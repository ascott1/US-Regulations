                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2009), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, Washington DC 20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

inscribed in the name of a designated national.

    Unless authorized by a license expressly referring to this section, 
the acquisition, transfer (including the transfer on the books of any 
issuer or agent thereof), disposition, transportation, importation, 
exportation, or withdrawal of, or the endorsement or guaranty of 
signatures on, or otherwise dealing in any security (or evidence 
thereof) registered or inscribed in the name of any designated national 
is prohibited irrespective of the fact that at any time (either prior 
to, on or subsequent to the ``effective date'') the registered or 
inscribed owner thereof may have, or appears to have, assigned, 
transferred or otherwise disposed of any such security.


<R05>
Sec. 500.203  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this chapter.

    (a) Any transfer after the ``effective date'' which is in violation 
of any provision of this chapter or of any regulation, ruling, 
instruction, license, or other direction or authorization thereunder and 
involves any property in which a designated national has or has had an 
interest since such ``effective date'' is null and void and shall not be 
the basis for the assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, 
remedy, power or privilege with respect to such property.
    (b) No transfer before the ``effective date'' shall be the basis for 
the assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege 
with respect to, or interest in, any property in which a designated 
national has or has had an interest since the ``effective date'' unless 
the person with whom such property is held or maintained had written 
notice of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such 
transfer prior to such ``effective date.''
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Secretary of the Treasury before, during or after a transfer shall 
validate such transfer or render it enforceable to the same extent as it 
would be valid or enforceable but for the provisions of section 5(b) of 
the Trading With the Enemy Act, as amended, and this chapter and any 
ruling, order, regulation, direction or instruction issued thereunder.
    (d) Transfers of property which otherwise would be null and void, or 
unenforceable, by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void, or unenforceable pursuant to such 
provisions, as to any person with whom such property was held or 
maintained (and as to such person, only) in cases in which such person 
is able to establish each of the following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this chapter by the person with whom such property was 
held or maintained;
    (2) The person with whom such property was held or maintained did 
not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts 
and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer 
required a license or authorization by or pursuant to the provisions of 
this chapter and was not so licensed or authorized or if a license or 
authorization did purport to cover the transfer, that such license or 
authorization had been obtained by misrepresentation or the withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) Promptly upon discovery that:

[[Page 11]]

    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this chapter 
or any regulation, ruling, instruction, license or other direction or 
authorization thereunder, or
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Secretary 
of the Treasury, or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation or the withholding of material 
facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained;

the person with whom such property was held or maintained filed with the 
Treasury Department, Washington, DC 20220, a report in triplicate 
setting forth in full the circumstances relating to such transfer. The 
filing of a report in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph 
shall not be deemed to be compliance or evidence of compliance with 
paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section.
    (e) Unless licensed or authorized by Sec. 500.504 or otherwise 
licensed or authorized pursuant to this chapter any attachment, 
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial 
process is null and void with respect to any property in which on or 
since the ``effective date'' there existed the interest of a designated 
foreign country or national thereof.
    (f) For the purpose of this section the term ``property'' includes 
gold, silver, bullion, currency, coin, credit, securities (as that term 
is defined in section 2(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) 
(48 Stat. 74; 15 U.S.C. 77(b)), bills of exchange, notes, drafts, 
acceptances, checks, letters of credit, book credits, debts, claims, 
contracts, negotiable documents of title, mortgages, liens, annuities, 
insurance policies, options and futures in commodities, and evidences of 
any of the foregoing. The term ``property'' shall not, except to the 
extent indicated, be deemed to include chattels or real property.

Sec. 500.205  Holding of certain types of blocked property in
interest-bearing accounts.

    (a) Except as provided by paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this 
section, or as authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury or his 
delegate by specific license, any person holding any property included 
in paragraph (h) of this section is prohibited from holding, 
withholding, using, transferring, engaging in any transactions 
involving, or exercising any right, power, or privilege with respect to 
any such property, unless it is held in an interest-bearing account in a 
domestic bank.
    (b) Any person presently holding property subject to the provisions 
of paragraph (a) of this section which, as of the effective date of this 
section, is not being held in accordance with the provisions of that 
paragraph, shall transfer such property to or hold such property or 
cause such property to be held in an interest-bearing account in any 
domestic bank within 30 days of the effective date of this section.
    (c) Any person holding any checks or drafts subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 500.201 is authorized and directed, wherever 
possible consistent with state law (except as otherwise specifically 
provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section), to negotiate or present 
for collection or payment such instruments and credit the proceeds to 
interest-bearing accounts. Any transaction by any person incident to the 
negotiation, processing, presentment, collection or payment of such 
instruments and deposit of the proceeds into an interest-bearing account 
is hereby authorized: Provided, That:
    (1) The transaction does not represent, directly or indirectly, a 
transfer of the interest of a designated national to any other country 
or person;
    (2) The proceeds are held in a blocked account indicating the 
designated national who is the payee or owner of the instrument; and,
    (3) In the case of a blocked check or draft which has been purchased 
by the maker/drawer from the drawee bank (e.g., cashier's check, money 
order, or traveler's check) or which is drawn against a presently 
existing account, such bank, on presentment of the instrument in 
accordance with the provisions of this section, shall either:
    (i) Pay the instrument (subject to paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of 
this section) or
    (ii) Credit a blocked account on its books with the amount payable 
on the instrument.

In either event, the blocked account shall be identified as resulting 
from the proceeds of a blocked check or draft, and the identification 
shall include a reference to the names of both the maker and payee of 
the instrument.
    (d) Property subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) or (b) of 
this section, held by a person claiming a set-off against such property, 
is exempt from the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this 
section to the extent of the set-off: Provided however, That interest 
shall be due from 30 days after the effective date of this section if it 
should ultimately be determined that the claim to a set-off is without 
merit.
    (e) Property subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, held in a customer's account by a registered broker/dealer 
in securities, may continue to be held for the customer by the broker/
dealer provided interest is credited to the account on any balance not 
invested in securities in accordance with Sec. 500.513. The interest 
paid on such accounts by a broker/dealer who does not elect to hold such 
property for a customer's account in a domestic bank shall not be less 
than the maximum rate payable on the

[[Page 13]]

shortest time deposit available in any domestic bank in the jurisdiction 
in which the broker/dealer holds the account.
    (f) Property subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, held by a state agency charged with the custody of 
abandoned or unclaimed property under Sec. 500.561 may continue to be 
held by the agency provided interest is credited to the blocked account 
in which the property is held by the agency, or the property is held by 
the agency in a blocked account in a domestic bank. The interest 
credited to such accounts by an agency which does not elect to hold such 
property in a domestic bank shall not be less than the maximum rate 
payable on the shortest time deposit available in any domestic bank in 
the state.
    (g) For purposes of this section, the term ``interest-bearing 
account'' means a blocked account earning interest at no less than the 
maximum rate payable on the shortest time deposit in the domestic bank 
where the account is held, provided however, that such an account may 
include six-month Treasury bills or insured certificates, with a 
maturity not exceeding six-months, appropriate to the amounts involved.
    (h) The following types of property are subject to paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section:
    (1) Any currency, bank deposit and bank accounts subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 500.201;
    (2) Any property subject to the provisions of Sec. 500.201 which 
consists, in whole or in part, of undisputed and either liquidated or 
matured debts, claims, obligations or other evidence of indebtedness, to 
the extent of any amount that is undisputed and liquidated or matured; 
and,
    (3) Any proceeds resulting from the payment of an obligation under 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (i) For purposes of this section, the term ``domestic bank'' 
includes any FSLIC-insured institution (as defined in 12 CFR 561.1).
    (j) For the purposes of this section the term ``person'' includes 
the United States Government or any agency or instrumentality thereof, 
except where the agency or instrumentality submits to the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control an opinion of its General Counsel that either:
    (1) It lacks statutory authority to comply with this section, or
    (2) The requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are 
inconsistent with the statutory program under which it operates.

Sec. 500.206  Exemption of information and informational materials.

    (a) The importation from any country and the exportation to any 
country of information or informational materials as defined in Sec. 
500.332, whether commercial or otherwise, regardless of format or medium 
of transmission, are exempt from the prohibitions and regulations of 
this part.
    (b) All transactions of common carriers incident to the importation 
or exportation of information or informational materials, including 
mail, between the United States and any foreign country designated under 
Sec. 500.201, are exempt from the prohibitions and regulations of this 
part.
    (c) This section does not authorize transactions related to 
information or informational materials not fully created and in 
existence at the date of the transaction, or to the substantive or 
artistic alteration or enhancement of information or informational 
materials, or to the provision of marketing and business consulting 
services by a person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. 
Such prohibited transactions include, without limitation, payment of 
advances for information or informational materials not yet created and 
completed, provision of services to market, produce or co-produce, 
create or assist in the creation of information or informational 
materials, and payment or royalties to a designated national with 
respect to income received for enhancements or alterations made by 
persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to information 
or informational materials imported from a designated national.
    (d) This section does not authorize transactions incident to the 
exportation of restricted technical data as defined in section 799 of 
the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR parts 768-799, or to the 
exportation of goods

[[Page 14]]

for use in the transmission of any data. The exportation of such goods 
to designated foreign countries is prohibited, as provided in Sec. 
500.201 of this part and Sec. 785.1 of the Export Administration 
Regulations.

    Example #1: A U.S. publisher ships 500 copies of a book to Vietnam 
directly from San Francisco aboard a chartered aircraft, and receives 
payment by means of a letter of credit issued by a Vietnamese bank and 
confirmed by an American bank. These are permissible transactions under 
this section.
    Example #2: A Vietnamese party exports a single master copy of a 
Vietnamese motion picture to a U.S. party and licenses the U.S. party to 
duplicate, distribute, show and exploit in the United States the 
Vietnamese film in any medium, including home video distribution, for 
five years, with the Vietnamese party receiving 40% of the net income. 
All transactions relating to the activities described in this example 
are authorized under this section or Sec. 500.550.
    Example #3: A U.S. recording company proposes to contract with a 
Vietnamese musician to create certain musical compositions, and to 
advance royalties of $10,000 to the musician. The music written in 
Vietnam is to be recorded in a studio that the recording company owns in 
the Bahamas. These are all prohibited transactions. The U.S. party is 
prohibited under Sec. 500.201 from contracting for the Vietnamese 
musician's services, from transferring $10,000 to Vietnam to pay for 
those services, and from providing the Vietnamese with production 
services through the use of its studio in the Bahamas. No informational 
materials are in being at the time of these proposed transactions. 
However, the U.S. recording company may contract to purchase and import 
preexisting recordings by the Vietnamese musician, or to copy the

``ADB''), and Vietnam wants the U.S. Consulting Firm's assistance in 
conducting a feasibility study for submission to the ADB. Since the 
project has not yet been formally proposed or approved for funding by 
the ADB, no involvement of the U.S. Consulting Firm is authorized 
pursuant to Sec. 500.576. However, had the ADB formally proposed the 
project in its monthly ADB Business Opportunities as a project being 
considered for funding, or had it funded the feasibility study, Sec. 
500.576 would authorize the U.S. Consulting Firm's transactions.
    Example # 2: Upon ADB approval of funding for the cement plant 
project, a U.S. company (the ``U.S. Company'') forms a joint venture 
with a Vietnamese company to bid on construction of the cement plants in 
Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. The joint venture's bid is successful, and 
it purchases construction equipment from the United States, financed by 
a U.S. bank and insured by a U.S. company. Several items are sourced 
from the United States during construction, including cement equipment, 
which is covered by a ten-year service and maintenance agreement. The 
joint venture agreement calls for the continued management and operation 
of the plants by the U.S. Company after completion, and for the 
insurance of the plants by a U.S. insurance company. Each of these 
transactions with respect to the Qualified Project is authorized by 
Sec. 500.576.
    Example # 3: The International Finance Corporation (``IFC'') offers 
equity investment in a Vietnamese company to finance environmental 
safeguards for drilling operations in offshore oil fields. Various U.S. 
investors, including venture capital companies, brokerage firms, and 
investment banks contribute capital and receive shares in the Vietnamese 
company. This equity investment in a Qualified Project is authorized by 
Sec. 500.576. The U.S. companies purchasing these shares as part of the 
IFC-sponsored development project may hold or resell them, including 
resale to other persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Shares acquired by 
entities not subject to U.S. jurisdiction may not then be purchased or 
repurchased by a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction.
    Example # 4: (a) An Indonesian company (the ``Contractor'') is a 
successful bidder on a Qualified Project, and hires a U.S. law firm to 
represent it in contract negotiations with Vietnam to build a fish 
processing and canning facility in Vietnam funded by the World Bank. The 
law firm may represent the Contractor throughout the course of the 
project pursuant to Sec. 500.576, once the project has been formally 
proposed or approved for funding by the World Bank.

    (b) Once the Qualified Project is underway, the Contractor purchases 
equipment manufactured in France by a French company. The long-term 
servicing of the equipment, however, will be provided by the French 
company's U.S. subsidiary. The service transactions are authorized 
pursuant to Sec. 500.576.
    (c) After the processing facility is completed, Vietnam hires a U.S. 
marketing firm to develop marketing strategies for the product 
worldwide. It further asks the marketing firm to execute the strategies 
it devises and to represent the product in South-East Asia, including 
the domestic market in Vietnam. The marketing firm in turn would hire 
the brokerage services of a U.S. citizen domiciled in Thailand for the 
sale of the product to that country. These transactions are outside the 
scope of Sec. 500.576, and violate Sec. 500.201, because they are not 
directly incident to the Qualified Project funded by the World Bank.

    (c) The purchase outside the United States for importation into the

Sec. 500.549  Proof of origin.

    Specific licenses for importation of goods the origin of which is 
North Korea, North Viet-Nam, Cambodia, or South Viet-Nam are generally 
not issued unless the applicant submits satisfactory documentary proof 
of the location of the goods outside North Korea, North Viet-Nam, 
Cambodia, or South Viet-Nam prior to the applicable

[[Page 34]]

effective date and of the absence of any interest of North Korea, North 
Viet-Nam, Cambodia, or South Viet-Nam in the goods at all times on or 
since that date. Since the type of documents which would constitute 
satisfactory proof varies depending upon the facts of the particular 
case, it is not possible to state in advance the type of documents 
required. However, it has been found that affidavits, statements, 
invoices, and other documents prepared by manufacturers, processors, 
sellers or shippers cannot be relied on and are therefore not by 
themselves accepted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control as 
satisfactory proof of origin. Independent corroborating documentary 
evidence, such as insurance documents, bills of lading, etc., may be 
accepted as satisfactory proof.

connection with participation in development projects in Vietnam 
formally proposed or approved for execution, funding or sponsorship by 
the international institutions listed in appendix A to this part 
(``Qualified Projects'') are authorized. For purposes of this section, 
Qualified Projects include investment projects, structural adjustment 
lending, sector adjustment lending, International Monetary Fund balance-
of-payments support, and general development assistance including 
grants, technical assistance, and loans.
    (b) Persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction may provide both goods and 
services to any party contracting to participate in a Qualified Project 
pursuant to the authorization contained in this section.
    (1) Services may include financial, legal, consulting, insurance, 
shipping and other services.
    (2) Persons subject to U.S jurisdiction may participate in Qualified 
Projects as suppliers, contractors, or subcontractors, and through joint 
ventures with third-country nationals and Vietnamese nationals.
    (3) Persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction may finance, or guarantee 
the performance of, activities of U.S. participants in a Qualified 
Project; co-financing of or lending to the Qualified Project itself by a 
person subject to U.S. jurisdiction may be authorized by specific 
license pursuant to Sec. 500.801.

Illustrative examples of transactions covered by this section are set 
forth in Sec. 500.413.
    (c) Except as otherwise authorized, persons subject to U.S. 
jurisdiction may not participate in development projects in Vietnam that 
are bilaterally funded and administered, or in projects or feasibility 
studies prior to formal proposal or approval by a qualified 
international institution for its involvement in the project or study. 
If a qualified international institution formally proposes but 
thereafter rejects, terminates, or abandons a project, the project shall 
no longer constitute a Qualified Project for purposes of this section. 
Except as otherwise specifically authorized pursuant to this part, 
persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction may not enter into any new 
commitments with respect to the project after the date of such 
rejection, termination, or abandonment. In addition, this section does 
not authorize:
    (1) The importation of Vietnamese-origin goods into the United 
States, except as required to honor service or warranty contracts 
associated with Qualified Projects;
    (2) Offshore transactions of persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction 
involving the sale of Vietnamese-origin goods between Vietnam and third 
countries, or among third countries;
    (3) Flights into or out of Vietnam by aircraft owned or controlled 
by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction, except when such persons 
transport, on aircraft they own, only passengers or cargo associated 
with a Qualified Project in which such persons are participating 
pursuant to this section;
    (4) The use in Vietnam of credit cards issued by a U.S. banking 
institution; or
    (5) A debit to a blocked account.

    Example: A Vietnamese highway project feasibility study financed by 
a third-country development agency is not a Qualified Project for 
purposes of this section. However, the feasibility study would be a 
Qualified Project, notwithstanding the bilateral funding, if the 
International Development Association had formally proposed the highway 
project as one under consideration for

[[Page 42]]

funding in its Monthly Operational Summary of World Bank and IDA 
Proposed Projects.

    (d) Within 10 business days after entering into an agreement for 
goods, services, financing, investment, or other participation in or 
related to a Qualified Project, the person(s) subject to U.S. 
jurisdiction entering into the agreement must register with the Office 
of Foreign Assets Control, Compliance Division, U.S. Department of the 
Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW.--Annex, Washington, DC 20220. 
The registration shall reference the fact that the agreement was entered 
into pursuant to 31 CFR 500.576(a), and shall provide:
    (1) The name, address, telephone and facsimile numbers, and 
nationality of the person(s) subject to U.S. jurisdiction;
    (2) If the reporting party is not an individual, the name, address, 
telephone and facsimile numbers of the individual to contact for further 
information,
    (3) The name of the international institution listed in appendix A 
formally proposing, approving, executing, funding, or sponsoring the 
project;
    (4) The name and a brief description of the project in Vietnam (with 
any contract, project, request for bid, or other identifying number);
    (5) A brief description of the activity covered by the agreement, 
and the contract value; and
    (6) If the reporting party is a subcontractor, the prime 
contractor's name, address, and nationality, and those of all 
intermediate subcontractors.

Registration is not required of agencies of the Federal Government 
participating in Qualified Projects.
    (e) Upon registration meeting the requirements of paragraph (d) of 
this section, the Office of Foreign Assets Control will assign a 
registration number to the contract involved. This number should be 
referenced in all funds transfers and other banking transactions that 
take place through banks subject to U.S. jurisdiction, and in all U.S. 
export documents, in connection with the Qualified Project in Vietnam in 
order to avoid the blocking of such funds and to facilitate export 
transactions.
    (f) Annual reports must be filed with the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control on the anniversary of the issuance of a contract registration 
number, briefly describing the status of the project and any material 
changes in the information originally provided.

    Note to Sec. 500.576: Exports or reexports to Vietnam of goods and 
technical data, or of the direct products of technical data (regardless 
of U.S. content), in connection with activities licensed by FAC may 
require authorization from the U.S. Department of Commerce pursuant to

Sec. 500.803  Customs procedures; merchandise specified in Sec. 500.204.

    (a) With respect to merchandise specified in Sec. 500.204, whether

    (b) Whenever a specific license is presented to a director of

fact authorizes the entry, withdrawal or other transaction with regard 
to the merchandise, the director, or other authorized customs employee, 
shall verify the notation by signing or initialing it after first 
assuring himself that it accurately describes the merchandise it 
purports to represent. The license shall thereafter be returned to the 
person presenting it and the additional copy of the entry, withdrawal or 
other appropriate document shall be forwarded by the director to the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury Department, Washington, DC

appropriate document affected by this section and shall assert that no 
specific Foreign Assets Control license is required in connection 
therewith, the director of customs shall withhold action thereon and 
shall advise such person to communicate directly with the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control to request that instructions be issued to the 
director to authorize him to take action with regard thereto.

requirements

[[Page 49]]

and license application and other procedures governing transactions 
regulated pursuant to other parts codified in this chapter, as well as 
to economic sanctions programs for which implementation and 
administration are delegated to the Office of Foreign Assets Control. 
Substantive prohibitions and policies particular to each economic 
sanctions program are not contained in this part but are set forth in 
the particular part of this chapter dedicated to that program, or, in 
the case of economic sanctions programs not yet implemented in 
regulations, in the applicable executive order or other authority. 
License application procedures and reporting requirements set forth in 
this part govern transactions undertaken pursuant to general or specific 
licenses. The criteria for general and specific licenses pertaining to a 
particular economic sanctions program are set forth in subpart E of the 
individual parts in this chapter. Statements of licensing policy 
contained in subpart E of the individual parts in this chapter, however, 
may contain additional information collection provisions that require 
production of specified documentation unique to a given general license 
or statement of licensing policy.

Sec. 501.603  Reports on blocked property.

    (a) Who must report--(1) Holders of blocked property. Any person, 
including a financial institution, holding property blocked pursuant to 
this chapter must report. The requirement includes financial 
institutions that receive and block payments or transfers. This 
requirement is mandatory and applies to all U.S. persons (or persons 
subject to U.S. jurisdiction in the case of parts 500 and 515 of this 
chapter) who have in their possession or control any property or 
interests in property blocked pursuant to this chapter.
    (2) Primary responsibility to report. A report may be filed on 
behalf of a holder of blocked property by an attorney, agent, or other 
person. Primary responsibility for reporting blocked property, however, 
rests with the actual holder of the property, or the person exercising 
control over property located outside the United States, with the 
following exceptions: primary responsibility for reporting any trust 
assets rest with the trustee; and primary responsibility for reporting 
real property rests with any U.S. co-owner, legal representative, agent, 
or property manager in the United States. No person is excused from 
filing a report by reason of the fact that another person has submitted 
a report with regard to the same property, except upon actual knowledge 
of the report filed by such other person. Reports filed are regarded as 
privileged and confidential.
    (3) Financial institutions. For purposes of this section, the term 
``financial institution'' shall include a banking institution, domestic 
bank, United States depository institution, financial institution, or 
U.S. financial institution, as those terms are defined in the applicable 
part of this chapter.
    (b) What must be reported--(1) Initial reports--(i) When reports are 
due. Reports are required to be filed within 10 business days from the 
date that property becomes blocked. This reporting requirement includes 
payments or transfers that are received and blocked by financial 
institutions.
    (ii) Contents of reports. Initial reports on blocked property shall 
describe the owner or account party, the property, its location, any 
existing or new account number or similar reference necessary to 
identify the property, actual or estimated value and the date it was 
blocked, and shall include the name and address of the holder, along 
with the name and telephone number of a contact person from whom 
compliance information can be obtained. If the report is filed by a 
financial institution and involves the receipt of a payment or transfer 
of funds which are blocked by the financial institution, the report 
shall also include a photocopy of the payment or transfer instructions 
received and shall confirm that the payment has been deposited into a 
new or existing blocked account which is labeled as such and is 
established in the name of, or contains a means of clearly identifying 
the interest of, the individual or entity subject to blocking pursuant 
to the requirements of this chapter.
    (2) Annual reports--(i) When reports are due. A comprehensive report 
on all blocked property held as of June 30 of the current year shall be 
filed annually by September 30. The first annual report is due September 
30, 1997.
    (ii) Contents of reports. Annual reports shall be filed using Form 
TDF 90-22.50, Annual Report of Blocked Property. Copies of Form TDF 90-
22.50 may be obtained directly from the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control, by calling the fax-on-demand service maintained by the Office 
of Foreign Assets Control at 202/622-0077, or by downloading the form

library (``FAC--MISC'') located on the Government Printing Office's 
Federal Bulletin Board Online via GPO Access (Internet site: http://

fac--misc.htm). Photocopies of the report form may be used. Requests to 
submit the information required on Form TDF 90-22.50 in an alternative 
format developed by the reporter are invited and will be considered by 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control on a case-by-case basis. A copy of 
reports filed using form TDF 90-22.50 or in alternative formats must be 
retained for the reporter's records.
    (c) Reports on retained funds pursuant to Sec. 596.504(b) of this 
chapter. The reporting requirements set forth in this section are 
applicable to any financial institution retaining funds pursuant to 
Sec. 596.504(b) of this chapter, except that the account name shall 
reflect the name of the person whose interest required retention of the 
funds.
    (d) Where to report. All reports must be filed with the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control, Compliance Programs Division, U.S. Treasury 
Department, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW.--Annex, Washington, DC 20220.

section, the term ``financial institution'' shall include a banking 
institution, depository institution or United States depository 
institution, domestic bank, financial institution or U.S. financial

Government of Iran.
    (c) When reports are due. Reports are required to be filed within 10 
business days by any financial institution rejecting instructions to 
execute payments or transfers involving underlying transactions 
prohibited by the provisions of this chapter.
    (d) What must be reported. The report shall include the name and 
address of the transferee financial institution, the date of the 
transfer, the amount of the payment transfer, and a photocopy of the 
payment or transfer instructions received, and shall state the basis for 
the rejection of the transfer instructions. The report shall also 
provide the name and telephone number of a contact person at the 
transferee financial institution from whom compliance information may be 
obtained.
    (e) Where to report. Reports must be filed with the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control, Compliance Programs Division, U.S. Treasury 
Department, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW.--Annex, Washington, DC 20220.

<R05>
Sec. 501.703  Overview of civil penalty process and construction of rules.

    (a) The administrative process for enforcing TWEA sanctions programs 
proceeds as follows:
    (1) The Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control will notify 
a suspected violator (hereinafter ``respondent'') of an alleged 
violation by issuing a ``Prepenalty Notice.'' The Prepenalty Notice 
shall describe the alleged violation(s) and include a proposed civil 
penalty amount.
    (2) The respondent will have 60 days from the date the Prepenalty 
Notice is served to make a written presentation either defending against 
the alleged violation or admitting the violation. A respondent who 
admits a violation may offer information as to why a monetary penalty 
should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the monetary penalty should be 
in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (3) Absent a settlement agreement or a finding that no violation 
occurred, the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control will 
issue a ``Penalty Notice.'' The respondent will have 30 days from the 
date of service to either pay the penalty or request a hearing.
    (4) If the respondent requests a hearing, the Director of the Office 
of Foreign Assets Control will have two options:
    (i) The Director may issue an ``Order Instituting Proceedings'' and 
refer the matter to an Administrative Law Judge for a hearing and 
decision; or
    (ii) The Director may determine to discontinue the penalty action 
based on information presented by the respondent.
    (5) Absent review by a Secretary's designee, the decision of the 
Administrative Law Judge will become the final decision of the 
Department without further proceedings.
    (6) If review is taken by a Secretary's designee, the Secretary's 
designee reaches the final decision of the Department.
    (7) A respondent may seek judicial review of the final decision of 
the Department.
    (b) Construction of rules. The rules contained in this subpart shall 
be construed and administered to promote the just, speedy, and 
inexpensive determination of every action. To the extent there is a 
conflict between the rules contained in this subpart and a procedural 
requirement contained in any statute, the requirement in the statute 
shall control.


<R05>
Sec. 501.704  Appearance and practice.

    No person shall be represented before the Director in any civil 
penalty matter, or an Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's 
designee in a civil penalty hearing, under this subpart except as 
provided in this section.
    (a) Representing oneself. In any proceeding, an individual may 
appear on his or her own behalf.
    (b) Representative. Upon written notice to the Director,
    (1) A respondent may be represented by a personal representative. If 
a respondent wishes to be represented by counsel, such counsel must be 
an attorney at law admitted to practice before

[[Page 55]]

the Supreme Court of the United States, the highest court of any State, 
commonwealth, possession, or territory of the United States, or the 
District of Columbia;
    (2) A duly authorized member of a partnership may represent the 
partnership; and
    (3) A bona fide officer, director, or employee of a corporation, 
trust or association may represent the corporation, trust or 
association.
    (c) Director representation. The Director shall be represented by 
members of the Office of Chief Counsel or any other counsel specifically 
assigned by the General Counsel.
    (d) Conflicts of interest--(1) Conflict of interest in 
representation. No individual shall appear as representative for a 
respondent in a proceeding conducted pursuant to this subpart if it 
reasonably appears that such representation may be materially limited by 
that representative's responsibilities to a third person, or by that 
representative's own interests.
    (2) Corrective measures. An Administrative Law Judge may take 
corrective measures at any stage of a proceeding to cure a conflict of 
interest in representation, including the issuance of an order limiting 
the scope of representation or disqualifying an individual from 
appearing in a representative capacity for the duration of the 
proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 501.705  Service and filing.

    (a) Service of Prepenalty Notice, Penalty Notice, Acknowledgment of 
Hearing Request and Order Instituting Proceedings. The Director shall 
cause any Prepenalty Notice, Penalty Notice, Acknowledgment of Hearing 
Request, Order Instituting Proceedings, and other related orders and 
decisions, or any amendments or supplements thereto, to be served upon 
the respondent.

respondent at the respondent's last known address, or to a 
representative authorized to receive service, including qualified 
representatives noticed to the Director pursuant to Sec. 501.704. 
Absent satisfactory evidence in the administrative record to the 
contrary, the Director may presume that the date of mailing is the date 
stamped on the first page of the notice or order. The respondent may 
rebut the presumption that a notice or order was mailed on the stamped 
mailing date only by presenting evidence of the postmark date on the 
envelope in which the notice or order was mailed;
    (ii) Upon personal service on the respondent; or leaving a copy at 
the respondent's place of business with a clerk or other person in 
charge thereof; or leaving a copy at the respondent's dwelling house or

residing therein; or with any other representative authorized by 
appointment or by law to accept or receive service for the respondent,

501.704; and evidenced by a certificate of service signed and dated by 
the individual making such service, stating the method of service and 
the identity of the individual with whom the notice or order was left; 
or
    (iii) Upon proof of service on a respondent who is not resident in 
the United States by any method of service permitted by the law of the 
jurisdiction in which the respondent resides or is located, provided the 
requirements of such foreign law satisfy due process requirements under 
United States law with respect to notice of administrative proceedings, 
and where applicable laws or intergovernmental agreements or 
understandings make the methods of service set forth in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section inappropriate or ineffective for 
service upon the nonresident respondent.
    (2) Service on corporations and other entities. Service is complete 
upon delivering a copy of the notice or order to a partner, bona fide 
officer, director, managing or general agent, or any other agent

harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of 
adjudication.
    (ii) If a filing is not signed, the Administrative Law Judge (or the 
Secretary's designee) shall strike the filing, unless it is signed 
promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the person 
making the filing.
    (d) Service of written orders or decisions issued by the 
Administrative Law Judge or Secretary's designee. Written orders or 
decisions issued by the Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's 
designee shall be served promptly on each respondent and the Director 
pursuant to any method of service authorized under paragraph (a) of this 
section. Service of such orders or decisions shall be made by the 
Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's designee, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 501.706  Prepenalty Notice; issuance by Director.

    (a) When required. If the Director has reason to believe there has 
occurred a violation of any provision of parts 500 or 515 of this 
chapter or a violation of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction or instruction issued by or pursuant to the 
direction or authorization of the Secretary pursuant to parts 500 or 515 
of this chapter or otherwise under the Trading With the Enemy Act, and 
the Director determines that further civil proceedings are warranted, 
the Director shall issue a Prepenalty Notice. The Prepenalty Notice may 
be issued whether or not another agency has taken any action with 
respect to the matter.
    (b) Contents of notice--(1) Facts of violation. The Prepenalty 
Notice shall describe the alleged violation, specify the laws and 
regulations allegedly violated, and state the amount of the proposed 
monetary penalty.
    (2) Right to respond. The Prepenalty Notice shall inform the 
respondent of respondent's right to make a written presentation within 
the time prescribed in Sec. 501.707 as to why the respondent believes 
there should be no finding of a violation or why, if the respondent 
admits the violation, a monetary penalty should not be imposed or why, 
if imposed, the monetary penalty should be in a lesser amount than 
proposed. The Prepenalty Notice shall also inform the respondent that:
    (i) The act of submitting a written response by the respondent is a 
factor that may result in a lower penalty absent any aggravating 
factors; and
    (ii) If the respondent fails to respond to the Prepenalty Notice 
within the applicable 60-day period set forth in Sec. 501.707, the 
Director may proceed with the issuance of a Penalty Notice.
    (3) Right to request a hearing. The Prepenalty Notice shall inform 
the respondent of respondent's right, if a subsequent Penalty Notice is 
issued, to request an administrative hearing. The Director will not 
consider any request

[[Page 58]]

for an administrative hearing until a Penalty Notice has been issued.


<R05>
Sec. 501.707  Response to Prepenalty Notice.

    (a) Deadline for response.
    (1) The respondent shall have 60 days after the date of service of 
the Prepenalty Notice pursuant to Sec. 501.705(a) to respond thereto. 
The response, signed and dated, shall be served as provided in Sec. 
501.705(b).
    (2) In response to a written request by the respondent, the Director 
may, at his or her discretion for the purpose of conducting settlement 
negotiations or for other valid reasons, grant additional time for a 
respondent to submit a response to the Prepenalty Notice.
    (3) The failure to submit a response within the time period set 
forth in this paragraph (a), including any additional time granted by 
the Director, shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to respond to 
the Prepenalty Notice.
    (b) Form and contents of response.
    (1) In general. The response need not be in any particular form, but 
must be typewritten and contain the heading ``Response to Prepenalty 
Notice'' and the Office of Foreign Assets Control identification number 
shown near the top of the Prepenalty Notice. It should be responsive to 
the allegations contained therein and set forth the nature of the 
respondent's admission of the violation, or defenses and claims for 
mitigation, if any.
    (i) The response must admit or deny specifically each separate 
allegation of violation made in the Prepenalty Notice. If the respondent 
is without knowledge as to an allegation, the response shall so state, 
and such statement shall constitute a denial. Any allegation not 
specifically addressed in the response shall be deemed admitted.
    (ii) The response must set forth any additional or new matter or 
arguments the respondent seeks, or shall seek, to use in support of all 
defenses or claims for mitigation. Any defense the respondent wishes to 
assert must be included in the response.
    (iii) The response must accurately state (for each respondent, if 
applicable) the respondent's full name and address for future service, 
together with a current telephone and, if applicable, facsimile machine 
number. If respondent is represented, the representative's full name and 
address, together with telephone and facsimile numbers, may be provided 
instead of service information for the respondent. The respondent or 
respondent's representative of record is responsible for providing 
timely written notice to the Director of any subsequent changes in the 
information provided.
    (iv) Financial disclosure statement requirement. Any respondent who 
asserts financial hardship or an inability to pay a penalty shall 
include with the response a financial disclosure statement setting forth 
in detail the basis for asserting the financial hardship or inability to 
pay a penalty, subject to 18 U.S.C. 1001.
    (2) Settlement. In addition, or as an alternative, to a written 
response to a Prepenalty Notice, the respondent or respondent's 
representative may seek settlement of the alleged violation(s). See 
Sec. 501.710. In the event of settlement prior to the issuance of a 
Penalty Notice, the claim proposed in the Prepenalty Notice will be 
withdrawn and the respondent will not be required to make a written 
response to the Prepenalty Notice. In the event no settlement is 
reached, a written response to the Prepenalty Notice is required 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 501.708  Director's finding of no penalty warranted.

    If after considering any written response to the Prepenalty Notice 
submitted pursuant to Sec. 501.707 and any other relevant facts, the 
Director determines that there was no violation or that the violation 
does not warrant the imposition of a civil monetary penalty, the 
Director promptly shall notify the respondent in writing of that 
determination and that no civil monetary penalty pursuant to this 
subpart will be imposed.


<R05>
Sec. 501.709  Penalty notice.

    (a) If, after considering any written response to the Prepenalty 
Notice, and any other relevant facts, the Director determines that there 
was a violation by the respondent and that a monetary penalty is 
warranted, the Director

[[Page 59]]

promptly shall issue a Penalty Notice informing the respondent that, 
absent a timely request for an administrative hearing, the Director will 
impose the civil monetary penalty described in the Penalty Notice. The 
Penalty Notice shall inform the respondent:
    (1) Of the respondent's right to submit a written request for an 
administrative hearing not later than 30 days after the date of service 
of the Penalty Notice;
    (2) That in the absence of a timely request for a hearing, the 
issuance of the Penalty Notice constitutes final agency action;
    (3) That, absent a timely request for a hearing, payment (or 
arrangement with the Financial Management Service of the Department for 
installment payment) of the assessed penalty must be made not later than 
30 days after the date of service of the Penalty Notice; and
    (4) That absent a timely request for a hearing, the respondent must 
furnish respondent's taxpayer identification number pursuant to 31 
U.S.C. 7701 and that the Director intends to use such information for 
the purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent penalty 
amount in the event of a failure to pay the penalty imposed.


<R05>
Sec. 501.710  Settlement.

    (a) Availability. Either the Director or any respondent may, at any 
time during the administrative civil penalty process described in this 
subpart, propose an offer of settlement. The amount accepted in 
settlement may be less than the civil penalty that might be imposed in 
the event of a formal determination of violation. Upon mutual agreement 
by the Director and a respondent on the terms of a settlement, the 
Director shall issue an Order of Settlement.
    (b) Procedure--(1) Prior to issuance of Penalty Notice. Any offer of 
settlement made by a respondent prior to the issuance of a Penalty 
Notice shall be submitted, in writing, to the Chief of Civil Penalties, 
Office of Foreign Assets Control, U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1500 
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20220.
    (2) After issuance of Penalty Notice. Any offer of settlement made 
by a respondent after issuance of a Penalty Notice shall state that it 
is made pursuant to this section; shall recite or incorporate as a part 
of the offer the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (b)(6) of this 
section; shall be signed by the respondent making the offer, and not 
only by his or her representative; and shall be submitted to the Chief 
Counsel.
    (3) Extensions of time. The submission of any settlement offer does 
not provide a basis for adjourning or otherwise delaying all or any 
portion of the administrative civil penalty process.
    (i) Prior to issuance of Order Instituting Proceedings. Any 
respondent (or potential respondent in the case of a pending Prepenalty 
Notice) may request, in writing, that the Director withhold issuance of 
any such notice, or grant an extension of time to respond to any such 
Notice, for a period not to exceed 60 days for the exclusive purpose of 
effecting settlement. The Director may grant any such request, in 
writing, under terms and conditions within his or her discretion.
    (ii) After issuance of Order Instituting Proceedings. Upon mutual 
agreement of the Director and a respondent, the Administrative Law Judge 
may grant an extension of time, for a period not to exceed 60 days, for 
the exclusive purpose of effecting settlement.
    (4) Views of Administrative Law Judge. Where an Administrative Law 
Judge is assigned to a proceeding, the Director or the respondent may 
request that the Administrative Law Judge express his or her views 
regarding the appropriateness of the offer of settlement. A request for 
the Administrative Law Judge to express his or her views on an offer of 
settlement or otherwise to participate in a settlement conference 
constitutes a waiver by the party making the request of any right to 
claim bias or prejudgment by the Administrative Law Judge based on the 
views expressed.
    (5) Waivers. (i) By submitting an offer of settlement, a respondent 
making the offer waives, subject to acceptance of the offer:
    (A) All hearings pursuant to section 16 of the Trading with the 
Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 16);

[[Page 60]]

    (B) The filing of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (C) Proceedings before, and a decision by, an Administrative Law 
Judge;
    (D) All post-hearing procedures; and
    (E) Judicial review by any court.
    (ii) By submitting an offer of settlement the respondent further 
waives:
    (A) Such provisions of this subpart or other requirements of law as 
may be construed to prevent any member of the Director's staff, or 
members of the Office of Chief Counsel or other counsel assigned by the 
General Counsel, from participating in or advising the Director as to 
any order, opinion, finding of fact, or conclusion of law to be entered 
pursuant to the offer; and
    (B) Any right to claim bias or prejudgment by the Director based on 
the consideration of or discussions concerning settlement of all or any 
part of the proceeding.
    (6) If the Director rejects the offer of settlement, the respondent 
shall be so notified in writing and the offer of settlement shall be 
deemed withdrawn. The rejected offer shall not constitute a part of the 
record in any proceeding against the respondent making the offer, 
provided, however, that rejection of an offer of settlement does not 
affect the continued validity of waivers pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of 
this section with respect to any discussions concerning the rejected 
offer of settlement.
    (7) No settlement offer or proposal, or any subsequent negotiation 
or resolution, is admissible as evidence in any administrative 
proceeding initiated by the Director.


<R05>
Sec. 501.711  Hearing request.

    (a) Deadline for request. A request for an agency hearing shall be 
served on the Director not later than 30 days after the date of service 
of the Penalty Notice. See Sec. 501.705(b). A respondent may not 
reserve the right to request a hearing after expiration of the 30 
calendar day period. A request for a hearing that is not made as 
required by this paragraph shall constitute a waiver of the respondent's 
right to a hearing.
    (b) Form and contents of request. The request need not be in any 
particular form, but must be typewritten and contain the heading 
``Request for Agency Hearing''. The request must include the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control identification number shown near the top of the 
Penalty Notice. It should be responsive to the determination contained 
in the Penalty Notice and set forth the nature of the respondent's 
defenses or claims for mitigation, if any.
    (1) The request must admit or deny specifically each separate 
determination of violation made in the Penalty Notice. If the respondent 
is without knowledge as to a determination, the request shall so state, 
and such statement shall constitute a denial. Any determination not 
specifically addressed in the response shall be deemed admitted.
    (2) The request must set forth any additional or new matter or 
arguments the respondent seeks, or shall seek, to use in support of all 
defenses or claims for mitigation. Any defense the respondent wishes to 
assert must be included in the request.
    (3) The request must accurately state, for each respondent (if 
applicable), the respondent's full name and address for future service, 
together with current telephone and, if applicable, a facsimile machine 
number. If respondent is represented, the representative's full name and 
address, together with telephone and facsimile numbers, may be provided 
in lieu of service information for the respondent. The respondent or 
respondent's representative is responsible for providing timely written 
notice to the Director of any subsequent changes in the information 
provided.
    (c) Signature requirement. The respondent or, if represented, the 
respondent's representative, must sign the hearing request.


<R05>
Sec. 501.712  Acknowledgment of hearing request.

    No later than 60 days after service of any hearing request, the 
Director shall acknowledge receipt and inform a respondent, in writing, 
whether an Order Instituting Proceedings shall be issued.


<R05>
Sec. 501.713  Order Instituting Proceedings.

    If a respondent makes a timely request for a hearing, the Director 
shall

[[Page 61]]

determine, at his or her option, whether to dismiss the violation(s) set 
forth in the Penalty Notice or to issue an Order Instituting Proceedings 
to initiate the hearing process. The Order shall be served on the 
respondent(s) as provided in Sec. 501.705(c)(1). The Director may, in 
his or her discretion, withdraw an Order Instituting Proceedings at any 
time prior to the issuance of a decision by the Administrative Law 
Judge.
    (a) Content of Order. The Order Instituting Proceedings shall:
    (1) Be prepared by the Office of the Chief Counsel or other counsel 
assigned by the General Counsel and based on information provided by the 
Director;
    (2) State the legal authority under which the hearing is to be held;
    (3) Contain a short and plain statement of the alleged violation(s) 
to be considered and determined (including the matters of fact and law 
asserted) in such detail as will permit a specific response thereto;
    (4) State the amount of the penalty sought in the proceeding; and
    (5) Be signed by the Director.
    (b) Combining penalty actions. The Director may combine claims 
contained in two or more Penalty Notices involving the same respondent, 
and for which hearings have been requested, into a single Order 
Instituting Proceedings.
    (c) Amendment to Order Instituting Proceedings. Upon motion by the 
Director, the Administrative Law Judge may, at any time prior to 
issuance of a decision, permit the Director to amend an Order 
Instituting Proceedings to include new matters of fact or law that are 
within the scope of the original Order Instituting Proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 501.714  Answer to Order Instituting Proceedings.

    (a) When required. Not later than 45 days after service of the Order 
Instituting Proceedings, the respondent shall file, with the 
Administrative Law Judge and the Office of Chief Counsel, an answer to 
each of the allegations contained therein. If the Order Instituting 
Proceedings is amended, the Administrative Law Judge may require that an 
amended answer be filed and, if such an answer is required, shall 
specify a date for the filing thereof.
    (b) Contents; effect of failure to deny. Unless otherwise directed 
by the Administrative Law Judge, an answer shall specifically admit, 
deny, or state that the respondent does not have, and is unable to 
obtain, sufficient information to admit or deny each allegation in the 
Order Instituting Proceedings. When a respondent intends to deny only a 
part of an allegation, the respondent shall specify so much of it as is 
true and shall deny only the remainder. A statement of lack of 
information shall have the effect of a denial. A defense of res 
judicata, statute of limitations or any other matter constituting an 
affirmative defense shall be asserted in the answer. Any allegation not 
specifically addressed in the answer shall be deemed admitted.
    (c) Motion for more definite statement. A respondent may file with 
an answer a motion for a more definite statement of specified matters of 
fact or law to be considered or determined. Such motion shall state the 
respects in which, and the reasons why, each such matter of fact or law 
should be required to be made more definite. If the motion is granted, 
the order granting such motion shall set the periods for filing such a 
statement and any answer thereto.
    (d) Amendments. A respondent may amend its answer at any time by 
written consent of the Director or with permission of the Administrative 
Law Judge. Permission shall be freely granted when justice so requires.
    (e) Failure to file answer: default. If a respondent fails to file 
an answer required by this subpart within the time prescribed, such 
respondent may be deemed in default pursuant to Sec. 501.716(a). A 
party may make a motion to set aside a default pursuant to Sec. 
501.726(e).


<R05>
Sec. 501.715  Notice of Hearing.

    (a) If the Director issues an Order Instituting Proceedings, the 
respondent shall receive not less than 45 days notice of the time and 
place of the hearing.
    (b) Time and place of hearing. All hearings shall be held in the 
Washington, DC metropolitan area unless, based on extraordinary reasons, 
otherwise mutually agreed by the respondent and the Director. The time 
for any

[[Page 62]]

hearing shall be fixed with due regard for the public interest and the 
convenience and necessity of the parties or their representatives. 
Requests to change the time of a hearing may be submitted to the 
Administrative Law Judge, who may modify the hearing date(s) and/or 
time(s) and place. All requests for a change in the date and time and/or 
place of a hearing must be received by the Administrative Law Judge and 
served upon the parties no later than 15 days before the scheduled 
hearing date.
    (c) Failure to appear at hearings: default. Any respondent named in 
an order instituting proceedings as a person against whom findings may 
be made or penalties imposed who fails to appear (in person or through a 
representative) at a hearing of which he or she has been duly notified 
may be deemed to be in default pursuant to Sec. 501.716(a). Without 
further proceedings or notice to the respondent, the Administrative Law 
Judge may enter a finding that the right to a hearing was waived, and 
the Penalty Notice shall constitute final agency action as provided in 
Sec. 501.709(a)(2). A respondent may make a motion to set aside a 
default pursuant to Sec. 501.726(e).


<R05>
Sec. 501.716  Default.

    (a) A party to a proceeding may be deemed to be in default and the 
Administrative Law Judge (or the Secretary's designee during review 
proceedings) may determine the proceeding against that party upon 
consideration of the record if that party fails:
    (1) To appear, in person or through a representative, at any hearing 
or conference of which the party has been notified;
    (2) To answer, to respond to a dispositive motion within the time 
provided, or otherwise to prosecute or defend the proceeding; or
    (3) To cure a deficient filing within the time specified by the 
Administrative Law Judge (or the Secretary's designee) pursuant to Sec. 
501.729(b).
    (b) In deciding whether to determine the proceedings against a party 
deemed to be in default, the Administrative Law Judge shall consider the 
record of the proceedings (including the Order Instituting Proceedings) 
and shall construe contested matters of fact and law against the party 
deemed to be in default.
    (c) For information and procedures pertaining to a motion to set 
aside a default, see Sec. 501.726(e).


<R05>
Sec. 501.717  Consolidation of proceedings.

    By order of the Administrative Law Judge, proceedings involving 
common questions of law and fact may be consolidated for hearing of any 
or all the matters at issue in such proceedings. The Administrative Law 
Judge may make such orders concerning the conduct of such proceedings as 
he or she deems appropriate to avoid unnecessary cost or delay. 
Consolidation shall not prejudice any rights under this subpart and 
shall not affect the right of any party to raise issues that could have 
been raised if consolidation had not occurred.


<R05>
Sec. 501.718  Conduct and order of hearings.

    All hearings shall be conducted in a fair, impartial, expeditious 
and orderly manner. Each party has the right to present its case or 
defense by oral and documentary evidence and to conduct such cross 
examination as may be required for full disclosure of the relevant 
facts. The Director shall present his or her case-in-chief first. The 
Director shall be the first party to present an opening statement and a 
closing statement and may make a rebuttal statement after the 
respondent's closing statement.


<R05>
Sec. 501.719  Ex parte communications.

    (a) Prohibition. (1) From the time the Director issues an Order 
Instituting Proceedings until the date of final decision, no party, 
interested person, or representative thereof shall knowingly make or 
cause to be made an ex parte communication.
    (2) Except to the extent required for the disposition of ex parte 
communication matters as authorized by law, the Secretary's designee and 
the Administrative Law Judge presiding over any proceeding may not:
    (i) Consult a person or party on an issue, unless on notice and 
opportunity for all parties to participate; or

[[Page 63]]

    (ii) Be responsible to or subject to the supervision, direction of, 
or evaluation by, an employee engaged in the performance of 
investigative or prosecutorial functions for the Department.
    (b) Procedure upon occurrence of ex parte communication. If an ex 
parte communication is received by the Administrative Law Judge or the 
Secretary's designee, the Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's 
designee, as appropriate, shall cause all of such written communication 
(or, if the communication is oral, a memorandum stating the substance of 
the communication) to be placed on the record of the proceeding and 
served on all parties. A party may, not later than 10 days after the 
date of service, file a response thereto and may recommend that the 
person making the prohibited communication be sanctioned pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Sanctions. Any party to the proceeding, a party's 
representative, or any other interested individual, who makes a 
prohibited ex parte communication, or who encourages or solicits another 
to make any such communication, may be subject to any appropriate 
sanction or sanctions imposed by the Administrative Law Judge or the 
Secretary's designee, as appropriate, for good cause shown, including, 
but not limited to, exclusion from the hearing and an adverse ruling on 
the issue that is the subject of the prohibited communication.


<R05>
Sec. 501.720  Separation of functions.

    Any officer or employee engaged in the performance of investigative 
or prosecutorial functions for the Department in a proceeding as defined 
in Sec. 501.702 may not, in that proceeding or one that is factually 
related, participate or advise in the decision pursuant to Section 557 
of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 557, except as a witness 
or counsel in the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 501.721  Hearings to be public.

    All hearings, except hearings on applications for confidential 
treatment filed pursuant to Sec. 501.725(b), shall be public unless 
otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's 
designee, as appropriate, on his or her own motion or the motion of a 
party.


<R05>
Sec. 501.722  Prehearing conferences.

    (a) Purposes of conferences. The purposes of prehearing conferences 
include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Expediting the disposition of the proceeding;
    (2) Establishing early and continuing control of the proceeding by 
the Administrative Law Judge; and

Administrative Law Judge shall be advised promptly by the parties of any 
agreements reached. Such conferences also may be held with one or more 
persons participating by telephone or other remote means.

disposition of the proceeding.
    (d) Timing of conferences. Unless the Administrative Law Judge 
orders otherwise, an initial prehearing conference shall be held not

under the circumstances.
    (e) Prehearing orders. At or following the conclusion of any 
conference held pursuant to this rule, the Administrative Law Judge

person or through a representative, at a prehearing conference of which 
he or she has been duly notified may be deemed in default pursuant to

    (ii) A copy, or a description by category and location, of all 
documents, data compilations, and tangible things that are in the

impeachment of a witness appearing in person or by deposition;
    (2) The disclosures described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section

hearing for any purpose other than solely for impeachment of a witness 
appearing in person or by deposition:

including the witness's name, occupation, address, phone number, and a 
brief summary of the expected testimony.
    (2) Unless otherwise directed by the Administrative Law Judge, the 
disclosures required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be made 
not later than 30 days before the date of the hearing.
    (c) Disclosure of expert testimony. A party who intends to call an 
expert witness shall submit, in addition to the information required by 
paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, a statement of the expert's 
qualifications, a list of other proceedings in which the expert has 
given expert testimony, and a list of publications authored or co-
authored by the expert.
    (d) Form of disclosures. Unless the Administrative Law Judge orders 
otherwise, all disclosures under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this 
section shall be made in writing, signed, and served as provided in 
Sec. 501.705.

[[Page 65]]

    (e) Methods to discover additional matter. Parties may obtain 
discovery by one or more of the following methods: Depositions of 
witnesses upon oral examination or written questions; written 
interrogatories to another party; production of documents or other 
evidence for inspection; and requests for admission. All depositions of 
Federal employees must take place in Washington, DC, at the Department 
of the Treasury or at the location where the Federal employee to be 
deposed performs his or her duties, whichever the Federal employee's 
supervisor or the Office of Chief Counsel shall deem appropriate. All 
depositions shall be held at a date and time agreed by the Office of 
Chief Counsel and the respondent or respondent's representative, and for 
an agreed length of time.
    (f) Discovery scope and limits. Unless otherwise limited by order of 
the Administrative Law Judge in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section, the scope of discovery is as follows:
    (1) In general. The availability of information and documents 
through discovery is subject to the assertion of privileges available to 
the parties and witnesses. Privileges available to the Director and the 
Department include exemptions afforded pursuant to the Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1) through (9)) and the Privacy Act (5 
U.S.C. 552a). Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not 
privileged, that is relevant to the merits of the pending action, 
including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and 
location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the 
identity and location of any persons having knowledge of any 
discoverable matter. For good cause, the Administrative Law Judge may 
order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in 
the proceeding. Relevant information need not be admissible at the 
hearing if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the 
discovery of admissible evidence.
    (2) Limitations. The Administrative Law Judge may issue any order 
that justice requires to ensure that discovery requests are not 
unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope or unduly burdensome, 
including an order to show cause why a particular discovery request is 
justified upon motion of the objecting party. The frequency or extent of 
use of the discovery methods otherwise permitted under this section may 
be limited by the Administrative Law Judge if he or she determines that:
    (i) The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, 
or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less 
burdensome, or less expensive;
    (ii) The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by 
discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or
    (iii) The burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its 
likely benefit, taking into account the needs of the hearing, the 
importance of the issues at stake, and the importance of the proposed 
discovery in resolving the issues.
    (3) Interrogatories. Respondent's interrogatories shall be served 
upon the Office of the Chief Counsel not later than 30 days after 
issuance of the Order Instituting Proceedings. The Director's 
interrogatories shall be served by the later of 30 days after the 
receipt of service of respondent's interrogatories or 40 days after 
issuance of the Order Instituting Proceedings if no interrogatories are 
filed by respondent. Parties shall respond to interrogatories not later 
than 30 days after the date interrogatories are received. 
Interrogatories shall be limited to 20 questions only. Each subpart, 
section, or other designation of a part of a question shall be counted 
as one complete question in computing the permitted 20 question total. 
Where more than 20 questions are served upon a party, the receiving 
party may determine which of the 20 questions the receiving party shall 
answer. The limitation on the number of questions in an interrogatory 
may be waived by the Administrative Law Judge.
    (4) Privileged matter. Privileged documents are not discoverable. 
Privileges include, but are not limited to, the attorney-client 
privilege, attorney work-product privilege, any government's or 
government agency's deliberative-process or classified information 
privilege, including materials classified pursuant

[[Page 66]]

to Executive Order 12958 (3 CFR, 1995 Comp., p. 333) and any future 
Executive orders that may be issued relating to the treatment of 
national security information, and all materials and information 
exempted from release to the public pursuant to the Privacy Act (5 
U.S.C. 552a) or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1) 
through (9)).
    (g) Updating discovery. A party who has made an initial disclosure 
under paragraph (a) of this section or responded to a request for 
discovery with a disclosure or response is under a duty to supplement or 
correct the disclosure or response to include information thereafter 
acquired whenever:
    (1) The party learns that in some material respect the information 
disclosed is incomplete or incorrect, if the additional or corrective 
information has not otherwise been made known to the other party during 
the discovery process or in writing; or
    (2) Ordered by the Administrative Law Judge. The Administrative Law 
Judge may impose sanctions for failure to supplement or correct 
discovery.
    (h) Time limits. All discovery, including all responses to discovery 
requests, shall be completed not later than 20 days prior to the date 
scheduled for the commencement of the hearing, unless the Administrative 
Law Judge finds on the record that good cause exists to grant additional 
time to complete discovery.
    (i) Effect of failure to comply. No witness may testify and no 
document or exhibit may be introduced at the hearing if such witness, 
document, or exhibit is not listed in the prehearing submissions 
pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, except for good 
cause shown.


<R05>
Sec. 501.724  Documents that may be withheld.

    (a) Notwithstanding Sec. 501.723(f), the Director or respondent may 
withhold a document if:
    (1) The document is privileged;
    (2) The document would disclose the identity of a confidential 
source; or
    (3) The Administrative Law Judge grants leave to withhold a document 
or category of documents as not relevant to the subject matter of the 
proceeding or otherwise, for good cause shown.
    (b) Nothing in paragraph (a) of this section authorizes the Director 
to withhold documents that contain material exculpatory evidence.
    (c) Withheld document list. The Director and respondent shall 
provide the Administrative Law Judge, for review, a list of documents 
withheld pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1)-(3) of this section. The 
Administrative Law Judge shall determine whether any such document 
should be made available for inspection and copying.


<R05>
Sec. 501.725  Confidential treatment of information in certain filings.

    (a) Filing document under seal. (1) The Director may file any 
document or any part of a document under seal and/or seek a protective 
order concerning any document if disclosure of the document would be 
inconsistent with the protection of the public interest or if justice 
requires protection of any person, including a source or a party, from 
annoyance, threat, oppression, or undue burden or expense, or the 
disclosure of the information would be, or might reasonably lead to a 
disclosure, contrary to Executive Order 12958, as amended by Executive 
Order 13292, or other Executive orders concerning disclosure of 
information, Department regulations, or the Privacy Act, or information 
exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act. The 
Administrative Law Judge shall allow placement of any such document 
under seal and/or grant a protective order upon a showing that the 
disclosure would be inconsistent with any such statute or Executive 
order, or that the harm resulting from disclosure would outweigh the 
benefits of disclosure.
    (2) A respondent may file any document or any part of a document 
under seal and/or seek a protective order to limit such document from 
disclosure to other parties or to the public. The Administrative Law 
Judge shall allow placement of any document under seal and/or grant a 
protective order upon a showing that the harm resulting from disclosure 
would outweigh the benefits of disclosure.
    (3) The Administrative Law Judge shall safeguard the security and 
integrity of any documents under seal or

[[Page 67]]

protective order and shall take all appropriate steps to preserve the 
confidentiality of such documents or any parts thereof, including 
closing a hearing or portions of a hearing to the public. Release of any 
information under seal or to the extent inconsistent with a protective 
order, in any form or manner, is subject to the sanctions and the 
exercise of the authorities as are provided with respect to ex parte 
communications under Sec. 501.719.
    (4) If the Administrative Law Judge denies placement of any document 
under seal or under protective order, any party, and any person whose 
document or material is at issue, may obtain interlocutory review by the 
Secretary's designee. In such cases the Administrative Law Judge shall 
not release or expose any of the records or documents in question to the 
public or to any person for a period of 20 days from the date of the 
Administrative Law Judge's ruling, in order to permit a party the 
opportunity either to withdraw the records and documents or obtain 
interlocutory review by the Secretary's designee and an order that the 
records be placed under seal or a protective order.
    (5) Upon settlement, final decision, or motion to the Administrative 
Law Judge for good cause shown, all materials (including all copies) 
under seal or protective order shall be returned to the submitting 
parties, except when it may be necessary to retain a record until any 
judicial process is completed.
    (6)(i) Written notice of each request for release of documents or 
materials under seal or subject to a protective order shall be given to 
the parties at least 20 days prior to any permitted release or prior to 
any access not specifically authorized under a protective order. A copy 
of each request for information, including the name, address, and 
telephone number of the requester, shall be provided to the parties.
    (ii) Each request for access to protected material shall include the 
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all persons on whose behalf 
the requester seeks access to protected information. The Administrative 
Law Judge may impose sanctions as provided under Sec. 501.729 for 
failure to provide this information.
    (b) Application. An application for a protective order or to place 
under seal shall be filed with the Administrative Law Judge. The 
application shall be accompanied by a sealed copy of the materials as to 
which confidential treatment is sought.
    (1) Procedure for supplying additional information. The person 
making the application may be required to furnish in writing additional 
information with respect to the grounds for objection to public 
disclosure. Failure to supply the information so requested within 14 
days from the date of receipt of a notice of the information required 
shall be deemed a waiver of the objection to public disclosure of that 
portion of the information to which the additional information relates, 
unless the Administrative Law Judge shall otherwise order for good cause 
shown at or before the expiration of such 14-day period.
    (2) Confidentiality of materials pending final decision. Pending the 
determination of the application for confidential treatment, 
transcripts, non-final orders including an initial decision, if any, and 
other materials in connection with the application shall be placed under 
seal; shall be for the confidential use only of the Administrative Law 
Judge, the Secretary's designee, the applicant, the Director, and any 
other respondent and representative; and shall be made available to the 
public only in accordance with orders of the Administrative Law Judge or 
the Secretary's designee.
    (3) Public availability of orders. Any final order of the 
Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's designee denying or 
sustaining an application for confidential treatment shall be made 
public. Any prior findings or opinions relating to an application for 
confidential treatment under this section shall be made public at such 
time as the material as to which confidentiality was requested is made 
public.


<R05>
Sec. 501.726  Motions.

    (a) Generally. Unless made during a hearing or conference, a motion 
shall be in writing, shall state with particularity the grounds 
therefor, shall set forth the relief or order sought, and shall be 
accompanied by a written brief of the points and authorities relied

[[Page 68]]

upon. Motions by a respondent must be filed with the Administrative Law 
Judge and served upon the Director through the Office of Chief Counsel 
and with any other party respondent or respondent's representative, 
unless otherwise directed by the Administrative Law Judge. Motions by 
the Director must be filed with the Administrative Law Judge and served 
upon each party respondent or respondent's representative. All written 
motions must be served in accordance with, and otherwise meet the 
requirements of, Sec. 501.705. The Administrative Law Judge may order 
that an oral motion be submitted in writing. No oral argument shall be 
heard on any motion unless the Administrative Law Judge otherwise 
directs.
    (b) Opposing and reply briefs. Except as provided in Sec. 
501.741(e), briefs in opposition to a motion shall be filed not later 
than 15 days after service of the motion. Reply briefs shall be filed 
not later than 3 days after service of the opposition. The failure of a 
party to oppose a written motion or an oral motion made on the record 
shall be deemed a waiver of objection by that party to the entry of an 
order substantially in the form of any proposed order accompanying the 
motion.
    (c) Dilatory motions. Frivolous, dilatory, or repetitive motions are 
prohibited. The filing of such motions may form the basis for sanctions.
    (d) Length limitation. Except as otherwise ordered by the 
Administrative Law Judge, a brief in support of, or in opposition to, a 
motion shall not exceed 15 pages, exclusive of pages containing any 
table of contents, table of authorities, or addendum.
    (e) A motion to set aside a default shall be made within a 
reasonable time as determined by the Administrative Law Judge, state the 
reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and, if applicable, specify 
the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. In order to 
prevent injustice and on such conditions as may be appropriate, the 
Administrative Law Judge, at any time prior to the filing of his or her 
decision, or the Secretary's designee, at any time during the review 
process, may for good cause shown set aside a default.


<R05>
Sec. 501.727  Motion for summary disposition.

    (a) At any time after a respondent's answer has been filed, the 
respondent or the Director may make a motion for summary disposition of 
any or all allegations contained in the Order Instituting Proceedings. 
If the Director has not completed presentation of his or her case-in-
chief, a motion for summary disposition shall be made only with 
permission of the Administrative Law Judge. The facts of the pleadings 
of the party against whom the motion is made shall be taken as true, 
except as modified by stipulations or admissions made by that party, by 
uncontested affidavits, or by facts officially noticed pursuant to Sec. 
501.732(b).
    (b) Decision on motion. The Administrative Law Judge may promptly 
decide the motion for summary disposition or may defer decision on the 
motion. The Administrative Law Judge shall issue an order granting a 
motion for summary disposition if the record shows there is no genuine 
issue with regard to any material fact and the party making the motion 
is entitled to a summary disposition as a matter of law.
    (c) A motion for summary disposition must be accompanied by a 
statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends 
there is no genuine issue. Such motion must be supported by documentary 
evidence, which may take the form of admissions in pleadings, 
stipulations, depositions, transcripts, affidavits, and any other 
evidentiary materials that the moving party contends support its 
position. The motion must also be accompanied by a brief containing the 
points and authorities in support of the moving party's arguments. Any 
party opposing a motion for summary disposition must file a statement 
setting forth those material facts as to which such party contends a 
genuine dispute exists. The opposition must be supported by evidence of 
the same type as that submitted with the motion for summary disposition 
and a brief containing the points and authorities in support of the 
contention that summary disposition would be inappropriate.

[[Page 69]]


<R05>
Sec. 501.728  Subpoenas.

    (a) Availability; procedure. In connection with any hearing before 
an Administrative Law Judge, either the respondent or the Director may 
request the issuance of subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony 
of witnesses at the designated time and place of hearing, and subpoenas 
requiring the production of documentary or other tangible evidence 
returnable at a designated time and place. Unless made on the record at 
a hearing, requests for issuance of a subpoena shall be made in writing 
and served on each party pursuant to Sec. 501.705.
    (b) Standards for issuance. If it appears to the Administrative Law 
Judge that a subpoena sought may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive 
in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may, in his or her discretion, 
as a condition precedent to the issuance of the subpoena, require the 
person seeking the subpoena to show the general relevance and reasonable 
scope of the testimony or other evidence sought. If after consideration 
of all the circumstances, the Administrative Law Judge determines that 
the subpoena or any of its terms is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive 
in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may refuse to issue the 
subpoena, or issue a modified subpoena as fairness requires. In making 
the foregoing determination, the Administrative Law Judge may inquire of 
the other participants whether they will stipulate to the facts sought 
to be proved.
    (c) Service. Service of a subpoena shall be made pursuant to the 
provisions of Sec. 501.705.
    (d) Application to quash or modify--(1) Procedure. Any person to 
whom a subpoena is directed or who is an owner, creator or the subject 
of the documents or materials that are to be produced pursuant to a 
subpoena may, prior to the time specified therein for compliance, but 
not later than 15 days after the date of service of such subpoena, 
request that the subpoena be quashed or modified. Such request shall be 
made by application filed with the Administrative Law Judge and served 
on all parties pursuant to Sec. 501.705. The party on whose behalf the 
subpoena was issued may, not later than 5 days after service of the 
application, file an opposition to the application.
    (2) Standards governing application to quash or modify. If the 
Administrative Law Judge determines that compliance with the subpoena 
would be unreasonable, oppressive or unduly burdensome, the 
Administrative Law Judge may quash or modify the subpoena, or may order 
return of the subpoena only upon specified conditions. These conditions 
may include, but are not limited to, a requirement that the party on 
whose behalf the subpoena was issued shall make reasonable compensation 
to the person to whom the subpoena was addressed for the cost of copying 
or transporting evidence to the place for return of the subpoena.
    (e) Witness fees and mileage. Witnesses summoned to appear at a 
proceeding shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to 
witnesses in the courts of the United States, and witnesses whose 
depositions are taken and the persons taking the same shall severally be 
entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in the courts of 
the United States. Witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the party 
at whose instance the witnesses appear.


<R05>
Sec. 501.729  Sanctions.

    (a) Contemptuous conduct--(1) Subject to exclusion or suspension. 
Contemptuous conduct by any person before an Administrative Law Judge or 
the Secretary's designee during any proceeding, including any 
conference, shall be grounds for the Administrative Law Judge or the 
Secretary's designee to:
    (i) Exclude that person from such hearing or conference, or any 
portion thereof; and/or
    (ii) If a representative, summarily suspend that person from 
representing others in the proceeding in which such conduct occurred for 
the duration, or any portion, of the proceeding.
    (2) Adjournment. Upon motion by a party represented by a 
representative subject to an order of exclusion or suspension, an 
adjournment shall be granted to allow the retention of a new 
representative. In determining the length of an adjournment, the 
Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's designee shall consider, in 
addition to

[[Page 70]]

the factors set forth in Sec. 501.737, the availability of another 
representative for the party or, if the representative was a counsel, of 
other members of a suspended counsel's firm.
    (b) Deficient filings; leave to cure deficiencies. The 
Administrative Law Judge, or the Secretary's designee in the case of a 
request for review, may in his or her discretion, reject, in whole or in 
part, any filing that fails to comply with any requirements of this 
subpart or of any order issued in the proceeding in which the filing was 
made. Any such filings shall not be part of the record. The 
Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's designee may direct a party 
to cure any deficiencies and to resubmit the filing within a fixed time 
period.
    (c) Failure to make required filing or to cure deficient filing. The 
Administrative Law Judge (or the Secretary's designee during review 
proceedings) may enter a default pursuant to Sec. 501.716, dismiss the 
case, decide the particular matter at issue against that person, or 
prohibit the introduction of evidence or exclude testimony concerning 
that matter if a person fails:
    (1) To make a filing required under this subpart; or
    (2) To cure a deficient filing within the time specified by the 
Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's designee pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Failure to make required filing or to cure deficient filing in 
the case of a request for review. The Secretary's designee, in any case 
of a request for review, may decide the issue against that person, or 
prohibit the introduction of evidence or exclude testimony concerning 
that matter if a person fails:
    (1) To make a filing required under this subpart; or
    (2) To cure a deficient filing within the time specified by the 
Secretary's designee pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 501.730  Depositions upon oral examination.

    (a) Procedure. Any party desiring to take the testimony of a witness 
by deposition shall make a written motion setting forth the reasons why 
such deposition should be taken including the specific reasons why the 
party believes the witness may be unable to attend or testify at the 
hearing; the name and address of the prospective witness; the matters 
concerning which the prospective witness is expected to be questioned; 
and the proposed time and place for the taking of the deposition.
    (b) Required finding when ordering a deposition. In the discretion 
of the Administrative Law Judge, an order for deposition may be issued 
upon a finding that the prospective witness will likely give testimony 
material to the proceeding, that it is likely the prospective witness 
will be unable to attend or testify at the hearing because of age, 
sickness, infirmity, imprisonment or other disability, and that the 
taking of a deposition will serve the interests of justice.
    (c) Contents of order. An order for deposition shall designate by 
name a deposition officer. The designated officer may be the 
Administrative Law Judge or any other person authorized to administer 
oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place where the 
deposition is to be held. An order for deposition also shall state:
    (1) The name of the witness whose deposition is to be taken;
    (2) The scope of the testimony to be taken;
    (3) The time and place of the deposition;
    (4) The manner of recording, preserving and filing the deposition; 
and
    (5) The number of copies, if any, of the deposition and exhibits to 
be filed upon completion of the deposition.
    (d) Procedure at depositions. A witness whose testimony is taken by 
deposition shall swear or affirm before any questions are put to him or 
her. Examination and cross-examination of witnesses may proceed as 
permitted at a hearing. A witness being deposed may have counsel or a 
representative present during the deposition.
    (e) Objections to questions or evidence. Objections to questions or 
evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objection relied 
upon. Objections to questions or evidence shall be noted by the 
deposition officer upon the deposition, but a deposition officer (other 
than an Administrative Law

[[Page 71]]

Judge) shall not have the power to decide on the competency, materiality 
or relevance of evidence. Failure to object to questions or evidence 
before the deposition officer shall not be deemed a waiver unless the 
ground of the objection is one that might have been obviated or removed 
if presented at that time.
    (f) Filing of depositions. The questions asked and all answers or 
objections shall be recorded or transcribed verbatim, and a transcript 
shall be prepared by the deposition officer, or under his or her 
direction. The transcript shall be subscribed by the witness and 
certified by the deposition officer. The original deposition transcript 
and exhibits shall be filed with the Administrative Law Judge. A copy of 
the deposition transcript and exhibits shall be served on the opposing 
party or parties. The cost of the transcript (including copies) shall be 
paid by the party requesting the deposition.


<R05>
Sec. 501.731  Depositions upon written questions.

    (a) Availability. Depositions may be taken and submitted on written 
questions upon motion of any party. The motion shall include the 
information specified in Sec. 501.730(a). A decision on the motion 
shall be governed by Sec. 501.730(b).
    (b) Procedure. Written questions shall be filed with the motion. Not 
later than 10 days after service of the motion and written questions, 
any party may file objections to such written questions and any party 
may file cross-questions. When a deposition is taken pursuant to this 
section no persons other than the witness, representative or counsel to 
the witness, the deposition officer, and, if the deposition officer does 
not act as reporter, a reporter, shall be present at the examination of 
the witness. No party shall be present or represented unless otherwise 
permitted by order. The deposition officer shall propound the questions 
and cross-questions to the witness in the order submitted.
    (c) Additional requirements. The order for deposition, filing of the 
deposition, form of the deposition and use of the deposition in the 
record shall be governed by paragraphs (b) through (g) of Sec. 501.730, 
except that no cross-examination shall be made.


<R05>
Sec. 501.732  Evidence.

    The applicable evidentiary standard for proceedings under this 
subpart is proof by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and 
substantial evidence. The Administrative Law Judge shall admit any 
relevant and material oral, documentary, or demonstrative evidence. The 
Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply, by their own force, to 
proceedings under this subpart, but shall be employed as general 
guidelines. The fact that evidence submitted by a party is hearsay goes 
only to the weight of the evidence and does not affect its 
admissibility.
    (a) Objections and offers of proof--(1) Objections. Objections to 
the admission or exclusion of evidence must be made on the record and 
shall be in short form, stating the grounds relied upon. Exceptions to 
any ruling thereon by the Administrative Law Judge need not be noted at 
the time of the ruling. Such exceptions will be deemed waived on review 
by the Secretary's designee, however, unless raised:
    (i) Pursuant to interlocutory review in accordance with Sec. 
501.741;
    (ii) In a proposed finding or conclusion filed pursuant to Sec. 
501.738; or
    (iii) In a petition for the Secretary's designee's review of an 
Administrative Law Judge's decision filed in accordance with Sec. 
501.741.
    (2) Offers of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, 
the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall 
be included in the record. Excluded material shall be retained pursuant 
to Sec. 501.739(b).
    (b) Official notice. An Administrative Law Judge or Secretary's 
designee may take official notice of any material fact that might be 
judicially noticed by a district court of the United States, any matter 
in the public official records of the Secretary, or any matter that is 
particularly within the knowledge of the Department as an expert body. 
If official notice is requested or taken of a material fact not 
appearing in the evidence in the record, a party, upon timely request to 
the Administrative Law Judge, shall be afforded an opportunity to 
establish the contrary.

[[Page 72]]

    (c) Stipulations. The parties may, by stipulation, at any stage of 
the proceeding agree upon any pertinent fact in the proceeding. A 
stipulation may be received in evidence and, when accepted by the 
Administrative Law Judge, shall be binding on the parties to the 
stipulation.
    (d) Presentation under oath or affirmation. A witness at a hearing 
for the purpose of taking evidence shall testify under oath or 
affirmation.
    (e) Presentation, rebuttal and cross-examination. A party is 
entitled to present its case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, 
to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as, 
in the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, may be required for a 
full and true disclosure of the facts.


<R05>
Sec. 501.733  Evidence: confidential information, protective orders.

    (a) Procedure. In any proceeding as defined in Sec. 501.702, a 
respondent; the Director; any person who is the owner, subject or 
creator of a document subject to subpoena or which may be introduced as 
evidence; or any witness who testifies at a hearing may file a motion 
requesting a protective order to limit from disclosure to other parties 
or to the public documents or testimony containing confidential 
information. The motion should include a general summary or extract of 
the documents without revealing confidential details. If a person seeks 
a protective order against disclosure to other parties as well as the 
public, copies of the documents shall not be served on other parties. 
Unless the documents are unavailable, the person shall file for 
inspection by the Administrative Law Judge a sealed copy of the 
documents as to which the order is sought.
    (b) Basis for issuance. Documents and testimony introduced in a 
public hearing are presumed to be public. A motion for a protective 
order shall be granted only upon a finding that the harm resulting from 
disclosure would outweigh the benefits of disclosure.
    (c) Requests for additional information supporting confidentiality. 
A person seeking a protective order under paragraph (a) of this section 
may be required to furnish in writing additional information with 
respect to the grounds for confidentiality. Failure to supply the 
information so requested not later than 5 days from the date of receipt 
by the person of a notice of the information required shall be deemed a 
waiver of the objection to public disclosure of that portion of the 
documents to which the additional information relates, unless the 
Administrative Law Judge shall otherwise order for good cause shown at 
or before the expiration of such 5-day period.
    (d) Confidentiality of documents pending decision. Pending a 
determination of a motion under this section, the documents as to which 
confidential treatment is sought and any other documents that would 
reveal the confidential information in those documents shall be 
maintained under seal and shall be disclosed only in accordance with 
orders of the Administrative Law Judge. Any order issued in connection 
with a motion under this section shall be made public unless the order 
would disclose information as to which a protective order has been 
granted, in which case that portion of the order that would reveal the 
protected information shall not be made public.

Sec. 501.734  Introducing prior sworn statements of witnesses into the record.

    (a) At a hearing, any person wishing to introduce a prior, sworn 
statement of a witness who is not a party to the proceeding, that is 
otherwise admissible in the proceeding, may make a motion setting forth 
the reasons therefor. If only part of a statement is offered in 
evidence, the Administrative Law Judge may require that all relevant 
portions of the statement be introduced. If all of a statement is 
offered in evidence, the Administrative Law Judge may require that 
portions not relevant to the proceeding be excluded. A motion to 
introduce a prior sworn statement may be granted if:
    (1) The witness is dead;
    (2) The witness is out of the United States, unless it appears that 
the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the prior 
sworn statement;

[[Page 73]]

    (3) The witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, 
sickness, infirmity, imprisonment or other disability;
    (4) The party offering the prior sworn statement has been unable to 
procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or,
    (5) In the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, it would be 
desirable, in the interests of justice, to allow the prior sworn 
statement to be used. In making this determination, due regard shall be 
given to the presumption that witnesses will testify orally in an open 
hearing. If the parties have stipulated to accept a prior sworn 
statement in lieu of live testimony, consideration shall also be given 
to the convenience of the parties in avoiding unnecessary expense.


<R05>
Sec. 501.735  Proposed findings, conclusions and supporting briefs.

    (a) Opportunity to file. Before a decision is issued by the 
Administrative Law Judge, each party shall have an opportunity, 
reasonable in light of all the circumstances, to file in writing 
proposed findings and conclusions.
    (b) Procedure. Proposed findings of fact must be supported by 
citations to specific portions of the record. If successive filings are 
directed, the proposed findings and conclusions of the party assigned to 
file first shall be set forth in serially numbered paragraphs, and any 
counter statement of proposed findings and conclusions shall, in 
addition to any other matter presented, indicate those paragraphs of the 
proposals already filed as to which there is no dispute. A reply brief 
may be filed by the party assigned to file first, or, where simultaneous 
filings are directed, reply briefs may be filed by each party, within 
the period prescribed therefor by the Administrative Law Judge. No 
further briefs may be filed except with permission of the Administrative 
Law Judge.
    (c) Time for filing. In any proceeding in which a decision is to be 
issued:
    (1) At the close of each hearing, the Administrative Law Judge 
shall, by order, after consultation with the parties, prescribe the 
period within which proposed findings and conclusions and supporting 
briefs are to be filed. The party directed to file first shall make its 
initial filing not later than 30 days after the end of the hearing 
unless the Administrative Law Judge, for good cause shown, permits a 
different period and sets forth in the order the reasons why the 
different period is necessary.
    (2) The total period within which all such proposed findings and 
conclusions and supporting briefs and any counter statements of proposed 
findings and conclusions and reply briefs are to be filed shall be no 
longer than 90 days after the close of the hearing unless the 
Administrative Law Judge, for good cause shown, permits a different 
period and sets forth in an order the reasons why the different period 
is necessary.


<R05>

    (a) Availability. Except as otherwise provided by law, the 
Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's designee, as appropriate, at 
any time prior to the filing of his or her decision, may, for good cause 
and in the interest of justice, modify any time limit prescribed by this 
subpart and may, consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, postpone 
or adjourn any hearing.
    (b) Limitations on postponements, adjournments and adjustments. A

reasonable period of time.
    (1) Additional considerations. In considering a motion for 
postponement of the start of a hearing, adjournment once a hearing has 
begun, or extensions of time for filing papers, the Administrative Law 
Judge or the Secretary's designee, as appropriate, shall consider, in 
addition to any other factors:
    (i) The length of the proceeding to date;
    (ii) The number of postponements, adjournments or extensions already 
granted;
    (iii) The stage of the proceedings at the time of the request; and
    (iv) Any other matter as justice may require.
    (2) Time limit. Postponements, adjournments or extensions of time

is necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 501.738  Disqualification and withdrawal of Administrative Law Judge.

therefor.
    (b) Motion for Withdrawal. Any party who has a reasonable, good 
faith basis to believe an Administrative Law Judge or Secretary's 
designee has a personal bias, or is otherwise disqualified from hearing 
a case, may make a motion to the Administrative Law Judge or Secretary's 
designee, as appropriate, that the Administrative Law Judge or 
Secretary's designee withdraw. The motion shall be accompanied by a 
statement subject to 18 U.S.C. 1001 setting forth in detail the facts 
alleged to constitute grounds for disqualification. If the 
Administrative Law Judge or Secretary's designee finds himself or 
herself qualified, he or she shall so rule and shall continue to preside 
over the proceeding.


<R05>

    (2) Transcript correction. Prior to the filing of post-hearing 
briefs or proposed findings and conclusions, or within such earlier time

<R05>
Sec. 501.740  Decision of Administrative Law Judge.

    The Administrative Law Judge shall prepare a decision that 
constitutes his or her final disposition of the proceedings.
    (a) Content. (1) The Administrative Law Judge shall determine 
whether or not the respondent has violated any provision of parts 500 
and 515 of this chapter or the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction or instruction issued by or under the 
authority of the Secretary pursuant to part 500 or 515 of this chapter 
or otherwise under the Trading with the Enemy Act.
    (2) The Administrative Law Judge's decision shall include findings 
and conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefor, as to all the 
material issues of fact, law or discretion presented on the record.
    (3) (i) Upon a finding of violation, the Administrative Law Judge 
shall award an appropriate monetary civil penalty in an amount 
consistent with the Penalty Guidelines published by the Director.
    (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the 
Administrative Law Judge:
    (A) Shall provide an opportunity for a respondent to assert his or 
her inability to pay a penalty, or financial hardship, by filing with 
the Administrative Law Judge a financial disclosure statement subject to 
18 U.S.C. 1001 that sets forth in detail the basis for the financial 
hardship or the inability to pay; and
    (B) Shall consider any such filing in determining the appropriate 
monetary civil penalty.
    (b) Administrative Law Judge's decision--(1) Service. The 
Administrative Law Judge shall serve his or her decision on the 
respondent and on the Director through the Office of Chief Counsel, and 
shall file a copy of the decision with the Secretary's designee.
    (2) Filing of report with the Secretary's designee. If the

501.741, or upon a request from the Secretary's designee, the 
Administrative Law Judge shall file his or her report with the 
Secretary's designee not later than 20 days after service of his or her 
decision on the parties. The report shall consist of the record, 
including the Administrative Law Judge's decision, and any petition from 
the respondent or the Director seeking review.

report has been directed for review by the Secretary's designee or, in 
the absence of a direction for review, until the decision

[[Page 76]]

has become a final order, the Administrative Law Judge may correct 
clerical errors and errors arising through oversight or inadvertence in 
decisions, orders, or other parts of the record.
    (c) Administrative Law Judge's decision final unless review 
directed. Unless the Secretary's designee determines to review a 
decision in accordance with Sec. 501.741(a)(1), the decision of the 
Administrative Law Judge shall become the final decision of the 
Department.
    (d) Penalty awarded. The Director is charged with implementing all

or award of a civil monetary penalty, shall carry out the necessary 
steps to close the action.


<R05>
Sec. 501.741  Review of decision or ruling.

    (a) Availability. (1)(i) Review of the decision of the 
Administrative Law Judge by the Secretary's designee is not a right. The 
Secretary's designee may, in his or her discretion, review the decision 
of the Administrative Law Judge on the petition of either the respondent 
or the Director, or upon his or her own motion. The Secretary's designee 
shall determine whether to review a decision:
    (A) If a petition for review has been filed by the respondent or the 
Director, not later than 30 days after that date the Administrative Law 
Judge filed his or her report with the Secretary's designee pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or
    (B) If no petition for review has been filed by the respondent or 
the Director, not later than 40 days after the date the Administrative 
Law Judge filed his or her decision with the Secretary's designee 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (ii) In determining whether to review a decision upon petition of 
the respondent or the Director, the Secretary's designee shall consider 
whether the petition for review makes a reasonable showing that:
    (A) A prejudicial error was committed in the conduct of the 
proceeding; or
    (B) The decision embodies:
    (1) A finding or conclusion of material fact that is clearly 
erroneous;
    (2) A conclusion of law that is erroneous; or
    (3) An exercise of discretion or decision of law or policy that is 
important and that the Secretary's designee should review.
    (2) Interlocutory review of ruling. The Secretary's designee shall 
review any ruling of an Administrative Law Judge involving privileged or 
confidential material that is the subject of a petition for review. See 
Sec. 501.725.
    (b) Filing. Either the respondent or the Director, when adversely 
affected or aggrieved by the decision or ruling of the Administrative 
Law Judge, may seek review by the Secretary's designee by filing a 
petition for review. Any petition for review shall be filed with the 
Administrative Law Judge within 10 days after service of the 
Administrative Law Judge's decision or the issuance of a ruling 
involving privileged or confidential material.
    (c) Contents. The petition shall state why the Secretary's designee 
should review the Administrative Law Judge's decision or ruling, 
including: Whether the Administrative Law Judge's decision or ruling 
raises an important question of law, policy or discretion; whether 
review by the Secretary's designee will resolve a question about which 
the Department's Administrative Law Judges have rendered differing 
opinions; whether the Administrative Law Judge's decision or ruling is 
contrary to law or Department precedent; whether a finding of material 
fact is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence; or whether a 
prejudicial error of procedure or an abuse of discretion was committed. 
A petition should concisely state the portions of the decision or ruling 
for which review is sought. A petition shall not incorporate by 
reference a brief or legal memorandum.
    (d) When filing effective. A petition for review is filed when 
received by the Administrative Law Judge.
    (e) Statements in opposition to petition. Not later than 8 days 
after the filing of a petition for review, either the respondent or the 
Director may file a statement in opposition to a petition. A statement 
in opposition to a petition for review shall be filed in the manner

[[Page 77]]

specified in this section for filing of petitions for review. Statements 
in opposition shall concisely state why the Administrative Law Judge's 
decision or ruling should not be reviewed with respect to each portion 
of the petition to which it is addressed.
    (f) Number of copies. An original and three copies of a petition or 
a statement in opposition to a petition shall be filed with the 
Administrative Law Judge.
    (g) Prerequisite to judicial review. Pursuant to section 704 of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 704, a petition for review by the 
Secretary's designee of an Administrative Law Judge decision or ruling 
is a prerequisite to the seeking of judicial review of a final order 
entered pursuant to such decision or ruling.

Administrative Law Judges.

    (a) Scope of review. The Secretary's designee may affirm, reverse, 
modify, set aside or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in 
part, a decision or ruling by an Administrative Law Judge and may make 
any findings or conclusions that in his or her judgment are proper and 
on the basis of the record and such additional evidence as the 
Secretary's designee may receive in his or her discretion.
    (b) Summary affirmance. The Secretary's designee may summarily 
affirm an Administrative Law Judge's decision or ruling based upon the 
petition for review and any response thereto, without further briefing, 
if he or she finds that no issue raised in the petition for review 
warrants further consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 501.743  Briefs filed with the Secretary's designee.

    (a) Briefing schedule order. If review of a determination is

citation to the relevant portions of the record, including references to 
the specific pages relied upon, and by concise argument including 
citation of such statutes, decisions and other authorities as may be 
relevant. If the exception relates to the admission or exclusion of 
evidence, the substance of the evidence admitted or excluded shall be 
set forth in the brief, in an appendix thereto, or by citation to the 
record. If the exception relates to interlocutory review, there is no 
requirement to reference pages of the transcript. Reply briefs shall be

the Administrative Law Judge shall direct that a

[[Page 78]]

transcript of the relevant proceedings be prepared and forwarded to the 
Secretary's designee.
    (a) Contents of the record. In proceedings for final decision before

considered a part of the record before the Secretary's designee on 
review but shall be transmitted to the Secretary's designee if he or she 
so requests. In the event that the Secretary's designee does not request 
the document, the Administrative Law Judge shall retain the document not 
admitted into the record until the later of:
    (1) The date upon which the Secretary's designee's order becomes 
final; or
    (2) The conclusion of any judicial review of that order.

Sec. 501.801  Licensing.

    (a) General licenses. General licenses have been issued authorizing 
under appropriate terms and conditions certain types of transactions 
which are subject to the prohibitions contained in this chapter. All 
such licenses are set forth in subpart E of each part contained in this 
chapter. General licenses may also be issued authorizing under 
appropriate terms and conditions certain types of transactions which are 
subject to prohibitions contained in economic sanctions programs the 
implementation and administration of which have been delegated to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control but

[[Page 79]]

which are not yet codified in this chapter. It is the policy of the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control not to grant applications for specific 
licenses authorizing transactions to which the provisions of an 
outstanding general license are applicable. Persons availing themselves 
of certain general licenses may be required to file reports and 
statements in accordance with the instructions specified in those 
licenses. Failure to file such reports or statements will nullify the 
authority of the general license.
    (b) Specific licenses--(1) General course of procedure. Transactions 
subject to the prohibitions contained in this chapter, or to 
prohibitions the implementation and administration of which have been 
delegated to the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which 
are not authorized by general license may be effected only under 
specific licenses.
    (2) Applications for specific licenses. Original signed applications 
for specific licenses to engage in any transactions prohibited by or 
pursuant to this chapter or sanctions programs that have been delegated 
to the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control for 
implementation and administration must be filed by mail or courier. 
Applications will not be accepted by fax or electronically, unless 
otherwise authorized. Applications may be submitted in letter form with 
the exception of license applications for the unblocking of funds 
transfers. Applications for the unblocking of funds transfers must be 
submitted using TD-F 90-22.54, ``Application for the Release of Blocked 
Funds,'' accompanied by two complete copies of the entire submission. 
The form, which requires information regarding the date of the blocking, 
the financial institutions involved in the transfer, and the beneficiary 
and amount of the transfer, may be obtained from the OFAC Internet Home 
Page: http://www.treas.gov/ofac, the OFAC fax-on-demand service: 202/
622-0077, or the Compliance Programs Division, Office of Foreign Assets 
Control, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20220. Any person 
having an interest in a transaction or proposed transaction may file an 
application for a license authorizing such transaction.
    (3) Information to be supplied. The applicant must supply all 
information specified by relevant instructions and/or forms, and must 
fully disclose the names of all parties who are concerned with or 
interested in the proposed transaction. If the application is filed by 
an agent, the agent must disclose the name of his principal(s). Such 
documents as may be relevant shall be attached to each application as a 
part of such application, except that documents previously filed with 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control may, where appropriate, be 
incorporated by reference in such application. Applicants are required 
to supply their taxpayer identifying number pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 7701, 
which number may be used for purposes of collecting and reporting on any 
delinquent amounts arising out of the applicant's relationship with the 
United States Government. Applicants may be required to furnish such 
further information as is deemed necessary to a proper determination by 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Any applicant or other party in 
interest desiring to present additional information may do so at any 
time before or after decision. Arrangements for oral presentation should 
be made with the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (4) Effect of denial. The denial of a license does not preclude the 
reopening of an application or the filing of a further application. The 
applicant or any other party in interest may at any time request 
explanation of the reasons for a denial by correspondence or personal 
interview.
    (5) Reports under specific licenses. As a condition for the issuance 
of any license, the licensee may be required to file reports with 
respect to the transaction covered by the license, in such form and at 
such times and places as may be prescribed in the license or otherwise.

and funds transfers and on all related documentation, including all 
purchasing, shipping, and financing documents.
    (4) Limitations. Registered NGOs are not authorized to make 
remittances from blocked accounts. Registration numbers are not 
transferable and may be revoked or modified at any time at the 
discretion of the Director, Office of Foreign Assets Control. 
Registration numbers do not excuse compliance with any law or regulation 
administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control or any other agency 
(including reporting requirements) applicable to the transaction(s) 
herein authorized, nor does it release the Registrant or third parties 
from civil or criminal liability for violation of any law or regulation.
    (5) Prior numbers. Registration numbers already issued remain in 
effect.

Sec. 501.806  Procedures for unblocking funds believed to have been 
blocked due to mistaken identity.

    When a transaction results in the blocking of funds at a financial 
institution pursuant to the applicable regulations of this chapter and a 
party to the transaction believes the funds have been blocked due to 
mistaken identity, that party may seek to have such funds unblocked 
pursuant to the following administrative procedures:
    (a) Any person who is a party to the transaction may request the 
release of funds which the party believes to have been blocked due to 
mistaken identity.
    (b) Requests to release funds which a party believes to have been 
blocked due to mistaken identity must be made in writing and addressed 
to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Compliance Programs Division, 
1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW.--Annex, Washington, DC 20220, or sent by 
facsimile transmission to the Compliance Programs Division at 202/622-
1657.
    (c) The written request to release funds must include the name, 
address, telephone number, and (where available) fax number of the party 
seeking the release of the funds. For individuals, the inclusion of a 
social security number is voluntary but will facilitate resolution of 
the request. For corporations or other entities, the application should 
include its principal place of business, the state of incorporation or 
organization, and the name and telephone number of the appropriate 
person to contact regarding the application.
    (d) A request to release funds should include the following 
information, where known, concerning the transaction:
    (1) The name of the financial institution in which the funds are 
blocked;
    (2) The amount blocked;
    (3) The date of the blocking;
    (4) The identity of the original remitter of the funds and any 
intermediary financial institutions;
    (5) The intended beneficiary of the blocked transfer;
    (6) A description of the underlying transaction including copies of 
related documents (e.g., invoices, bills of lading, promissory notes, 
etc.);

[[Page 83]]

    (7) The nature of the applicant's interest in the funds; and
    (8) A statement of the reasons why the applicant believes the funds 
were blocked due to mistaken identity.
    (e) Upon receipt of the materials required by paragraph (d) of this

concerning the transaction pursuant to Sec. 501.602.
    (f) Following review of all applicable submissions, the Director of 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control will determine whether to release 
the funds. In the event the Director determines that the funds should be 
released, the Office of Foreign Assets Control will direct the financial 
institution to return the funds to the appropriate party.
    (g) For purposes of this section, the term ``financial institution'' 
shall include a banking institution, depository institution or United 
States depository institution, domestic bank, financial institution or 
U.S. financial institution, as those terms are defined in the applicable 
part of this chapter.

Sec. 501.807  Procedures governing removal of names from appendices A, 
B, and C to this chapter.

    A person may seek administrative reconsideration of his, her or its 
designation or that of a vessel as blocked, or assert that the 
circumstances resulting in the designation no longer apply, and thus 
seek to have the designation rescinded pursuant to the following 
administrative procedures:
    (a) A person blocked under the provisions of any part of this 
chapter, including a specially designated national, specially designated 
terrorist, or specially designated narcotics trafficker 
(collectively,``a blocked person''), or a person owning a majority 
interest in a blocked vessel may submit arguments or evidence that the 
person believes establishes that insufficient basis exists for the 
designation. The blocked person also may propose remedial steps on the 
person's part, such as corporate reorganization, resignation of persons 
from positions in a blocked entity, or similar steps, which the person 
believes would negate the basis for designation. A person owning a 
majority interest in a blocked vessel may propose the sale of the 
vessel, with the proceeds to be placed into a blocked interest-bearing 
account after deducting the costs incurred while the vessel was blocked 
and the costs of the sale. This submission must be made in writing and 
addressed to the Director, Office of Foreign Assets Control, U.S. 
Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW.--Annex, 
Washington, DC 20220.
    (b) The information submitted by the blocked person seeking 
unblocking or by a person seeking the unblocking of a vessel will be 
reviewed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which may request 
clarifying, corroborating, or other additional information.
    (c) A blocked person seeking unblocking or a person seeking the 
unblocking of a vessel may request a meeting with the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control; however, such meetings are not required, and the office 
may, at its discretion, decline to conduct such meetings prior to 
completing a review pursuant to this section.
    (d) After the Office of Foreign Assets Control has conducted a 
review of the request for reconsideration, it will provide a written 
decision to the blocked person or person seeking the unblocking of a 
vessel.

 Sec. Appendix A to Part 501--Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines

    Note: This appendix provides a general framework for the enforcement 
of all economic sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control (OFAC), with the exception of those violations set forth 
in the proposed Appendix to the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR), 
31 CFR Part 515 (see 68 FR 4422, 4429 (January 29, 2003)) or in the 
Service Provider Program Circular periodically issued by OFAC pursuant 
to the CACR.

                             I. Definitions

    A. Apparent violation means conduct that constitutes an actual or 
possible violation of U.S. economic sanctions laws, including the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the Trading With 
the Enemy Act (TWEA), the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, and 
other statutes administered or enforced by OFAC, as well as Executive 
orders, regulations, orders, directives, or licenses issued pursuant 
thereto.
    B. Applicable schedule amount means:
    i. $1,000 with respect to a transaction valued at less than $1,000;
    ii. $10,000 with respect to a transaction valued at $1,000 or more 
but less than $10,000;
    iii. $25,000 with respect to a transaction valued at $10,000 or more 
but less than $25,000;
    iv. $50,000 with respect to a transaction valued at $25,000 or more 
but less than $50,000;
    v. $100,000 with respect to a transaction valued at $50,000 or more 
but less than $100,000;
    vi. $170,000 with respect to a transaction valued at $100,000 or 
more but less than $170,000;
    vii. $250,000 with respect to a transaction valued at $170,000 or 
more, except that where the applicable schedule amount as defined above 
exceeds the statutory maximum civil penalty amount applicable to an 
apparent violation, the applicable schedule amount shall equal such 
statutory maximum civil penalty amount.
    C. OFAC means the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign 
Assets Control.
    D. Penalty is the final civil penalty amount imposed in a Penalty 
Notice.
    E. Proposed penalty is the civil penalty amount set forth in a Pre-
Penalty Notice.
    F. Regulator means any federal, state, local or foreign official or 
agency that has authority to license or examine an entity for compliance 
with federal, state, or foreign law.
    G. Subject Person means an individual or entity subject to any of 
the sanctions programs administered or enforced by OFAC.
    H. Transaction value means the dollar value of a subject 
transaction. In export and import cases, the transaction value generally 
will be the domestic value in the United States of the goods, 
technology, or services sought to be exported or imported into the 
United States, as demonstrated by commercial invoices, bills of lading, 
signed Customs declarations, or similar documents. In cases involving 
seizures by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the transaction 
value generally will be the domestic value as determined by CBP. If the 
apparent violation at issue is a prohibited dealing in blocked property 
by a Subject Person, the transaction value generally will be the dollar 
value of the underlying transaction involved, such as the value of the 
property dealt in or the amount of the funds transfer that a financial 
institution failed to block or reject. Where the transaction value is 
not otherwise ascertainable, OFAC may consider the market value of the 
goods or services that were the subject of the transaction, the economic 
benefit conferred on the sanctioned party, and/or the economic benefit 
derived by the Subject Person from the transaction in determining 
transaction value. For purposes of these Guidelines, ``transaction 
value'' will not necessarily have the same meaning, nor be applied in 
the same manner, as that term is used for import valuation purposes at 
19 CFR 152.103.
    I. Voluntary self-disclosure means self-initiated notification to 
OFAC of an apparent violation by a Subject Person that has committed, or 
otherwise participated in, an apparent violation of a statute, Executive 
order, or regulation administered or enforced by OFAC, prior to the time 
that OFAC, or any other federal, state or local government agency or 
official, discovers the apparent violation or another substantially 
similar apparent violation. For these purposes, ``substantially similar 
apparent violation'' means an apparent violation that is part of a 
series of similar apparent violations or is related to the same pattern 
or practice of conduct. Notification to OFAC of an apparent violation is 
not a voluntary self-disclosure if: a third party is required to notify 
OFAC of the apparent violation or a substantially similar apparent 
violation because a transaction was blocked or rejected by that

[[Page 85]]

third party (regardless of whether or when OFAC actually receives such 
notice from the third party and regardless of whether the Subject Person 
was aware of the third party's disclosure); the disclosure includes 
false or misleading information; the disclosure (when considered along 
with supplemental information provided by the Subject Person) is 
materially incomplete; the disclosure is not self-initiated (including 
when the disclosure results from a suggestion or order of a federal or 
state agency or official); or, when the Subject Person is an entity, the 
disclosure is made by an individual in a Subject Person entity without 
the authorization of the entity's senior management. Responding to an 
administrative subpoena or other inquiry from, or filing a license 
application with, OFAC is not a voluntary self-disclosure. In addition 
to notification, a voluntary self-disclosure must include, or be 
followed within a reasonable period of time by, a report of sufficient 
detail to afford a complete understanding of an apparent violation's 
circumstances, and should also be followed by responsiveness to any 
follow-up inquiries by OFAC. (As discussed further below, a Subject 
Person's level of cooperation with OFAC is an important factor in 
determining the appropriate enforcement response to an apparent 
violation even in the absence of a voluntary self-disclosure as defined 
herein; disclosure by a Subject Person generally will result in 
mitigation insofar as it represents cooperation with OFAC's 
investigation.)

              II. Types of Responses to Apparent Violations

    Depending on the facts and circumstances of a particular case, an 
OFAC investigation may lead to one or more of the following actions:
    A. No Action. If OFAC determines that there is insufficient evidence 
to conclude that a violation has occurred and/or, based on an analysis 
of the General Factors outlined in Section III of these Guidelines, 
concludes that the conduct or activity does not rise to a level 
warranting an administrative response, then no action will be taken. In 
those cases in which OFAC is aware that the Subject Person has knowledge 
of OFAC's investigation, OFAC generally will issue a letter to the 
Subject Person indicating that the investigation is being closed with no 
administrative action being taken. A no-action determination represents 
a final determination as to the apparent violation, unless OFAC later 
learns of additional related violations or other relevant facts.
    B. Request Additional Information. If OFAC determines that 
additional information regarding the apparent violation is needed, it 
may request further information from the Subject Person or third 
parties, including through an administrative subpoena issued pursuant to 
31 CFR Sec. 501.602. In the case of an institution subject to 
regulation where OFAC has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding 
(MOU) with the Subject Person's regulator, OFAC will follow the 
procedures set forth in such MOU regarding consultation with the 
regulator. Even in the absence of an MOU, OFAC may seek relevant 
information about a regulated institution and/or the conduct or activity 
constituting the apparent violation from the institution's federal, 
state, or foreign regulator. Upon receipt of information determined to 
be sufficient to assess the apparent violation, OFAC will decide, based 
on an analysis of the General Factors outlined in Section III of these 
Guidelines, whether to pursue further enforcement action or whether some 
other response to the apparent violation is appropriate.
    C. Cautionary Letter: If OFAC determines that there is insufficient 
evidence to conclude that a violation has occurred or that a finding of 
violation is not warranted under the circumstances, but believes that 
the underlying conduct could lead to a violation in other circumstances 
and/or that a Subject Person does not appear to be exercising due 
diligence in assuring compliance with the statutes, Executive orders, 
and regulations that OFAC enforces, OFAC may issue a cautionary letter 
that conveys its concerns about the underlying conduct and/or the 
Subject Person's OFAC compliance policies, practices and/or procedures. 
A cautionary letter represents a final enforcement response to the 
apparent violation, unless OFAC later learns of additional related 
violations or other relevant facts, but does not constitute a final 
agency determination as to whether a violation has occurred.
    D. Finding of Violation: If OFAC determines that a violation has 
occurred and considers it important to document the occurrence of a 
violation and, based on an analysis of the General Factors outlined in 
Section III of these Guidelines, concludes that the Subject Person's 
conduct warrants an administrative response but that a civil monetary 
penalty is not the most appropriate response, OFAC may issue a finding 
of violation that identifies the violation, conveys OFAC's concerns 
about the violation and/or the Subject Person's OFAC compliance 
policies, practices and/or procedures, and/or identifies the need for 
further compliance steps to be taken. A finding of violation represents 
a final enforcement response to the violation, unless OFAC later learns 
of additional related violations or other relevant facts, and 
constitutes a final agency determination that a violation has occurred. 
A finding of violation will afford the Subject Person an opportunity to 
respond to OFAC's determination that a violation has occurred.
    E. Civil Monetary Penalty. If OFAC determines that a violation has 
occurred and,

[[Page 86]]

based on an analysis of the General Factors outlined in Section III of 
these Guidelines, concludes that the Subject Person's conduct warrants 
the imposition of a monetary penalty, OFAC may impose a civil monetary 
penalty. Civil monetary penalty amounts will be determined as discussed 
in Section V of these Guidelines. The imposition of a civil monetary 
penalty constitutes a final agency determination that a violation has 
occurred and represents a final civil enforcement response to the 
violation.
    F. Criminal Referral. In appropriate circumstances, OFAC may refer 
the matter to appropriate law enforcement agencies for criminal 
investigation and/or prosecution. Apparent sanctions violations that 
OFAC has referred for criminal investigation and/or prosecution also may 
be subject to OFAC civil penalty or other administrative action.
    G. Other Administrative Actions. In addition to or in lieu of other 
administrative actions, OFAC may also take the following administrative 
actions in response to an apparent violation:
    1. License Denial, Suspension, Modification, or Revocation. OFAC 
authorizations to engage in a transaction (including the release of 
blocked funds) pursuant to a general or specific license may be 
withheld, denied, suspended, modified, or revoked in response to an 
apparent violation.
    2. Cease and Desist Order. OFAC may order the Subject Person to 
cease and desist from conduct or activities that are prohibited by any 
of the sanctions programs enforced by OFAC when OFAC has reason to 
believe that a Subject Person has engaged in such conduct or activities 
and/or that such conduct or activities are ongoing or may recur.

          III. General Factors Affecting Administrative Action

    The type of enforcement action undertaken by OFAC will depend on the 
nature of the apparent violation and the harm caused to the relevant 
sanctions program and its objectives. As a general matter, OFAC will 
consider some or all of the following General Factors in determining the 
appropriate administrative action in response to an apparent violation 
of U.S. sanctions by a Subject Person, and, where a civil monetary 
penalty is imposed, in determining the appropriate amount of any such 
penalty:
    A. Willful or Reckless Violation of Law: a Subject Person's 
willfulness or recklessness in violating, attempting to violate, 
conspiring to violate, or causing a violation of the law. Generally, to 
the extent the conduct, activity or transaction at issue is the result 
of willful misconduct or a deliberate intent to violate, attempt to 
violate, conspire to violate, or cause a violation of the law, the OFAC 
enforcement response will be stronger. Among the factors OFAC may 
consider in evaluating willfulness or recklessness are:
    1. Willfulness. Was the conduct at issue the result of a decision to 
take action with the knowledge that such action would constitute a 
violation of U.S. law? Did the Subject Person know that the underlying 
conduct constituted, or likely constituted, a violation of U.S. law at 
the time of the conduct?
    2. Recklessness. Did the Subject Person demonstrate reckless 
disregard for U.S. sanctions requirements or otherwise fail to exercise 
a minimal degree of caution or care in avoiding conduct, activities or 
transactions that led to the apparent violation? Were there warning 
signs that should have alerted the Subject Person that an action or 
failure to act would lead to an apparent violation?
    3. Concealment. Was there an effort by the Subject Person to hide or 
purposely obfuscate its conduct, activities or transactions in order to 
mislead OFAC, federal, state or foreign regulators, or other parties 
involved in the transaction/conduct about an apparent violation?
    4. Pattern of Misconduct. Was the apparent violation the result of a 
pattern or practice of conduct or was it relatively isolated and 
atypical in nature?
    5. Prior Notice. Was the Subject Person on notice, or should it 
reasonably have been on notice, that the conduct at issue, or similar 
conduct, constituted a violation of U.S. law?
    6. Management Involvement. In cases of entities, at what level 
within the organization did the willful or reckless misconduct occur? 
Were supervisory or managerial level staff aware, or should they 
reasonably have been aware, of the willful or reckless misconduct?
    B. Awareness of Conduct at Issue: The Subject Person's awareness of 
the conduct, activity or transaction giving rise to the apparent 
violation. Generally, the greater a Subject Person's actual knowledge 
of, or reason to know about, the conduct, activity, or transaction 
constituting an apparent violation, the stronger the OFAC enforcement 
response will be. In the case of a corporation, awareness will focus on 
supervisory or managerial level staff in the business unit at issue, as 
well as other senior officers and managers. Among the factors OFAC may 
consider in evaluating the Subject Person's awareness of the conduct at 
issue are:
    1. Actual Knowledge. Did the Subject Person have actual knowledge 
that the conduct, activity, or transaction giving rise to an apparent 
violation took place? Was the conduct, activity, or transaction part of 
a business process, structure or arrangement that was designed or 
implemented with the intent to prevent or shield the Subject Person from 
having such actual knowledge, or was the conduct, activity, or 
transaction part of a business process, structure or arrangement 
implemented for other legitimate reasons

[[Page 87]]

that made it difficult or impossible for the Subject Person to have 
actual knowledge?
    2. Reason to Know. If the Subject Person did not have actual 
knowledge that the conduct, activity, or transaction took place, did the 
Subject Person have reason to know, or should the Subject Person 
reasonably have known, based on all readily available information and 
with the exercise of reasonable due diligence, that the conduct, 
activity, or transaction would or might take place?
    3. Management Involvement. In the case of an entity, was the 
conduct, activity or transaction undertaken with the explicit or 
implicit knowledge of senior management, or was the conduct, activity, 
or transaction undertaken by personnel outside the knowledge of senior 
management? If the apparent violation was undertaken without the 
knowledge of senior management, was there oversight intended to detect 
and prevent violations, or did the lack of knowledge by senior 
management result from disregard for its responsibility to comply with 
applicable sanctions laws?
    C. Harm to Sanctions Program Objectives: The actual or potential 
harm to sanctions program objectives caused by the conduct, activities, 
or transactions giving rise to the apparent violation. Among the factors 
OFAC may consider in evaluating the harm to sanctions program objectives 
are:
    1. Economic or Other Benefit to the Sanctioned Individual, Entity, 
or Country: The economic or other benefit conferred or attempted to be 
conferred to sanctioned individuals, entities, or countries as a result 
of an apparent violation, including the number, size, and impact of the 
transactions or incidents constituting an apparent violation(s), the 
length of time over which they occurred, and the nature of the economic 
or other benefit conferred. OFAC may also consider the causal link 
between the Subject Person's conduct and the economic benefit conferred 
or attempted to be conferred.
    2. Implications for U.S. Policy: The effect that the circumstances 
of the apparent violation had on the integrity of the U.S. sanctions 
program and the related policy objectives involved.
    3. License Eligibility: Whether the conduct constituting the 
apparent violation likely would have been licensed by OFAC under 
existing licensing policy.
    4. Humanitarian activity: Whether the conduct at issue was in 
support of a humanitarian activity.
    D. Individual Characteristics: The particular circumstances and 
characteristics of a Subject Person. Among the factors OFAC may consider 
in evaluating individual characteristics are:
    1. Commercial Sophistication: The commercial sophistication and 
experience of the Subject Person. Is the Subject Person an individual or 
an entity? If an individual, was the transaction constituting the 
apparent violation conducted for personal or business reasons?
    2. Size of Operations and Financial Condition: The size of a Subject 
Person's business operations and overall financial condition may be 
considered, where such information is available and relevant. 
Qualification of the Subject Person as a small business or organization 
for the purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness 
Act, as determined by reference to the applicable regulations of the 
Small Business Administration, may also be considered.
    3. Volume of Transactions: The total volume of transactions 
undertaken by the Subject Person on an annual basis, with attention 
given to the apparent violations as compared with the total volume.
    4. Sanctions Violation History: The Subject Person's history of 
sanctions violations, including OFAC's issuance of prior findings of 
violations or cautionary, warning or evaluative letters, or other 
administrative actions.
    E. Compliance Program: The existence and nature of a Subject 
Person's OFAC compliance program at the time of the apparent violation, 
where relevant. In the case of an institution subject to regulation 
where OFAC has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the 
Subject Person's regulator, OFAC will follow the procedures set forth in 
such MOU regarding consultation with the regulator with regard to the 
quality and effectiveness of the Subject Person's compliance program. 
Even in the absence of an MOU, OFAC may take into consideration the 
views of federal, state, or foreign regulators, where relevant.
    F. Remedial Response: The Subject Person's corrective action taken 
in response to the apparent violation. Among the factors OFAC may 
consider in evaluating the remedial response are:
    1. The steps taken by the Subject Person upon learning of the 
apparent violation. Did the Subject Person immediately stop the conduct 
at issue?
    2. In the case of an entity, the processes followed to resolve 
issues related to the apparent violation. Did the Subject Person 
discover necessary information to ascertain the causes and extent of the 
apparent violation, fully and expeditiously? Where applicable, were the 
Audit Committee and the Board of Directors fully informed? If so, when?
    3. In the case of an entity, whether the Subject Person adopted new 
and more effective internal controls and procedures to prevent a 
recurrence of the apparent violation. If the Subject Person did not have 
an OFAC compliance program in place at the time of the apparent 
violation, did it implement one upon discovery or notification of the 
violations? If it did have an OFAC compliance program, did it take 
appropriate steps to enhance the program to prevent the recurrence

[[Page 88]]

of similar violations? Did the entity provide the individual(s) 
responsible for the apparent violation with additional training, and/or 
take other appropriate action, to ensure that similar violations do not 
occur in the future?
    4. Where applicable, whether the Subject Person undertook a thorough 
review to identify other possible violations.
    G. Cooperation with OFAC: The nature and extent of the Subject 
Person's cooperation with OFAC. Among the factors OFAC may consider in 
evaluating cooperation with OFAC are:
    1. Did the Subject Person voluntarily self-disclose the apparent 
violation to OFAC?
    2. Did the Subject Person provide OFAC with all relevant information 
regarding an apparent violation (whether or not voluntarily self-
disclosed)?
    3. Did the Subject Person research and disclose to OFAC relevant 
information regarding any other apparent violations caused by the same 
course of conduct?
    4. Was information provided voluntarily or in response to an 
administrative subpoena?
    5. Did the Subject Person cooperate with, and promptly respond to, 
all requests for information?
    6. Did the Subject Person agree to a statute of limitations waiver 
or tolling agreement, if requested by OFAC (particularly in situations 
where the apparent violations were not immediately notified to or 
discovered by OFAC)?
    H. Timing of apparent violation in relation to imposition of 
sanctions: The timing of the apparent violation in relation to the 
adoption of the applicable prohibitions, particularly if the apparent 
violation took place soon after relevant changes in the sanctions 
program regulations or the addition of a new name to OFAC's List of 
Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List).
    I. Other enforcement action: Other enforcement actions taken by 
federal, state, or local agencies against the Subject Person for the 
apparent violation or similar apparent violations, including whether the 
settlement of alleged violations of OFAC regulations is part of a 
comprehensive settlement with other federal, state, or local agencies.
    J. Future Compliance/Deterrence Effect: The impact administrative 
action may have on promoting future compliance with U.S. economic 
sanctions by the Subject Person and similar Subject Persons, 
particularly those in the same industry sector.
    K. Other relevant factors on a case-by-case basis: Such other 
factors that OFAC deems relevant on a case-by-case basis in determining 
the appropriate enforcement response and/or the amount of any civil 
monetary penalty. OFAC will consider the totality of the circumstances 
to ensure that its enforcement response is proportionate to the nature 
of the violation.

 IV. Civil Penalties for Failure to Furnish Information or Keep Records

    Except in the instance of authorized service providers under the 
Cuban Assets Control Regulations, for whom enforcement guidelines appear 
in the Service Provider Program Circular periodically issued by OFAC, as 
a general matter the following civil penalty amounts shall apply to a 
Subject Person's failure to furnish information or maintain records:
    A. The failure to respond to a requirement to furnish information 
pursuant to 31 CFR 501.602, or failure to furnish the requested 
information, may result in a penalty in an amount up to $20,000, 
irrespective of whether any other violation is alleged. Where OFAC has 
reason to believe that the apparent violation(s) that is the subject of 
the request to furnish information involves a transaction(s) valued at 
greater than $500,000, a failure to respond to a request to furnish 
information or failure to furnish the requested information may result 
in a penalty in an amount up to $50,000, irrespective of whether any 
other violation is alleged. A failure to respond to a requirement to 
furnish information or a failure to furnish the requested information 
shall be considered a continuing violation, and the penalties described 
above may be imposed each month that a party has continued to fail to 
respond or to furnish the requested information. OFAC may also seek to 
have a requirement to furnish information judicially enforced. 
Imposition of a civil monetary penalty for failure to respond to a 
requirement to furnish information or a failure to furnish the requested 
information does not preclude OFAC from seeking such judicial 
enforcement.
    B. The late filing of a required report, whether set forth in 
regulations or in a specific license, may result in a civil monetary 
penalty in an amount up to $2,500, if filed within the first 30 days 
after the report is due, and a penalty in an amount up to $5,000 if 
filed more than 30 days after the report is due. If the report relates 
to blocked assets, the penalty may include an additional $1,000 for 
every 30 days that the report is overdue, up to five years.
    C. The first failure to maintain records in conformance with the 
requirements of OFAC's regulations or of a specific license may result 
in a penalty in an amount up to $5,000. Each additional violation in 
this regard may result in a penalty in an amount up to $10,000.

                           V. Civil Penalties

    OFAC will review the facts and circumstances surrounding an apparent 
violation and apply the General Factors for Taking Administrative Action 
in Section III above in determining whether to initiate a civil penalty 
proceeding and in determining

[[Page 89]]

the amount of any civil monetary penalty. OFAC will give careful 
consideration to the appropriateness of issuing a cautionary letter or 
finding of violation in lieu of the imposition of a civil monetary 
penalty.

                        A. Civil Penalty Process

    1. Pre-Penalty Notice. If OFAC has reason to believe that a 
violation of U.S. sanctions has occurred and that a civil monetary 
penalty is warranted, it will issue a Pre-Penalty Notice in accordance 
with the procedures set forth in the particular regulations governing 
the conduct, activity, or transactions giving rise to the apparent 
violation. The amount of the proposed penalty set forth in the Pre-
Penalty Notice will reflect OFAC's preliminary assessment of the 
appropriate penalty amount, based on information then in OFAC's 
possession. The amount of the final penalty may change as OFAC learns 
additional relevant information. If, after issuance of a Pre-Penalty 
Notice, OFAC determines that a penalty in an amount that represents an 
increase of more than 10 percent from the proposed penalty set forth in 
the Pre-Penalty Notice is appropriate, or if OFAC intends to allege 
additional violations, it will issue a revised Pre-Penalty Notice 
setting forth the new proposed penalty amount and/or alleged violations.
    a. In general, the Pre-Penalty Notice will set forth the following 
with respect to the specific violations alleged and the proposed 
penalties:
    i. Description of the alleged violations, including the number of 
violations and their value, for which a penalty is being proposed;
    ii. Identification of the regulatory or other provisions alleged to 
have been violated;
    iii. Identification of the General Factors that were most relevant 
to the determination of the proposed penalty amount, including the base 
category (defined below) according to which the proposed penalty amount 
was calculated;
    iv. The maximum amount of the penalty to which the Subject Person 
could be subject under applicable law; and
    v. The proposed penalty amount, determined in accordance with the 
provisions set forth in these Guidelines.
    b. The Pre-Penalty Notice will also include information regarding 
how to respond to the Pre-Penalty Notice including:
    i. A statement that the Subject Person may submit a written response 
to the Pre-Penalty Notice by a date certain addressing the alleged 
violation(s), the General Factors Affecting Administrative Action set 
forth in Section III of these Guidelines, and any other information or 
evidence that the Subject Person deems relevant to OFAC's consideration.
    ii. A statement that a failure to respond to the Pre-Penalty Notice 
likely will result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty in the 
amount set forth in the Pre-Penalty Notice.
    2. Response to Pre-Penalty Notice. A Subject Person may submit a 
written response to the Pre-Penalty Notice in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in the particular regulations governing the 
conduct, activity or transactions giving rise to the apparent violation. 
Generally, the response should either agree to the proposed penalty set 
forth in the Pre-Penalty Notice or set forth reasons why a penalty 
should not be imposed or, if imposed, why it should be a lesser amount 
than proposed, with particular attention paid to the General Factors 
Affecting Administrative Action set forth in Section III of these 
Guidelines. The response should include all documentary or other 
evidence available to the Subject Person that supports the arguments set 
forth in the response. OFAC will consider all relevant materials 
submitted.
    3. Penalty Notice. If OFAC receives no response to a Pre-Penalty 
Notice within the time prescribed in the Pre-Penalty Notice, or if 
following the receipt of a response to a Pre-Penalty Notice and a review 
of the information and evidence contained therein OFAC concludes that a 
violation warranting a civil monetary penalty has occurred, a Penalty 
Notice generally will be issued in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in the particular regulations governing the conduct, activity or 
transactions giving rise to the violation. A Penalty Notice constitutes 
a final agency finding that a violation has occurred. The penalty amount 
set forth in the Penalty Notice will take into account relevant 
additional information provided in response to a Pre-Penalty Notice. In 
the absence of a response to a Pre-Penalty Notice, the penalty amount 
set forth in the Penalty Notice will generally be the same as the 
proposed penalty set forth in the Pre-Penalty Notice.
    4. Referral to Financial Management Division. The imposition of a 
civil monetary penalty pursuant to a Penalty Notice creates a debt due 
the U.S. Government. OFAC will advise Treasury's Financial Management 
Division upon the imposition of a penalty. The Financial Management 
Division may take follow-up action to collect the penalty assessed if it 
is not paid within the prescribed time period set forth in the Penalty 
Notice. In addition or instead, the matter may be referred to the U.S. 
Department of Justice for appropriate action to recover the penalty.
    5. Final Agency Action. The imposition of a penalty pursuant to a 
Penalty Notice constitutes final agency action with respect to the 
violation(s) for which the penalty is assessed.

[[Page 90]]

                       B. Amount of Civil Penalty

    1. Egregious case. In those cases in which a civil monetary penalty 
is deemed appropriate, OFAC will make a determination as to whether a 
case is deemed ``egregious'' for purposes of the base penalty 
calculation. This determination will be based on an analysis of the 
applicable General Factors. In making the egregiousness determination, 
OFAC generally will give substantial weight to General Factors A 
(``willful or reckless violation of law''), B (``awareness of conduct at 
issue''), C (``harm to sanctions program objectives'') and D 
(``individual characteristics''), with particular emphasis on General 
Factors A and B. A case will be considered an ``egregious case'' where 
the analysis of the applicable General Factors, with a focus on those 
General Factors identified above, indicates that the case represents a 
particularly serious violation of the law calling for a strong 
enforcement response. A determination that a case is ``egregious'' will 
be made by the Director or Deputy Director.
    2. Pre-Penalty Notice. The penalty amount proposed in a Pre-Penalty 
Notice shall generally be calculated as follows, except that neither the 
base amount nor the proposed penalty will exceed the applicable 
statutory maximum amount:
    a. Base category calculation
    i. In a non-egregious case, if the apparent violation is disclosed 
through a voluntary self-disclosure by the Subject Person, the base 
amount of the proposed civil penalty in the Pre-Penalty Notice shall be 
one-half of the transaction value, capped at a maximum base amount of 
$125,000 per violation.
    ii. In a non-egregious case, if the apparent violation comes to 
OFAC's attention by means other than a voluntary self-disclosure, the 
base amount of the proposed civil penalty in the Pre-Penalty Notice 
shall be the ``applicable schedule amount,'' as defined above (capped at 
a maximum base amount of $250,000 per violation).
    iii. In an egregious case, if the apparent violation is disclosed 
through a voluntary self-disclosure by a Subject Person, the base amount 
of the proposed civil penalty in the Pre-Penalty Notice shall be one-
half the statutory maximum penalty applicable to the violation.
    iv. In an egregious case, if the apparent violation comes to OFAC's 
attention by means other than a voluntary self-disclosure, the base 
amount of the proposed civil monetary penalty in the Pre-Penalty Notice 
shall be the statutory maximum penalty amount applicable to the 
violation.
    The following matrix represents the base amount of the proposed 
civil penalty for each category of violation:

[[Page 91]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR08SE08.003

    The base penalty amount will not exceed the applicable statutory 
maximum amount.
    b. Adjustment for applicable relevant General Factors
    The base amount of the proposed civil penalty may be adjusted to 
reflect applicable General Factors for Administrative Action set forth 
in Section III of these Guidelines. Each factor may be considered 
mitigating or aggravating, resulting in a lower or higher proposed 
penalty amount. As a general matter, in those cases where the following 
General Factors are present, OFAC will adjust the base proposed penalty 
amount in the following manner:
    i. In cases involving substantial cooperation with OFAC but no 
voluntary self-disclosure as defined herein, including cases in which an 
apparent violation is reported to OFAC by a third party but the Subject 
Person provides substantial additional information regarding the 
apparent violation and/or other related violations, the base penalty 
amount generally will be reduced between 25 and 40 percent. Substantial 
cooperation in cases involving voluntary self-disclosure may also be 
considered as a further mitigating factor.
    ii. In cases involving a Subject Person's first violation, the base 
penalty amount generally will be reduced up to 25 percent. The extent of 
any such mitigation will be based, in part, on whether the Subject 
Person had previously been issued a cautionary, warning or evaluative 
letter.
    In all cases, the proposed penalty amount will not exceed the 
applicable statutory maximum.
    In cases involving a large number of apparent violations, where the 
transaction value of all apparent violations is either unknown or would 
require a disproportionate allocation of resources to determine, OFAC 
may estimate or extrapolate the transaction value of the total universe 
of apparent violations in determining the amount of any proposed civil 
monetary penalty.
    3. Penalty Notice. The amount of the proposed civil penalty in the 
Pre-Penalty Notice will be the presumptive starting point for 
calculation of the civil penalty amount in the Penalty Notice. OFAC may 
adjust the penalty amount in the Penalty Notice based on:
    a. Evidence presented by the Subject Person in response to the Pre-
Penalty Notice, or otherwise received by OFAC with respect to the 
underlying violation(s); and/or
    b. Any modification resulting from further review and 
reconsideration by OFAC of the

[[Page 92]]

proposed civil monetary penalty in light of the General Factors for 
Administrative Action in Section III above.
    In no event will the amount of the civil monetary penalty in the 
Penalty Notice exceed the proposed penalty set forth in the Pre-Penalty 
Notice by more than 10 percent, or include additional alleged 
violations, unless a revised Pre-Penalty Notice has first been sent to 
the Subject Person as set forth above. In the event that OFAC determines 
upon further review that no penalty is appropriate, it will so inform 
the Subject Person in a no-action letter, a cautionary letter, or a 
finding of violation.

                             C. Settlements

    A settlement does not constitute a final agency determination that a 
violation has occurred.
    1. Settlement Process. Settlement discussions may be initiated by 
OFAC, the Subject Person or the Subject Person's authorized 
representative. Settlements generally will be negotiated in accordance 
with the principles set forth in these Guidelines with respect to 
appropriate penalty amounts. OFAC may condition the entry into or 
continuation of settlement negotiations on the execution of a tolling 
agreement with respect to the statute of limitations.
    2. Settlement Prior to Issuance of Pre-Penalty Notice. Where 
settlement discussions occur prior to the issuance of a Pre-Penalty 
Notice, the Subject Person may request in writing that OFAC withhold 
issuance of a Pre-Penalty Notice pending the conclusion of settlement 
discussions. OFAC will generally agree to such a request as long as 
settlement discussions are continuing in good faith and the statute of 
limitations is not at risk of expiring.
    3. Settlement Following Issuance of Pre-Penalty Notice. If a matter 
is settled after a Pre-Penalty Notice has been issued, but before a 
final Penalty Notice is issued, OFAC will not make a final determination 
as to whether a sanctions violation has occurred. In the event no 
settlement is reached, the period specified for written response to the 
Pre-Penalty Notice remains in effect unless additional time is granted 
by OFAC.
    4. Settlements of Multiple Apparent Violations. A settlement 
initiated for one apparent violation may also involve a comprehensive or 
global settlement of multiple apparent violations covered by other Pre-
Penalty Notices, apparent violations for which a Pre-Penalty Notice has 
not yet been issued by OFAC, or previously unknown apparent violations 
reported to OFAC during the pendency of an investigation of an apparent 
violation.

transportation, importation, exportation, or withdrawal of, or the 
endorsement or guaranty of signatures on or otherwise dealing in any

<R05>
Sec. 515.203  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

    (a) Any transfer after the ``effective date'' which is in violation 
of any provision of this part or of any regulation, ruling, instruction, 
license, or other direction or authorization thereunder and involves any 
property in which a designated national has or has had an interest since 
such ``effective date'' is null and void and shall not be the basis for 
the assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power 
or privilege with respect to such property.
    (b) No transfer before the ``effective date'' shall be the basis for 
the assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege 
with respect to, or interest in, any property in which a designated 
national has or has had an interest since the ``effective date'' unless 
the person with whom such property is held or maintained had written 
notice of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such 
transfer prior to such ``effective date.''
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Secretary of the Treasury before, during or after a transfer shall

    (d) Transfers of property which otherwise would be null and void, or

provisions, as to any person with whom such property was held or 
maintained (and as to such person only) in cases in which such person is

    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property was held 
or maintained;
    (2) The person with whom such property was held or maintained did 
not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts 
and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer 
required a license or authorization by or pursuant to the provisions of 
this part and was not so licensed or authorized or if a license or 
authorization did purport to cover the transfer, that such license or 
authorization had been obtained by misrepresentation or the withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) Promptly upon discovery that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or 
any regulation, ruling, instruction, license or other direction or 
authorization thereunder, or
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Secretary 
of the Treasury, or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation or the withholding of material 
facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained;

the person with whom such property was held or maintained filed with the 
Treasury Department, Washington, D.C., a report in triplicate setting 
forth in full the circumstances relating to such transfer. The filing of 
a report in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph shall not 
be deemed to be compliance or evidence of compliance with paragraphs (d) 
(1) and (2) of this section.
    (e) Unless licensed or authorized by Sec. 515.504 or otherwise 
licensed or authorized pursuant to this chapter any attachment, 
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial

in paragraph (h) of this section is prohibited from holding, 
withholding, using, transferring, engaging in any transactions

any such property, unless it is held in an interest-bearing account in a

of paragraph (a) of this section which, as of the effective date of this 
section, is not being held in accordance with the provisions of that

for collection or payment such instruments and credit the proceeds to 
interest-bearing accounts. Any transaction by any person incident to the 
negotiation, processing. presentment, collection or payment of such

    (2) The proceeds are held in a blocked account indicating the 
designated national who is the payee or owner of the instrument; and,
    (3) In the case of a blocked check or draft which has been purchased

order, or traveler's check) or which is drawn against a presently 
existing account, such bank, on presentment of the instrument in

property in a domestic bank shall not be less than the maximum rate

from the prohibitions and regulations of this part except for payments 
owed to Cuba for telecommunications services between Cuba and the United 
States, which are subject to the provisions of Sec. 515.542.
    (2) This section does not authorize transactions related to 
information or informational materials not fully created and in 
existence at the date of the transaction, or to the substantive or 
artistic alteration or enhancement of information or informational 
materials, or to the provision of marketing and business consulting 
services by a person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. 
Such prohibited

[[Page 100]]

transactions include, without limitation, payment of advances for 
information or informational materials not yet created and completed, 
provision of services to market, produce or co-produce, create or assist 
in the creation of information or informational materials, and payment 
of royalties to a designated national with respect to income received 
for enhancements or alterations made by persons subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States to information or informational 
materials imported from a designated national.
    (3) This section does not authorize transactions incident to the 
transmission of restricted technical data as defined in the Export 
Administration Regulations, 15 CFR parts 730-774, or to the exportation 
of goods for use in the transmission of any data. The exportation of 
such goods to designated foreign countries is prohibited, as provided in 
Sec. 515.201 of this part and Sec. 785.1 of the Export Administration 
Regulations.
    (4) This section does not authorize transactions related to travel 
to Cuba when such travel is not otherwise authorized under Sec. 
515.545.

    Example #1: A U.S. publisher ships 500 copies of a book to Cuba 
directly from Miami aboard a chartered aircraft, and receives payment by 
means of a letter of credit issued by a Cuban bank and confirmed by an 
American bank. These are permissible transactions under this section.
    Example #2: A Cuban party exports a single master copy of a Cuban 
motion picture to a U.S. party and licenses the U.S. party to duplicate, 
distribute, show and exploit in the United States the Cuban film in any 
medium, including home video distribution, for five years, with the 
Cuban party receiving 40% of the net income. All transactions relating 
to the activities described in this example are authorized under this 
section or Sec. 515.545.
    Example #3: A U.S. recording company proposes to contract with a 
Cuban musician to create certain musical compositions, and to advance 
royalties of $10,000 to the musician. The music written in Cuba is to be 
recorded in a studio that the recording company owns in the Bahamas. 
These are all prohibited transactions. The U.S. party is prohibited 
under Sec. 515.201 from contracting for the Cuban musician's services, 
from transferring $10,000 to Cuba to pay for those services, and from 
providing the Cuban with production services through the use of its 
studio in the Bahamas. No information or informational materials are in 
being at the time of these proposed transactions. However, the U.S. 
recording company may contract to purchase and import preexisting 
recordings by the Cuban musician, or to copy the recordings in the 
United States and pay negotiated royalties to Cuba under this section or 
Sec. 515.545.
    Example #4: A Cuban party enters into a subpublication agreement 
licensing a U.S. party to print and publish copies of a musicial 
composition and to sub-license rights of public performance, adaptation, 
and arrangement of the musical composition, with payment to be a 
percentage of income received. All transactions related to the 
activities described in this example are authorized under this section 
and Sec. 515.545, except for adaptation, and arrangement, which 
constitute artistic enhancement of the Cuban composition. Payment to the 
Cuban party may not reflect income received as a result of these 
enhancements.

    (b) Donation of food. The prohibitions contained in this part do not 
apply to transactions incident to the donation of food to 
nongovernmental organizations or individuals in Cuba.

<R05>
Sec. 515.505  Certain Cuban nationals unblocked; transactions of Cuban 
nationals paroled into the United States.

    (a) General license unblocking certain persons. The following 
persons are licensed as unblocked nationals, as that term is defined in 
Sec. 515.307 of this part:
    (1) Any individual who:
    (i) Has taken up residence in the United States;
    (ii) Is a United States citizen, a permanent resident alien of the 
United States, or has applied to become a permanent resident alien of 
the United States and has an adjustment of status application pending; 
and
    (iii) Is not a specially designated national; and
    (2) Any entity that otherwise would be a national of Cuba solely 
because of the interest therein of an individual licensed in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section as an unblocked national.

    Note to paragraph (a): An individual unblocked pursuant to this 
paragraph does not become blocked again by leaving the United States 
unless he or she becomes domiciled or a permanent national of Cuba or 
otherwise becomes a specially designated national.

    (b) Specific licenses unblocking individuals permanently resident in 
third countries. Individual nationals of Cuba who have taken up 
permanent residence in the authorized trade territory may apply to the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control to be specifically licensed as 
unblocked nationals. Applications for specific licenses under this 
paragraph should include at least two of the following documents issued 
by the government authorities of the new country of permanent residence: 
Passport; voter registration card; permanent resident alien card; or 
national identity card. Other documents tending to show residency, such 
as income tax returns, also may be submitted in support of government 
documentation, but are not themselves sufficient.

    Note to paragraph (b): An individual unblocked pursuant to this 
paragraph does not become blocked again by leaving the United States 
unless he or she becomes domiciled or a permanent national of Cuba or 
otherwise becomes a specially designated national.

    (c) General license authorizing certain transactions of individuals 
paroled into the United States. An individual national of Cuba who has 
been paroled into the United States is authorized to engage in all 
transactions available to unblocked nationals, as that term is defined 
in Sec. 515.307 of this part, except that all property in which the 
individual has an interest and that was blocked pursuant to this part 
prior to the date on which parole was granted shall remain blocked. Such 
an individual is further authorized to withdraw a total amount not to 
exceed $250 in any one calendar month from any blocked accounts held in 
the individual's name.
    (d) The licensing of any person pursuant to this section shall not 
suspend the requirements of any section of this chapter relating to the 
maintenance or production of records.
    (e) The following examples illustrate the application of this 
section:

    (1) Example 1: A national of Cuba with a blocked U.S. bank account 
receives a U.S immigration visa. Upon arrival in the United States, she 
is issued a permanent resident alien card and thereby is licensed as an 
unblocked national pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. She can 
apply immediately to OFAC for a specific license to have her bank 
account unblocked.
    (2) Example 2: A national of Cuba with a blocked U.S. bank account 
arrives in the United States without a valid visa and is paroled into 
the United States. One year later, he applies for and receives permanent 
resident alien status. From the date he is paroled into the United 
States until the date he applies for permanent resident alien status, he 
qualifies for the general license contained in paragraph (c) of this 
section. During this time he can engage in all transactions as if he is 
an unblocked national, but he cannot gain access to his blocked bank 
account other than to withdraw $250 each month. Beginning with his 
application to become a permanent resident alien, he is licensed as an 
unblocked national pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. At this 
time, he can apply to OFAC for a specific license to have his bank 
account unblocked.
    (3) Example 3: A national of Cuba with a blocked U.S. bank account 
arrives in the United States on a temporary visa valid for

[[Page 111]]

six months. After her visa expires, she remains in the United States for 
an additional six months and then applies to become a permanent resident 
alien. She has an adjustment of status application pending until she 
receives permanent resident alien status one year later. From her 
arrival in the United States until her application for permanent 
resident alien status, she does not qualify for any of the 
authorizations contained in this section. Instead, she is authorized by 
Sec. 515.571 only to engage in transactions ordinarily incident to her 
travel and maintenance in the United States and to withdraw $250 each 
month from her blocked account to cover her living expenses. Beginning 
with her application to become a permanent resident alien, she is 
licensed as an unblocked national pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section. At this time, she can apply to OFAC for a specific license to 
have her bank account unblocked.

    Note to Sec. 515.505: See Sec. 515.571 for the authorization of 
certain limited transactions incident to travel to, from, and within the 
United States by Cuban nationals who enter the United States on a non-
immigrant visa or other non-immigrant travel authorization issued by the 
State Department.

are not tied to specific exports or reexports, such as transactions 
involving future (non-specific) shipments, must be separately licensed 
by OFAC. For the waiver of the prohibitions on entry into U.S. ports 
contained in Sec. 515.207 for vessels transporting shipments of items 
between the United States and Cuba pursuant to this section, see Sec. 
515.550.

    (b) Persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States are 
authorized to engage in all transactions ordinarily incident to 
negotiation of and entry into executory contracts for the sale of items 
that may be exported from the United States to Cuba or 100% U.S.-origin 
items that may be reexported from a third country to Cuba consistent 
with the export licensing policy of the Department of Commerce, provided 
that performance of such executory contracts is expressly made 
contingent on the prior authorization by the Department of Commerce.

    Note to paragraph (b): This paragraph does not authorize 
transactions related to travel to, from, or within Cuba. See paragraph 
(e) for a statement of specific licensing policy with respect to such 
transactions.

    (c) This section does not authorize:
    (1) The financing of any transactions from any blocked account.
    (2) Any transaction involving, directly or indirectly, property in 
which any designated national, other than a person located in the 
country to which the exportation or reexportation is consigned, has an 
interest or has had an interest since the effective date set forth in 
Sec. 515.201 of this part.
    (d) In addition to those transactions authorized pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section, all transactions ordinarily incident to 
the processing of payments received for items exported from the United 
States to any person within Cuba are authorized, provided that:
    (1) The exportation is licensed or otherwise authorized by the 
Department of Commerce under the provisions of the Export Administration 
Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401-2420) (see the Export 
Administration Regulations, 15 CFR 730-774);
    (2) The items are shipped from the port at which they are loaded on 
or before March 24, 2005; and
    (3) Payment is received by a U.S. banking institution on or before

authorizing the travel-related transactions set forth in Sec. 
515.560(c) and other transactions that are directly incident to the 
marketing, sales negotiation, accompanied delivery, or servicing of 
exports that appear consistent with the export or re-export licensing 
policy of the Department of Commerce.

proper authorization. Paragraph (a) of this section does not authorize 
the purchase or importation of any merchandise.
    (c) The purchase outside the United States for importation into the 
United States of nickel-bearing materials presumptively subject to Sec.

Sec. 515.543  Proof of origin.

    Specific licenses for importation of goods of Cuban origin are 
generally not issued unless the applicant submits satisfactory 
documentary proof of the location of the goods outside Cuba prior to 
July 8, 1963 and of the absence of any Cuban interest in the goods at 
all times on or since that date. Since the type of document which would 
constitute satisfactory proof varies depending upon the facts of the 
particular case, it is not possible to state in advance the type of 
documents required. However, it has been found that affidavits, 
statements, invoices, and other documents prepared by manufacturers, 
processors, sellers or shippers cannot be relied on and are therefore 
not by themselves accepted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control as 
satisfactory proof of origin. Independent corroborating documentary 
evidence, such as insurance documents, bills of lading, etc., may be 
accepted as satisfactory proof.

July 8, 1963, any direct or indirect financial or commercial benefit to 
Cuba or nationals thereof from the importation.

licenses are issued unblocking only that amount with respect to which 
the applicant is able to prove beneficial ownership by documentary 
evidence independent of his assertions of interest.
    (2) Joint bank account, with survivorship provisions. Specific 
licenses are issued unblocking an amount equivalent to that portion of 
the total amount to which the applicant would be entitled if the total 
were divided evenly among the persons in whose names the account is held 
(e.g. 50 percent where there are two names; 33\1/3\ percent where there 
are three names). Such licenses generally are issued on the basis of 
applicant's assertions of beneficial ownership interest without the 
requirement of independent evidence.
    (3) Joint bank account in the names of a husband and wife, with 
survivorship provision. Specific licenses are issued unblocking portions 
of such accounts blocked by reason of the residence of one spouse in 
Cuba in favor of the non-blocked spouse under the policy stated in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section. However, if 50 percent of the account 
has been unblocked under that policy, and the spouse who is the blocked 
Cuban

license unblocking the remainder of the assets under Sec. 515.522.

an unblocked national exists in that portion of the funds to which the 
applicant is entitled.
    (b) Applications for specific licenses under this section must 
include all of the following information:
    (1) Proof of permanent residence in the United States or the 
authorized trade territory, to be established by the submission of 
documentation issued by relevant government authorities that must 
include at least two of the following documents:
    (i) Passport;
    (ii) Voter registration card;
    (iii) Permanent resident alien card; or
    (iv) National identity card.

Other documents tending to show residency, such as income tax returns, 
may also be submitted in support of government documentation, but will 
not suffice in and of themselves;
    (2) Proof of entitlement under the insurance policy to be 
established by a copy of the policy and an affidavit from an appropriate 
officer of a recognized insurance company acknowledging the legitimacy 
of the beneficiary's claim and the amount of the payment; and
    (c) Any document provided pursuant to this section that is not 
written in the English language must be accompanied by a translation 
into English, as well as a certification by the translator that he is 
not an interested party to the proceeding, is qualified to make the 
translation, and has made an accurate translation of the document in

property.
    (b) Specific licenses are issued authorizing the transfer of blocked 
property, pursuant to the laws of the State governing abandoned

laws are custodial in nature, i.e., there is no permanent transfer of 
beneficial interest to the State. Licenses require the property to be 
held by the State in accounts which are identified as blocked under the 
regulations. A separate index of these blocked assets is required to be 
maintained by the State agency. The requirements of this section for 
identification and separate indexing of blocked assets apply to all 
blocked assets held by State agencies and any licenses issued prior to 
the effective date of this section hereby are amended by the 
incorporation of such requirements.
    (c) To be eligible for a specific license under this section, the 
state agency must demonstrate that it has the statutory authority under 
appropriate state law to comply with the requirements of Sec. 515.205.

OFAC;
    (3) The date of issuance of the applicant's most recent specific

transactions set forth in Sec. 515.560(c) and additional travel-related 
transactions that are directly incident to the purpose of visiting a 
member of the person's immediate family who is not a national of Cuba, 
as that term is defined in Sec. 515.302 of this part, in Cuba in 
exigent circumstances, provided the person to be visited is in Cuba 
pursuant to an OFAC authorization, the particular exigency has been 
reported to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, and issuance of the 
license would support the mission of the U.S. Interests Section in 
Havana.

in Sec. 515.560(c) and such additional transactions that are directly

    (i) The research is of a noncommercial, academic nature;
    (ii) The research comprises a full work schedule in Cuba;
    (iii) The research has a substantial likelihood of public 
dissemination; and
    (iv) The research does not fall within the categories of activities 
described in paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1): This general license does not authorize as 
professional research any travel-related transactions incident to 
attendance at professional meetings or conferences. Such transactions 
must either qualify under the general license set forth in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section or be the subject of a request for a specific 
license under paragraph (b) of this section.

    (2) The travel-related transactions set forth in Sec. 515.560(c) 
and such additional transactions as are directly incident to travel to 
Cuba by full-time professionals to attend professional meetings or 
conferences in Cuba organized by an international professional 
organization, institution, or association that regularly sponsors 
meetings or conferences in other countries are authorized, provided 
that:
    (i) The international professional organization, institution, or 
association is not headquartered in the United States unless that 
organization, institution, or association has been specifically licensed 
to sponsor the meeting in Cuba;
    (ii) The purpose of the meeting or conference is not the promotion 
of tourism in Cuba or other commercial activities involving Cuba that 
are inconsistent with this part; and
    (iii) The meeting or conference is not intended primarily for the 
purpose of fostering production of any biotechnological products.

    Note to paragraph (a): See Sec. Sec. 501.601 and 501.602 of this 
chapter for applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements. 
Exportation of equipment and other items, including the transfer of 
technology or software to foreign persons (``deemed exportation'') and 
items not eligible for Department of Commerce GFT or BAG License 
Exceptions, 15 CFR 740.12 and 740.14, may require separate authorization 
by the Department of Commerce.

    (b) Specific licensing. Specific licenses may be issued on a case-
by-case basis authorizing the travel-related transactions set forth in 
Sec. 515.560(c) and other transactions that are directly incident to 
professional research and professional meetings that do not qualify for 
the general license in paragraph (a) of this section. Specific licenses 
may be issued pursuant to this section authorizing transactions for 
multiple trips to Cuba over an extended period of time by applicants 
demonstrating a significant record of research. Specific licenses will 
not be issued for travel-related transactions for purposes of attendance 
at meetings or conferences in Cuba organized by the Cuban government 
where such meetings or conferences could be intended primarily

[[Page 132]]

for the purpose of fostering the production of any biotechnological 
products.

license in paragraph (a) of this section and for which the specific 
licenses described in paragraph (b) of this section will not be issued 
include recreational travel; tourist travel; travel in pursuit of a 
hobby; research for personal satisfaction only; and any travel for an 
authorized professional research purpose if the schedule of activities 
includes free time, travel, or recreation in excess of that consistent 
with a full work schedule of professional research or attendance at 
professional meetings or conferences.
    (d) An entire group does not qualify for the general license in 
paragraph (a) of this section and will not be issued a specific license 
under paragraph (b) of this section merely because some members of the 
group could qualify individually for such licenses.

    Example 1 to paragraph (d): A musicologist travels to Cuba to do 
research on Cuban music pursuant to the general license for professional 
researchers set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. Others who are 
simply interested in music but who do not research music as part of 
their careers may not engage in travel-related transactions with the 
musicologist in reliance on this general license. For example, an art 
historian who plays in the same band with the musicologist would not 
qualify as a professional researcher of Cuban music for purposes of this 
general license.
    Example 2 to paragraph (d): A specific license issued pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section authorizing travel-related transactions by 
a fish biologist who travels to Cuba to engage in professional research 
does not authorize transactions by other persons who might travel with 
the fish biologist but whose principal purpose in travel is to engage in 
recreational or trophy fishing. The fact that such persons may engage in 
certain activities with or under the direction of the professional fish 
biologist, such as measuring or recording facts about their catch, does 
not bring these individuals' activities within the scope of professional 
research and similar activities.

    (e) A person will not qualify as engaging in professional research 
merely because that person is a professional who plans to travel to 
Cuba.

    Example 1 to paragraph (e): A professor of history interested in 
traveling to Cuba for the principal purpose of learning or practicing 
Spanish or attending general purpose lectures devoted to Cuban culture 
and contemporary life does not qualify for the general license in 
paragraph (a) of this section or for a specific license issued pursuant 
to paragraph (b) of this section.
    Example 2 to paragraph (e): A professional photographer who wishes 
to take photographs in Cuba that will become the basis for creating post 
cards, paintings, and other secondary products or that merely document 
the photographer's travel does not qualify for the general license in 
paragraph (a) of this section or for a specific license issued pursuant 
to paragraph (b) of this section.

chapter for applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

Sec. 515.570  Remittances to nationals of Cuba.

    (a) Periodic $300 family household remittances authorized. Persons 
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States who are 18 years of age 
or older are authorized to make remittances to nationals of Cuba who are 
members of the remitter's immediate family, provided that:
    (1) The remitter's total remittances do not exceed $300 per 
recipient household in any consecutive 3-month period, regardless of the 
number of members of the remitter's immediate family comprising that 
household;
    (2) The remittances are not made from a blocked source unless:
    (i) The remittances are authorized pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section; or
    (ii) The remittances are made to a recipient in a third country and 
are made from a blocked account in a banking institution in the United 
States held in the name of, or in which the beneficial interest is held 
by, the recipient; and
    (3) The recipient is not a prohibited official of the Government of 
Cuba or a prohibited member of the Cuban Communist Party. For the 
purposes of this paragraph, the term ``prohibited official of the 
Government of Cuba'' means: Ministers and Vice-ministers, members of the 
Council of State, and the Council of Ministers; members and employees of 
the National Assembly of People's Power; members of any provincial 
assembly; local sector chiefs of the Committees for the Defense of the 
Revolution; Director Generals and sub-Director Generals and higher of 
all Cuban ministries and state agencies; employees of the Ministry of 
the Interior (MININT); employees of the Ministry of Defense (MINFAR); 
secretaries and first secretaries of the Confederation of Labor of Cuba 
(CTC) and its component unions; chief editors, editors and deputy 
editors of Cuban state-run media organizations and programs, including 
newspapers, television, and radio; and members and employees of the 
Supreme Court (Tribuno Supremo Nacional). For purposes of this 
paragraph, the term ``prohibited members of the Cuban Communist Party'' 
means: members of the Politburo; the Central Committee; Department Heads 
of the Central Committee; employees of the Central Committee; and 
secretary and first secretary of the provincial Party central 
committees.
    (4) For the purposes of this paragraph (a), the term ``member of the 
remitter's immediate family'' means a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, 
grandparent, or sibling of the remitter or the remitter's spouse, as 
well as any spouse, widow, or widower of any of the foregoing.

    Note to paragraph (a): The maximum amount set forth in this 
paragraph does not apply to remittances to a Cuban individual who has 
been unblocked or whose current transactions are otherwise authorized 
pursuant to Sec. 515.505, because remittances to such persons do not 
require separate authorization.

    (b) Two one-time $500 emigration-related remittances authorized. 
Persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States are authorized 
to remit the following amounts:
    (1) Up to $500 per payee on a one-time basis to any Cuban nationals 
for the purpose of covering the payees' preliminary expenses associated 
with emigrating from Cuba to the United States. These remittances may be 
sent before the payees have received valid visas issued by the State 
Department or other approved U.S.-immigration documents, but may not be 
carried by a licensed traveler to Cuba until the payees have received 
valid visas issued by the State Department or other approved U.S.-
immigration documents. See Sec. 515.560(c)(4) of this part for the

[[Page 136]]

rules regarding the carrying of authorized remittances to Cuba. These 
remittances may not be made from a blocked source unless authorized 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Up to an additional $500 per payee on a one-time basis to any 
Cuban nationals for the purpose of enabling the payees to emigrate from 
Cuba to the United States, including for the purchase of airline tickets 
and payment of exit or third-country visa fees or other travel-related 
fees. These remittances may be sent only once the payees have received 
valid visas issued by the State Department or other approved U.S.-
immigration documents. A remitter must be able to provide the visa 
recipients' full names, dates of birth, visa numbers, and visa dates of 
issuance. See Sec. 515.560(c)(4) of this part for the rules regarding 
the carrying of authorized remittances to Cuba. These remittances may 
not be made from a blocked source unless authorized pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Certain remittances from inherited blocked sources authorized. 
The remittances authorized in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may 
be made from a blocked account in a banking institution in the United 
States held in the name of, or in which the beneficial interest is held 
by, the payee, provided that the funds were deposited in the blocked 
account as a result of a valid testamentary disposition, intestate 
succession, or payment from a life insurance policy or annuity contract 
triggered by the death of the policy or contract holder.
    (d) Specific licenses. Specific licenses may be issued on a case-by-
case basis authorizing the following:
    (1) Remittances by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction, including 
but not limited to nongovernmental organizations and individuals, to 
independent non-governmental entities in Cuba, including but not limited 
to pro-democracy groups, civil society groups, and religious 
organizations, and to members of such groups or organizations.
    (1) Remittances by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction to 
independent non-governmental entities in Cuba.
    (2) Remittances by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction from blocked 
accounts to Cuban households in third countries in excess of the amount 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section; or

in Cuba, directly or indirectly, for transactions to facilitate non-
immigrant travel by an individual in Cuba to the United States under 
circumstances where humanitarian need is demonstrated, including but not 
limited to illness or other medical emergency.

    Note to Sec. 515.570: For the rules relating to the carrying of 
remittances to Cuba, see paragraph (c)(4) of Sec. 515.560. Persons 
subject to U.S. jurisdiction are prohibited from engaging in the 
collection or forwarding of remittances to Cuba unless authorized 
pursuant to Sec. 515.572. For a list of authorized U.S. remittance 
service providers, see the following Web site: http://www.treas.gov/

<R05>
Sec. 515.572  Authorization of transactions incident to the provision of 
travel services, carrier services, and remittance forwarding services.

    (a)(1) Authorization of travel service provider. The following 
persons wishing to provide services in connection with travel to Cuba 
are ``travel service providers'' for purposes of this part: Travel 
agents, ticket agents, commercial and noncommercial organizations that 
arrange travel to Cuba; tour operators; persons arranging through 
transportation to Cuba; persons chartering an aircraft or vessel on 
behalf of others in Cuba; and persons arranging hotel accommodations, 
ground transportation, local tours, and similar travel activities on 
behalf of others in Cuba. Travel service providers must obtain 
authorization from the Office of Foreign Assets Control before providing 
services with respect to travel to Cuba. The list stated above should 
not be considered exhaustive, as other persons may be ``travel service 
providers'' within the meaning of this part. Opinions may be obtained 
from the Office of Foreign Assets Control concerning the applicability 
of this licensing requirement in individual cases.
    (2) Authorization of carrier service provider. Persons subject to 
U.S. jurisdiction wishing to provide carrier services by aircraft or 
vessels incidental to their non-scheduled flights or voyages to, from, 
or within Cuba are ``carrier service providers'' for purposes of this 
part. Carrier service providers must obtain authorization from the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control before providing services with respect 
to non-scheduled flights or voyages to, from, or within Cuba. Carriage 
to or from Cuba of any merchandise, cargo or gifts, other than those 
permitted to individual travelers as accompanied baggage, must also be 
authorized by licenses issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
    (3) Authorization of remittance forwarders. Persons subject to U.S. 
jurisdiction, including persons who provide remittance forwarding 
services and

[[Page 138]]

noncommercial organizations acting on behalf of donors, who wish to 
provide services in connection with the collection or forwarding of 
remittances authorized pursuant to this part must obtain a license from 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Depository institutions, as 
defined in Sec. 515.533, must obtain a license pursuant to this section 
only for the provision of services in connection with the collection and 
forwarding of remittances authorized pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), 
and (c) of Sec. 515.570. Depository institutions do not need a license 
pursuant to this section to provide such services with respect to any 
other remittances authorized pursuant to this part.
    (b) Terms and conditions of authorization to engage in service 
transactions. Authorization to engage in service transactions will be 
issued only upon the applicant's written affirmation and subsequent 
demonstration that it does not participate in discriminatory practices 
of the Cuban government against certain residents and citizens of the 
United States. Examples of such practices include, but are not limited 
to, charging discriminatory rates for air travel or requiring payment 
for services, such as hotel accommodations and meals, not desired, 
planned to be utilized, or actually utilized, based on such 
characteristics as race, color, religion, sex, citizenship, place of 
birth, or national origin. Authorization, whether a grant of provisional 
authorization or a license issued pursuant to this part, does not permit 
a travel or carrier service provider to provide services in connection 
with any individual's transactions incident to travel which are 
prohibited by this part.
    (c) Initial applications for licenses. The initial application for a 
license shall contain:
    (1) The applicant organization's name, address, telephone number, 
and the name of an official of the applicant organization responsible 
for its licensed services;
    (2) The state of applicant's organization, if a juridical entity, 
the address of its principal place of business and all branch offices, 
the identity and ownership percentages of all shareholders or partners, 
and the identity and position of all principal officers and directors;
    (3) Copies of any bylaws, articles of incorporation, partnership 
agreements, management agreements, or other documents pertaining to the 
organization, ownership, control, or management of the applicant; and
    (4)(i) In the case of applications for authorization to serve as 
travel or carrier service providers, a report on the forms and other 
procedures used to establish that each customer is in full compliance 
with U.S. law implementing the Cuban embargo and either qualifies for 
one of the general licenses contained in this part authorizing travel-
related transactions in connection with travel to Cuba or has received a 
specific license from the Office of Foreign Assets Control issued 
pursuant to this part. In the case of a customer traveling pursuant to a 
general license, the applicant must demonstrate that it requires each 
customer to attest, in a signed statement, to his or her qualification 
for the particular general license claimed. The statement must provide 
facts supporting the customer's belief that he or she qualifies for the 
general license claimed. In the case of a customer traveling under a 
specific license, the applicant must demonstrate that it requires the 
customer to furnish it with a copy of the license. The copy of the 
signed statement or the specific license must be maintained on file with 
the applicant.
    (ii) In the case of applications for authorization as remittance 
forwarders, a report on the forms, account books, and other 
recordkeeping procedures used to determine whether each customer has 
violated the terms of any authorization for remittances contained in or 
issued pursuant to this part, or sent remittances to persons ineligible 
to receive them under Sec. 515.570; and the method by which remittances 
are sent to Cuba and the procedures used by the applicant to ensure that 
the remittances are received by the persons intended.
    (d) Required reports and recordkeeping. (1) Each specific license or 
grant of provisional authority shall require that the service provider 
furnish annual reports to the Department of the Treasury, Office of 
Foreign Assets Control, Washington, DC 20220, during the

[[Page 139]]

term of the license. The required content of such reports and their due 
dates shall be provided to the service provider in a letter authorizing 
the provider to commence services. Each such report will cover only the 
one-year period immediately preceding the date of the report.
    (2) While the names and addresses of individual travelers or 
remitters, the number and amount of each remittance, and the name and 
address of each recipient, as applicable, need not be submitted with 
annual reports, this information must be retained on file with all other 
information required by Sec. 515.601 of this chapter. These records 
must be furnished to the Office of Foreign Assets Control on demand 
pursuant to Sec. 515.602 of this chapter.
    (3) Presentation of passenger lists. Tour operators, persons 
operating an aircraft or vessel, or persons chartering an aircraft or 
vessel on behalf of others, for travel to, from, and within Cuba must 
furnish the U.S. Customs Service on demand a list of passengers on each 
flight or voyage to, from, and within Cuba.
    (e) Procedures governing the grant of provisional authority, denial, 
suspension, or revocation of authority to engage in service 
transactions--(1) Grant of provisional authority. Following submission 
of a complete application as described in paragraph (c) of this section, 
the submission of any additional relevant information, and a preliminary 
evaluation by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the applicant will 
be notified in writing that provisional authority has been granted to 
provide the services contemplated in the application. This provisional 
authority to provide services will remain in effect pending a final 
decision to grant or deny the license.
    (2) Denial of license--(i) Notice of denial. If the Director, Office 
of Foreign Assets Control, determines that the application for a license 
to engage in service transactions related to travel to Cuba, carrier 
service transactions related to travel to Cuba, or transactions related 
to remittance forwarding should be denied for any reason, notice of 
denial shall be given to the applicant. The notice of denial shall state 
the reasons for the denial.
    (ii) Grounds for denial. The causes sufficient to justify denial of 
an application for a license may include, but need not be limited to:
    (A) Any cause which would justify suspension or revocation of the 
authority of a service provider pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section;
    (B) Failure to file a full and complete application;
    (C) Any willful misstatement of pertinent facts in the application;
    (D) Evidence indicating that the applicant participates in 
discriminatory practices of the Cuban Government against certain 
residents and citizens of the United States as described in paragraph 
(b) of this section; or
    (E) A reputation imputing to the applicant criminal, dishonest, or 
unethical conduct, or a record of such conduct.
    (3) Suspension or revocation of a license or provisional 
authorization. A license or provisional authorization issued pursuant to 
this section may be suspended for a specific period of time, or revoked, 
for the following reasons:
    (i) The service provider has willfully made or caused to be made in 
any application for any license, request for a ruling or opinion, or 
report be filed with the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any statement 
that was, at the time and in light of the circumstances under which it 
was made, false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or has 
omitted to state in any application, request for ruling or opinion, or 
report any material fact that was required;
    (ii) The service provider has failed to file timely reports or 
comply with the recordkeeping requirements of his license or provisional 
authorization.
    (iii) The service provider has been convicted, at any time after 
filing an application for a license under this section, of any felony or 
misdemeanor that:
    (A) Involved the importation, exportation, or transfer of property 
in violation of any law or regulation administered by the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control;
    (B) Arose directly out of the conduct of the business covered by the

[[Page 140]]

    (C) Involved larceny, extortion, forgery, counterfeiting, fraudulent 
concealment, embezzlement, fraudulent conversion, misappropriation of 
funds, or a violation of the Customs laws, export or import control 
laws, or banking laws.
    (iv) The service provider has violated any provision of law enforced 
by the Office of Foreign Assets Control or the rules or regulations 
issued under any such provision;
    (v) The service provider has counseled, commanded, induced, 
procured, or knowingly aided or abetted the violation by any other 
person of any provision of any law or regulation referred to above;
    (vi) The service provider has, in the course of the business covered 
by the license, with felonious intent, in any manner willfully and 
knowingly deceived, defrauded, misled, threatened, or coerced any client 
or prospective client; or
    (vii) The service provider has committed any other act or omission 
that demonstrates unfitness to conduct the business covered by the 
license.

    (ii) Exporting embedded software necessary for reading, browsing, 
navigating, or searching a written publication in electronic format,

individualized or customized services are delivered through the use of 
information and informational materials;
    (2) To create or undertake for any person a marketing campaign with 
respect to any service or product other than a written publication, or

Sec. 515.803  Customs procedures; merchandise specified in Sec. 515.204.

    (a) With respect to merchandise specified in Sec. 515.204 
(including nickel-bearing materials presumptively subject thereto) 
whether or not such merchandise has been imported into the United 
States, collectors of customs shall not accept or allow any:
    (1) Entry for consumption (including any appraisement entry, any 
entry of goods imported in the mails, regardless of value, and any other 
informal entries);
    (2) Entry for immediate exportation;
    (3) Entry for transportation and exportation;
    (4) Withdrawal from warehouse;
    (5) Transfer or withdrawal from a foreign-trade zone; or
    (6) Manipulation or manufacture in a warehouse or in a foreign-trade 
zone, unless either:
    (i) The merchandise was imported prior to 12:01 a.m., February 7, 
1962, or
    (ii) A specific license pursuant to this part is presented, or
    (iii) Instructions from the Office of Foreign Assets Control, 
authorizing the transaction are received, or
    (iv) The original of an appropriate certificate of origin as defined 
in Sec. 515.536(d) is presented.
    (b) Whenever a specific license is presented to a collector of 
customs in accordance with this section, one additional legible copy of 
the entry, withdrawal or other appropriate document with respect to the 
merchandise involved shall be filed with the collector of customs at the 
port where the transaction is to take place. Each copy of any such 
entry, withdrawal or other appropriate document, including the 
additional copy, shall bear plainly on its face the number of the 
license pursuant to which it is filed. The original copy of the specific 
license shall be presented to the collector in respect of each such 
transaction and shall bear a notation in ink by the licensee or person 
presenting the license showing the description, quantity and value of 
the merchandise to be entered, withdrawn or otherwise dealt with. This 
notation should be so placed and so written that there will exist no 
possibility of confusing it with anything placed on the license at the 
time of its issuance. If

[[Page 144]]

the license in fact authorizes the entry, withdrawal or other 
transaction with regard to the merchandise the collector, or other 
authorized customs employee, shall verify the notation by signing or 
initialing it after first assuring himself that it accurately describes 
the merchandise it purports to represent. The license shall thereafter 
be returned to the person presenting it and the additional copy of the 
entry, withdrawal or other appropriate document shall be forwarded by 
the collector to the Foreign Assets Control.
    (c)(1) Whenever the original of an appropriate certificate or origin 
as defined in Sec. 515.536(d) is presented to a collector of customs in 
accordance with this section, an additional legible copy of the entry, 
withdrawal or other appropriate document with respect to the merchandise 
involved shall be filed with the collector of customs at the port where 
the transaction is to take place. Each copy of the entry, withdrawal, or 
other appropriate document, including the additional copy, shall bear 
plainly on its face the following statement: ``This document is 
presented under the provisions of Sec. 515.536 (c) of the Cuban Assets 
Control Regulations.'' The original of the certificate of origin shall 
not be returned to the person presenting it. It shall be securely 
attached to the additional copy required by this subparagraph and shall 
be forwarded by the collector to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, 
Treasury Department, Washington, DC 20220. Collectors may forward such 
documents weekly or more often if the volume warrants.
    (2) If the original of an appropriate certificate of origin is 
properly presented to a collector of customs with respect to a 
transaction which is the first of a series of transactions which may be 
allowed in connection therewith under paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of this 
section (as, for example, where merchandise has been entered in a bonded 
warehouse and an appropriate certificate of origin is presented which 
relates to all of the merchandise entered therein but the importer 
desires to withdraw only part of the merchandise in the first 
transaction), the collector shall so note on the original of the 
appropriate certificate of origin and return it to the importer. In 
addition, the collector shall endorse his pertinent records so as to 
record what merchandise is covered by the appropriate certificate of 
origin presented. The collector may thereafter allow subsequent 
authorized transactions on presentation of the certificate of origin. 
The collector shall, with respect to each such transaction, demand an 
additional copy of each withdrawal or other appropriate document, which 
copy shall be promptly forwarded by the collector to the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control, Treasury Department, Washington, DC 20220, with 
an endorsement thereon reading:

    This document has been accepted pursuant to Sec. 515.808(c) (2) of 
the Cuban Assets Control Regulations. Appropriate certificate of origin 
No.--------------from (country).


When the final transaction has been effected under the certificate of 
origin, the original shall be taken up and attached to the entry and 
forwarded as in this paragraph.
    (d) Whenever a person shall present an entry, withdrawal or other 
appropriate document affected by this section and shall assert that no 
specific Foreign Assets Control license or appropriate certificate of 
origin as defined in Sec. 515.536 (d) is required in connection 
therewith, the collector of customs shall withhold action thereon and 
shall advise such person to communicate directly with the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control to request that instructions be issued to the 
collector to authorize him to take action with regard thereto.

Sec. 535.202  Transactions with respect to securities registered or 
inscribed in the name of Iran.

    Unless authorized by a license expressly referring to this section, 
the acquisition, transfer (including the transfer on the books of any 
issuer or agent thereof), disposition, transportation, importation, 
exportation, or withdrawal of, or the endorsement or guaranty of 
signatures on or otherwise dealing in any security (or evidence thereof) 
registered or inscribed in the name of any Iranian entity is prohibited 
irrespective of the fact that at any time (either prior to, on, or 
subsequent to the effective date) the registered or inscribed owner 
thereof may have, or appears to have, assigned, transferred or otherwise 
disposed of any such security.


<R05>
Sec. 535.203  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date which is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, ruling, instruction, 
license, or other direction or authorization thereunder and involves any 
property in which Iran has or has had an interest since such effective 
date is null and void and shall not be the basis for the assertion or 
recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power or privilege with 
respect to such property.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or interest in, any property in which Iran has or has had an 
interest since the effective date unless the person with whom such 
property is held or maintained had written notice of the transfer or by 
any written evidence had recognized such transfer prior to such 
effective date.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Secretary of the Treasury before, during or after a transfer shall 
validate such transfer or render it enforceable to the same extent as it 
would be valid or enforceable but for the provisions of the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act and this part and any 
ruling, order, regulation, direction or instruction issued hereunder.
    (d) Transfers of property which otherwise would be null and void, or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void, or unenforceable pursuant to such 
provisions, as to any person with whom such property was held or 
maintained (and as to such person only) in cases in which such person is 
able to establish each of the following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property was held 
or maintained;
    (2) The person with whom such property was held or maintained did 
not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts 
and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer 
required a license or authorization by or pursuant to the provision of 
this part and was not so licensed or authorized or if a license or 
authorization did purport to cover the transfer, that such license or 
authorization had been obtained by misrepresentation or the withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) Promptly upon discovery that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or 
any regulation, ruling, instruction, license or other direction or 
authorization thereunder, or
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Secretary 
of the Treasury, or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation or the withholding of material 
facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; the person with whom such 
property was held or maintained filed with the Treasury Department, 
Washington, D.C., a report in triplicate setting forth in full the 
circumstances relating to such transfer. The filing of a report in 
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph shall not be deemed to 
be compliance or evidence of compliance

[[Page 148]]

with paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section.
    (e) Unless licensed or authorized pursuant to this part any 
attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other 
judicial process is null and void with respect to any property in which 
on or since the effective date there existed an interest of Iran.
    (f) For the purpose of this section the term property includes gold,

    (a) Question. Prior to the effective date, a bank subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States has issued or confirmed a documentary 
letter of credit for a non-Iranian account party in favor of an Iranian 
entity. Can payment be made upon presentation of documentary drafts?
    Answer. Yes, provided payment is made into a blocked account in a 
domestic bank.
    (b) Question. Prior to the effective date, a domestic branch of a 
bank organized or incorporated under the laws of the United States has 
issued or confirmed a documentary letter of credit for a non-Iranian 
account party in favor of an Iranian entity. Payment is to be made 
through a foreign branch of the bank. Can payment be made upon 
presentation of documentary drafts?
    Answer. Yes, provided payment is made into a blocked account in a 
domestic bank.
    (c) Question. Prior to the effective date, a foreign bank confirms a 
documentary letter of credit issued by its U.S. agency or branch for a 
non-Iranian account party in favor of an Iranian entity. Can the U.S. 
agency or branch of the foreign bank transfer funds to the foreign bank 
in connection with that foreign bank's payment under the letter of 
credit?
    Answer. No, the U.S. agency's payment is blocked, unless the foreign 
bank made payment to the Iranian entity prior to the effective date.
    (d) Question. Prior to the effective date, a bank subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States has issued or confirmed a documentary 
letter of credit for a non-Iranian account party in favor of an Iranian 
entity. The Iranian entity presents documentry drafts which are 
deficient in some detail. May the non-Iranian account party waive the 
documentary deficiency and authorize the bank to make payment?
    Answer. Yes, provided payment is made into a blocked account in a 
domestic bank. However, the non-Iranian account party is not obligated 
by these Regulations to exercise a waiver of documentary deficiencies. 
In cases where such a waiver is not exercised, the bank's payment 
obligation, if any, under the letter of credit remains blocked, as does 
any obligation, contingent or otherwise, of the account party. The 
documents are also blocked.
    (e) Question. Prior to the effective date, a bank subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States has issued or confirmed a documentary 
letter of credit for a non-Iranian account party in favor of an Iranian 
entity. The Iranian entity does not make timely, complete, or proper 
presentation of documents, and the letter of credit expires. Does there 
remain a blocked payment obligation held by the bank?
    Answer. No, but any documents held by the bank continue to be 
blocked. It is also possible that the account party still has a related 
obligation to the Iranian entity and any such obligation would be 
blocked.
    (f) Question. A bank subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States has issued a letter of credit for a U.S. account party in favor 
of an Iranian entity. The letter of credit is confirmed by a foreign 
bank. Prior to or after the effective date, the Iranian entity presents 
documents to the U.S. issuing bank. Payment is deferred. After the 
effective date, the Iranian entity requests that the issuing bank either 
return the documents to the Iranian entity or transfer them to the 
confirming bank. Can the issuing bank do so?
    Answer. No. The U.S. issuing bank can neither return nor transfer 
the documents without a license. The documents constitute blocked 
property under the Regulations.

[[Page 159]]

    (g) Question. Prior to the effective date, a bank subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States has issued or confirmed a documentary 
letter of credit for a non-Iranian account party in favor of an Iranian 
entity. The Iranian entity presents documentary drafts which are 
deficient in some detail. May the non-Iranian account party waive the 
documentary deficiency and make payment?
    Answer. Yes, provided payment is made into a blocked account in a 
domestic bank. However, the non-Iranian account party is not obligated 
by these Regulations to exercise a waiver of documentary deficiencies.

Sec. 535.440  Commercially reasonable interest rates.

    (a) For purposes of Sec. Sec. 535.212 and 535.213, what is meant by 
``commercially reasonable rates'' depends on the particular 
circumstances. In the case of time or savings deposits, the 
``commercially reasonable rate'' is that rate provided for by the 
deposit agreement or applicable law. With respect to other obligations 
where the rate remains to be determined, it is presently expected that 
the ``commercially reasonable rate'' will be the rate agreed upon by the 
bank and Iran. However, where a deposit has in fact operated as a demand 
account under Treasury license, it would be appropriate to treat the 
deposit for purposes of Sec. Sec. 535.212 and 535.213 as a non-interest 
bearing account. Furthermore, in the event that the Iran-U.S Claims 
Tribunal (the ``Tribunal'') determines that interest additional to that 
agreed upon between the bank and Iran, or compensation or damages in 
lieu of interest, is due Iran, then that amount determined by the 
Tribunal to be owing to Iran shall be transferred as, or as part of, the 
interest at ``commercially reasonable rates'' required to be transferred 
pursuant to Sec. Sec. 535.212 and 535.213, regardless of any settlement 
between the bank and Iran or any release or discharge that Iran may have 
given the bank.
    (b) The contingent interest of Iran in any liability for further or 
additional interest, or compensation or damages in lieu of interest, 
that may be claimed in, and determined by the Tribunal, constitutes an 
interest of Iran in property for purposes of this part, and no agreement 
between Iran and any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States is effective to extinguish such Iranian interest in property 
unless so specifically licensed by the Treasury Department.
    (c) For deposits held as time deposits, no penalty shall be imposed 
for early withdrawal. (In this connection, the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System has determined that application of the penalty 
for early withdrawal of time deposits transferred before maturity, 
pursuant to Sec. 535.213 is not required.)

applicable prior to November 14, 1979, which may include unrestricted 
use of all or a portion of the proceeds, provided that the applicant

United States in the amount of the proceeds of sale, prior to any such 
disposition.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, payment into a 
blocked account in a domestic bank by an issuing or confirming bank 
under a standby letter of credit in favor of an Iranian entity is 
prohibited by Sec. 535.201 and not authorized, notwithstanding the 
provisions of Sec. 535.508, if either:
    (1) A specific license has been issued pursuant to the provisions of 
paragraph (b) of this section, or
    (2) Eight business days have not expired after notice to the account 
party pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Whenever an issuing or confirming bank shall receive such demand 
for payment under a standby letter of credit, it shall promptly notify

[[Page 166]]

the person for whose account the credit was opened. Such person may then 
apply within five business days for a specific license authorizing the 
account party to establish a blocked account on its books in the name of 
the Iranian entity in the amount payable under the credit, in lieu of 
payment by the issuing or confirming bank into a blocked account and 
reimbursement therefor by the account party.
    (c) Where there is outstanding a demand for payment under a standby 
letter of credit, and the issuing or confirming bank has been enjoined 
from making payment, upon removal of the injunction, the person for 
whose account the credit was opened may apply for a specific license for 
the same purpose and in the same manner as that set forth in paragraph 
(b) of this section. The issuing or confirming bank shall not make 
payment under the standby letter of credit unless:
    (1) Eight business days have expired since the bank has received 
notice of the removal of the injunction and;
    (2) A specific license issued to the account party pursuant to the 
provisions of this paragraph has not been presented to the bank.

the Secretary may at any time require the payment of the amounts due 
under any letter of credit described in paragraph (a) of this section 
into a blocked account in a domestic bank or the supplying of any form 
of security deemed necessary.
    (e) Nothing in this section precludes any person for whose account a 
standby letter of credit was opened or any other person from at any time 
contesting the legality of the demand from the Iranian entity or from 
raising any other legal defense to payment under the standby letter of 
credit.
    (f) This section does not affect the obligation of the various 
parties of the instruments covered by this section if the instruments 
and payment thereunder are subsequently unblocked.
    (g) For the purposes of this section, the term standby letter of 
credit shall mean a letter of credit securing performance of, or 
repayment of, any advance payments of deposits, under a contract with 
Iran or an Iranian entity, or any similar obligation in the nature of a 
performance bond.
    (h) The regulations do not authorize any person subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States to reimburse a non-U.S. bank for 
payment to Iran or an Iranian entity under a standby letter of credit, 
except by payment into a blocked account in accordance with Sec. 
535.508 or paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
    (i) A person receiving a specific license under paragraph (b) or (c) 
of this section shall certify to the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
within five business days after receipt of that license that it has 
established the blocked account on its books as provided for in those 
paragraphs. However, in appropriate cases, this time may be extended 
upon application to the Office of Foreign Assets Control when the 
account party has filed a petition with an appropriate court seeking a 
judicial order barring payment by the issuing or confirming bank.
    (j) The extension or renewal of a standby letter of credit is 
authorized.
    (k) All specific licenses previously issued under this section to 
account parties to standby letters of credit are revoked, effective 
February 28, 1991, unless the license holder submits documentation to 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control establishing that the specific 
license pertains to a standby letter of credit obligation that (1) is at 
issue in any claim brought before the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal 
(``Tribunal''), (2) is or was at issue in any claim that the Tribunal 
resolves, or has resolved, on the merits in favor of the account party, 
or (3) was at issue in a matter that was settled by the parties. The 
documentation required for such a showing may include such items as a 
copy of a Tribunal Award, a copy of a signed settlement agreement, or 
copies of cover pages of recent filings in pending Tribunal cases.

Sec. 536.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    (a) This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts 
of this chapter with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Differing foreign policy 
and national security contexts may result in differing interpretations 
of similar language among the parts of this chapter. No license or 
authorization contained in or issued pursuant to those other parts 
authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No license or 
authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other provision of 
law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part.
    (b) No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations.

identity, that party may seek to have such funds unblocked pursuant to 
the administrative procedures set forth in Sec. 501.806 of this 
chapter.

Sec. 536.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date, which is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, license, or other authorization hereunder and 
involves any property held in the name of a specially designated 
narcotics trafficker or in which a specially designated narcotics 
trafficker has or has had an interest since such date, is null and void 
and shall not be the basis for the assertion or recognition of any 
interest in or right, remedy, power or privilege with respect to such 
property.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or interest in, any property held in the name of a specially 
designated narcotics trafficker or in which a specially designated 
narcotics trafficker has an interest, or has had an interest since such 
date, unless the person with whom such property is held or maintained, 
prior to such date, had written notice of the transfer or by any written 
evidence had recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, or 
after a transfer shall validate such transfer or render it enforceable 
to the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the 
provisions of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, this 
part, and any regulation, order, directive, ruling, instruction, or 
license issued hereunder.

[[Page 172]]

    (d) Transfers of property which otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property was held or maintained (and as to such person only) in 
cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property was held 
or maintained;
    (2) The person with whom such property was held or maintained did 
not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts 
and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer 
required a license or authorization by or pursuant to this part and was 
not so licensed or authorized, or if a license or authorization did 
purport to cover the transfer, that such license or authorization had 
been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or the withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property was held or maintained filed 
with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth in full 
the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon discovery 
that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or 
any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other direction or 
authorization hereunder; or
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director of 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or the 
withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

    Note to paragraph (d)(3): The filing of a report in accordance with 
the provisions of this paragraph (d)(3) shall not be deemed evidence 
that the terms of paragraphs (d)(l) and (2) of this section have been 
satisfied.

    (e) Unless licensed or authorized pursuant to this part, any 
attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other 
judicial process is null and void with respect to any property which, on 
or since the effective date, was held in the name of a specially 
designated narcotics trafficker or in which there existed an interest of 
a specially designated narcotics trafficker.


<R05>
Sec. 536.203  Holding of certain types of blocked property in 
interest-bearing accounts.

    (a)(1) Any person, including a U.S. financial institution, currently 
holding property subject to Sec. 536.201 which, as of the effective 
date or the date of receipt if subsequent to the effective date, is not 
being held in an interest-bearing account, or otherwise invested in a 
manner authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (e.g., Sec. 
536.504), shall transfer such property to, or hold such property or 
cause such property to be held in, an interest-bearing account or 
interest-bearing status in a U.S. financial institution as of the 
effective date or the date of receipt if subsequent to the effective 
date of this section, unless otherwise authorized or directed by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (2) The requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
shall apply to currency, bank deposits, accounts, obligations, and any 
other financial or economic resources or assets, and any proceeds 
resulting from the sale of tangible or intangible property. If interest 
is credited to an account separate from that in which the interest-
bearing asset is held, the name of the account party on both accounts 
must be the same and must clearly indicate the specially designated 
narcotics trafficker having an interest in the accounts. If the account 
is held in the name of a specially designated narcotics trafficker, the 
name of the account to which interest is credited must be the same.
    (b) For purposes of this section, the term interest-bearing account 
means a blocked account in a U.S. financial institution earning interest 
at rates that are commercially reasonable for the amount of funds in the 
account. Except as otherwise authorized, the funds may not be invested 
or held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 90 days.

[[Page 173]]

    (c) This section does not apply to blocked tangible property, such 
as chattels, nor does it create an affirmative obligation on the part of 
the holder of such blocked tangible property to sell or liquidate the 
property and put the proceeds in a blocked account. However, the Office 
of Foreign Assets Control may issue licenses permitting or directing 
sales of tangible property in appropriate cases.

materials, and payment of royalties to a specially designated narcotics 
trafficker with respect to income received for enhancements or 
alterations made by U.S. persons to information or informational 
materials imported from a specially designated narcotics trafficker.
    (3) This section does not authorize transactions incident to the 
exportation of technology that is not informational material as defined 
in Sec. 536.306(b)(1) or incident to the exportation of goods for use 
in the transmission of any information.
    (c) Travel. The prohibitions contained in this part do not apply to 
transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country, 
including importation of accompanied baggage for personal use, 
maintenance within any country including payment of living expenses and 
acquisition of goods or services for personal use, and arrangement or 
facilitation of such travel including non-scheduled air, sea, or land 
voyages. Any transactions entered into by a specially designated 
narcotics trafficker while traveling in the United States that are 
outside the scope of those set forth in this paragraph are in violation 
of Sec. 536.201.

property interest) is transferred or attempted to be transferred to a 
specially designated narcotics trafficker, such property shall be deemed

designated narcotics trafficker.


<R05>
Sec. 536.404  Setoffs prohibited.

    A setoff against blocked property (including a blocked account), 
whether by a U.S. bank or other U.S. person, is a prohibited transfer 
under Sec. 536.201 if effected after the effective date.


<R05>
Sec. 536.405  Transactions incidental to a licensed transaction.

    Any transaction ordinarily incident to a licensed transaction and 
necessary to give effect thereto is also authorized, except a 
transaction by an unlicensed, specially designated narcotics trafficker 
or involving a debit to a blocked account or a transfer of blocked 
property not explicitly authorized within the terms of the license.


<R05>
Sec. 536.406  Provision of services.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 536.205, the prohibitions contained 
in Sec. 536.201 apply to services performed by U.S. persons, wherever 
located:
    (1) On behalf of, or for the benefit of, a specially designated 
narcotics trafficker; or
    (2) With respect to property interests of a specially designated 
narcotics trafficker.
    (b) Example: U.S. persons may not, except as authorized by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control by or pursuant to this part, provide 
legal, accounting, financial, brokering, freight forwarding, 
transportation, public relations, educational, or other services to

[[Page 177]]

a specially designated narcotics trafficker. See Sec. 536.506, with 
respect to certain authorized legal services.


<R05>
Sec. 536.407  Offshore transactions.

    The prohibitions contained in Sec. 536.201 apply to transactions by 
U.S. persons in locations outside the United States with respect to 
property which the U.S. person knows, or has reason to know, is held in 
the name of a specially designated narcotics trafficker, or in which the 
U.S. person knows, or has reason to know, a specially designated 
narcotics trafficker has or has had an interest since the effective 
date.


<R05>
Sec. 536.408  Alleged change in ownership or control of an entity designated 
as a specially designated narcotics trafficker.

    (a) A change or alleged change in ownership or control of an entity 
designated as a specially designated narcotics trafficker shall not be 
the basis for removal of that entity from the list of specially 
designated narcotics traffickers unless, upon investigation by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control and submission of evidence by the 
entity, it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director of the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control that the transfer to a bona fide 
purchaser at arm's length is legitimate and that the entity no longer 
meets the criteria for designation under Sec. 536.312. Evidence 
submitted must conclusively demonstrate that all ties with other 
specially designated narcotics traffickers have been completely severed, 
and may include, but is not limited to, articles of incorporation; 
identification of new directors, officers, shareholders, and sources of 
capital; and contracts evidencing the sale of the entity to its new 
owners.
    (b) Any continuing substantial financial obligations on the part of 
the new owners to any specially designated narcotics traffickers, 
including long-term payment plans, leases, or rents, will be considered 
as evidence of continuing control of the entity by the specially 
designated narcotics trafficker. Purchase of a designated entity without 
ongoing substantial financial obligations to a specially designated 
narcotics trafficker may nonetheless be a basis for subsequent 
designation of the purchaser, if the transaction is determined 
materially to assist in or provide financial support for the narcotics 
trafficking activities of specially designated narcotics traffickers for 
purposes of Sec. 536.312(b)(2). For example, any acquisition 
transaction resulting in a direct cash transfer to or other enrichment 
of a specially designated narcotics trafficker could lead to designation 
of the purchaser. Mere change in name of an entity will not be 
considered as constituting a change of the entity's status.


<R05>
Sec. 536.409  Credit extended and cards issued by U.S. financial institutions.

    The prohibition in Sec. 536.201 on dealing in property in which a 
specially designated narcotics trafficker has an interest prohibits U.S. 
financial institutions from performing under any existing credit 
agreements, including, but not limited to, charge cards, debit cards, or 
other credit facilities issued by a U.S. financial institution to a 
person designated under this part.

    (a) No license or other authorization contained in this part, or 
otherwise issued by or under the direction of the Director of the Office 
of Foreign Assets Control, shall be deemed to authorize or validate any 
transaction effected prior to the issuance of the license, unless 
specifically provided in such license or authorization.
    (b) No regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizes any 
transaction prohibited under this part unless the regulation, ruling, 
instruction, or license is issued by the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control and specifically refers to this part. No regulation, ruling, 
instruction, or license referring to this part shall be deemed to 
authorize any transaction prohibited by any provision of this chapter 
unless the regulation, ruling, instruction or license specifically 
refers to such provision.
    (c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizing any 
transaction otherwise prohibited under this

[[Page 178]]

part has the effect of removing a prohibition or prohibitions contained 
in this part from the transaction, but only to the extent specifically 
stated by its terms. Unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or 
license otherwise specifies, such an authorization does not create any 
right, duty, obligation, claim, or interest in, or with respect to, any 
property which would not otherwise exist under ordinary principles of 
law.


<R05>
Sec. 536.502  Exclusion from licenses and authorizations.

    The Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control reserves the 
right to exclude any person, property, or transaction from the operation 
of any license, or from the privileges therein conferred, or to restrict 
the applicability thereof with respect to particular persons, property, 
transactions, or classes thereof. Such action shall be binding upon all 
persons receiving actual or constructive notice of such exclusion or 
restriction.


<R05>
Sec. 536.503  Payments and transfers to blocked accounts in U.S. financial 
institutions.

    (a) Any payment of funds or transfer of credit or other financial or 
economic resources or assets into a blocked account in a U.S. financial 
institution is authorized, provided that a transfer from a blocked 
account pursuant to this authorization may only be made to another 
blocked account held in the same name on the books of the same U.S. 
financial institution.
    (b) This section does not authorize any transfer from a blocked 
account within the United States to an account held outside the United 
States.

    Note to Sec. 536.503: Please refer to Sec. 501.603 of this chapter 
for mandatory reporting requirements regarding financial transfers.

FR 32652, June 10, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 536.702  Prepenalty notice.

    (a) When required. If the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control has reasonable cause to believe that there has occurred a 
violation of any provision of this part or a violation of the provisions 
of any license, ruling, regulation, order, direction or instruction 
issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary 
of the Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and the Director determines 
that further proceedings are warranted, he shall issue to the person 
concerned a notice of his intent to impose a monetary penalty. The 
prepenalty notice may be issued whether or not another agency has taken 
any action with respect to this matter.
    (b) Contents--(1) Facts of violation. The prepenalty notice shall 
describe the violation, specify the laws and regulations allegedly 
violated, and state the amount of the proposed monetary penalty.
    (2) Right to respond. The prepenalty notice also shall inform the 
respondent of respondent's right to respond to the notice within 30 days 
of its mailing as to why a monetary penalty should not be imposed, or, 
if imposed, why it should be in a lesser amount than proposed.


<R05>
Sec. 536.703  Response to prepenalty notice.

    (b) Form and contents of written response. The written response need 
not be in any particular form, but shall contain information sufficient 
to indicate that it is in response to the prepenalty notice. It should 
respond to the allegations in the prepenalty notice and set forth the 
reasons why the person believes the penalty should not be imposed or, if 
imposed, why it should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (c) Informal settlement. In addition or as an alternative to a 
written response to a prepenalty notice pursuant to this section, the 
respondent or respondent's representative may contact the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control as advised in the prepenalty notice to propose 
the settlement of allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and 
related matters. In the event of settlement at the prepenalty stage, the 
prepenalty notice will be withdrawn, the respondent is not required to 
take a written position on allegations contained in the prepenalty 
notice, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control will make no final 
determination as to whether a violation occurred. The amount accepted in 
settlement of allegations in a prepenalty notice may vary from the

[[Page 181]]

civil penalty that might finally be imposed in the event of a formal 
determination of violation. In the event no settlement is reached, the 
30-day period specified in paragraph (a) of this section for written 
response to the prepenalty notice remains in effect unless additional 
time is granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.


<R05>
Sec. 536.704  Penalty notice.

    (a) No violation. If, after considering any written response to the 
prepenalty notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control determines that there was no violation by the 
respondent named in the prepenalty notice, the Director promptly shall 
notify the respondent in writing of that determination and that no 
monetary penalty will be imposed.
    (b) Violation. If, after considering any written response to the 
prepenalty notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control determines that there was a violation by the 
respondent named in the prepenalty notice, the Director promptly shall 
issue a written notice of the imposition of the monetary penalty or 
other available disposition on the respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 536.705  Administrative collection; referral to United States 
Department of Justice.

    In the event that the respondent does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control within 30 days of the 
mailing of the written notice of the imposition of the penalty, the 
matter may be referred for administrative collection measures or to the 
United States Department of Justice for appropriate action to recover 
the penalty in a civil suit in a Federal district court.

      Subpart A_Relation of This Part to Other Laws and Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 537.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to 
part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in 
this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing 
foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No 
license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other 
provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by 
this part. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant 
to this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations.


<R04>
                         Subpart B_Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 537.201  Prohibited transactions involving certain blocked property.

    (a) Except as authorized by regulations, orders, directives, 
rulings, instructions, licenses or otherwise, and notwithstanding any 
contracts entered into or any license or permit granted prior to 12:01 
a.m. eastern daylight time, July 29, 2003, all property and interests in 
property of the following persons that are in the United States, that 
hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come 
within the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their 
overseas branches, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, 
exported, withdrawn or otherwise dealt in:
    (1) Any person listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13310 of July 
28, 2003 (68 FR 44853, July 30, 2003); and
    (2) Any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State,
    (i) To be a senior official of the Government of Burma, the State 
Peace and Development Council of Burma, the Union Solidarity and 
Development Association of Burma, or any successor entity to any of the 
foregoing, or
    (ii) To be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act 
for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property 
or interests in property are blocked pursuant to this section.

    Note to paragraph (a) of Sec. 537.201: The names of persons whose 
property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 
537.201(a) are announced in the Federal Register, published on OFAC's 
Web site, and incorporated on an ongoing basis with the identifier 
[BURMA]into Appendix A to this chapter V.

    (b) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any security 
(or evidence thereof) held within the possession or control of a U.S. 
person and either registered or inscribed in the name of or known to be 
held for the benefit of any person whose property or interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is 
prohibited. This prohibition includes but is not limited to the transfer 
(including the

[[Page 184]]

transfer on the books of any issuer or agent thereof), disposition, 
transportation, importation, exportation, or withdrawal of any such 
security or the endorsement or guaranty of signatures on any such 
security. This prohibition applies irrespective of the fact that at any 
time (whether prior to, on, or subsequent to 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight 
time, July 29, 2003) the registered or inscribed owner of any such 
security may have or might appear to have assigned, transferred, or 
otherwise disposed of the security.


<R05>
Sec. 537.202  Prohibited exportation or reexportation of financial
services to Burma.

    Except as authorized, and notwithstanding any contracts entered into 
or any license or permit granted prior to July 29, 2003, the exportation 
or reexportation of financial services to Burma, directly or indirectly, 
from the United States or by a U.S. person, wherever located, is 
prohibited.


<R05>
Sec. 537.203  Prohibited importation of products of Burma.

    Except as otherwise authorized, and notwithstanding any contracts 
entered into or any license or permit granted prior to August 28, 2003, 
the importation into the United States of any article that is a product 
of Burma is prohibited.

    Note to Sec. 537.203: Section 3(b) of the Burmese Freedom and 
Democracy Act of 2003 provides that the prohibition contained in this 
section may be waived by the President for any or all articles that are 
a product of Burma if the President determines and notifies specified 
committees of Congress that to do so is in the national interest of the 
United States. Therefore, the Office of Foreign Assets Control will not 
issue licenses authorizing transactions prohibited under this section in 
the absence of such a waiver process. The President's waiver functions 
and authorities under section 3(b) have been delegated to the Secretary 
of State.


<R05>
Sec. 537.204  Prohibited new investment in Burma.

    Except as otherwise authorized, new investment, as defined in Sec. 
537.311, in Burma by U.S. persons is prohibited.

    Note to Sec. 537.204: Section 570 of the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 
104-208) provides that the prohibition contained in this section may be 
waived, temporarily or permanently, by the President if he determines 
and certifies to Congress that the application of this sanction would be 
contrary to the national interests of the United States. Licenses are 
thus not available for purposes of authorizing transactions prohibited 
under this section in the absence of such a waiver determination and 
certification to Congress.


<R05>
Sec. 537.205  Prohibited facilitation.

    (a) Except as otherwise authorized, U.S. persons, wherever located, 
are prohibited from approving, financing, facilitating, or guaranteeing 
a transaction by a person who is a foreign person where the transaction 
would be prohibited if performed by a U.S. person or within the United 
States.
    (b) With respect to new investment in Burma, the prohibition against 
facilitation does not include the entry into, performance of, or 
financing of a contract to sell or purchase goods, services, or 
technology unless such contract includes any of the activities described 
in Sec. 537.311(a)(2), (3) or (4).

    Note to Sec. 537.205: This section's prohibitions include, but are 
not limited to, the approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee of 
transactions prohibited by either section 570 of the Foreign Operations,

    (c) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 
180 days at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 537.201(a) may 
continue to be held until maturity in the original instrument, provided

into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph (b) 
or (d) of this section.
    (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the United 
States at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 537.201(a) may

of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to sell or 
liquidate such property at the time the property becomes subject to 
Sec. 537.201(a). However, the Office of Foreign Assets Control may 
issue licenses permitting or directing such sales in appropriate cases.
    (f) Funds subject to this section may not be held, invested, or 
reinvested in a manner that provides immediate financial or economic 
benefit or access to any person whose property or interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to Sec. 537.201(a), nor may their holder cooperate

other than those set forth in Sec. 537.203, do not apply to any 
activity undertaken pursuant to an agreement, or pursuant to the 
exercise of rights under such an agreement, that was entered into by a 
U.S. person with the Government of Burma or a non-governmental entity in 
Burma prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 21, 1997.

exportation or reexportation of financial services from the United 
States or by U.S. persons to Burma that are not necessary and ordinarily

such individualized or customized services are delivered through the use 
of information and informational materials;
    (2) The creation or undertaking of a marketing campaign for any 
person with respect to any service or product other than a written 
publication, or the creation or undertaking of a marketing campaign of 
any kind for the benefit of the State Peace and Development Council of 
Burma or the Union Solidarity and Development Association of Burma; or

informational materials, as defined in Sec. 537.308, that are products 
of Burma is authorized by the general license set forth in Sec. 
537.515. The exportation to Burma of information or informational 
materials, as defined in Sec. 537.308, whether commercial or otherwise, 
regardless of format or medium of transmission, is exempt from the 
prohibitions and regulations of this part. See Sec. 537.210(b).

    (c) This section does not authorize U.S. persons to engage in

services to Burma that relate to the services of publishing houses or 
translators in Burma unless such activity is primarily for the 
dissemination of written publications in Burma.
    (d) This section does not authorize:
    (1) The importation into the United States of any article that is a 
product of Burma.

    Note to paragraph (d)(1): The importation of information or 
informational materials, as defined in Sec. 537.308, that are products 
of Burma is authorized by the general license set forth in Sec. 
537.515.

nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological weapons or nuclear-maritime 
end-uses as set forth in part 744 of the EAR. In addition, U.S. persons 
are precluded from exporting any item subject to the EAR to certain

<R04>
                           Subpart G_Penalties


<R05>
Sec. 537.701  Penalties.

    (a) Attention is directed to section 206 of the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (the ``Act'') (50 U.S.C. 1705), which is 
applicable to violations of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant 
to this part or otherwise under the Act.
    (1) A civil penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in Section 
206 of the Act may be imposed on any person who violates, attempts to 
violate, conspires to violate, or causes a violation of any license, 
order, regulation, or prohibition issued under the Act.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 537.701: As of June 10, 2008, the 
Act provides for a maximum civil penalty not to exceed the greater of 
$250,000 or an amount that is twice the amount of the transaction that 
is the basis of the violation with respect to which the penalty is 
imposed.

    (2) A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, or 
willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of a 
violation of any license, order, regulation, or prohibition shall, upon 
conviction, be fined not more than $1,000,000, or if a natural person, 
may be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.
    (b) Adjustments to penalty amounts. (1) The civil penalties provided 
in the Act are subject to adjustment pursuant to the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410, as amended, 
28 U.S.C. 2461 note).
    (2) The criminal penalties provided in the Act are subject to 
adjustment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571.
    (c) Attention is also directed to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides 
that whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, 
legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, 
knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, 
scheme, or device, a material fact, or makes any materially false, 
fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or makes or uses 
any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially 
false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry shall be fined under 
title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not more than five years, or 
both.
    (d) Violations of this part may also be subject to relevant 
provisions of other applicable laws.

FR 32652, June 10, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 537.702  Prepenalty notice.

    (a) When required. If the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control has reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of any 
provision of this part or a violation of the provisions of any license, 
ruling, regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or 
pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the 
Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act, and the Director determines that further 
proceedings are warranted, the Director

[[Page 202]]

shall notify the alleged violator of the agency's intent to impose a 
monetary penalty by issuing a prepenalty notice. The prepenalty notice 
shall be in writing. The prepenalty notice may be issued whether or not 
another agency has taken any action with respect to the matter.
    (b) Contents of notice--(1) Facts of violation. The prepenalty 
notice shall describe the violation, specify the laws and regulations 
allegedly violated, and state the amount of the proposed monetary 
penalty.
    (2) Right to respond. The prepenalty notice also shall inform the 
respondent of the respondent's right to make a written presentation 
within the applicable 30-day period set forth in Sec. 537.703 as to why 
a monetary penalty should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the 
monetary penalty should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (c) Informal settlement prior to issuance of prepenalty notice. At 
any time prior to the issuance of a prepenalty notice, an alleged 
violator may request in writing that, for a period not to exceed 60 
days, the agency withhold issuance of the prepenalty notice for the 
exclusive purpose of effecting settlement of the agency's potential 
civil monetary penalty claims. In the event the Director grants the 
request, under terms and conditions within the Director's discretion, 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control will agree to withhold issuance of 
the prepenalty notice for a period not to exceed 60 days and will enter 
into settlement negotiations of the potential civil monetary penalty 
claim.


<R05>
Sec. 537.703  Response to prepenalty notice; informal settlement.

    (a) Deadline for response. The respondent may submit a response to 
the prepenalty notice within the applicable 30-day period set forth in 
this paragraph. The Director may grant, at the Director's discretion, an 
extension of time in which to submit a response to the prepenalty 
notice. The failure to submit a response within the applicable time 
period set forth in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of the 
right to respond.
    (1) Computation of time for response. A response to the prepenalty 
notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or 
foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider 
(if transmitted to OFAC by courier) on or before the 30th day after the 
postmark date on the envelope in which the prepenalty notice was mailed. 
If the respondent refused delivery or otherwise avoided receipt of the 
prepenalty notice, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or 
before the 30th day after the date on the stamped postal receipt 
maintained at the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If the prepenalty 
notice was personally delivered to the respondent by a non-U.S. Postal 
Service agent authorized by the Director, a response must be postmarked 
or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (2) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at 
the Director's discretion, only upon the respondent's specific request 
to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (b) Form and method of response. The response must be submitted in 
typewritten form and signed by the respondent or a representative 
thereof. The response need not be in any particular form. A copy of the 
written response may be sent by facsimile, but the original also must be 
sent to the Office of Foreign Assets Control Civil Penalties Division by 
mail or courier and must be postmarked or date-stamped, in accordance 
with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Contents of response. A written response must contain 
information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the 
prepenalty notice.
    (1) A written response must include the respondent's full name, 
address, telephone number, and facsimile number, if available, or those 
of the representative of the respondent.
    (2) A written response should either admit or deny each specific 
violation alleged in the prepenalty notice and also state if the 
respondent has no knowledge of a particular violation. If the written 
response fails to address any specific violation alleged in the 
prepenalty notice, that alleged violation shall be deemed to be 
admitted.

[[Page 203]]

    (3) A written response should include any information in defense, 
evidence in support of an asserted defense, or other factors that the 
respondent requests the Office of Foreign Assets Control to consider. 
Any defense or explanation previously made to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control or any other agency must be repeated in the written 
response. Any defense not raised in the written response will be 
considered waived. The written response also should set forth the 
reasons why the respondent believes the penalty should not be imposed or 
why, if imposed, it should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (d) Failure to Respond. Where OFAC receives no response to a 
prepenalty notice within the applicable time period set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section, a penalty notice generally will be 
issued, taking into account the mitigating and/or aggravating factors 
present in the record. If there are no mitigating factors present in the 
record, or the record contains a preponderance of aggravating factors, 
the proposed prepenalty amount generally will be assessed as the final 
penalty.
    (e) Informal settlement. In addition to or as an alternative to a 
written response to a prepenalty notice, the respondent or respondent's 
representative may contact the Office of Foreign Assets Control as 
advised in the prepenalty notice to propose the settlement of 
allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and related matters. 
However, the requirements set forth in paragraph (f) of this section as 
to oral communication by the representative must first be fulfilled. In 
the event of settlement at the prepenalty stage, the claim proposed in 
the prepenalty notice will be withdrawn, the respondent will not be 
required to take a written position on allegations contained in the 
prepenalty notice, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control will make no 
final determination as to whether a violation occurred. The amount 
accepted in settlement of allegations in a prepenalty notice may vary 
from the civil penalty that might finally be imposed in the event of a 
formal determination of violation. In the event no settlement is 
reached, the time limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section for 
written response to the prepenalty notice will remain in effect unless 
additional time is granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (f) Guidelines. Guidelines for the imposition or settlement of civil 
penalties by the Office of Foreign Assets Control have been codified in 
the Appendix to the Reporting, Procedures and Penalties Regulations, 31 
CFR part 501.
    (g) Representation. A representative of the respondent may act on 
behalf of the respondent, but any oral communication with the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission regarding the 
specific allegations contained in the prepenalty notice must be preceded 
by a written letter of representation, unless the prepenalty notice was 
served upon the respondent in care of the representative.


<R05>
Sec. 537.704  Penalty imposition or withdrawal.

    (a) No violation. If, after considering any response to the 
prepenalty notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control determines that there was no violation by the 
respondent named in the prepenalty notice, the Director shall notify the 
respondent in writing of that determination and of the cancellation of 
the proposed monetary penalty.
    (b) Violation.--(1) If, after considering any written response to 
the prepenalty notice, or default in the submission of a written 
response, and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control determines that there was a violation by the respondent 
named in the prepenalty notice, the Director is authorized to issue a 
written penalty notice to the respondent of the determination of the 
violation and the imposition of the monetary penalty.
    (2) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent that payment or 
arrangement for installment payment of the assessed penalty must be made 
within 30 days of the date of mailing of the penalty notice by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent of the 
requirement to furnish the respondent's taxpayer identification number 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 7701 and that such number will be used

[[Page 204]]

for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent penalty 
amount.
    (4) The issuance of the penalty notice finding a violation and 
imposing a monetary penalty shall constitute final agency action. The 
respondent has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency 
action in federal district court.


<R05>
Sec. 537.705  Administrative collection; referral to United States 
Department of Justice.

    In the event that the respondent does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control within 30 days of the 
date of mailing of the penalty notice, the matter may be referred for 
administrative collection measures by the Department of the Treasury or 
to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate action to 
recover the penalty in a civil suit in a federal district court.

Sec. 538.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    (a) This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts 
of this chapter with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Differing foreign policy 
and national security contexts may result in differing interpretations 
of similar language among the parts of this chapter. No license or 
authorization contained in or issued pursuant to those other parts 
authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No license or 
authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other provision of 
law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part.
    (b) No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations.


<R04>
                         Subpart B_Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 538.201  Prohibited transactions involving blocked property.

    (a) Except as authorized by regulations, orders, directives, 
rulings, instructions, licenses, or otherwise, no property or interests 
in property of the Government of Sudan, that are in the United States, 
that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter 
come within the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their 
overseas branches, may be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn or 
otherwise dealt in.
    (b) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, the transfer (including the

transportation, importation, exportation, or withdrawal of, or the 
endorsement or guaranty of signatures on, or otherwise dealing in any 
security (or evidence thereof) registered or inscribed in the name of 
the Government of Sudan, and held within the possession or control of a 
U.S. person is prohibited, irrespective of the fact that at any time 
(either prior to, on, or subsequent to the effective date) the 
registered or inscribed owner thereof may have, or appears to have, 
assigned, transferred, or otherwise disposed of any such security.
    (c) When a transaction results in the blocking of funds at a 
financial institution pursuant to this section and a party to the 
transaction believes the funds have been blocked due to mistaken 
identity, that party may seek to have such funds unblocked pursuant to 
the administrative procedures set forth in Sec. 501.806 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 538.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, license, or other authorization hereunder and 
involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec. 
538.201 is null and void and shall not be the basis for the assertion or 
recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power or privilege with 
respect to such property or property interests.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or interest in, any property or interest in property blocked 
pursuant to Sec. 538.201, unless the person with whom such property is 
held or maintained, prior to such date, had written notice of the 
transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer.

[[Page 207]]

    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, or 
after a transfer shall validate such transfer or render it enforceable 
to the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the 
provisions of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, this 
part, and any regulation, order, directive, ruling, instruction, or 
license issued hereunder.
    (d) Transfers of property which otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property was held or maintained (and as to such person only) in 
cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property was held 
or maintained;
    (2) The person with whom such property was held or maintained did 
not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts 
and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer 
required a license or authorization by or pursuant to this part and was 
not so licensed or authorized, or if a license or authorization did 
purport to cover the transfer, that such license or authorization had 
been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or the withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property was held or maintained filed 
with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth in full 
the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon discovery

authorization hereunder; or
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director of 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or the 
withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

    Note to paragraph (d): The filing of a report in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall not be deemed 
evidence that the terms of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section 
have been satisfied.

    (e) Unless licensed or authorized pursuant to this part, any 
attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other 
judicial process is null and void with respect to any property or 
interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec. 538.201.

    (c) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 
180 days at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 538.201 may

into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph (b) 
or (d) of this section.
    (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the United 
States at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 538.201 may

<R05>
Sec. 538.406  Exportation of services; performance of service contracts;
legal services.

    (a) The prohibition on the exportation of services contained in 
Sec. 538.205 applies to services performed on behalf of the Government 
of Sudan, or where the benefit of such services is otherwise received in 
Sudan, when such services are performed:
    (1) In the United States;
    (2) By a U.S. person, wherever located;

[[Page 214]]

    (3) By an entity located in the United States, including its 
overseas branches; or
    (4) Outside the United States by an individual U.S. person 
ordinarily resident in the United States.
    (b) The benefit of services performed anywhere in the world on 
behalf of the Government of Sudan, including services performed for a 
controlled entity or agent of the Government of Sudan, is presumed to be 
received in Sudan.
    (c) The prohibitions contained in Sec. Sec. 538.201 and 538.207 
apply to services performed by U.S. persons, wherever located:
    (1) On behalf of the Government of Sudan;
    (2) With respect to property interests of the Government of Sudan; 
or
    (3) In support of an industrial, commercial, public utility or 
governmental project in Sudan.
    (d) Example: U.S. persons may not, without specific authorization 
from the Office of Foreign Assets Control, represent an individual or 
entity with respect to contract negotiations, contract performance, 
commercial arbitration, or other business dealings with the Government 
of Sudan. See Sec. 538.505 on licensing policy with regard to the 
provision of certain legal services.


<R05>
Sec. 538.407  Facilitation by a United States person.

    (a) The prohibition contained in Sec. 538.206 against facilitation 
by a United States person of the exportation or reexportation of goods, 
technology, or services between Sudan and any destination (including the 
United States) bars any unlicensed action by a U.S. person that assists 
or supports trading activity with Sudan by any person. Facilitation of a 
trade or financial transaction that could be engaged in directly by a 
U.S. person or from the United States consistent with the prohibitions, 
general licenses and exemptions contained in this part is not 
prohibited. Activity of a purely clerical or reporting nature that does 
not further trade or financial transactions with Sudan or the Government 
of Sudan is not considered prohibited facilitation. For example, 
reporting on the results of a subsidiary's trade with Sudan is not 
prohibited, while financing or insuring that trade or warranting the 
quality of goods sold by a subsidiary to the Government of Sudan 
constitutes prohibited facilitation.
    (b) To avoid potential liability for U.S. persons under this part, a 
U.S. parent corporation must ensure that its foreign subsidiaries act 
independently of any U.S. person with respect to all transactions and 
activities relating to the exportation or reexportation of goods, 
technology, or services between Sudan and any other location including 
but not limited to business and legal planning; decision making; 
designing, ordering or transporting goods; and financial, insurance, and 
other risks. See Sec. 538.505 with respect to exports of, inter alia, 
certain legal services benefitting Sudan.
    (c) No U.S. person may change its policies or operating procedures, 
or those of a foreign affiliate or subsidiary, in order to enable a 
foreign entity owned or controlled by U.S. persons to enter into a 
transaction that could not be entered into directly by a U.S. person or 
from the United States pursuant to this part.
    (d) No U.S. person may refer to a foreign person purchase orders, 
requests for bids, or similar business opportunities involving Sudan or 
the Government of Sudan to which the United States person could not 
directly respond as a result of the prohibitions contained in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 538.408  Offshore transactions.

    (a) The prohibitions contained in Sec. Sec. 538.201 and 538.206 
apply to transactions by any U.S. person in a location outside the 
United States with respect to property in which the U.S. person knows, 
or has reason to know, the Government of Sudan has or has had an 
interest since the effective date, or with respect to goods, technology 
or services which the U.S. person knows, or has reason to know, are of 
Sudanese origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Sudan.
    (b) Prohibited transactions include, but are not limited to, 
importation into or exportation from locations outside the United States 
of, or purchasing, selling, financing, swapping, insuring, transporting, 
lifting, storing, incorporating, transforming,

[[Page 215]]

brokering, or otherwise dealing in, within such locations, goods, 
technology or services of Sudanese origin.
    (c) Examples. (1) A U.S. person may not, within the United States or 
abroad, purchase, sell, finance, insure, transport, act as a broker for 
the sale or transport of, or otherwise deal in, Sudanese crude oil or 
sugar refined in Sudan.
    (2) A U.S. person may not, within the United States or abroad, 
conduct transactions of any nature whatsoever with an entity that the 
U.S. person knows or has reason to know is the Government of Sudan, 
including a controlled entity or agent of that Government, or which 
benefits or supports the business of an entity located in Sudan, unless 
the entity is licensed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control to 
conduct such transactions with U.S. persons or the transaction is 
generally licensed in, or exempted from the prohibitions of, this part.


<R05>
Sec. 538.409  Transshipments through the United States prohibited.

    (a) The prohibitions in Sec. 538.205 apply to the importation into 
the United States, for transshipment or transit, of goods which are 
intended or destined for Sudan, or an entity operated from Sudan.
    (b) The prohibitions in Sec. 538.204 apply to the importation into 
the United States, for transshipment or transit, of goods of Sudanese

imported into or transshipped through the United States are blocked

Sec. 538.410  Imports of Sudanese goods from third countries; 
transshipments.

that have been transshipped through a third country without being 
incorporated into manufactured products or otherwise substantially 
transformed in a third country are prohibited.

    Exportation of goods or technology (including technical data, 
software, information not exempted from the prohibition of this part 
pursuant to Sec. 538.211, or technical assistance) from the United 
States to third countries is prohibited if the exporter knows, or has 
reason to know, that the goods or technology are intended for 
transshipment to Sudan (including passage through, or storage in, 
intermediate destinations). The exportation of goods or technology 
intended specifically for incorporation or substantial transformation 
into a third-country product is also prohibited if the particular 
product is to be used in Sudan, is being specifically manufactured to 
fill a Sudanese order, or if the manufacturer's sales of the particular 
product are predominantly to Sudan.


<R05>
Sec. 538.414  Loans or extensions of credit.

    (a) The prohibition in Sec. 538.205 applies to loans or extensions 
of credit to a person in Sudan, including overdraft protection on 
checking accounts, and the unlicensed renewal or rescheduling of credits 
or loans in existence as of the effective date, whether by affirmative 
action or operation of law.
    (b) The prohibition in Sec. 538.205 applies to financial services 
including loans or credits extended in any currency.


<R05>
Sec. 538.415  Payments involving Sudan.

    Before a United States financial institution initiates a payment 
subject to the prohibitions contained in this part on behalf of any 
customer, or credits a transfer subject to such prohibitions to the 
account on its books of the ultimate beneficiary, the U.S. financial 
institution must determine that the transfer is not prohibited by this 
part.

[[Page 216]]


<R05>
Sec. 538.416  Payments from blocked accounts to U.S. exporters and for
other obligations prohibited.

    No debits may be made to a blocked account to pay obligations to 
U.S. persons or other persons, including payment for goods, technology 
or services exported prior to the effective date, except as authorized 
pursuant to this part.


<R05>
Sec. 538.417  Transshipments through Sudan.

    (a) The exportation or reexportation of goods, technology, or 
services to the Specified Areas of Sudan is exempt under Sec. 
538.212(g) only if such goods, technology, or services do not transit or 
transship through any area of Sudan other than the Specified Areas of 
Sudan.
    (b) The importation into the United States of goods or services 
from, or originating in, the Specified Areas of Sudan is exempt under 
Sec. 538.212(g) only if such goods or services do not transit or 
transship through any area of Sudan other than the Specified Areas of 
Sudan.
    Note to Sec. 538.417. See Sec. 538.532, which authorizes 
humanitarian transshipments to or from Southern Sudan and Darfur.

[72 FR 61516, Oct. 31, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 538.418  Financial transactions in Sudan.

    (a) Any financial transaction with a depository institution located 
in an area of Sudan other than the Specified Areas of Sudan, e.g., 
Khartoum, remains prohibited.
    (b) Financial transactions are no longer prohibited by this part if:
    (1) The underlying activity is not prohibited by this part;
    (2) The financial transaction involves a third-country depository 
institution, or a Sudanese depository institution not owned or 
controlled by the Government of Sudan, that is located in the Specified 
Areas of Sudan; and
    (3) The financial transaction is not routed through a depository 
institution that is located in an area of Sudan other than the Specified 
Areas of Sudan or that is owned or controlled by the Government of 
Sudan, wherever located.
    (c) Example. A U.S. bank is instructed to transfer funds to the 
Abyei branch of a Sudanese bank that is not owned or controlled by the 
Government of Sudan. In order for the transfer to take place, the U.S. 
bank is required to route the funds through the Sudanese bank's 
headquarters, which is located in Khartoum. Due to the routing of the 
financial transaction through Khartoum, this transaction is prohibited 
and requires authorization from the Office of Foreign Assets Control. 
However, if the U.S. bank is able to bypass the Khartoum headquarters 
and transfer the funds directly to the Abyei branch of the Sudanese 
bank, then the transaction would not be prohibited.

<R05>
Sec. 538.501  Effect of license or authorization.

    (a) No license or other authorization contained in this part, or 
otherwise issued by or under the direction of the Director of the Office 
of Foreign Assets Control, authorizes or validates any transaction 
effected prior to the issuance of the license, unless specifically 
provided in such license or authorization.
    (b) No regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizes any 
transaction prohibited under this part unless the regulation, ruling, 
instruction, or license is issued by the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control and specifically refers to this part. No regulation, ruling, 
instruction, or license referring to this part shall be deemed to 
authorize any transaction prohibited by any provision of this chapter 
unless the regulation, ruling, instruction or license specifically 
refers to such provision.

[[Page 217]]

    (c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizing any 
transaction otherwise prohibited under this part has the effect of 
removing a prohibition or prohibitions contained in this part from the 
transaction, but only to the extent specifically stated by its terms. 
Unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license otherwise 
specifies, such an authorization does not create any right, duty, 
obligation, claim, or interest in, or with respect to, any property 
which would not otherwise exist under ordinary principles of law.


<R05>
Sec. 538.502  Exclusion from licenses and authorizations.

    The Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control reserves the 
right to exclude any person, property, or transaction from the operation 
of any license, or from the privileges therein conferred, or to restrict

transactions, or classes thereof. Such action shall be binding upon all 
persons receiving actual or constructive notice of such exclusion or 
restriction.


<R05>
Sec. 538.503  Payments and transfers to blocked accounts in U.S. financial 
institutions.

    Any payment of funds or transfer of credit in which the Government 
of Sudan has any interest, that comes within the possession or control 
of a U.S. financial institution, must be blocked in an account on the 
books of that financial institution. A transfer of funds or credit by a 
U.S. financial institution between blocked accounts in its branches or 
offices is authorized, provided that no transfer is made from an account 
within the United States to an account held outside the United States, 
and further provided that a transfer from a blocked account may only be 
made to another blocked account held in the same name.

    Note to Sec. 538.503: Please refer to Sec. 501.603 of this chapter 
for mandatory reporting requirements regarding financial transfers. See 
also Sec. 538.203 concerning the obligation to hold blocked funds in 
interest-bearing accounts.


<R05>
Sec. 538.504  Entries in certain accounts for normal service charges

    (a) The provision to the Government of Sudan, to a person in Sudan, 
or in circumstances in which the benefit is otherwise received in Sudan, 
of the legal services set forth in paragraph (b) of this section is 
authorized, provided that all receipts of payment therefor must be 
specifically licensed. The provision of any other legal services as 
interpreted in Sec. 538.406 requires the issuance of a specific 
license.
    (b) Specific licenses may be issued, on a case-by-case basis, 
authorizing receipt, from unblocked sources, of payment of professional 
fees and reimbursement of incurred expenses for the following legal 
services by U.S. persons to the Government of Sudan or to a person in 
Sudan:
    (1) Provision of legal advice and counseling to the Government of 
Sudan, to a person in Sudan, or in circumstances in which the benefit is 
otherwise received in Sudan, on the requirements of and compliance with 
the laws of any jurisdiction within the United States, provided that 
such advice and counseling is not provided to facilitate transactions in 
violation of this part;

when named as a defendant in or otherwise made a party to domestic U.S.

    (c) Enforcement of any lien, judgment, arbitral award, decree, or 
other order through execution, garnishment or other judicial process

Sec. 538.506  30-day delayed effective date for pre-November 4, 1997 trade 
contracts involving Sudan.

    (a) Pre-existing trade contracts. Trade transactions required under 
a contract entered into prior to November 4, 1997 (a ``pre-existing 
trade contract''), otherwise prohibited by this part, including the 
importation of goods or services of Sudanese origin or the exportation 
of goods, services, or technology that was authorized under applicable 
Federal regulations in force immediately prior to November 4, 1997, are 
authorized without specific licensing by the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control as follows:
    (1) Exports or reexports are authorized until 12:01 a.m. EST, 
December 4, 1997, and non-financing activity by U.S. persons incidental 
to the performance of the pre-existing trade contract (such as the 
provision of transportation or insurance) is authorized through 12:01 
a.m. EST, February 2, 1998, if the pre-existing trade contract is for:
    (i) The exportation of goods, services, or technology from the 
United States or a third country that was authorized under applicable 
Federal regulations in force immediately prior to November 4, 1997; or
    (ii) The reexportation of goods or technology that was authorized 
under applicable Federal regulations in force immediately prior to 
November 4, 1997.
    (2) If the pre-existing trade contract is for the importation of 
goods or services of Sudanese origin or other trade transactions 
relating to goods or services of Sudanese origin or owned or controlled 
by the Government of Sudan, importations under the pre-existing trade 
contract are authorized until 12:01 a.m. EST, December 4, 1997.
    (3) For purposes of this section, goods are considered to be 
exported upon final loading aboard the exporting conveyance in the 
country of export. Goods are considered to be imported upon arrival in 
the jurisdiction of the country of importation.
    (b)(1) Financing for pre-existing trade contracts. In general, no 
financing services prohibited by this part may be performed after 12:01 
a.m. EST, November 4, 1997. However, letters of credit and other 
financing agreements with respect to the trade transactions authorized 
in paragraph (a) of this section may be performed according to their 
terms, and may be extended or renewed, except that:
    (i) Any payment required to be made to the Government of Sudan or 
any person blocked pursuant to this part or otherwise, including 
payments authorized with respect to trade transactions described in 
paragraph (a) of this section, must be made into a blocked account in 
the United States; and
    (ii) No payment may be made from a blocked account unless authorized 
by a specific license issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Controls.
    (2) Specific licenses may be issued by the Office of Foreign Asset 
Controls on a case-by-case basis to permit a U.S. bank to debit a 
blocked account of the Government of Sudan for funds held as collateral 
under an irrevocable letter of credit issued or confirmed by it, or a 
letter of credit reimbursement confirmed by it, for goods, services or 
technology exported, or goods or technology reexported, prior to 12:01 
a.m.

[[Page 219]]

EST, December 4, 1997, directly or indirectly to Sudan, or to third 
countries for an entity operated from Sudan, or for the benefit of the 
Government of Sudan. The application for a license must:
    (i) Present evidence satisfactory to the Office of Foreign Asset 
Controls that the exportation or reexportation occurred prior to 12:01 
a.m. EST, December 4, 1997; and

surrounding the entry and execution of the export or reexport 
transaction, including the names and addresses of all Sudanese 
participants in the transaction and all Sudanese persons having an 
ownership interest in the beneficiary of the letter of credit.
    (c) Blocked Government of Sudan accounts. Nothing in this section 
permits debits to a blocked account of the Government of Sudan absent 
the issuance of a specific license by Office of Foreign Asset Controls 
authorizing such a debit. The operation of an account of the Government 
of Sudan in a financial institution does not constitute a trade 
transaction for purposes of this section.
    (d) Existence of contract. The existence of a contract will be 
determined with reference to the principles contained in Article 2 of 
the Uniform Commercial Code.
    (e) Reporting requirement. Although a specific license from Office 
of Foreign Asset Controls is not required for any transaction authorized 
in paragraph (a) of this section, any U.S. person engaging in a 
transaction described in paragraph (a) of this section is required to 
report such transaction immediately to the Office of Foreign Asset 
Controls and provide a description of the underlying trade contract. 
Such reports should be directed to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, 
Attn: Compliance Programs Division/Sudan Contracts, 1500 Pennsylvania 
Avenue, NW., Annex-2nd Floor, Washington, DC 20220. Such reports may be 
made by facsimile transmission to 202/622-1657.

applications to the Office of Foreign Asset Controls for specific 
licenses and reporting requirements, see Sec. Sec. 501.606 and 501.808 
of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 538.507  Reexports by non-U.S. persons.

requirements under other United States regulations. The reexportation to

technology of U.S. origin, the exportation of which to Sudan is not 
subject to any export license application requirements under any other 
United States regulations, is authorized under this section.

    Note to paragraph (b) of Sec. 538.507: However, the reexportation 
by non-U.S. persons of U.S.-origin goods, technology or software 
classified as EAR99 under the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR 
parts 730 through 774) may require specific authorization from the 
Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security. See, for 
example, the end-use and end-user restrictions set forth in 15 CFR part 
744.

by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets 
Control, for contracts entered into during the one-year period of the

the signing of the contract. No license will be granted for the 
exportation or reexportation of agricultural commodities, medicine, or 
medical equipment to any entity or individual in Sudan promoting 
international terrorism. Executory contracts entered into pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section prior to the issuance of the one-year 
license described in this paragraph shall be deemed to have been signed 
on the date of issuance of that one-year license (and, therefore, the 
exporter is authorized to make shipments under that contract within the 
12-month period beginning on the date of issuance of the one-year 
license).
    (b) General license for arrangement of exportation or reexportation 
of covered products. (1) The making of shipping arrangements, cargo 
inspection, obtaining of insurance, and arrangement of financing 
(consistent with Sec. 538.525) for the exportation or reexportation of 
agricultural commodities, medicine, or medical devices to the Government 
of Sudan, entities in Sudan, individuals in Sudan, or persons in third 
countries purchasing specifically for resale to any of the foregoing, is 
authorized.
    (2) If desired, entry into executory contracts (including executory 
pro forma invoices, agreements in principle, or executory offers capable 
of acceptance such as bids in response to public tenders) for the 
exportation or reexportation of agricultural commodities, medicine, and 
medical devices to the Government of Sudan, entities in Sudan, 
individuals in Sudan, or persons in third countries purchasing 
specifically for resale to any of the foregoing, is authorized, provided 
that performance of an executory contract is expressly made contingent 
upon the prior issuance of the one-year license described in paragraph 
(a) of this section.
    (c) Instructions for obtaining one-year licenses. In order to obtain 
the one-year license described in paragraph (a), the exporter must 
provide to the Office of Foreign Assets Control:
    (1) The applicant's full legal name (if the applicant is a business 
entity, the state or jurisdiction of incorporation and principal place 
of business).
    (2) The applicant's mailing and street address (so that OFAC may 
reach a responsible point of contact, the applicant should also include 
the name of the individual(s) responsible for the application and 
related commercial transactions along with their telephone and fax 
numbers and, if available, email addresses).
    (3) The names, mailing addresses, and if available, fax and 
telephone numbers of all parties with an interest in the transaction. If 
the goods are being exported or reexported to a purchasing agent in 
Sudan, the exporter must identify the agent's principals at the 
wholesale level for whom the purchase is being made. If the goods are 
being exported or reexported to an individual, the exporter must 
identify any organizations or entities with which the individual is 
affiliated that have an interest in the transaction.
    (4) A description of all items to be exported or reexported pursuant 
to the requested one-year license, including a statement that the item

[[Page 224]]

EAR 99, and, if necessary, documentation sufficient to verify that the 
items to be exported or reexported are classified as EAR 99 and do not 
fall within any of the limitations contained in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (5) An Official Commodity Classification of EAR 99 issued by the 
Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration (``BXA''), 
certifying that the product is EAR 99 is required to be submitted to 
OFAC with the request for a license authorizing the exportation or 
reexportation of all fertilizers, live horses, western red cedar, and 
medical devices other than basic medical supplies, such as syringes, 
bandages, gauze and similar items, that are specifically listed on BXA's 
website, www.bxa.doc.gov/ Regulations/Trade Sanctions ReformExport 
EnhancementAct.html. Medical supplies that are specifically listed on 
BXA's website do not require an Official Commodity Classification of EAR 
99 from BXA. BXA will also provide a list on its website of medicines 
that are ineligible for a one-year license under these procedures. If an 
exporter is uncertain whether the medicine to be exported is eligible, 
they should seek an Official Commodity Classification of EAR 99 from BXA 
and submit a copy to OFAC. See, 15 CFR 745.3 for instructions for 
obtaining Official Commodity Classification of EAR 99 from BXA.
    (d) Limitations. (1) Nothing in this section or in any license 
issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section relieves the exporter 
from compliance with the export license application requirements of 
another Federal agency.

paragraph (a) of this section authorizes the exportation or

controlled on the United States Munitions List established under section 
38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778); controlled on any 
control list established under the Export Administration Act of 1979 or 
any successor statute (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.; or used to 
facilitate the development or production of a chemical or biological 
weapon or weapon of mass destruction.
    (3) Nothing in this section or in any license issued pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section affects prohibitions on the sale or supply 
of U.S. technology or software used to manufacture agricultural 
commodities, medicine, or medical devices, such as technology to design 
or produce biotechnological items or medical devices.
    (4) Nothing in this section or in any license issued pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section affects U.S. nonproliferation export 
controls, including end-user and end-use controls maintained under the 
Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative.
    (5) This section does not apply to any transaction or dealing 
involving property blocked pursuant to this chapter or to any other 
activity prohibited by this chapter that is not otherwise authorized in

Federal Food,

[[Page 225]]

Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) but does not include any item 
listed on the Commerce Control List in the Export Administration 
Regulations, 15 CFR part 774, supplement no. 1 (excluding items

    (3) Medical device. For the purposes of this section, the term

financing not authorized by the general license in paragraph (a) of this

    (d) Transfers through the U.S. financial system. Before a United

determine that the underlying transaction is not prohibited by this 
part. Any payment relating to a transaction authorized in or pursuant to 
Sec. 538.523 or Sec. 538.526 that is routed through the U.S. financial 
system must reference the relevant Office of Foreign Assets Control 
license authorizing the payment to avoid the blocking or rejection of 
the transfer.

exportation to Sudan may be made with United States Government 
assistance, including United States foreign assistance, United States 
export assistance, and any United States credit or guarantees absent a

Sec. 538.529  Authorized transactions necessary and ordinarily incident 
to publishing.

    (a) To the extent that such activities are not exempt from this 
part, and subject to the restrictions set forth in paragraphs (b) 
through (d) of this section, U.S. persons are authorized to engage in 
all transactions necessary and ordinarily incident to the publishing and 
marketing of manuscripts, books, journals, and newspapers in paper or 
electronic format (collectively, ``written publications''). This section 
does not apply if the parties to the transactions described in this 
paragraph include the Government of Sudan. For the purposes of this 
section, the term ``Government of Sudan'' includes the state and the 
Government of Sudan, as well as any political subdivision, agency, or 
instrumentality thereof, including the Central Bank of Sudan, and any 
person acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly on behalf of 
any of the foregoing with respect to the transactions described in this 
paragraph. For the purposes of this section, the term ``Government of 
Sudan'' does not include any academic and research institutions and 
their personnel. Pursuant to this section, the following activities are 
authorized, provided that U.S. persons ensure that they are not 
engaging, without separate authorization, in the activities identified 
in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section:
    (1) Commissioning and making advance payments for identifiable 
written publications not yet in existence, to the extent consistent with

navigating, or searching a written publication in electronic format, 
provided that the software is classified as ``EAR 99'' under the Export 
Administration Regulations, 15 CFR parts 730-774 (the ``EAR''), or is 
not subject to the EAR;
    (4) Substantive editing of written publications;
    (5) Payment of royalties for written publications;
    (6) Creating or undertaking a marketing campaign to promote a 
written publication; and
    (7) Other transactions necessary and ordinarily incident to the 
publishing and marketing of written publications as described in this 
paragraph (a).
    (b) This section does not authorize transactions involving the 
provision of goods or services not necessary and ordinarily incident to 
the publishing and marketing of written publications as described in 
paragraph (a) of this section. For example, this section does not 
authorize U.S. persons:
    (1) To provide or receive individualized or customized services 
(including, but not limited to, accounting, legal, design, or consulting 
services), other than those necessary and ordinarily incident to the 
publishing and marketing of written publications, even though such 
individualized or customized services are delivered through the use of 
information and informational materials;
    (2) To create or undertake for any person a marketing campaign with 
respect to any service or product other than a written publication, or 
to create or undertake a marketing campaign of any kind for the benefit 
of the Government of Sudan;

Sudan other than the exportation of embedded software described in 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section; or

[[Page 228]]

    (4) To operate a publishing house, sales outlet, or other office in 
Sudan.

    Note to paragraph (b): The importation from Sudan and the 
exportation to Sudan of information or informational materials, as

format or medium of transmission, are exempt from the prohibitions and 
regulations of this part. See Sec. 538.211(c).

    (c) This section does not authorize U.S. persons to engage the 
services of publishing houses or translators in Sudan unless such 
activity is primarily for the dissemination of written publications in 
Sudan.
    (d) This section does not authorize:
    (1) The exportation from or importation into the United States of 
services for the development, production, or design of software;
    (2) Transactions for the development, production, design, or 
marketing of technology specifically controlled by the International 
Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22 CFR parts 120 through 130 (the 
``ITAR''), the EAR, or the Department of Energy Regulations set forth at 
10 CFR part 810.
    (3) The exportation of information or technology subject to the 
authorization requirements of 10 CFR part 810, or Restricted Data as

controlled under the Atomic Energy Act and regulations therein;
    (4) The exportation of any item (including information) subject to 
the EAR where a U.S. person knows or has reason to know that the item 
will be used, directly or indirectly, with respect to certain nuclear, 
missile, chemical, or biological weapons or nuclear-maritime end-uses as 
set forth in part 744 of the EAR. In addition, U.S. persons are 
precluded from exporting any item subject to the EAR to certain 
restricted end-users, as set forth in part 744 of the EAR, as well as 
certain persons whose export privileges have been denied pursuant to 
parts 764 or 766 of the EAR, without authorization from the Department 
of Commerce; or
    (5) The exportation of information subject to licensing requirements 
under the ITAR or exchanges of information that are subject to 
regulation by other government agencies.

Sec. 538.701  Penalties.

    (a) Attention is directed to section 206 of the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (the ``Act'')(50 U.S.C. 1705), which is 
applicable to violations of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction or instruction issued by or pursuant to the 
direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to 
this part or otherwise under the Act.
    (1) A civil penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in Section 
206 of the Act may be imposed on any person who violates, attempts to 
violate, conspires to violate, or causes a violation of any license, 
order, regulation, or prohibition issued under the Act.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 538.701: As of June 10, 2008, the 
Act provides for a maximum civil penalty not to exceed the greater of 
$250,000 or an amount that is twice the amount of the transaction that 
is the basis of the violation with respect to which the penalty is 
imposed.

    (2) A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, or 
willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of a 
violation of any license, order, regulation, or prohibition shall, upon 
conviction, be fined not more than $1,000,000, or if a natural person, 
may be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.
    (b) Adjustments to penalty amounts. (1) The civil penalties provided 
in the Act are subject to adjustment pursuant to the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410, as amended, 
28 U.S.C. 2461 note).
    (2) The criminal penalties provided in the Act are subject to 
adjustment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571.
    (c) Attention is also directed to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides 
that whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, 
legislative, or judicial branch of the United States, knowingly and 
willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or 
device a material fact, or makes any materially false, fictitious or 
fraudulent statement or representation or makes or uses any false 
writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, 
fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined under title 
18, United States Code, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
    (d) Violations of this part may also be subject to relevant 
provisions of other applicable laws.

<R05>
Sec. 538.702  Prepenalty notice.

    (a) When required. If the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control has reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of any 
provision of this part or a violation of the provisions of any license, 
ruling, regulation, order, direction or instruction issued by or 
pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the 
Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act, and the Director determines that further 
proceedings are warranted, the Director shall notify the alleged 
violator of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty by issuing 
a prepenalty notice. The prepenalty notice shall be in writing. The 
prepenalty notice may be issued whether or not another agency has taken 
any action with respect to the matter.
    (b) Contents of notice.--(1) Facts of violation. The prepenalty 
notice shall describe the violation, specify the laws and regulations 
allegedly violated, and state the amount of the proposed monetary 
penalty.
    (2) Right to respond. The prepenalty notice also shall inform the 
respondent of the respondent's right to make a written presentation 
within the applicable 30-day period set forth in Sec. 538.703 as to why 
a monetary penalty should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the 
monetary penalty should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (c) Informal settlement prior to issuance of prepenalty notice. At 
any time prior to the issuance of a prepenalty notice, an alleged 
violator may request in writing that, for a period not to exceed sixty 
(60) days, the agency withhold issuance of the prepenalty notice for the 
exclusive purpose of effecting settlement of the agency's potential 
civil monetary penalty claims. In the event the Director grants the 
request, under terms and conditions within the Director's discretion, 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control will agree to withhold issuance of 
the prepenalty notice for a period not to exceed 60 days and will enter 
into settlement negotiations with respect to the potential civil 
monetary penalty claim.

[70 FR 34063, June 13, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 538.703  Response to prepenalty notice; informal settlement.

    (a) Deadline for response. The respondent may submit a response to 
the prepenalty notice within the applicable 30-day period set forth in 
this paragraph. The Director may grant, at the Director's discretion, an 
extension of time in which to submit a response to the prepenalty 
notice. The failure to submit a response within the applicable time 
period set forth in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of the 
right to respond.
    (1) Computation of time for response. A response to the prepenalty 
notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or 
foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider 
(if transmitted to OFAC by courier) on or before the 30th day after the 
postmark date on the envelope in which the prepenalty notice was mailed. 
If the respondent refused delivery or otherwise avoided receipt of the 
prepenalty notice, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or 
before the 30th day after the date on the stamped postal receipt 
maintained at the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If the prepenalty 
notice was personally delivered to the respondent by a non-U.S. Postal 
Service agent authorized by the Director, a response must be postmarked 
or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (2) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at 
the Director's discretion, only upon the respondent's specific request 
to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (b) Form and method of response. The response must be submitted in 
typewritten form and signed by the respondent or a representative 
thereof. The response need not be in any particular form. A copy of the 
written response may be sent by facsimile, but the original also must be 
sent to the Office of Foreign Assets Control Civil Penalties Division by 
mail or courier and must be postmarked or date-stamped, in accordance 
with paragraph (a) of this section.

[[Page 231]]

    (c) Contents of response. A written response must contain 
information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the 
prepenalty notice and must identify the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
identification number listed on the prepenalty notice.
    (1) A written response must include the respondent's full name, 
address, telephone number, and facsimile number, if available, or those 
of the representative of the respondent.
    (2) A written response should either admit or deny each specific 
violation alleged in the prepenalty notice and also state if the 
respondent has no knowledge of a particular violation. If the written 
response fails to address any specific violation alleged in the 
prepenalty notice, that alleged violation shall be deemed to be 
admitted.
    (3) A written response should include any information in defense, 
evidence in support of an asserted defense, or other factors that the 
respondent requests the Office of Foreign Assets Control to consider. 
Any defense or explanation previously made to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control or any other agency must be repeated in the written 
response. Any defense not raised in the written response will be 
considered waived. The written response also should set forth the 
reasons why the respondent believes the penalty should not be imposed or 
why, if imposed, it should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (d) Failure to respond. Where OFAC receives no response to a 
prepenalty notice within the applicable time period set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section, a penalty notice generally will be 
issued, taking into account the mitigating and/or aggravating factors 
present in the record. If there are no mitigating factors present in the 
record, or the record contains a preponderance of aggravating factors, 
the proposed prepenalty amount generally will be assessed as the final 
penalty.
    (e) Informal settlement. In addition to or as an alternative to a 
written response to a prepenalty notice, the respondent or respondent's 
representative may contact the Office of Foreign Assets Control's Civil 
Penalties Division as advised in the prepenalty notice to propose the 
settlement of allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and related 
matters. However, the requirements set forth in paragraph (g) of this 
section as to oral communication by the representative must first be 
fulfilled. In the event of settlement at the prepenalty stage, the claim 
proposed in the prepenalty notice will be withdrawn, the respondent will 
not be required to take a written position on allegations contained in 
the prepenalty notice, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control will 
make no final determination as to whether a violation occurred. The 
amount accepted in settlement of allegations in a prepenalty notice may 
vary from the civil penalty that might finally be imposed in the event 
of a formal determination of violation. In the event no settlement is 
reached, the time limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section for 
written response to the prepenalty notice will remain in effect, unless 
additional time is granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (f) Guidelines. Guidelines for the imposition or settlement of civil 
penalties by the Office of Foreign Assets Control have been codified in 
the Appendix to 31 CFR part 501, the Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations.
    (g) Representation. A representative of the respondent may act on 
behalf of the respondent, but any oral communication with the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission regarding the 
specific allegations contained in the prepenalty notice must be preceded 
by a written letter of representation, unless the prepenalty notice was 
served upon the respondent in care of the representative.

Sec. 538.704  Penalty imposition or withdrawal.

    (a) No violation. If, after considering any response to the 
prepenalty notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control determines that there was no violation by the 
respondent named in the prepenalty notice, the Director shall notify the 
respondent in writing of that determination and of the cancellation of 
the proposed monetary penalty.

[[Page 232]]

    (b) Violation.--(1) If, after considering any written response to 
the prepenalty notice, or default in the submission of a written 
response, and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control determines that there was a violation by the respondent 
named in the prepenalty notice, the Director is authorized to issue a 
written penalty notice to the respondent of the determination of the 
violation and the imposition of the monetary penalty.
    (2) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent that payment or 
arrangement for installment payment of the assessed penalty must be made 
within 30 days of the date of mailing of the penalty notice by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent of the 
requirement to furnish the respondent's taxpayer identification number 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 7701 and that such number will be used for 
purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent penalty amount.
    (4) The issuance of the penalty notice finding a violation and 
imposing a monetary penalty shall constitute final agency action. The 
respondent has the right to seek judicial review of that agency action 
in federal district court.

pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control within 30 days of the 
mailing of the written notice of the imposition of the penalty, the 
matter may be referred for administrative collection measures by the 
Department of the Treasury or to the United States Department of Justice 
for appropriate action to recover the penalty in a civil suit in a 
Federal district court.

such an authorization does not create any right, duty, obligation,

of any license, ruling, regulation, order, direction, or instruction 
issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary 
of the Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under the

    (b) Contents--(1) Facts of violation. The prepenalty notice shall

penalty should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the monetary penalty 
should be in a lesser amount than proposed.


<R05>
Sec. 539.703  Response to prepenalty notice; informal settlement.

the date of mailing of the prepenalty notice to make a written response 
to the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (b) Form and contents of response. The written response need not be

imposed or why, if imposed, it should be in a lesser amount than 
proposed.
    (c) Informal settlement. In addition or as an alternative to a 
written response to a prepenalty notice issued pursuant to this section, 
the respondent or respondent's representative may contact the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control as advised in the prepenalty notice to propose 
the settlement of allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and

imposed in the event of a formal determination of violation. In the 
event no settlement is reached, the 30-day period specified in paragraph 
(a) of this section for written response to the prepenalty notice 
remains in effect unless additional time is granted by the Office of

Sec. 540.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    (a) This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts

other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to

foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this

license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other 
provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by 
this part.

from any requirement to obtain a license or other authorization from any 
department or agency of the United States Government in compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations subject to the jurisdiction of that 
department or agency, and no license contained in or issued pursuant to 
this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations.

the basis for the assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, 
remedy, power, or privilege with respect to such property or property 
interests.

assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in property 
blocked pursuant to Sec. 540.201, unless the person with whom such 
property is held or maintained, prior to that date, had written notice 
of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of

    (d) The Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control may, in his 
discretion, retroactively license a transfer of property that is null 
and void or unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section so 
that such a transfer shall not be deemed to be null and void or 
unenforceable as to any person with whom such property was held or 
maintained (and as to such person only) in cases in which such person is 
able to establish to the satisfaction of the Director of the Office of

    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property was held 
or maintained;
    (2) The person with whom such property was held or maintained did 
not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts 
and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer 
required a license or authorization issued pursuant to this part and was 
not so licensed or authorized, or if a license or authorization did 
purport to cover the transfer, that such license or authorization had 
been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding of 
material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and

with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth in full

Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provided

if it is the rate currently offered to other depositors on deposits or 
instruments of comparable size and maturity.
    (3) Funds held or placed in a blocked account pursuant to this 
paragraph (b) may not be invested in instruments the maturity of which 
exceeds 180 days. If interest is credited to a separate blocked account

the same.
    (c) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 
180 days at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 540.201 may

States at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 540.201 may

holder of blocked tangible property, such as chattels or real estate, or 
of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to sell or 
liquidate such property at the time the property becomes subject to 
Sec. 540.201. However, the Office of Foreign Assets Control may issue 
licenses permitting or directing such sales in appropriate cases.
    (f) Except as otherwise licensed, authorized or directed by OFAC, 
funds subject to this section may not be invested, used for collateral 
or reinvested in a manner which provides immediate financial or economic 
benefit or access to the Government of the Russian Federation or its

United States to an account held outside the United States, and further 
provided that a transfer from a blocked account may only be made to 
another blocked account held in the same name. U.S. financial

<R05>
Sec. 540.701  Penalties.

    (a) Attention is directed to section 206 of the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (the ``Act'') (50 U.S.C. 1705), which is 
applicable to violations of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant 
to this part or otherwise under the Act.
    (1) A civil penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in Section 
206 of the Act may be imposed on any person who violates, attempts to 
violate, conspires to violate, or causes a violation of any license, 
order, regulation, or prohibition issued under the Act.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 540.701: As of June 10, 2008, the 
Act provides for a maximum civil penalty not to exceed the greater of 
$250,000 or an amount that is twice the amount of the transaction that 
is the basis of the violation with respect to which the penalty is 
imposed.

    (2) A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, or 
willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of a 
violation of any license, order, regulation, or prohibition shall, upon 
conviction, be fined not more than $1,000,000, or if a natural person, 
may be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.
    (b) Adjustments to penalty amounts. (1) The civil penalties provided 
in the Act are subject to adjustment pursuant to the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410, as amended, 
28 U.S.C. 2461 note).
    (2) The criminal penalties provided in the Act are subject to 
adjustment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571.
    (c) Attention is also directed to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides 
that whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, 
legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, 
knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, 
scheme, or device, a material fact, or makes any materially false, 
fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation or makes or uses 
any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially 
false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or

[[Page 249]]

entry shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned 
not more than five years, or both.
    (d) Violations of this part may also be subject to relevant 
provisions of other applicable laws.

FR 32653, June 10, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 540.702  Prepenalty notice.

    (a) When required. If the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control has reasonable cause to believe that there has occurred a 
violation of any provision of this part or a violation of the provisions 
of any license, ruling, regulation, order, direction, or instruction 
issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary 
of the Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and the Director determines 
that further proceedings are warranted, the Director shall notify the 
alleged violator of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty by 
issuing a prepenalty notice. The prepenalty notice shall be in writing. 
The prepenalty notice may be issued whether or not another agency has 
taken any action with respect to the matter.
    (b) Contents of notice--(1) Facts of violation. The prepenalty 
notice shall describe the violation, specify the laws and regulations 
allegedly violated, and state the amount of the proposed monetary 
penalty.
    (2) Right to respond. The prepenalty notice also shall inform the 
respondent of respondent's right to make a written presentation within 
the applicable 30 day period set forth in Sec. 540.703 as to why a 
monetary penalty should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the monetary 
penalty should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (c) Informal settlement prior to issuance of prepenalty notice. At 
any time prior to the issuance of a prepenalty notice, an alleged 
violator may request in writing that, for a period not to exceed sixty 
(60) days, the agency withhold issuance of the prepenalty notice for the 
exclusive purpose of effecting settlement of the agency's potential 
civil monetary penalty claims. In the event the Director grants the 
request, under terms and conditions within his discretion, the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control will agree to withhold issuance of the prepenalty 
notice for a period not to exceed 60 days and will enter into settlement 
negotiations of the potential civil monetary penalty claim.


<R05>
Sec. 540.703  Response to prepenalty notice; informal settlement.

    (a) Deadline for response. The respondent may submit a response to 
the prepenalty notice within the applicable 30 day period set forth in 
this paragraph. The Director may grant, at his discretion, an extension 
of time in which to submit a response to the prepenalty notice. The 
failure to submit a response within the applicable time period set forth 
in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to 
respond.
    (1) Computation of time for response. A response to the prepenalty 
notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or 
foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider 
(if transmitted to OFAC by courier) on or before the 30th day after the 
postmark date on the envelope in which the prepenalty notice was mailed. 
If the respondent refused delivery or otherwise avoided receipt of the 
prepenalty notice, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or 
before the 30th day after the date on the stamped postal receipt 
maintained at the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If the prepenalty 
notice was personally delivered to the respondent by a non-U.S. Postal 
Service agent authorized by the Director, a response must be postmarked 
or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (2) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at 
the Director's discretion, only upon the respondent's specific request 
to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (b) Form and method of response. The response must be submitted in 
writing and may be handwritten or typed. The response need not be in any 
particular form. A copy of the written response

[[Page 250]]

may be sent by facsimile, but the original must also be sent to the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control Civil Penalties Division by mail or 
courier and must be postmarked or date-stamped, in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Contents of response. A written response must contain 
information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the 
prepenalty notice.
    (1) A written response must include the respondent's full name, 
address, telephone number, and facsimile number, if available, or those 
of the representative of the respondent.
    (2) A written response should either admit or deny each specific 
violation alleged in the prepenalty notice and also state if the 
respondent has no knowledge of a particular violation. If the written 
response fails to address any specific violation alleged in the 
prepenalty notice, that alleged violation shall be deemed to be 
admitted.
    (3) A written response should include any information in defense, 
evidence in support of an asserted defense, or other factors that the 
respondent requests the Office of Foreign Assets Control to consider. 
Any defense or explanation previously made to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control or any other agency must be repeated in the written 
response. Any defense not raised in the written response will be 
considered waived. The written response should also set forth the 
reasons why the respondent believes the penalty should not be imposed or 
why, if imposed, it should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (d) Default. If the respondent elects not to submit a written 
response within the time limit set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section, the Office of Foreign Assets Control will conclude that the 
respondent has decided not to respond to the prepenalty notice. The 
agency generally will then issue a written penalty notice imposing the 
penalty proposed in the prepenalty notice.
    (e) Informal settlement. In addition to or as an alternative to a 
written response to a prepenalty notice, the respondent or respondent's 
representative may contact the Office of Foreign Assets Control as 
advised in the prepenalty notice to propose the settlement of 
allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and related matters. 
However, the requirements set forth in paragraph (f) of this section as 
to oral communication by the representative must first be fulfilled. In 
the event of settlement at the prepenalty stage, the claim proposed in 
the prepenalty notice will be withdrawn, the respondent will not be 
required to take a written position on allegations contained in the 
prepenalty notice, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control will make no 
final determination as to whether a violation occurred. The amount 
accepted in settlement of allegations in a prepenalty notice may vary 
from the civil penalty that might finally be imposed in the event of a 
formal determination of violation. In the event no settlement is 
reached, the time limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section for 
written response to the prepenalty notice remains in effect unless 
additional time is granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (f) Representation. A representative of the respondent may act on 
behalf of the respondent, but any oral communication with the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission regarding the 
specific allegations contained in the prepenalty notice must be preceded 
by a written letter of representation, unless the prepenalty notice was 
served upon the respondent in care of the representative.


<R05>
Sec. 540.704  Penalty imposition or withdrawal.

    (a) No violation. If, after considering any response to the 
prepenalty notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control determines that there was no violation by the 
respondent named in the prepenalty notice, the Director shall notify the 
respondent in writing of that determination and the cancellation of the 
proposed monetary penalty.
    (b) Violation. (1) If, after considering any written response to the 
prepenalty notice, or default in the submission of a written response, 
and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control determines that there was a violation by the respondent named in 
the prepenalty notice, the Director is authorized to issue a written

[[Page 251]]

penalty notice to the respondent of the determination of violation and 
the imposition of the monetary penalty.
    (2) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent that payment or 
arrangement for installment payment of the assessed penalty must be made 
within 30 days of the date of mailing of the penalty notice by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent of the 
requirement to furnish the respondent's taxpayer identification number 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 7701 and that such number will be used for 
purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent penalty amount.
    (4) The issuance of the penalty notice finding a violation and 
imposing a monetary penalty shall constitute final agency action. The 
respondent has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency 
action in a federal district court.


<R05>
Sec. 540.705  Administrative collection; referral to United States 
Department of Justice.

    In the event that the respondent does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control within 30 days of the 
date of mailing of the penalty notice, the matter may be referred for 
administrative collection measures by the Department of the Treasury or 
to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate action to 
recover the penalty in a civil suit in a federal district court.

Sec. 541.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the record 
keeping and reporting requirements and license application and other 
procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to part 
501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in this 
part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing 
foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No 
license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other 
provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by 
this part. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant 
to this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations.

of this section will be published on OFAC's Web site, announced in the 
Federal Register and incorporated on an ongoing basis with the 
identifier [ZIMBABWE] into appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V. Section 
501.807 of this chapter V sets forth the procedures to be followed by 
persons seeking administrative reconsideration of their designation 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section or who wish to assert that 
the circumstances resulting in designation no longer apply. Similarly, 
when a transaction results in the blocking of funds at a financial 
institution pursuant to this section and a party to the transaction 
believes the funds to have been blocked due to mistaken identity, that 
party may seek to have such funds unblocked pursuant to the 
administrative procedures set forth in Sec. 501.806 of this chapter.
    (b) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any security

person and either registered or inscribed in the name of or known to be 
held for the benefit of any person whose property or interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is 
prohibited. This prohibition includes but is not limited to the transfer 
(including the transfer on the books of any issuer or agent thereof), 
disposition, transportation, importation, exportation, or withdrawal of 
any such security or the endorsement or guaranty of signatures on any 
such security. This prohibition applies irrespective of the fact that at 
any time (whether prior to, on, or subsequent to the effective date) the 
registered or inscribed owner of any such security may have or might 
appear to have assigned, transferred, or otherwise disposed of the 
security.


<R05>
Sec. 541.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that 
involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec. 
541.201(a), is null and void and shall not be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or 
privilege with respect to such property or property interests.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in property 
blocked pursuant to Sec. 541.201(a), unless the person with whom such 
property is held or maintained, prior to that date, had written notice 
of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, or 
after a transfer shall validate such transfer or make it enforceable to 
the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the 
provisions of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.), this part, and any regulation, order, directive, ruling, 
instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part.
    (d) Transfers of property that otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property was held or maintained (and as to such person only) in 
cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property was held 
or maintained;
    (2) The person with whom such property was held or maintained did 
not

[[Page 254]]

have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts and 
circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer 
required a license or authorization issued pursuant to this part and was 
not so licensed or authorized, or, if a license or authorization did 
purport to cover the transfer, that such license or authorization had 
been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding of 
material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property was held or maintained filed 
with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth in full 
the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon discovery 
that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or 
any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other direction or 
authorization issued pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director of 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

    Note to paragraph (d) of Sec. 541.202: The filing of a report in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall 
not be deemed evidence that the terms of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of 
this section have been satisfied.

    (e) Except to the extent otherwise provided by law or unless 
licensed pursuant to this part, any attachment, judgment, decree, lien, 
execution, garnishment, or other judicial process is null and void with 
respect to any property in which on or since the effective date there 
existed an interest of a person whose property or interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to Sec. 541.201(a).


<R05>
Sec. 541.203  Holding of funds in interest-bearing accounts; investment

financial obligations, subject to Sec. 541.201(a) shall hold or place 
such funds in a blocked interest-bearing account located in the United 
States.
    (b)(1) For purposes of this section, the term blocked interest-
bearing account means a blocked account:
    (i) In a federally-insured U.S. bank, thrift institution, or credit 
union, provided the funds are earning interest at rates that are 
commercially reasonable; or

Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 
78a et seq.), provided the funds are invested in a money market fund or

    (2) For purposes of this section, a rate is commercially reasonable 
if it is the rate currently offered to other depositors on deposits or 
instruments of comparable size and maturity.
    (3) Funds held or placed in a blocked account pursuant to this 
paragraph (b) may not be invested in instruments the maturity of which 
exceeds 180 days. If interest is credited to a separate blocked account

same.
    (c) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 
180 days at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 541.201(a) may 
continue to be held until maturity in the original instrument, provided 
any interest, earnings, or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid 
into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph (b) 
or (d) of this section.
    (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the United 
States at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 541.201(a) may 
continue to be held in the same type of accounts or instruments, 
provided the funds earn interest at rates that are commercially 
reasonable.
    (e) This section does not create an affirmative obligation for the 
holder of blocked tangible property, such as chattels or real estate, or 
of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to sell or 
liquidate such property at the time the property becomes subject to 
Sec. 541.201(a). However, the Office of Foreign Assets Control

[[Page 255]]

may issue licenses permitting or directing such sales in appropriate 
cases.
    (f) Funds subject to this section may not be held, invested, or 
reinvested in a manner that provides immediate financial or economic 
benefit or access to any person whose property or interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to Sec. 541.201(a), nor may their holder cooperate 
in or facilitate the pledging or other attempted use of blocked funds or 
other assets as collateral.

<R04>
                           Subpart G_Penalties


<R05>
Sec. 541.701  Penalties.

    (a) Attention is directed to section 206 of the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (the ``Act'') (50 U.S.C. 1705), which is 
applicable to violations of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant 
to this part or otherwise under the Act.
    (1) A civil penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in Section 
206 of the Act may be imposed on any person who violates, attempts to 
violate, conspires to violate, or causes a violation of any license, 
order, regulation, or prohibition issued under the Act.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 541.701: As of June 10, 2008, the 
Act provides for a maximum civil penalty not to exceed the greater of 
$250,000 or an amount that is twice the amount of the transaction that 
is the basis of the violation with respect to which the penalty is 
imposed.

    (2) A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, or 
willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of a 
violation of any license, order, regulation, or prohibition shall, upon 
conviction, be fined not more than $1,000,000, or if a natural person, 
may be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.
    (b) Adjustments to penalty amounts. (1) The civil penalties provided 
in the Act are subject to adjustment pursuant to the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410, as amended, 
28 U.S.C. 2461 note).
    (2) The criminal penalties provided in the Act are subject to 
adjustment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571.
    (c) Attention is also directed to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides 
that whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, 
legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, 
knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, 
scheme, or device, a material fact, or makes any materially false, 
fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or makes or uses 
any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially 
false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry shall be fined under 
title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not more than five years, or 
both.
    (d) Violations of this part may also be subject to relevant 
provisions of other applicable laws.

[69 FR 45248, July 29, 2004, as amended at 71 FR 29253, May 22, 2006; 73 
FR 32653, June 10, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 541.702  Prepenalty notice.

    (a) When required. If the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control has reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of any 
provision of this part or a violation of the provisions of any license, 
ruling, regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or 
pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the 
Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act, and the Director determines that further 
proceedings are warranted, the Director shall notify the alleged 
violator of the agency's intent to impose a monetary

[[Page 262]]

penalty by issuing a prepenalty notice. The prepenalty notice shall be 
in writing. The prepenalty notice may be issued whether or not another 
agency has taken any action with respect to the matter.
    (b) Contents of notice.--(1) Facts of violation. The prepenalty 
notice shall describe the violation, specify the laws and regulations 
allegedly violated, and state the amount of the proposed monetary 
penalty.
    (2) Right to respond. The prepenalty notice also shall inform the 
respondent of the respondent's right to make a written presentation 
within the applicable 30 day period set forth in Sec. 541.703 as to why 
a monetary penalty should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the 
monetary penalty should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (c) Informal settlement prior to issuance of prepenalty notice. At 
any time prior to the issuance of a prepenalty notice, an alleged 
violator may request in writing that, for a period not to exceed sixty 
(60) days, the agency withhold issuance of the prepenalty notice for the 
exclusive purpose of effecting settlement of the agency's potential 
civil monetary penalty claims. In the event the Director grants the 
request, under terms and conditions within his discretion, the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control will agree to withhold issuance of the prepenalty 
notice for a period not to exceed 60 days and will enter into settlement 
negotiations of the potential civil monetary penalty claim.


<R05>
Sec. 541.703  Response to prepenalty notice; informal settlement.

    (a) Deadline for response. The respondent may submit a response to 
the prepenalty notice within the applicable 30-day period set forth in 
this paragraph. The Director may grant, at his discretion, an extension 
of time in which to submit a response to the prepenalty notice. The 
failure to submit a response within the applicable time period set forth 
in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to 
respond.
    (1) Computation of time for response. A response to the prepenalty 
notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or 
foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider 
(if transmitted to OFAC by courier) on or before the 30th day after the 
postmark date on the envelope in which the prepenalty notice was mailed. 
If the respondent refused delivery or otherwise avoided receipt of the 
prepenalty notice, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or 
before the 30th day after the date on the stamped postal receipt 
maintained at the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If the prepenalty 
notice was personally delivered to the respondent by a non-U.S. Postal 
Service agent authorized by the Director, a response must be postmarked 
or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (2) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at 
the Director's discretion, only upon the respondent's specific request 
to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (b) Form and method of response. The response must be submitted in 
typewritten form and signed by the respondent or a representative 
thereof. The response need not be in any particular form. A copy of the 
written response may be sent by facsimile, but the original also must be 
sent to the Office of Foreign Assets Control Civil Penalties Division by 
mail or courier and must be postmarked or date-stamped in accordance 
with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Contents of response. A written response must contain 
information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the 
prepenalty notice.
    (1) A written response must include the respondent's full name, 
address, telephone number, and facsimile number, if available, or those 
of the representative of the respondent.
    (2) A written response should either admit or deny each specific 
violation alleged in the prepenalty notice and also state if the 
respondent has no knowledge of a particular violation. If the written 
response fails to address any specific violation alleged in the 
prepenalty notice, that alleged violation shall be deemed to be 
admitted.
    (3) A written response should include any information in defense, 
evidence in

[[Page 263]]

support of an asserted defense, or other factors that the respondent 
requests the Office of Foreign Assets Control to consider. Any defense 
or explanation previously made to the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
or any other agency must be repeated in the written response. Any 
defense not raised in the written response will be considered waived. 
The written response also should set forth the reasons why the 
respondent believes the penalty should not be imposed or why, if 
imposed, it should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (d) Failure to respond. Where OFAC receives no response to a 
prepenalty notice within the applicable time period set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section, a penalty notice generally will be 
issued, taking into account the mitigating and/or aggravating factors 
present in the record. If there are no mitigating factors present in the 
record, or the record contains a preponderance of aggravating factors, 
the proposed prepenalty amount generally will be assessed as the final 
penalty.
    (e) Informal settlement. In addition to or as an alternative to a 
written response to a prepenalty notice, the respondent or respondent's 
representative may contact the Office of Foreign Assets Control as 
advised in the prepenalty notice to propose the settlement of 
allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and related matters. 
However, the requirements set forth in paragraph (f) of this section as 
to oral communication by the representative must first be fulfilled. In 
the event of settlement at the prepenalty stage, the claim proposed in 
the prepenalty notice will be withdrawn, the respondent will not be 
required to take a written position on allegations contained in the 
prepenalty notice, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control will make no 
final determination as to whether a violation occurred. The amount 
accepted in settlement of allegations in a prepenalty notice may vary 
from the civil penalty that might finally be imposed in the event of a 
formal determination of violation. In the event no settlement is 
reached, the time limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section for 
written response to the prepenalty notice will remain in effect unless 
additional time is granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (f) Representation. A representative of the respondent may act on 
behalf of the respondent, but any oral communication with the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission regarding the 
specific allegations contained in the prepenalty notice must be preceded 
by a written letter of representation, unless the prepenalty notice was 
served upon the respondent in care of the representative.


<R05>
Sec. 541.704  Penalty imposition or withdrawal.

    (a) No violation. If, after considering any response to the 
prepenalty notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control determines that there was no violation by the 
respondent named in the prepenalty notice, the Director shall notify the 
respondent in writing of that determination and of the cancellation of 
the proposed monetary penalty.
    (b) Violation. (1) If, after considering any written response to the 
prepenalty notice, or default in the submission of a written response, 
and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control determines that there was a violation by the respondent named in 
the prepenalty notice, the Director is authorized to issue a written 
penalty notice to the respondent of the determination of the violation 
and the imposition of the monetary penalty.
    (2) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent that payment or 
arrangement for installment payment of the assessed penalty must be made 
within 30 days of the date of mailing of the penalty notice by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent of the 
requirement to furnish the respondent's taxpayer identification number 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 7701 and that such number will be used for 
purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent penalty amount.
    (4) The issuance of the penalty notice finding a violation and 
imposing a monetary penalty shall constitute final agency action. The 
respondent has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency 
action in federal district court.

[[Page 264]]


<R05>
Sec. 541.705  Administrative collection; referral to United States 
Department of Justice.

    In the event that the respondent does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control within 30 days of the 
date of mailing of the penalty notice, the matter may be referred for 
administrative collection measures by the Department of the Treasury or 
to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate action to 
recover the penalty in a civil suit in a federal district court.

      Subpart A_Relation of This Part to Other Laws and Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 542.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to 
part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in 
this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing 
foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No 
license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other 
provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by 
this part. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant 
to this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 542.102  Relation of this part to part 596 of this chapter.

    For the purposes of the Terrorism List Government Sanctions 
Regulations set forth in part 596 of this chapter, the Government of 
Syria in its entirety is not subject to the regulations set forth in 
this part. Consequently, 31 CFR 596.503 does not apply to financial 
transactions with the Government of Syria, while 31 CFR 596.504 and 
596.505 continue to apply.


<R04>
                         Subpart B_Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 542.201  Prohibited transactions involving blocked property.

    (a) Except as authorized by regulations, orders, directives, 
rulings, instructions, licenses or otherwise, and notwithstanding any 
contracts entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the 
effective date, all property and interests in property of the following 
persons that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the 
United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or 
control of United States persons, including their overseas branches, are 
blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
otherwise dealt in:
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) Any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State:
    (i) To be or to have been directing or otherwise significantly 
contributing to the Government of Syria's provision of safe haven to or 
other support for any

[[Page 266]]

person whose property or interests in property are blocked under United 
States law for terrorism-related reasons, including, but not limited to, 
Hamas, Hizballah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command, and any persons designated pursuant to 
Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001;
    (ii) To be or to have been directing or otherwise significantly 
contributing to the Government of Syria's military or security presence 
in Lebanon;
    (iii) To be or to have been directing or otherwise significantly 
contributing to the Government of Syria's pursuit of the development and 
production of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons and medium- and 
long-range surface-to-surface missiles;
    (iv) To be or to have been directing or otherwise significantly 
contributing to any steps taken by the Government of Syria to undermine 
United States and international efforts with respect to the 
stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq; or
    (v) To be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for 
or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property or 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this section.

    Note to paragraph (a) of Sec. 542.201: The names of persons whose 
property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 
542.201(a) will be published on OFAC's Web site, announced in the 
Federal Register, and incorporated on an ongoing basis with the 
identifier [SYRIA] in appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V. Section 501.807 of 
this chapter V sets forth the procedures to be followed by persons 
seeking administrative reconsideration of their designations pursuant to 
Sec. 542.201(a) or who wish to assert that the circumstances resulting 
in a designation no longer apply. Similarly, when a transaction results 
in the blocking of funds at a financial institution pursuant to this 
section and a party to the transaction believes the funds to have been 
blocked due to mistaken identity, that party may seek to have such funds 
unblocked pursuant to the administrative procedures set forth in Sec. 
501.806 of this chapter.
    Section 203 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1702) explicitly authorizes the blocking of property and 
interests in property of a person during the pendency of an 
investigation. The name of any individual or entity whose property or 
interests in property are blocked under this part pending investigation 
will be published as noted above with the descriptor ``[BPI-SYRIA].'' 
The scope of the blocking of property or interests in property during 
the pendency of an investigation may be more limited than the scope of 
the blocking set forth in Sec. 542.201(a). Inquiries regarding the 
scope of any such blocking should be directed to OFAC's Compliance 
Division at 202/622-2490.

    (b) The blocking of property and interests in property pursuant to 
Sec. 542.201(a) includes, but is not limited to, the prohibition of:
    (1) The making of any contribution of funds, goods, or services by, 
to, or for the benefit of any person whose property or interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to this section; and
    (2) The receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services from any such person.
    (c) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any security 
(or evidence thereof) held within the possession or control of a U.S. 
person and either registered or inscribed in the name of or known to be 
held for the benefit of any person whose property or interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 542.201(a) is prohibited. This 
prohibition includes but is not limited to the transfer (including the 
transfer on the books of any issuer or agent thereof), disposition, 
transportation, importation, exportation, or withdrawal of any such 
security or the endorsement or guaranty of signatures on any such 
security. This prohibition applies irrespective of the fact that at any 
time (whether prior to, on, or subsequent to the effective date) the 
registered or inscribed owner of any such security may have or might 
appear to have assigned, transferred, or otherwise disposed of the

ruling, instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that 
involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to

[[Page 267]]

assertion or recognition of any interest in, or right, remedy, power, or 
privilege with respect to, such property or property interests.

assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in property 
blocked pursuant to Sec. 542.201(a), unless the person with whom such 
property is held or maintained, prior to that date, had written notice 
of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, or

not so licensed or authorized, or, if a license or authorization did 
purport to cover the transfer, that such license or authorization had 
been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding of 
material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property was held or maintained filed 
with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth in full 
the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon discovery

authorization issued pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director of

    (c) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 
180 days at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 542.201(a) may

into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph (b) 
or (d) of this section.
    (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the United 
States at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 542.201(a) may 
continue to be held in the same type of accounts or instruments, 
provided the funds earn interest at rates that are commercially 
reasonable.
    (e) This section does not create an affirmative obligation for the 
holder of blocked tangible property, such as chattels or real estate, or 
of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to sell or 
liquidate such property at the time the property becomes subject to 
Sec. 542.201(a). However, the Office of Foreign Assets Control may 
issue licenses permitting or directing such sales in appropriate cases.
    (f) Funds subject to this section may not be held, invested, or 
reinvested in a manner that provides immediate financial or economic 
benefit or access to any person whose property or interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to Sec. 542.201(a), nor may their holder cooperate 
in or facilitate the pledging or other attempted use of blocked funds or 
other assets as collateral.

<R04>
                           Subpart G_Penalties


<R05>
Sec. 542.701  Penalties.

    (a) Attention is directed to section 206 of the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (the ``Act'') (50 U.S.C. 1705), which is 
applicable to violations of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant 
to this part or otherwise under the Act.
    (1) A civil penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in Section 
206 of the Act may be imposed on any person who

[[Page 275]]

violates, attempts to violate, conspires to violate, or causes a 
violation of any license, order, regulation, or prohibition issued under 
the Act.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 542.701: As of June 10, 2008, the 
Act provides for a maximum civil penalty not to exceed the greater of 
$250,000 or an amount that is twice the amount of the transaction that 
is the basis of the violation with respect to which the penalty is 
imposed.

    (2) A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, or 
willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of a 
violation of any license, order, regulation, or prohibition shall, upon 
conviction, be fined not more than $1,000,000, or if a natural person, 
may be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.
    (b) Adjustments to penalty amounts. (1) The civil penalties provided 
in the Act are subject to adjustment pursuant to the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410, as amended,

that whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, 
legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, 
knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, 
scheme, or device, a material fact, or makes any materially false, 
fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or makes or uses 
any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially 
false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry shall be fined under 
title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not more than five years, or 
both.
    (d) Violations of this part may also be subject to relevant

FR 32653, June 10, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 542.702  Prepenalty notice.

    (a) When required. If the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control has reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of any 
provision of this part or a violation of the provisions of any license, 
ruling, regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or 
pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the 
Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act, and the Director determines that further 
civil proceedings are warranted, the Director shall notify the alleged 
violator of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty by issuing 
a prepenalty notice. The prepenalty notice shall be in writing. The 
prepenalty notice may be issued whether or not another agency has taken 
any action with respect to the matter.
    (b) Contents of notice--(1) Facts of violation. The prepenalty 
notice shall describe the violation, specify the laws and regulations 
allegedly violated, and state the amount of the proposed monetary 
penalty.
    (2) Right to respond. The prepenalty notice also shall inform the 
respondent of the respondent's right to make a written presentation 
within the applicable 30 day period set forth in Sec. 542.703 as to why 
a monetary penalty should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the 
monetary penalty should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (c) Informal settlement prior to issuance of prepenalty notice. At 
any time prior to the issuance of a prepenalty notice, an alleged 
violator may request in writing that, for a period not to exceed sixty 
(60) days, the agency withhold issuance of the prepenalty notice for the 
exclusive purpose of effecting settlement of the agency's potential 
civil monetary penalty claims. In the event the Director of the Office 
of Foreign Assets Control grants the request, under terms and conditions 
within his discretion, the Office of Foreign Assets Control will agree 
to withhold issuance of the prepenalty notice for a period not to exceed 
60 days and will enter into settlement negotiations of the potential 
civil monetary penalty claim.


<R05>
Sec. 542.703  Response to prepenalty notice; informal settlement.

    (a) Deadline for response. The respondent may submit a response to 
the prepenalty notice within the applicable 30-day period set forth in 
this paragraph. The Director of the Office of

[[Page 276]]

Foreign Assets Control may grant, at his discretion, an extension of 
time in which to submit a response to the prepenalty notice. The failure 
to submit a response within the applicable time period set forth in this 
paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to respond.
    (1) Computation of time for response. A response to the prepenalty 
notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or 
foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider 
(if transmitted to the Office of Foreign Assets Control by courier) on 
or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the envelope in which 
the prepenalty notice was mailed. If the respondent refused delivery or 
otherwise avoided receipt of the prepenalty notice, a response must be 
postmarked or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date on 
the stamped postal receipt maintained at the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control. If the prepenalty notice was personally delivered to the 
respondent by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent authorized by the 
Director, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or before the 
30th day after the date of delivery.
    (2) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
Federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at 
the discretion of the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, 
only upon the respondent's specific request to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control.
    (b) Form and method of response. The response must be submitted in 
handwritten or typed form and signed by the respondent or a 
representative thereof. The response need not be in any particular form. 
A copy of the written response may be sent by facsimile, but the 
original also must be sent to the Office of Foreign Assets Control Civil 
Penalties Division by mail or courier and must be postmarked or date-
stamped, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Contents of response. A written response must contain 
information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the 
prepenalty notice and must include the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
identification number listed on the prepenalty notice.
    (1) A written response must include the respondent's full name, 
address, telephone number, and facsimile number, if available, or those 
of the representative of the respondent.
    (2) A written response should either admit or deny each specific 
violation alleged in the prepenalty notice and also state if the 
respondent has no knowledge of a particular violation. If the written 
response fails to address any specific violation alleged in the 
prepenalty notice, that alleged violation shall be deemed to be 
admitted.
    (3) A written response should include any information in defense, 
evidence in support of an asserted defense, or other factors that the 
respondent requests the Office of Foreign Assets Control to consider. 
Any defense or explanation previously made to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control or any other agency must be repeated in the written 
response. Any defense not raised in the written response will be 
considered waived. The written response also should set forth the 
reasons why the respondent believes the penalty should not be imposed or 
why, if imposed, it should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (d) Failure to respond. Where the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
receives no response to a prepenalty notice within the applicable time 
period set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, a penalty notice 
generally will be issued, taking into account the mitigating and/or 
aggravating factors present in the record. If there are no mitigating 
factors present in the record, or the record contains a preponderance of 
aggravating factors, the proposed prepenalty amount generally will be 
assessed as the final penalty.
    (e) Informal settlement. In addition to or as an alternative to a 
written response to a prepenalty notice, the respondent or respondent's 
representative may contact the Office of Foreign Assets Control as 
advised in the prepenalty notice to propose the settlement of 
allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and related matters. 
However, the requirements set forth in paragraph (f) of this section as 
to oral

[[Page 277]]

communication by the representative must first be fulfilled. In the 
event of settlement at the prepenalty stage, the claim proposed in the 
prepenalty notice will be withdrawn, the respondent will not be required 
to take a written position on allegations contained in the prepenalty 
notice, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control will make no final 
determination as to whether a violation occurred. The amount accepted in 
settlement of allegations in a prepenalty notice may vary from the civil 
penalty that might finally be imposed in the event of a formal 
determination of violation. In the event no settlement is reached, the 
time limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section for written 
response to the prepenalty notice will remain in effect unless 
additional time is granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (f) Representation. A representative of the respondent may act on 
behalf of the respondent, but any oral communication with the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission regarding the 
specific allegations contained in the prepenalty notice must be preceded 
by a written letter of representation, unless the prepenalty notice was 
served upon the respondent in care of the representative.


<R05>
Sec. 542.704  Penalty imposition or withdrawal.

    (a) No violation. If, after considering any response to the 
prepenalty notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control determines that there was no violation by the 
respondent named in the prepenalty notice, the Director shall notify the 
respondent in writing of that determination and of the cancellation of 
the proposed monetary penalty.
    (b) Violation. (1) If, after considering any written response to the 
prepenalty notice, or default in the submission of a written response, 
and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control determines that there was a violation by the respondent named in 
the prepenalty notice, the Director is authorized to issue a written 
penalty notice to the respondent of the determination of the violation 
and the imposition of the monetary penalty.
    (2) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent that payment or 
arrangement for installment payment of the assessed penalty must be made 
within 30 days of the date of mailing of the penalty notice by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent of the 
requirement to furnish the respondent's taxpayer identification number 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 7701 and that such number will be used for 
purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent penalty amount.
    (4) The issuance of the penalty notice finding a violation and 
imposing a monetary penalty shall constitute final agency action. The 
respondent has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency 
action in Federal District Court.


<R05>
Sec. 542.705  Administrative collection; referral to United States 
Department of Justice.

    In the event that the respondent does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control within 30 days of the 
date of mailing of the penalty notice, the matter may be referred for 
administrative collection measures by the Department of the Treasury or 
to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate action to 
recover the penalty in a civil suit in a Federal District Court.

      Subpart A_Relation of This Part to Other Laws and Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 543.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to 
part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in 
this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing 
foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No 
license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other 
provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by 
this part. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant 
to this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations.


<R04>
                         Subpart B_Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 543.201  Prohibited transactions involving blocked property.

    (a) Except as authorized by regulations, orders, directives, 
rulings, instructions, licenses, or otherwise, and notwithstanding any 
contracts entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the 
effective date, all property and interests in property that are in the 
United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are 
or hereafter come within the possession or control of U.S. persons, 
including their overseas branches, of the following persons are blocked 
and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise 
dealt in:
    (1) Any person listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13396 of 
February 7, 2006 (71 FR 7389, February 10, 2006); and
    (2) Any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after 
consultation with the Secretary of State:
    (i) To constitute a threat to the peace and national reconciliation 
process in C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire, such as by blocking the implementation 
of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement of January 24, 2003, the Accra III 
Agreement of July 30, 2004, and the Pretoria Agreement of April 6, 2005;
    (ii) To be responsible for serious violations of international law 
in C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire;
    (iii) To have directly or indirectly supplied, sold, or transferred

the conflict in C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire;
    (v) To have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support 
of, the activities described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(iv) 
of this section or any person whose property or interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to this paragraph (a); or
    (vi) To be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act 
for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property 
and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this paragraph (a).
    Note to paragraph (a) of Sec. 543.201: 1. The names of persons 
listed in or designated pursuant to Executive Order 13396, whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section, are published on the Office of Foreign Assets Control's 
Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (``SDN List'') 
(which is accessible via the Office of Foreign Assets Control's Web 
site), published in the Federal Register, and incorporated into Appendix 
A to this chapter with the identifier ``[COTED].'' See Sec. 543.411 
concerning entities that may not be listed on the SDN list but whose 
property and interests in property are nevertheless blocked pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    2. Section 203 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act 
(50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) (``IEEPA'') explicitly authorizes the blocking of 
property and interests in property of a person during the pendency of an

[[Page 280]]

investigation. The names of persons whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pending investigation pursuant to this part also 
are published on the SDN List, published in the Federal Register and 
incorporated into Appendix A to this chapter with the identifier ``[BPI-
COTED].''
    3. Sections 501.806 and 501.807 of this chapter V describe the 
procedures to be followed by persons seeking, respectively, the 
unblocking of funds that they believe were blocked due to mistaken 
identity, or administrative reconsideration of their status as persons 
whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (b) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section include, but 
are not limited to, prohibitions on the following transactions when 
engaged in by a United States person or within the United States:
    (1) The making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section; and
    (2) The receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services from any person whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any security 
(or evidence thereof) held within the possession or control of a U.S. 
person and either registered or inscribed in the name of, or known to be 
held for the benefit of, or issued by, any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section is prohibited. This prohibition includes but is not limited to 
the transfer (including the transfer on the books of any issuer or agent 
thereof), disposition, transportation, importation, exportation, or 
withdrawal of, or the endorsement or guaranty of signatures on, any such 
security on or after the effective date. This prohibition applies 
irrespective of the fact that at any time (whether prior to, on, or 
subsequent to the effective date) the registered or inscribed owner of 
any such security may have or might appear to have assigned, 
transferred, or otherwise disposed of the security.


<R05>
Sec. 543.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that 
involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec. 
543.201(a), is null and void and shall not be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or 
privilege with respect to such property or property interests.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in property 
blocked pursuant to Sec. 543.201(a), unless the person who holds or 
maintains such property, prior to that date, had written notice of the 
transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of

[[Page 281]]

not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts 
and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer

not so licensed or authorized, or, if a license or authorization did 
purport to cover the transfer, that such license or authorization had 
been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding of 
material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
filed with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth 
in full the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon

into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraphs 
(b) or (d) of this section.
    (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the United 
States at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 543.201(a) may

reasonable.

reinvested in a

Sec. 543.701  Penalties.

    (a) Attention is directed to section 206 of the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1705) (``IEEPA''), which is 
applicable to violations of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, directive, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant 
to this part or otherwise under IEEPA.
    (1) A civil penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in section 
206 of IEEPA may be imposed on any person who violates, attempts to 
violate, conspires to violate, or causes a violation of any license, 
order, regulation, or prohibition issued under IEEPA.
    Note to paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 543.701: As of the date of 
publication in the Federal Register of the final rule adding this part 
to 31 CFR chapter V (April 13, 2009), IEEPA provides for a maximum civil 
penalty not to exceed the greater of $250,000 or an amount that is twice 
the amount of the transaction that is the basis of the violation with 
respect to which the penalty is imposed.
    (2) A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, or 
willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of a 
violation of any license, order, regulation, or prohibition may, upon 
conviction, be fined not more than $1,000,000, or if a natural person, 
be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.
    (b) Adjustments to penalty amounts. (1) The civil penalties provided 
in IEEPA are subject to adjustment pursuant to the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410, as amended, 
28 U.S.C. 2461 note).
    (2) The criminal penalties provided in IEEPA are subject to

    (c) Attention is directed to section 5 of the United Nations

violate or evade any order, rule, or regulation issued by the President 
pursuant to the authority granted in that section, upon conviction, 
shall be fined not more than $10,000 and, if a natural person, may also 
be imprisoned for not more than 10 years; and the officer, director, or 
agent of any corporation who knowingly participates in such violation or

203(b)(1),(3), and (4) of IEEPA shall be subject only to the penalties 
set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (e) Attention is also directed to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides 
that whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, 
legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, 
knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, 
scheme, or device a material fact; or makes any materially false, 
fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation; or makes or uses 
any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially 
false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry; shall be fined under

    (f) Violations of this part may also be subject to relevant 
provisions of other applicable laws.

<R05>
Sec. 543.702  Pre-Penalty Notice; settlement.

    (a) When required. If the Office of Foreign Assets Control has 
reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of any provision 
of this part or a violation of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant 
to this part or otherwise under IEEPA and determines that a civil 
monetary penalty is warranted, the Office of Foreign Assets Control will 
issue a Pre-Penalty Notice informing the alleged violator of the 
agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty. A Pre-Penalty Notice shall 
be in writing. The Pre-Penalty Notice may be issued whether or not 
another agency has taken any action with respect to the matter. For a 
description of the contents of a Pre-Penalty Notice, see Appendix A to 
part 501 of this chapter.
    (b)(1) Right to respond. An alleged violator has the right to 
respond to a Pre-Penalty Notice by making a written presentation to the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control. For a description of the information 
that should be included in such a response, see appendix A to part 501 
of this chapter.
    (2) Deadline for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice must 
be made within the applicable 30-day period set forth in this paragraph. 
The failure to submit a response within the applicable time period set 
forth in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to 
respond.
    (i) Computation of time for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty 
Notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or 
foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider 
(if transmitted to the Office of Foreign Assets Control by courier) on 
or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the envelope in which 
the Pre-Penalty Notice was mailed. If the Pre-Penalty Notice was 
personally delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent authorized by 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a response must be postmarked or 
date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (ii) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at 
the discretion of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, only upon 
specific request to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) Form and method of response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice 
need not be in any particular form, but it must be typewritten and 
signed by the alleged violator or a representative thereof, must contain 
information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the Pre-
Penalty Notice, and must include the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
identification number listed on the Pre-Penalty Notice. A copy of the 
written response may be sent by facsimile, but the original also must be 
sent to the Office of Foreign Assets Control Civil Penalties Division by 
mail or courier and must be postmarked or date-stamped, in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Settlement. Settlement discussion may be initiated by the Office 
of Foreign Assets Control, the alleged violator, or the alleged 
violator's authorized representative. For a description of practices 
with respect to settlement, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (d) Guidelines. Guidelines for the imposition or settlement of civil 
penalties by the Office of Foreign Assets Control are contained in 
Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (e) Representation. A representative of the alleged violator may act 
on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission regarding 
the specific allegations contained in the Pre-Penalty Notice must be 
preceded by a written letter of representation, unless the Pre-Penalty 
Notice was served upon the alleged violator in care of the 
representative.


<R05>
Sec. 543.703  Penalty imposition.

    If, after considering any written response to the Pre-Penalty Notice 
and any relevant facts, the Office of Foreign Assets Control determines 
that

[[Page 290]]

there was a violation by the alleged violator named in the Pre-Penalty 
Notice and that a civil monetary penalty is appropriate, the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control may issue a written Penalty Notice to the 
violator containing a determination of the violation and the imposition 
of the monetary penalty. For additional details concerning issuance of a 
Penalty Notice, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    The issuance of the Penalty Notice shall constitute final agency 
action. The violator has the right to seek judicial review of that final 
agency action in federal district court.


<R05>
Sec. 543.704  Administrative collection; referral to United States 
Department of Justice.

    In the event that the violator does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the matter may be 
referred for administrative collection measures by the Department of the 
Treasury or to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate 
action to recover the penalty in a civil suit in a federal district 
court.


<R04>
                          Subpart H_Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 543.801  Procedures.

    For license application procedures and procedures relating to 
amendments, modifications, or revocations of licenses; administrative 
decisions; rulemaking; and requests for documents pursuant to the 
Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts (5 U.S.C. 552 and 552a), see 
part 501, subpart E, of this chapter.

February 10, 2006), and any further Executive orders relating to the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13396, may be taken by 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control or by any other 
person to whom the Secretary of the Treasury has delegated authority so 
to act.

<R04>
      Subpart A_Relation of This Part to Other Laws and Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 544.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to 
part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in 
this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing 
foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No 
license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other 
provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by 
this part. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant 
to this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations.
    Note to Sec. 544.101: The sanctions implemented pursuant to the 
Weapons of Mass Destruction Trade Control Regulations set forth in part 
539 of this chapter are separate and distinct from the sanctions 
implemented pursuant to this part, even though both programs have been 
imposed pursuant to the same declaration of national emergency in 
Executive Order 12938 of November 14, 1994. Accordingly, a ``designated 
foreign person'' whose goods, technology, or services are prohibited 
from being imported into the United States under part 539 is not 
necessarily a person whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to Sec. 544.201(a). Consequently, the property and 
interests in property of a ``designated foreign person'' under part 539 
are not blocked, unless the ``designated foreign person'' has separately 
become a person whose property and interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to Sec. 544.201(a) or any other part of 31 CFR chapter V. 
Note, however, that the importation into the United States of goods, 
technology, or services (other than information or informational 
materials) produced or provided by

[[Page 292]]

a ``designated foreign person'' under part 539 is prohibited by that 
part.


<R04>
                         Subpart B_Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 544.201  Prohibited transactions involving blocked property.

    (a) Except as authorized by regulations, orders, directives, 
rulings, instructions, licenses or otherwise, and notwithstanding any 
contracts entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the 
effective date, all property and interests in property that are in the 
United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are 
or hereafter come within the possession or control of U.S. persons, 
including their overseas branches, of the following persons are blocked 
and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise 
dealt in:
    (1) Any person listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13382 of June 
28, 2005 (70 FR 38567, July 1, 2005);
    (2) Any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in 
consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, 
and other relevant agencies, to have engaged, or attempted to engage, in 
activities or transactions that have materially contributed to, or pose 
a risk of materially contributing to, the proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction or their means of delivery (including missiles capable 
of delivering such weapons), including any efforts to manufacture, 
acquire, possess, develop, transport, transfer or use such items, by any 
person or foreign country of proliferation concern;
    (3) Any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and 
other relevant agencies, to have provided, or attempted to provide, 
financial, material, technological or other support for, or goods or 
services in support of, any activity or transaction described in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this section; and
    (4) Any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and 
other relevant agencies, to be owned or controlled by, or acting or 
purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any 
person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
this section.
    Note to paragraph (a) of Sec. 544.201: 1. The names of persons 
listed in or designated pursuant to Executive Order 13382, whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section, are published on the Office of Foreign Assets Control's 
Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (``SDN'' list) 
(which is accessible via the Office of Foreign Assets Control's Web 
site), published in the Federal Register, and incorporated into Appendix 
A to this chapter with the identifier ``[NPWMD].'' See Sec. 544.411 
concerning entities that may not be listed on the SDN list but whose 
property and interests in property are nevertheless blocked pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    2. Section 203 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act 
(50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) (``IEEPA'') explicitly authorizes the blocking of 
property and interests in property of a person during the pendency of an 
investigation. The names of persons whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pending investigation pursuant to this part also 
are published on the SDN list, published in the Federal Register, and 
incorporated into Appendix A to this chapter with the identifier ``[BPI-
NPWMD].''
    3. Sections 501.806 and 501.807 of this chapter describe the 
procedures to be followed by persons seeking, respectively, the 
unblocking of funds that they believe were blocked due to mistaken 
identity, or administrative reconsideration of their status as persons 
whose property and interests in Property are blocked pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (b) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section include, but 
are not limited to, prohibitions on the following transactions when 
engaged in by a United States person or within the United States:
    (1) The making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section; and
    (2) The receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services from any person whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

[[Page 293]]

    (c) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any security 
(or evidence thereof) held within the possession or control of a U.S. 
person and either registered or inscribed in the name of, or known to be 
held for the benefit of, or issued by, any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section is prohibited. This prohibition includes but is not limited to 
the transfer (including the transfer on the books of any issuer or agent 
thereof), disposition, transportation, importation, exportation, or 
withdrawal of, or the endorsement or guaranty of signatures on, any such 
security on or after the effective date. This prohibition applies 
irrespective of the fact that at any time (whether prior to, on, or 
subsequent to the effective date) the registered or inscribed owner of 
any such security may have or might appear to have assigned, 
transferred, or otherwise disposed of the security.


<R05>
Sec. 544.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that 
involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec. 
544.201(a), is null and void and shall not be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or 
privilege with respect to such property or property interests.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in property 
blocked pursuant to Sec. 544.201(a), unless the person who holds or 
maintains such property, prior to that date, had written notice of the 
transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, or 
after a transfer shall validate such transfer or make it enforceable to 
the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the 
provisions of IEEPA, Executive Order 13382, this part, and any 
regulation, order, directive, ruling, instruction, or license issued 
pursuant to this part.
    (d) Transfers of property that otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property is or was held or maintained (and as to such person only) 
in cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction 
of the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property is or was 
held or maintained (and as to such person only);
    (2) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
did not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the 
facts and circumstances known or available to such person, that such 
transfer required a license or authorization issued pursuant to this 
part and was not so licensed or authorized, or, if a license or 
authorization did purport to cover the transfer, that such license or 
authorization had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or 
withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; 
and
    (3) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
filed with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth 
in full the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon 
discovery that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or 
any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other directive or 
authorization issued pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director of 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding 
of material facts

[[Page 294]]

or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.
    Note to paragraph (d) of Sec. 544.202: The filing of a report in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall 
not be deemed evidence that the terms of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of 
this section have been satisfied.
    (e) Unless licensed pursuant to this part, any attachment, judgment, 
decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial process is null 
and void with respect to any property in which, on or since the 
effective date, there existed an interest of a person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 544.201(a).


<R05>
Sec. 544.203  Holding of funds in interest-bearing accounts; investment
and reinvestment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section, or 
as otherwise directed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any U.S. 
person holding funds, such as currency, bank deposits, or liquidated 
financial obligations, subject to Sec. 544.201(a) shall hold or place 
such funds in a blocked interest-bearing account located in the United 
States.
    (b)(1) For purposes of this section, the term blocked interest-
bearing account means a blocked account:
    (i) In a federally-insured U.S. bank, thrift institution, or credit 
union, provided the funds are earning interest at rates that are 
commercially reasonable; or
    (ii) With a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 
78a et seq.), provided the funds are invested in a money market fund or 
in U.S. Treasury bills.

Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1705) (``IEEPA''), which is 
applicable to violations of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, directive, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant 
to this part or otherwise under IEEPA.
    (1) A civil penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in section 
206 of IEEPA may be imposed on any person who violates, attempts to 
violate, conspires to violate, or causes a violation of any license, 
order, regulation, or prohibition issued under IEEPA.
    Note to paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 544.701: As of the date of 
publication in the Federal Register of the final rule adding this part 
to 31 CFR chapter V (April 13, 2009), IEEPA provides for a maximum civil 
penalty not to exceed the greater of $250,000 or an amount that is twice 
the amount of the transaction that is the basis of the violation with 
respect to which the penalty is imposed.
    (2) A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, or 
willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of a 
violation of any license, order, regulation, or prohibition may, upon 
conviction, be fined not more than $1,000,000, or if a natural person, 
be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.
    (b) Adjustments to penalty amounts. (1) The civil penalties provided 
in IEEPA are subject to adjustment pursuant to the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410, as amended, 
28 U.S.C. 2461 note).
    (2) The criminal penalties provided in IEEPA are subject to 
adjustment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571.
    (c) Attention is also directed to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides 
that whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, 
legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, 
knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, 
scheme, or device a material fact; makes any materially false, 
fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or makes or uses 
any false writing or document knowing the same

[[Page 302]]

to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or 
entry; shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, imprisoned not 
more than five years, or both.
    (d) Violations of this part may also be subject to relevant 
provisions of other applicable laws.


<R05>
Sec. 544.702  Pre-Penalty Notice; settlement.

    (a) When required. If the Office of Foreign Assets Control has 
reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of any provision 
of this part or a violation of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant 
to this part or otherwise under IEEPA and determines that a civil 
monetary penalty is warranted, the Office of Foreign Assets Control will 
issue a Pre-Penalty Notice informing the alleged violator of the 
agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty. A Pre-Penalty Notice shall 
be in writing. The Pre-Penalty Notice may be issued whether or not 
another agency has taken any action with respect to the matter. For a 
description of the contents of a Pre-Penalty Notice, see Appendix A to 
part 501 of this chapter.
    (b)(1) Right to respond. An alleged violator has the right to 
respond to a Pre-Penalty Notice by making a written presentation to the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control. For a description of the information 
that should be included in such a response, see Appendix A to part 501 
of this chapter.
    (2) Deadline for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice must 
be made within the applicable 30-day period set forth in this paragraph. 
The failure to submit a response within the applicable time period set 
forth in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to 
respond.
    (i) Computation of time for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty 
Notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or 
foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider 
(if transmitted to the Office of Foreign Assets Control by courier) on 
or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the envelope in which 
the Pre-Penalty Notice was mailed. If the Pre-Penalty Notice was 
personally delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent authorized by 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a response must be postmarked or 
date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (ii) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at 
the discretion of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, only upon 
specific request to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) Form and method of response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice 
need not be in any particular form, but it must be typewritten and 
signed by the alleged violator or a representative thereof, must contain 
information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the Pre-
Penalty Notice, and must include the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
identification number listed on the Pre-Penalty Notice. A copy of the 
written response may be sent by facsimile, but the original also must be 
sent to the Office of Foreign Assets Control Civil Penalties Division by 
mail or courier and must be postmarked or date-stamped in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Settlement. Settlement discussion may be initiated by the Office 
of Foreign Assets Control, the alleged violator, or the alleged 
violator's authorized representative. For a description of practices 
with respect to settlement, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (d) Guidelines. Guidelines for the imposition or settlement of civil 
penalties by the Office of Foreign Assets Control are contained in 
appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (e) Representation. A representative of the alleged violator may act 
on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission regarding 
the specific allegations contained in the Pre-Penalty Notice must be 
preceded by a written letter of representation, unless the Pre-Penalty 
Notice was served upon

[[Page 303]]

the alleged violator in care of the representative.


<R05>
Sec. 544.703  Penalty imposition.

    If, after considering any written response to the Pre-Penalty Notice 
and any relevant facts, the Office of Foreign Assets Control determines 
that there was a violation by the alleged violator named in the Pre-
Penalty Notice and that a civil monetary penalty is appropriate, the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control may issue a Penalty Notice to the 
violator containing a determination of the violation and the imposition 
of the monetary penalty. For additional details concerning issuance of a 
Penalty Notice, see Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter. The issuance 
of the Penalty Notice shall constitute final agency action. The violator 
has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency action in 
federal district court.


<R05>
Sec. 544.704  Administrative collection; referral to United States 
Department of Justice.

    In the event that the violator does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the matter may be 
referred for administrative collection measures by the Department of the 
Treasury or to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate 
action to recover the penalty in a civil suit in a federal district 
court.

      Subpart A_Relation of This Part to Other Laws and Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 545.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to 
part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in 
this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing 
foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No 
license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other 
provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by 
this part. No license contained in or issued pursuant to this part 
relieves the involved parties from complying with any other applicable 
laws or regulations.


<R04>
                         Subpart B_Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 545.201  Prohibited transactions involving blocked property.

    (a) Except as otherwise authorized by regulations, orders, 
directives, rulings, instructions, licenses, or otherwise, and 
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the effective date, property or property interests of 
the following persons that are in the United States, that hereafter come 
within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the 
possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked, and may not be 
transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:
    (1) The Taliban; and
    (2) Persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General:
    (i) To be owned or controlled by, or to act for or on behalf of, the 
Taliban; or
    (ii) To provide financial, material, or technological support for, 
or services in support of, any of the foregoing.

    Note to paragraph (a) of Sec. 545.201. Please refer to the 
appendices at the end of this chapter V for listings of persons 
designated pursuant to this section. Section 501.807 of this chapter V 
sets forth the procedures to be followed by persons seeking 
administrative reconsideration of their designation or who wish to 
assert that the circumstances resulting in designation no longer apply. 
Similarly, when a transaction results in the blocking of funds at a 
financial institution pursuant to this section and a party to the 
transaction believes the funds to have been blocked due to mistaken 
identity, that party may seek to have such funds unblocked pursuant to 
the administrative procedures set forth in Sec. 501.806 of this 
chapter.

    (b) Except as otherwise authorized, and notwithstanding any contract 
entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective 
date, any transaction or dealing by U.S. persons or within the United 
States in property or interests in property blocked pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section is prohibited, including the making or 
receiving of any contribution of funds, goods, or services to or for the 
benefit of the Taliban or persons designated pursuant to Sec. 
545.201(a).
    (c) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any security 
(or evidence thereof) held within the possession or control of a U.S. 
person and either registered or inscribed in the name of or known to be 
held for the benefit of any person whose property or interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to this

[[Page 306]]

section is prohibited. This prohibition includes but is not limited to 
the transfer (including the transfer on the books of any issuer or agent 
thereof), disposition, transportation, importation, exportation, or 
withdrawal of any such security or the endorsement or guaranty of 
signatures on any such security. This prohibition applies irrespective 
of the fact that at any time (whether prior to, on, or subsequent to 
January 11, 2001) the registered or inscribed owner of any such security 
may have or might appear to have assigned, transferred, or otherwise 
disposed of the security.


<R05>
Sec. 545.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that 
involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec. 
545.201(a), is null and void and shall not be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or 
privilege with respect to such property or property interests.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in property 
blocked pursuant to Sec. 545.201(a), unless the person with whom such 
property is held or maintained, prior to that date, had written notice 
of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, or 
after a transfer shall validate such transfer or make it enforceable to 
the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the 
provisions of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, this 
part, and any regulation, order, directive, ruling, instruction, or 
license issued pursuant to this part.
    (d) Transfers of property that otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property was held or maintained (and as to such person only) in 
cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property was held 
or maintained;
    (2) The person with whom such property was held or maintained did 
not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts 
and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer 
required a license or authorization issued pursuant to this part and was 
not so licensed or authorized, or, if a license or authorization did 
purport to cover the transfer, that such license or authorization had 
been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding of 
material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property was held or maintained filed 
with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth in full 
the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon discovery 
that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or 
any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other direction or 
authorization issued pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director of 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

    Note to paragraph (d) of Sec. 545.202: The filing of a report in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall 
not be deemed evidence that the terms of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of 
this section have been satisfied.

    (e) Unless licensed pursuant to this part, any attachment, judgment, 
decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial process is null 
and void

[[Page 307]]

with respect to any property in which on or since the effective date of 
Sec. 545.201 there existed an interest of a person whose property or 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 545.201(a).


<R05>
Sec. 545.203  Holding of funds in interest-bearing accounts; investment 
and reinvestment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, or 
as otherwise directed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any U.S. 
person holding funds, such as currency, bank deposits, or liquidated 
financial obligations, subject to Sec. 545.201(a) shall hold or place 
such funds in a blocked interest-bearing account located in the United 
States.
    (b)(1) For purposes of this section, the term blocked interest-
bearing account means a blocked account:
    (i) In a federally-insured U.S. bank, thrift institution, or credit 
union, provided the funds are earning interest at rates that are 
commercially reasonable; or
    (ii) With a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provided 
the funds are invested in a money market fund or in U.S. Treasury bills.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a rate is commercially reasonable 
if it is the rate currently offered to other depositors on deposits or 
instruments of comparable size and maturity.
    (3) Funds held or placed in a blocked account pursuant to this 
paragraph (b) may not be invested in instruments the maturity of which 
exceeds 180 days. If interest is credited to a separate blocked account 
or subaccount, the name of the account party on each account must be the 
same.
    (c) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 
180 days at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 545.201(a) may 
continue to be held until maturity in the original instrument, provided 
any interest, earnings, or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid 
into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph (b) 
or (d) of this section.
    (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the United 
States at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 545.201(a) may 
continue to be held in the same type of accounts or instruments, 
provided the funds earn interest at rates that are commercially 
reasonable.
    (e) This section does not create an affirmative obligation for the 
holder of blocked tangible property, such as chattels or real estate, or 
of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to sell or 
liquidate such property at the time the property becomes subject to 
Sec. 545.201(a). However, the Office of Foreign Assets Control may 
issue licenses permitting or directing such sales in appropriate cases.
    (f) Funds subject to this section may not be held, invested, or 
reinvested in a manner that provides immediate financial or economic 
benefit or access to persons whose property or interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to Sec. 545.201(a), nor may their holder cooperate in 
or facilitate the pledging or other attempted use as collateral of 
blocked funds or other assets.


<R05>
Sec. 545.204  Prohibited exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply of 
goods, software, technology, or services.

    Except as otherwise authorized, and notwithstanding any contract 
entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective 
date, the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or 
indirectly, from the United States, or by a U.S. person, wherever 
located, of any goods, software, technology (including technical data), 
or services to the territory of Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban or 
to the Taliban or to persons whose property or interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to Sec. 545.201 is prohibited.


<R05>

services.

civil monetary penalty claims. In the event the Director grants the 
request, under terms and conditions within his discretion, the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control will agree to withhold issuance of the prepenalty 
notice for a period not to exceed 60 days and will enter into settlement 
negotiations of the potential civil monetary penalty claim.


<R05>
Sec. 545.703  Response to prepenalty notice; informal settlement.

    (a) Deadline for response. The respondent may submit a response to 
the prepenalty notice within the applicable 30 day period set forth in 
this paragraph. The Director may grant, at his discretion, an extension 
of time in which to submit a response to the prepenalty notice. The 
failure to submit a response within the applicable time period set forth 
in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to 
respond.
    (1) Computation of time for response. A response to the prepenalty 
notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or 
foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider 
(if transmitted to OFAC by courier) on or before the 30th day after the 
postmark date on the envelope in which the prepenalty notice was mailed. 
If the respondent refused delivery or otherwise avoided receipt of the 
prepenalty notice, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or 
before the 30th day after the date on the stamped postal receipt 
maintained at the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If the prepenalty 
notice was personally delivered to the respondent by a non-U.S. Postal 
Service agent authorized by the Director, a response must be postmarked 
or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (2) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at 
the Director's discretion, only upon the respondent's specific request 
to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (b) Form and method of response. The response must be submitted in 
writing and may be handwritten or typed. The response need not be in any 
particular form. A copy of the written response may be sent by 
facsimile, but the original also must be sent to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control Civil Penalties Division by mail or courier and must

[[Page 323]]

be postmarked or date-stamped, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) Contents of response. A written response must contain 
information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the 
prepenalty notice.
    (1) A written response must include the respondent's full name, 
address, telephone number, and facsimile number, if available, or those 
of the representative of the respondent.
    (2) A written response should either admit or deny each specific 
violation alleged in the prepenalty notice and also state if the 
respondent has no knowledge of a particular violation. If the written 
response fails to address any specific violation alleged in the 
prepenalty notice, that alleged violation shall be deemed to be 
admitted.
    (3) A written response should include any information in defense, 
evidence in support of an asserted defense, or other factors that the 
respondent requests the Office of Foreign Assets Control to consider. 
Any defense or explanation previously made to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control or any other agency must be repeated in the written 
response. Any defense not raised in the written response will be 
considered waived. The written response also should set forth the 
reasons why the respondent believes the penalty should not be imposed or 
why, if imposed, it should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (d) Default. If the respondent elects not to submit a written 
response within the time limit set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section, the Office of Foreign Assets Control will conclude that the 
respondent has decided not to respond to the prepenalty notice. The 
agency generally will then issue a written penalty notice imposing the 
penalty proposed in the prepenalty notice.
    (e) Informal settlement. In addition to or as an alternative to a 
written response to a prepenalty notice, the respondent or respondent's 
representative may contact the Office of Foreign Assets Control as 
advised in the prepenalty notice to propose the settlement of 
allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and related matters. 
However, the requirements set forth in paragraph (f) of this section as 
to oral communication by the representative must first be fulfilled. In 
the event of settlement at the prepenalty stage, the claim proposed in 
the prepenalty notice will be withdrawn, the respondent will not be 
required to take a written position on allegations contained in the 
prepenalty notice, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control will make no 
final determination as to whether a violation occurred. The amount 
accepted in settlement of allegations in a prepenalty notice may vary 
from the civil penalty that might finally be imposed in the event of a 
formal determination of violation. In the event no settlement is 
reached, the time limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section for 
written response to the prepenalty notice remains in effect unless 
additional time is granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (f) Representation. A representative of the respondent may act on 
behalf of the respondent, but any oral communication with the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission regarding the 
specific allegations contained in the prepenalty notice must be preceded 
by a written letter of representation, unless the prepenalty notice was 
served upon the respondent in care of the representative.


<R05>
Sec. 545.704  Penalty imposition or withdrawal.

    (a) No violation. If, after considering any response to the 
prepenalty notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control determines that there was no violation by the 
respondent named in the prepenalty notice, the Director shall notify the 
respondent in writing of that determination and of the cancellation of 
the proposed monetary penalty.
    (b) Violation. (1) If, after considering any written response to the 
prepenalty notice, or default in the submission of a written response, 
and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control determines that there was a violation by the respondent named in 
the prepenalty notice, the Director is authorized to issue a written 
penalty notice to the respondent of the determination of violation and 
the imposition of the monetary penalty.

[[Page 324]]

    (2) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent that payment or 
arrangement for installment payment of the assessed penalty must be made 
within 30 days of the date of mailing of the penalty notice by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent of the 
requirement to furnish the respondent's taxpayer identification number 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 7701 and that such number will be used for 
purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent penalty amount.
    (4) The issuance of the penalty notice finding a violation and 
imposing a monetary penalty shall constitute final agency action. The 
respondent has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency 
action in federal district court.


<R05>
Sec. 545.705  Administrative collection; referral to United States
Department of Justice.

    In the event that the respondent does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control within 30 days of the 
date of mailing of the penalty notice, the matter may be referred for 
administrative collection measures by the Department of the Treasury or 
to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate action to 
recover the penalty in a civil suit in a federal district court.

      Subpart A_Relation of This Part to Other Laws and Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 546.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to 
part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in 
this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing 
foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No 
license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other 
provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by 
this part. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant 
to this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations.

                         Subpart B_Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 546.201  Prohibited transactions involving blocked property.

services from any person whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any security 
(or evidence thereof) held within the possession or control of a U.S. 
person and either registered or inscribed in the name of, or known to be 
held for the benefit of, or issued by, any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked

[[Page 327]]

pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is prohibited. This 
prohibition includes but is not limited to the transfer (including the 
transfer on the books of any issuer or agent thereof), disposition, 
transportation, importation, exportation, or withdrawal of, or the 
endorsement or guaranty of signatures on, any such security on or after 
the effective date. This prohibition applies irrespective of the fact 
that at any time (whether prior to, on, or subsequent to the effective 
date) the registered or inscribed owner of any such security may have or 
might appear to have assigned, transferred, or otherwise disposed of the 
security.


<R05>
Sec. 546.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that 
involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec. 
546.201(a), is null and void and shall not be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or 
privilege with respect to such property or property interests.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in property 
blocked pursuant to Sec. 546.201(a), unless the person who holds or 
maintains such property, prior to that date, had written notice of the 
transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, or 
after a transfer shall validate such transfer or make it enforceable to 
the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the 
provisions of IEEPA, Executive Order 13400, this part, and any 
regulation, order, directive, ruling, instruction, or license issued 
pursuant to this part.
    (d) Transfers of property that otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property is or was held or maintained (and as to such person only) 
in cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction 
of the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property is or was 
held or maintained (and as to such person only);
    (2) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
did not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the 
facts and circumstances known or available to such person, that such 
transfer required a license or authorization issued pursuant to this 
part and was not so licensed or authorized, or, if a license or 
authorization did purport to cover the transfer, that such license or 
authorization had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or 
withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; 
and
    (3) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
filed with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth 
in full the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon 
discovery that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or 
any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other directive or 
authorization issued pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director of 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

    Note to paragraph (d) of Sec. 546.202: The filing of a report in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall 
not be deemed evidence that the terms of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of 
this section have been satisfied.


[[Page 328]]


    (e) Unless licensed pursuant to this part, any attachment, judgment, 
decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial process is null 
and void with respect to any property in which, on or since the 
effective date, there existed an interest of a person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 546.201(a).


<R05>
Sec. 546.203  Holding of funds in interest-bearing accounts; investment
and reinvestment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, or 
as otherwise directed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any U.S. 
person holding funds, such as currency, bank deposits, or liquidated 
financial obligations, subject to Sec. 546.201(a) shall hold or place 
such funds in a blocked interest-bearing account located in the United 
States.
    (b)(1) For purposes of this section, the term blocked interest-
bearing account means a blocked account:
    (i) In a federally-insured U.S. bank, thrift institution, or credit 
union, provided the funds are earning interest at rates that are 
commercially reasonable; or
    (ii) With a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 
78a et seq.), provided the funds are invested in a money market fund or 
in U.S. Treasury bills.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a rate is commercially reasonable 
if it is the rate currently offered to other depositors on deposits or 
instruments of comparable size and maturity.
    (3) Funds held or placed in a blocked account pursuant to this 
paragraph (b) may not be invested in instruments the maturity of which 
exceeds 180 days. If interest is credited to a separate blocked account 
or subaccount, the name of the account party on each account must be the 
same.
    (c) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 
180 days at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 546.201(a) may 
continue to be held until maturity in the original instrument, provided 
any interest, earnings, or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid 
into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph (b) 
or (d) of this section.
    (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the United 
States at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 546.201(a) may 
continue to be held in the same type of accounts or instruments, 
provided the funds earn interest at rates that are commercially 
reasonable.
    (e) This section does not create an affirmative obligation for the 
holder of blocked tangible property, such as chattels or real estate, or 
of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to sell or 
liquidate such property. However, the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
may issue licenses permitting or directing such sales or liquidation in 
appropriate cases.
    (f) Funds subject to this section may not be held, invested, or 
reinvested in a manner that provides immediate financial or economic 
benefit or access to any person whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to Sec. 546.201(a), nor may their holder cooperate 
in or facilitate the pledging or other attempted use as collateral of 
blocked funds or other assets.


<R05>
Sec. 546.204  Expenses of maintaining blocked physical property; 
liquidation of blocked property.

    (a) Except as otherwise authorized, and notwithstanding the 
existence of any rights or obligations conferred or imposed by any 
international agreement or contract entered into or any license or 
permit granted prior to the effective date, all expenses incident to the 
maintenance of physical property blocked pursuant to Sec. 546.201(a) 
shall be the responsibility of the owners or operators of such property, 
which expenses shall not be met from blocked funds.
    (b) Property blocked pursuant to Sec. 546.201(a) may, in the 
discretion of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, be sold or 
liquidated and the net proceeds placed in a blocked interest-bearing 
account in the name of the owner of the property.

[[Page 329]]


<R05>
Sec. 546.205  Evasions; attempts; conspiracies.

    (a) Except as otherwise authorized, and notwithstanding any contract 
entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective 
date, any transaction by a U.S. person or within the United States on or 
after the effective date that evades or avoids, has the purpose of 
evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set 
forth in this part is prohibited.
    (b) Except as otherwise authorized, and notwithstanding any contract 
entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective 
date, any conspiracy formed to violate the prohibitions set forth in 
this part is prohibited.

<R05>
Sec. 546.301  Arms or any related materiel.

    The term arms or any related materiel shall mean arms or related 
materiel of all types, military aircraft, and equipment, but excludes:

authorize any transaction prohibited by any other provision of this 
chapter unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license

    (2) The criminal penalties provided in IEEPA are subject to 
adjustment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571.
    (c) Attention is directed to section 5 of the United Nations 
Participation Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c(b)) (``UNPA''), which

violate or evade any order, rule, or regulation issued by the President

Sec. 546.702  Pre-Penalty Notice; settlement.

    (a) When required. If the Office of Foreign Assets Control has 
reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of any provision 
of this part or a violation of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant 
to this part or otherwise under IEEPA and determines that a civil 
monetary penalty is warranted, the Office of Foreign Assets Control will 
issue a Pre-Penalty Notice informing the alleged violator of the 
agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty. A Pre-Penalty Notice shall 
be in writing. The Pre-Penalty Notice may be issued whether or not 
another agency has taken any action with respect to the matter. For a 
description of the contents of a Pre-Penalty Notice, see appendix A to 
part 501 of this chapter.
    (b)(1) Right to respond. An alleged violator has the right to 
respond to a Pre-Penalty Notice by making a written presentation to the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control. For a description of the information 
that should be included in such a response, see appendix A to part 501 
of this chapter.
    (2) Deadline for response. A response to the Pre-Penalty Notice must 
be made within the applicable 30-day period set forth in this paragraph. 
The failure to submit a response within the

[[Page 336]]

applicable time period set forth in this paragraph shall be deemed to be 
a waiver of the right to respond.
    (i) Computation of time for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty 
Notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or 
foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider 
(if transmitted to the Office of Foreign Assets Control by courier) on 
or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the envelope in which 
the Pre-Penalty Notice was mailed. If the Pre-Penalty Notice was 
personally delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent authorized by 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a response must be postmarked or 
date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (ii) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at 
the discretion of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, only upon 
specific request to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) Form and method of response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice 
need not be in any particular form, but it must be typewritten and

Sec. 546.703  Penalty imposition.

    If, after considering any written response to the Pre-Penalty Notice 
and any relevant facts, the Office of Foreign Assets Control determines 
that there was a violation by the alleged violator named in the Pre-
Penalty Notice and that a civil monetary penalty is appropriate, the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control may issue a written Penalty Notice to 
the violator containing a determination of the violation and the 
imposition of the monetary penalty. For additional details concerning 
issuance of a Penalty Notice, see Appendix A to part 501 of this 
chapter. The issuance of the Penalty Notice shall constitute final 
agency action. The violator has the right to seek judicial review of 
that final agency action in Federal district court.

of Justice.

    In the event that the violator does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the

referred for administrative collection measures by the Department of the 
Treasury or to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate 
action to recover the penalty in a civil suit in a Federal district 
court.

      Subpart A_Relation of This Part to Other Laws and Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 547.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to 
part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in 
this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing 
foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No 
license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other 
provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by 
this part. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant 
to this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations.


<R04>
                         Subpart B_Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 547.201  Prohibited transactions involving blocked property.

rulings, instructions, licenses, or otherwise, and notwithstanding any 
contracts entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the

including their overseas branches, of the following persons are blocked 
and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise 
dealt in:
    (1) Any person listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13413 of

    (2) Any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after

operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that impedes the

related to military activities;
    (vi) To have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support

[[Page 339]]

    (vii) To be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act 
for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property 
and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this paragraph (a).

    Note 1 to paragraph (a) of Sec. 547.201: 1. The names of persons 
listed in or designated pursuant to Executive Order 13413, whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section, are published on the Office of Foreign Assets Control's 
Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (``SDN List'') 
(which is accessible via the Office of Foreign Assets Control's Web 
site), published in the Federal Register, and incorporated into Appendix 
A to this chapter with the identifier ``[DRC].'' See Sec. 547.411 
concerning entities that may not be listed on the SDN list but whose 
property and interests in property are nevertheless blocked pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    Note 2 to paragraph (a) of Sec. 547.201. Section 203 of the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706)

in property of a person during the pendency of an investigation. The 
names of persons whose property and interests in property are blocked 
pending investigation pursuant to this part also are published on the 
SDN List, published in the Federal Register and incorporated into 
Appendix A to this chapter with the identifier ``[BPI-DRC].''
    Note 3 to paragraph (a) of Sec. 547.201. Sections 501.806 and 
501.807 of this chapter describe the procedures to be followed by 
persons seeking, respectively, the unblocking of funds that they believe

of their status as persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

    (b) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section include, but 
are not limited to, prohibitions on the following transactions when

services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section; and
    (2) The receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services from any person whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any security 
(or evidence thereof) held within the possession or control of a U.S. 
person and either registered or inscribed in the name of, or known to be 
held for the benefit of, or issued by, any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section is prohibited. This prohibition includes but is not limited to 
the transfer (including the transfer on the books of any issuer or agent 
thereof), disposition, transportation, importation, exportation, or 
withdrawal of, or the endorsement or guaranty of signatures on, any such 
security on or after the effective date. This prohibition applies 
irrespective of the fact that at any time (whether prior to, on, or 
subsequent to the effective date) the registered or inscribed owner of 
any such security may have or might appear to have assigned, 
transferred, or otherwise disposed of the security.


<R05>
Sec. 547.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that 
involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec. 
547.201(a), is null and void and shall not be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or 
privilege with respect to such property or property interests.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in property 
blocked pursuant to Sec. 547.201(a), unless the person who holds or 
maintains such property, prior to that date, had written notice of the 
transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Director of

[[Page 340]]

the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, or after a transfer 
shall validate such transfer or make it enforceable to the same extent 
that it would be valid or enforceable but for the provisions of IEEPA, 
Executive Order 13413, this part, and any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part.
    (d) Transfers of property that otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property is or was held or maintained (and as to such person only) 
in cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction 
of the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property is or was 
held or maintained (and as to such person only);
    (2) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
did not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the 
facts and circumstances known or available to such person, that such 
transfer required a license or authorization issued pursuant to this 
part and was not so licensed or authorized, or, if a license or 
authorization did purport to cover the transfer, that such license or 
authorization had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or 
withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; 
and
    (3) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
filed with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth 
in full the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon 
discovery that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or 
any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other direction or 
authorization issued pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director of 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

    Note to paragraph (d) of Sec. 547.202: The filing of a report in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall 
not be deemed evidence that the terms of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of 
this section have been satisfied.

    (e) Unless licensed pursuant to this part, any attachment, judgment, 
decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial process is null 
and void with respect to any property in which, on or since the 
effective date, there existed an interest of a person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 547.201(a).


<R05>
Sec. 547.203  Holding of funds in interest-bearing accounts; investment
and reinvestment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, or 
as otherwise directed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any U.S.

financial obligations, subject to Sec. 547.201(a) shall hold or place 
such funds in a blocked interest-bearing account located in the United 
States.
    (b)(1) For purposes of this section, the term blocked interest-
bearing account means a blocked account:
    (i) In a federally-insured U.S. bank, thrift institution, or credit 
union, provided the funds are earning interest at rates that are 
commercially reasonable; or
    (ii) With a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 
78a et seq.), provided the funds are invested in a money market fund or 
in U.S. Treasury bills.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a rate is commercially reasonable 
if it is the rate currently offered to other depositors on deposits or 
instruments of comparable size and maturity.
    (3) Funds held or placed in a blocked account pursuant to this 
paragraph (b) may not be invested in instruments the maturity of which 
exceeds 180 days. If interest is credited to a separate blocked account 
or subaccount, the name of the account party on each account must be the 
same.

[[Page 341]]

    (c) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 
180 days at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 547.201(a) may 
continue to be held until maturity in the original instrument, provided 
any interest, earnings, or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid 
into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph (b) 
or (d) of this section.
    (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the United 
States at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 547.201(a) may 
continue to be held in the same type of accounts or instruments, 
provided the funds earn interest at rates that are commercially 
reasonable.
    (e) This section does not create an affirmative obligation for the 
holder of blocked tangible property, such as chattels or real estate, or 
of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to sell or 
liquidate such property. However, the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
may issue licenses permitting or directing such sales or liquidation in 
appropriate cases.
    (f) Funds subject to this section may not be held, invested, or 
reinvested in a manner that provides immediate financial or economic 
benefit or access to any person whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to Sec. 547.201(a), nor may their holder cooperate 
in or facilitate the pledging or other attempted use as collateral of 
blocked funds or other assets.


<R05>
Sec. 547.204  Expenses of maintaining blocked physical property; 
liquidation of blocked property.

    (a) Except as otherwise authorized, and notwithstanding the

international agreement or contract entered into or any license or 
permit granted prior to the effective date, all expenses incident to the

authorize any transaction prohibited by any other provision of this 
chapter unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license

    (c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizing any 
transaction otherwise prohibited under this part has the effect of 
removing a prohibition contained in this part from the transaction, but

    (2) The criminal penalties provided in IEEPA are subject to 
adjustment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571.
    (c) Attention is directed to section 5 of the United Nations 
Participation Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c(b)) (``UNPA''), which

Sec. 547.702  Pre-Penalty Notice; settlement.

    (a) When required. If the Office of Foreign Assets Control has 
reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of any provision 
of this part or a violation of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant 
to this part or otherwise under IEEPA and determines that a civil 
monetary penalty is warranted, the Office of Foreign Assets Control will 
issue a Pre-Penalty Notice informing the alleged violator of the 
agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty. A Pre-Penalty Notice shall 
be in writing. The Pre-Penalty Notice may be issued whether or not 
another agency has taken any action with respect to the matter. For a 
description of the contents of a Pre-Penalty Notice, see Appendix A to 
part 501 of this chapter.
    (b)(1) Right to respond. An alleged violator has the right to 
respond to a Pre-Penalty Notice by making a written presentation to the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control. For a description of the information 
that should be included in such a response, see Appendix A to part 501 
of this chapter.
    (2) Deadline for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice must 
be made within the applicable 30-day period set forth in this paragraph. 
The failure to submit a response within the applicable time period set 
forth in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to 
respond.
    (i) Computation of time for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty 
Notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or 
foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider 
(if transmitted to the Office of Foreign Assets Control by courier) on 
or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the envelope in which 
the Pre-Penalty Notice was mailed. If the Pre-Penalty Notice was 
personally delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent authorized by 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a response must be postmarked or 
date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (ii) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at 
the discretion of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, only upon 
specific request to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) Form and method of response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice 
need not be in any particular form, but it must be typewritten and 
signed by the alleged violator or a representative thereof, must contain 
information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the Pre-
Penalty Notice, and must include the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
identification number listed on the Pre-Penalty Notice. A copy of the 
written response may be sent by facsimile, but the original also must be

[[Page 349]]

sent to the Office of Foreign Assets Control Civil Penalties Division by 
mail or courier and must be postmarked or date-stamped, in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Settlement. Settlement discussion may be initiated by the Office 
of Foreign Assets Control, the alleged violator, or the alleged 
violator's authorized representative. For a description of practices 
with respect to settlement, see Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (d) Guidelines. Guidelines for the imposition or settlement of civil 
penalties by the Office of Foreign Assets Control are contained in 
appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (e) Representation. A representative of the alleged violator may act 
on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission regarding 
the specific allegations contained in the Pre-Penalty Notice must be 
preceded by a written letter of representation, unless the Pre-Penalty 
Notice was served upon the alleged violator in care of the 
representative.


<R05>
Sec. 547.703  Penalty imposition.

    If, after considering any written response to the Pre-Penalty Notice 
and any relevant facts, the Office of Foreign Assets Control determines 
that there was a violation by the alleged violator named in the Pre-
Penalty Notice and that a civil monetary penalty is appropriate, the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control may issue a Penalty Notice to the 
violator containing a determination of the violation and the imposition 
of the monetary penalty. For additional details concerning issuance of a 
Penalty Notice, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter. The issuance 
of the Penalty Notice shall constitute final agency action. The violator 
has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency action in 
federal district court.


<R05>
Sec. 547.704  Administrative collection; referral to United States
Department of Justice.

    In the event that the violator does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the matter may be 
referred for administrative collection measures by the Department of the 
Treasury or to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate 
action to recover the penalty in a civil suit in a federal district 
court.

for use in foreign-made products or technology.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and 
notwithstanding the prohibitions in Sec. 560.204, the exportation or 
supply of goods or technology from the United States, or by a United 
States person wherever located, for substantial transformation or 
incorporation into a foreign-made end product in a country other than 
the United States or Iran, intended specifically or predominantly for 
Iran or the Government of Iran, is permitted under this part where the 
exporter has ascertained that all of the following are the case:

[[Page 364]]

    (1) The U.S.-origin goods or technology being exported for 
substantial transformation or incorporation abroad were not subject to 
export license application requirements under any United States 
regulations in effect on May 6, 1995, or were not thereafter made 
subject to such regulations imposed independently of this part;
    (2) With respect to the foreign-made end product:
    (i) U.S.-origin goods (excluding software) comprise less than 10 
percent of the foreign-made good (excluding software);
    (ii) U.S.-origin software comprises less than 10 percent of the 
foreign-made software;
    (iii) U.S.-origin technology comprises less than 10 percent of the 
foreign-made technology; and
    (iv) In cases involving a complex product made of a combination of 
goods (including software) and technology, the aggregate value of all 
U.S.-origin goods (including software) and technology contained in the 
foreign-made end product is less than 10 percent of the total value of 
the foreign-made product;
    (3) The foreign-made end product is not destined to end uses or end 
users prohibited under regulations administered by other U.S. Government 
agencies. See, e.g., the Export Administration Regulations (31 CFR 
736.2(b)(5), 744.2, 744.3, 744.4, 744.7, and 744.10); International 
Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR 123.9);
    (4) The foreign-made end product is not intended for use in the 
Iranian petroleum or petrochemical industry. For this purpose, products 
intended for use in the Iranian petroleum or petrochemical industry 
include not only products uniquely suited for use in those industries, 
such as oilfield services equipment, but also goods and technology for 
use in products, such as computers, office equipment, construction 
equipment, or building materials, which are suitable for use in other 
industries but which are intended specifically for use in the petroleum 
or petrochemical industries.
    (b) The authorization contained in this section is not available if 
the foreign-made end product is of a type which other U.S. Government 
agencies make ineligible for de minimis U.S.-origin content. See, e.g., 
the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR 734.4(a) and (b)); 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR 123.9).

    Note to Sec. 560.511. An exportation authorized by this section may 
nevertheless require authorization by the U.S. Department of Commerce, 
the U.S. Department of State or other agencies of the U.S. Government.

Sec. 560.530  Commercial sales, exportation, and reexportation of 
agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices.

    (a) One-year license requirement. The exportation or reexportation 
of agricultural commodities (including bulk agricultural commodities 
listed in appendix B to this part 560), medicine, or medical devices to 
the Government of Iran, any entity in Iran, individuals in Iran, or 
persons in third countries purchasing specifically for resale to any of 
the foregoing, shall only be made pursuant to a one-year license issued 
by the United States Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign 
Assets Control, for contracts entered into during the one-year period of 
the license and shipped within the 12-month period beginning on the date 
of the signing of the contract. No license will be granted for the 
exportation or reexportation of agricultural commodities, medicine, or

[[Page 371]]

medical equipment to any entity or individual in Iran promoting 
international terrorism. Executory contracts entered into pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section prior to the issuance of the one-year 
license described in this paragraph shall be deemed to have been signed 
on the date of issuance of that one-year license (and, therefore, the 
exporter is authorized to make shipments under that contract within the 
12-month period beginning on the date of issuance of the one-year 
license).
    (b) General license for arrangement of exportation and reexportation 
of covered products. (1) The making of shipping arrangements, cargo 
inspections, obtaining of insurance, and arrangement of financing 
(consistent with Sec. 560.532) for the exportation or reexportation of 
agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices to the 
Government of Iran, entities in Iran, individuals in Iran, or persons in 
third countries purchasing specifically for resale to any of the 
foregoing, is authorized.
    (2) If desired, entry into executory contracts (including executory 
pro forma invoices, agreements in principle, or executory offers capable 
of acceptance such as bids in response to public tenders) for the 
exportation or reexportation of agricultural commodities, medicine, and 
medical devices to the Government of Iran, entities in Iran, individuals 
in Iran, or persons in third countries purchasing specifically for 
resale to any of the foregoing, is authorized, provided that performance 
of an executory contract is expressly made contingent upon the prior 
issuance of the one-year license described in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) Instructions for obtaining one-year licenses. In order to obtain 
the one-year license described in paragraph (a), the exporter must 
provide to the Office of Foreign Assets Control:
    (1) The applicant's full legal name (if the applicant is a business 
entity, the state or jurisdiction of incorporation and principal place 
of business).
    (2) The applicant's mailing and street address (so that OFAC may 
reach a responsible point of contact, the applicant should also include 
the name of the individual(s) responsible for the application and 
related commercial transactions along with their telephone and fax 
numbers and, if available, email addresses).
    (3) The names, mailing addresses, and, if available, fax and 
telephone numbers of all parties with an interest in the transaction. If 
the goods are being exported or reexported to a purchasing agent in 
Iran, the exporter must identify the agent's principals at the wholesale 
level for whom the purchase is being made. If the goods are being 
exported or reexported to an individual, the exporter must identify any 
organizations or entities with which the individual is affiliated that 
have an interest in the transaction.
    (4) A description of all items to be exported or reexported pursuant 
to the requested one-year license, including a statement that the item 
is classified as EAR 99, and, if necessary, documentation sufficient to 
verify that the items to be exported or reexported are classified as EAR 
99 and do not fall within any of the limitations contained in paragraph 
(d) of this section.
    (5) An Official Commodity Classification of EAR 99 issued by the 
Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration (``BXA''), 
certifying that the product is EAR 99 is required to be submitted to 
OFAC with the request for a license authorizing the exportation or 
reexportation of all fertilizers, live horses, western red cedar, and 
medical devices other than basic medical supplies, such as syringes, 
bandages, gauze and similar items, that are specifically listed on BXA's 
website, www.bxa.doc.gov/Regulations/Trade Sanctions ReformExport 
EnhancementAct.html. Medical supplies that are specifically listed on 
BXA's website do not require an Official Commodity Classification of EAR 
99 from BXA. BXA will also provide a list on its website of medicines 
that are ineligible for a one-year license under these procedures. If an 
exporter is uncertain whether the medicine to be exported is eligible, 
they should seek an Official Commodity Classification of EAR 99 from BXA 
and submit a copy to OFAC. See, 15 CFR 745.3 for instructions for 
obtaining Official Commodity Classification of EAR 99 from BXA.

[[Page 372]]

    (d) Limitations. (1) Nothing in this section or in any license 
issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section relieves the exporter 
from compliance with the export license application requirements of 
another Federal agency.

control list established under the Export Administration Act of 1979 or 
any successor statute (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.); or used to 
facilitate the development or production of a chemical or biological 
weapon or weapon of mass destruction.
    (3) Nothing in this section or in any license issued pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section affects prohibitions on the sale or supply 
of U.S. technology or software used to manufacture agricultural 
commodities, medicine, or medical devices, such as technology to design 
or produce biotechnological items or medical devices.
    (4) Nothing in this section or in any license issued pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section affects U.S. nonproliferation export 
controls, including end-user and end-use controls maintained under the 
Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative.
    (5) This section does not apply to any transaction or dealing 
involving property blocked pursuant to this chapter or any other 
activity prohibited by this chapter not otherwise authorized in this 
part.

commodities, medicine, and medical devices are defined below.

[[Page 373]]

remain in effect solely to permit completion of performance of contracts 
already entered into prior to July 26, 2001 pursuant to the license. As 
of July 26, 2001, new contracts for the exportation of bulk agricultural 
commodities may be entered into only pursuant to the terms of, and as 
authorized by, this part.

    (a) With respect to goods specified in Sec. 560.201, and not 
otherwise licensed or excepted from the scope of that section, 
appropriate Customs officers shall not accept or allow any:
    (1) Entry for consumption or warehouse (including any appraisement 
entry, any entry of goods imported in the mails, regardless of value, 
and any informal entries);
    (2) Entry for immediate exportation;
    (3) Entry for transportation and exportation;
    (4) Withdrawal from warehouse;
    (5) Admission, entry, transfer or withdrawal to or from a foreign 
trade zone; or
    (6) Manipulation or manufacture in a warehouse or in a foreign trade 
zone.
    (b) Customs officers may accept or allow the importation of Iranian-
origin goods under the procedures listed in paragraph (a) if:
    (1) A specific license pursuant to this part is presented; or
    (2) Instructions authorizing the transaction are received from the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (c) Whenever a specific license is presented to an appropriate 
Customs officer in accordance with this section, one additional legible 
copy of the entry, withdrawal or other appropriate document with respect 
to the merchandise involved must be filed with the appropriate Customs 
officers at the port where the transaction is to take place. Each copy 
of any such entry, withdrawal or other appropriate document, including 
the additional copy, must bear plainly on its face the number of the 
license pursuant to which it is filed. The original copy of the specific 
license must be presented to the appropriate Customs officers in respect 
of each such transaction and must bear a notation in ink by the licensee 
or person presenting the license showing the description, quantity and 
value of the merchandise to be entered, withdrawn or otherwise dealt 
with. This notation must be so placed and so written that there will 
exist no possibility of confusing it with anything placed on the license 
at the time of its issuance. If the license in fact authorizes the 
entry, withdrawal, or other transaction with regard to the merchandise, 
the appropriate Customs officer, or other authorized Customs employee, 
shall verify the notation by signing or initialing it after first 
assuring himself that it accurately describes the merchandise it 
purports to represent. The license shall thereafter be returned to the 
person presenting it and the additional copy of the entry, withdrawal or 
other appropriate document shall be forwarded by the appropriate Customs 
officer to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (d) If it is unclear whether an entry, withdrawal or other action 
affected by this section requires a specific license from the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control, the appropriate Customs officer may withhold any 
action thereon and shall advise such person to communicate directly with 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control to request that instructions be 
sent to the Customs officer to authorize him to take action with regard 
thereto.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date, which is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, ruling, instruction, 
license, or other direction or authorization hereunder and involves any 
property in which the Government of Iraq has or has had an interest 
since such date, is null and void and shall not be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power or 
privilege with respect to such property.

has an interest, or has had an interest since such date, unless the 
person with whom such property is held or maintained, prior to such 
date, had written notice of the transfer or by any written evidence had 
recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of

regulation, direction, or instruction issued hereunder.
    (d) Transfers of property which otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property was held or maintained (and as to such person only) in 
cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property was held 
or maintained;

not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts 
and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer 
required a license or authorization by or pursuant to this part and was 
not so licensed or authorized, or if a license or authorization did 
purport to cover the transfer, that such license or authorization had 
been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or the withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) Promptly upon discovery that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or

the person with whom such property was held or maintained filed with the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth in full the 
circumstances relating to such transfer. The filing of a report in 
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph shall not be deemed 
evidence that the terms of paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section 
have been satisfied.
    (e) Unless licensed or authorized pursuant to this part, any 
attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other 
judicial process is null and void with respect to any property in which,

interest-bearing status in a U.S. financial institution as of the

as chattels, nor does it create an affirmative obligation on the part of

prohibition in UNSC Resolution 661 on the importation of goods exported

Iraqi-origin goods in a third country does not exempt the third-country 
products from the prohibitions contained in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 575.411  Exports to third countries; transshipments.

    Exportation of goods or technology (including technical data and

received from the Government of Iraq with respect to such goods is 
placed in a blocked account in a U.S. financial institution pursuant to 
Sec. 575.503. The prohibitions of Sec. 575.205 apply to goods subject

Sec. 575.416  Travel transactions for journalistic activity in Iraq.

    (a) Section 575.207 does not prohibit travel transactions in Iraq by 
persons regularly employed in journalistic activity by recognized 
newsgathering organizations.
    (b) For purposes of this part:
    (1) A person is considered regularly employed as a journalist if he 
or she is employed in a constant or regular manner by a recognized 
newsgathering organization. Free-lance journalists should have an 
assignment from a recognized newsgathering organization requiring travel 
to Iraq, or be able to demonstrate that publication by a recognized 
newsgathering organization of a work requiring such travel is likely. 
The latter may be demonstrated by providing a resume listing previously-
published free-lance works or copies of previously-published works.

[[Page 396]]

    (2) Recognized newsgathering organizations include those entities 
regularly and principally engaged in collecting news for publication in 
the public press, transmission by wire services, or broadcast by radio 
or television.
    (c) Authorized travel transactions are limited to those incident to 
travel for the purpose of collecting and disseminating information for a

complete a securities sale also authorizes all activities by other 
parties required to complete the sale, including transactions by the 
buyer, brokers, transfer agents, banks, etc.


<R05>
Sec. 575.419  Transactions in Iraqi debt.

    Section 575.533 authorizes U.S. persons to trade in Iraqi commercial

possession or control of a U.S. person as of May 23, 2003, see Sec. 
575.533(b)(1), (c); and
    (b) Unless licensed or otherwise authorized by the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control, no U.S. person is permitted to enter into any 
transaction, including an attempt to collect on debt, with persons or 
organizations determined by the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control to be included within Sec. 575.306, persons on the Defense 
Department's 55-person Watch List, or persons identified by the 661

    (a) No license or other authorization contained in this part, or 
otherwise issued by or under the direction of the Director of the Office 
of Foreign Assets Control, shall be deemed to authorize or validate any 
transaction effected prior to the issuance of the license, unless 
specifically provided in such license or authorization.
    (b) No regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizes any 
transaction prohibited under this part unless the regulation, ruling, 
instruction, or license is issued by the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control and specifically refers to this part. No regulation, ruling, 
instruction, or license referring to this part shall be deemed to 
authorize any transaction prohibited by any provision of this chapter 
unless the regulation, ruling, instruction or license specifically 
refers to such provision.
    (c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizing any 
transaction otherwise prohibited under this part has the effect of 
removing a prohibition or prohibitions contained in Subpart B from the 
transaction, but only to the extent specifically stated by its terms. 
Unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license otherwise 
specifies, such an authorization does not create any right, duty, 
obligation, claim, or interest in, or with respect to, any property 
which would not otherwise exist under ordinary principles of law.

Sec. 575.502  Exclusion from licenses and authorizations.

    The Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control reserves the 
right to exclude any person, property, or transaction from the operation

States, to a blocked account in a U.S. financial institution located in 
the United States in the name of the Government of Iraq is hereby 
authorized, including incidental foreign exchange transactions, provided 
that such payment or transfer shall not be made from any blocked account 
if such payment or transfer represents, directly or indirectly, a 
transfer of any interest of the Government of Iraq to any other country 
or person.
    (b) This section authorizes transfer of the funds of a blocked 
demand deposit account to a blocked interest-bearing account under the 
same name or designation as was the demand deposit account, as required 
pursuant to Sec. 575.203 or at the instruction of the depositor, at any 
time. If such transfer is to a blocked account in a different U.S.

transferee financial institution must furnish within 10 business days of 
the date of transfer, the notification described in paragraph (h) of 
this section to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Blocked Assets

designation which differs from the name or designation of the specific 
blocked account or sub-account in which such securities or assets were 
or are held.
    (g) This section does not authorize any payment or transfer from a 
blocked account in a U.S. financial institution to a blocked account 
held under any name or designation which differs from the name or 
designation of the specified blocked account or sub-account from which 
the payment or transfer is made.

or with other applicable provisions of law, including any aviation,

    Note to Sec. 575.533(b)(2)(ii): Pursuant to an amendment to the 
Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 799),

Security, Department of Commerce. Reexportation of items originally 
authorized pursuant to a specific license issued by the Treasury 
Department must conform to the relevant provision of the Export

items being reexported and the country to which they are being 
reexported.

    Note to Sec. 575.533(b)(2)(iii): Pursuant to an amendment to the 
Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 799), 
effective July 30, 2004, further authorization by the Department of 
Commerce will be required for exports or reexports licensed by the 
Department of the Treasury prior to the transfer of such items within 
Iraq to a new end-user. The amendment also requires that any 
reexportation of items pursuant to a specific license issued by the 
Treasury Department must conform to the relevant provision of the Export 
Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 799) based on the 
country to which the items are being reexported.
    Note to Sec. 575.533(b)(2): The term ``controlled by the Department 
of Commerce'' means subject to a license requirement under the

reexportation to Iraq pursuant to 15 CFR part 742 or 15 CFR 746.3, as 
well as items and activities that require a license under the end-use

or the date of receipt if subsequent to July 15, 1992, is not being held 
in an interest-bearing account or otherwise invested in a manner 
authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, shall transfer such 
property to, or hold such property or cause such property to be held in, 
an interest-bearing account or interest-bearing status in a U.S. 
financial institution as of July 15, 1992, or the date of receipt if 
subsequent to July 15, 1992, unless otherwise authorized or directed by 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (2) The requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
shall apply to currency, bank deposits, accounts, obligations, and any 
other financial or economic resources or assets, and any proceeds 
resulting from the sale of tangible or intangible property. If interest 
is credited to an account separate from that in which the interest-
bearing asset is held, the name of the account party on both accounts 
must be the same and must clearly indicate the person(s) having an 
interest in the accounts. If the account is held in the name of the 
Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the former 
Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the name of 
the account to which interest is credited must be the same.
    (b) For purposes of this section, the term ``interest-bearing 
account'' means a blocked account in a U.S. financial institution 
earning interest at rates that are commercially reasonable for the 
amount of funds in the account, i.e., a rate similar to that currently 
offered other depositors on deposits of comparable size and maturity. 
Overnight investment of blocked funds is authorized, provided that the 
funds remain within the possession and control of the U.S. person 
holding the funds

[[Page 407]]

and that the funds remain in a blocked status at all times. Except as 
otherwise authorized, the funds may not be re-invested or held in 
instruments the maturity of which exceeds 90 days.
    (c) U.S. financial institutions receiving instructions to execute a 
payment or transfer of funds they hold in which a person has an interest 
whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 
585.201, shall block the funds and provide written notification to the 
Compliance Programs Division, Office of Foreign Assets Control, U.S. 
Treasury Department, 1500 Pennsylvania Ave., NW.-2131 Annex, Washington, 
DC 20220, within 10 business days from the value date of the payment or 
transfer. The notification shall include a photocopy of the payment or 
transfer instructions received, shall confirm that the payment or 
transfer has been deposited into an existing or newly-established 
blocked account, and shall provide the account number, the name of the 
account, the location of the account, the name and address of the 
transferor and transferee financial instructions, the date of the 
deposit and the amount of the payment or transfer.
    (d) This section does not apply to blocked tangible property, such 
as chattels, nor does it create an affirmative obligation on the part of 
the holder of such blocked tangible property to sell or liquidate the 
property and put the proceeds in a blocked account. However, the Office 
of Foreign Assets Control may issue licenses permitting or directing 
sales of tangible property in appropriate cases.

services by U.S. persons to the Government of the FRY (S&M) or to a

beneficiary that is the Government of the FRY (S&M) or a person in the 
FRY (S&M) is prohibited by Sec. 585.201 and not authorized, 
notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 585.503, if

business days for a specific license authorizing the account party to 
establish a blocked account on its books in the name of the FRY (S&M) 
beneficiary in the amount payable under the credit, in lieu of payment 
by the issuing or confirming bank into a blocked account and 
reimbursement therefor by the account party. Nothing in this section 
relieves any such bank or such account party from giving any notice of 
defense against payment or reimbursement that is required by applicable 
law.
    (c) Where there is outstanding a demand for payment under a standby 
letter of credit, and the issuing or confirming bank has been enjoined

described in paragraph

[[Page 422]]

(a) of this section into a blocked account in a U.S. financial 
institution or the supplying of any form of security deemed necessary.
    (e) Nothing in this section precludes the account party on any 
standby letter or credit or any other person from at any time contesting 
the legality of the demand from a beneficiary in the FRY (S&M) or from 
raising any other legal defense to payment under the standby letter of 
credit.
    (f) This section does not affect the obligation of the various 
parties to the instruments covered by this section if the instruments 
and payments thereunder are subsequently unblocked.
    (g) This section does not authorize any U.S. person to reimburse a 
non-U.S. bank for payment to an FRY (S&M) beneficiary under a standby 
letter of credit, except by payments into a blocked account in 
accordance with Sec. 585.503 or paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
    (h) A person receiving a specific license under paragraph (b) or (c) 
of this section shall certify to the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
within 5 business days after receipt of that license that it has 
established the blocked account on its books as provided in those 
paragraphs. However, in appropriate cases, this time period may be 
extended upon application to the Office of Foreign Assets Control when 
the account party has filed a petition with an appropriate court seeking 
a judicial order barring payment by the issuing or confirming bank.
    (i) For the purposes of this section:
    (1) The term standby letter of credit shall mean a letter of credit

    (2) The criminal penalties provided in the Act are subject to 
adjustment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571.

      Subpart A_Relation of This Part to Other Laws and Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 586.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    (a) This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts 
of this chapter with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions pursuant to part 
501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions of this part are 
considered actions pursuant to this part. Differing foreign policy and 
national security contexts may result in differing interpretations of 
similar language among the parts of this chapter. No license or 
authorization contained in or issued pursuant to those other parts 
authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No license or 
authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other provision of 
law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part.
    (b) No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations.

<R04>
                         Subpart B_Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 586.201  Prohibited transactions involving blocked property.

    (a) Except as authorized by regulations, orders, directives, 
rulings, instructions, licenses, or otherwise, no property or interests 
in property of the Governments of the FRY (S&M), the Republic of Serbia, 
and the Republic of Montenegro, that are in the United States, that 
hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come 
within the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their 
overseas branches, may be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn or 
otherwise dealt in.

    Note to paragraph (a) of Sec. 586.201: See note at end of this 
section with regard to the lifting of certain sanctions effective 
January 19, 2001.

    (b) The blocking of property and property interests in paragraph (a) 
of this section includes the prohibition of financial transactions with, 
including trade financing for, the Governments of the FRY (S&M), the 
Republic of Serbia, and the Republic of Montenegro by United States 
persons.

    Note to paragraph (b) of Sec. 586.201: See note at end of this 
section with regard to the lifting of certain sanctions effective 
January 19, 2001.

    (c) Property or interests in property blocked pursuant to Executive 
Order 13088 of June 9, 1998, as amended by Executive Order 13121 of 
April 30, 1999, and this part prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time, 
January 19, 2001, are blocked, and may not be transferred, paid, 
exported or otherwise dealt in except as otherwise authorized by the 
Secretary of the Treasury.

    Note to paragraph (c) of Sec. 586.201: See note at end of this 
section with regard to the lifting of certain sanctions effective 
January 19, 2001.

    (d) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, the transfer (including the 
transfer on the books of any issuer or agent thereof), disposition, 
transportation, importation, exportation, or withdrawal of, or the 
endorsement or guaranty of signatures on, or otherwise dealing in any 
security (or evidence thereof) registered or inscribed in the name of 
the Governments of the FRY (S&M), the Republic of Serbia, and the 
Republic of Montenegro, and held within the possession or control of a 
U.S. person is prohibited, irrespective of the fact that at any time 
(either prior to, on, or subsequent to the effective date) the 
registered or inscribed owner thereof may have, or appears to have, 
assigned, transferred, or otherwise disposed of any such security.

    Note to paragraph (d) of Sec. 586.201: See note at end of this 
section with regard to the lifting of certain sanctions effective 
January 19, 2001.

    (e) When a transaction results in the blocking of funds at a 
financial institution pursuant to this section and a party to the 
transaction believes the funds have been blocked due to mistaken 
identity, that party may seek to have such funds unblocked pursuant to 
the administrative procedures set forth in Sec. 501.806 of this 
chapter.

    Note to Sec. 586.201: Section 1(a) of Executive Order 13192 of 
January 17, 2001 (66 FR 7379, January 23, 2001), amended Executive Order 
13088 of June 9, 1998 (63 FR 32109, June 12, 1998), to remove 
prospectively the prohibition on transactions that involve blocked 
property and interests in property of the Governments of the FRY(S&M), 
the Republic of Serbia, and the Republic of Montenegro. Consequently, 
with the exception of transactions involving property or interests in 
property of persons designated in or pursuant to 31 CFR Sec. 
587.201(a), transactions or transfers by U.S. persons that involve the 
property or interests in property of the FRY(S&M) and that occur on or 
after January 19, 2001, are not prohibited by Sec. Sec. 586.201(a), 
(b), or (d). Executive Order 13088, as amended by Executive Order 13192, 
however, also requires that all property or interests in property 
blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13088 prior to January 19, 2001, 
shall remain blocked, except as otherwise authorized by the Secretary of 
the Treasury. See Sec. 586.201(c). The continued blocking of previously 
blocked property is necessary until provision is made to address claims 
or encumbrances with respect to such property.

[63 FR 54576, Oct. 13, 1998, as amended at 66 FR 50509, Oct. 3, 2001]

[[Page 431]]


<R05>
Sec. 586.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date which is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, license, or other authorization issued pursuant to 
this part and involves any property or interest in property blocked 
pursuant to Sec. 586.201 is null and void and shall not be the basis 
for the assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, 
power or privilege with respect to such property or property interests.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or interest in, any property or interest in property blocked 
pursuant to Sec. 586.201, unless the person with whom such property is 
held or maintained, prior to such date, had written notice of the 
transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, or 
after a transfer shall validate such transfer or render it enforceable 
to the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the 
provisions of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, this 
part, and any regulation, order, directive, ruling, instruction, or 
license issued pursuant to this part.
    (d) Transfers of property which otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property was held or maintained (and as to such person only) in 
cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property was held 
or maintained;
    (2) The person with whom such property was held or maintained did 
not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts 
and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer 
required a license or authorization by or pursuant to this part and was 
not so licensed or authorized, or if a license or authorization did 
purport to cover the transfer, that such license or authorization had 
been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or the withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property was held or maintained filed 
with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth in full 
the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon discovery 
that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or 
any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other direction or 
authorization issued pursuant to this part; or
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director of 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or the 
withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

    Note to paragraph (d) of Sec. 586.202: The filing of a report in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall 
not be deemed evidence that the terms of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of 
this section have been satisfied.

    (e) Unless licensed or authorized pursuant to this part, any 
attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other 
judicial process is null and void with respect to any property or 
interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec. 586.201.


<R05>
Sec. 586.203  Holding of funds in interest-bearing accounts; investment 
and reinvestment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, or 
as otherwise directed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any U.S. 
person holding funds, such as currency, bank deposits, or liquidated 
financial obligations, subject to Sec. 586.201 shall hold or place such 
funds in a blocked interest-bearing account located in the United 
States.

[[Page 432]]

    (b)(1) For purposes of this section, the term blocked interest-
bearing account means a blocked account:
    (i) In a federally-insured U.S. bank, thrift institution, or credit 
union, provided the funds are earning interest at rates which are 
commercially reasonable; or
    (ii) With a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provided 
the funds are invested in a money market fund or in U.S. Treasury bills.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a rate is commercially reasonable 
if it is the rate currently offered to other depositors on deposits or 
instruments of comparable size and maturity.
    (3) Funds held or placed in a blocked account pursuant to this 
paragraph (b) may not be invested in instruments the maturity of which 
exceeds 180 days. If interest is credited to a separate blocked account 
or sub-account, the name of the account party on each account must be 
the same.
    (c) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 
180 days at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 586.201 may 
continue to be held until maturity in the original instrument, provided 
any interest, earnings, or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid 
into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph (b) 
or (d) of this section.
    (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the United 
States at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 586.201 may 
continue to be held in the same type of accounts or instruments, 
provided the funds earn interest at rates which are commercially 
reasonable.
    (e) This section does not create an affirmative obligation for the 
holder of blocked tangible property, such as chattels or real estate, or 
of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to sell or 
liquidate such property at the time the property becomes subject to 
Sec. 586.201. However, the Office of Foreign Assets Control may issue 
licenses permitting or directing such sales in appropriate cases.
    (f) Funds subject to this section may not be held, invested, or 
reinvested in a manner which provides immediate financial or economic 
benefit or access to persons whose property or interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to Sec. 586.201, nor may their holder cooperate in or 
facilitate the pledging or other attempted use as collateral of blocked 
funds or other assets.


<R05>
Sec. 586.204  Prohibited new investment within Serbia.

    Except as otherwise provided in regulations, orders, directives, or 
licenses that may hereafter be issued pursuant to this order, all new 
investment in the territory of the Republic of Serbia by United States 
persons, and the approval or other facilitation by United States persons 
of other persons' new investment in the territory of the Republic of 
Serbia, are prohibited.

    Note to Sec. 586.204: Section 1(b) of Executive Order 13192 of 
January 17, 2001 (66 FR 7379, January 23, 2001), revoked section 3 of 
Executive Order 13088 of June 9, 1998 (63 FR 32109, June 12, 1998), 
which prohibited all new investment by United States persons in the 
territory of the Republic of Serbia and the approval and other 
facilitation by United States persons of other persons' new investment 
in the territory of the Republic of Serbia. Consequently, with the 
exception of transactions involving property or interests in property of 
persons designated in or pursuant to 31 CFR Sec. 587.201(a), the new 
investment activities of United States persons in the territory of the 
Republic of Serbia on or after January 19, 2001, are not prohibited by 
Sec. 586.204.

[63 FR 54576, Oct. 13, 1998, as amended at 66 FR 50509, Oct. 3, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 586.205  Evasions; attempts; conspiracies.

    Any transaction by any United States person or within the United 
States that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or avoiding, 
or attempts to violate, any of the prohibitions set forth in this part 
is prohibited. Any conspiracy formed for the purpose of engaging in a 
transaction prohibited by this part is prohibited.


<R05>
Sec. 586.206  Exempt transactions.

    (a) Personal communications. The prohibitions contained in this part 
do not apply to any postal, telegraphic, telephonic, or other personal

with respect to property in which the U.S. person knows, or has reason 
to know, that a person whose property and interests in property are

effective date.
    (b) Prohibited transactions include, but are not limited to, 
importation into or exportation from locations outside the United States 
of, or purchasing, selling, financing, swapping, insuring, transporting, 
lifting, storing, incorporating, transforming, brokering, or otherwise 
dealing in, within such locations, goods, technology or services in

has or has had an interest since the effective date.
    (c) Examples: (1) A U.S. person may not, within the United States or

by the Office of Foreign Assets Control to conduct such transactions 
with U.S. persons or the transaction is generally licensed in, or 
exempted from the prohibitions of, this part.

    Note to Sec. 586.407: See Sec. 586.513 with regard to the 
authorization of certain trade-related transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 586.408  Exempt financial transactions within the territory of 
the FRY (S&M); prohibition on establishment of new offices in Serbia.

    (a) Section 586.201(c) exempts financial transactions, including 
trade financing, from the prohibitions contained in Sec. 586.201 by 
U.S. persons physically located within the territory of the FRY (S&M), 
where those transactions are conducted exclusively through the domestic 
banking system within the FRY (S&M) in local currency (dinars), or using 
bank notes or barter. A U.S. entity must have a permanent establishment, 
such as a branch or representative office, within the territory of the 
FRY (S&M) to be considered physically located there for purposes of this 
paragraph (a).
    (b) The prohibition on new investment within Serbia contained in 
Sec. 586.204, as defined in Sec. 586.312, precludes the establishment 
after the effective date of a new representative or branch office or 
joint venture or other entity within the territory of the Republic of 
Serbia, because such activity

[[Page 438]]

would necessarily involve a commitment or contribution of funds or other 
assets to a public or private undertaking, entity, or project within 
Serbia. See Sec. 586.513 concerning the authorization of certain trade-
related transactions conducted using bank notes or barter by U.S. 
persons located outside of the territory of the FRY (S&M).

    Note to Sec. 586.408: All transactions with respect to property in 
which the Government of the Republic of Montenegro has an interest are 
authorized pursuant to Sec. 586.516. Therefore, all financial 
transactions by U.S. persons within the territory of the Republic of 
Montenegro are authorized, unless the transaction involves property in 
which another interest exists that is blocked pursuant to Sec. 586.201 
or any other part of this chapter. See Sec. 586.403.


<R05>
Sec. 586.409  Approval or other facilitation of other persons' investment
in the territory of the Republic of Serbia.

    (a) The prohibition contained in Sec. 586.204 against approval or 
other facilitation by U.S. persons of other persons' investment in the 
territory of the Republic of Serbia bars any action by a U.S. person 
that assists or supports other persons' activity that would constitute 
prohibited new investment under that section if engaged in by a U.S. 
person. Such approval or other facilitation with respect to persons 
whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 
586.201 also constitutes a violation of that section. See the definition 
of the term new investment in Sec. 586.312.
    (b) Examples: (1) A U.S. person is prohibited from brokering, 
financing, guaranteeing, or approving the purchase by any other person, 
including a foreign affiliate, of shares, including an equity interest, 
in a publicly or privately held undertaking, entity or project located 
in the territory of the Republic of Serbia, except as provided in Sec. 
586.514.
    (2) The sale to a non-U.S. person of a U.S. person's equity or 
income interest in an entity in the territory of the Republic of Serbia 
constitutes facilitation of that other person's investment in Serbia, 
and would otherwise be prohibited but for the authorization contained in 
Sec. 586.514.
    (3) A U.S. national or permanent resident alien employed by a 
foreign person may not participate in any decision-making role in an 
activity by the foreign person that includes investment in the territory 
of the Republic of Serbia.


<R05>
Sec. 586.410  Transfer of funds to the benefit of certain persons in 
the territory of the FRY (S&M).

    Section 586.201 does not prohibit U.S. financial institutions that 
are not blocked, including their foreign branches, from transferring 
funds to accounts in financial institutions for the benefit of 
individuals, non-governmental organizations and other persons located in 
the territory of the FRY (S&M) whose property and interests in property 
are not blocked pursuant to that section, provided that such 
transactions do not result in the transfer of funds to or for the 
benefit of persons whose property or interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to Sec. 586.201.

<R05>
Sec. 586.502  Effect of license or authorization.

    (a) No license or other authorization contained in this part, or 
otherwise issued by or under the direction of the Director of the Office 
of Foreign Assets Control pursuant to this part, authorizes or validates 
any transaction effected prior to the issuance of the license, unless 
specifically so provided in such license or authorization.
    (b) No regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizes any 
transaction prohibited under this part unless the regulation, ruling, 
instruction, or license is issued by the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control and specifically refers

[[Page 439]]

to this part. No regulation, ruling, instruction, or license referring 
to this part authorizes any transaction prohibited by any provision of 
this chapter unless the regulation, ruling, instruction or license 
specifically refers to such provision.
    (c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizing any 
transaction otherwise prohibited under this part has the effect of 
removing a prohibition or prohibitions contained in this part from the 
transaction, but only to the extent specifically stated by its terms. 
Unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license otherwise 
specifies, such an authorization does not create any right, duty, 
obligation, claim, or interest in, or with respect to, any property 
which would not otherwise exist under ordinary principles of law.

    Note to paragraph (c) of Sec. 586.502: The general license in Sec. 
586.516 authorizing transactions with respect to property in which the 
Government of the Republic of Montenegro has an interest removes such 
property and interests in property from the phrase ``property and 
interests in property blocked pursuant to Sec. 586.201'' for purposes 
of this part.

    (d) Any general license or statement of licensing policy contained 
in this part authorizing transactions with respect to the Government of 
the FRY (S&M) shall, unless otherwise stated, also authorize analogous 
transactions with respect to the Governments or territories of the 
Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro.


<R05>
Sec. 586.503  Exclusion from licenses and authorizations.

    The Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control reserves the 
right to exclude any person, property, or transaction from the operation 
of any license, or from the privileges therein conferred, or to restrict 
the applicability thereof with respect to particular persons, property, 
transactions, or classes thereof. Such action is binding upon all 
persons receiving actual or constructive notice of such exclusion or 
restriction.


<R05>
Sec. 586.504  Payments and transfers to blocked accounts in U.S. 
financial institutions.

    Any payment of funds or transfer of credit in which any person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 586.201 
has any interest, that comes within the possession or control of a U.S. 
financial institution, must be blocked in an account on the books of 
that financial institution. A transfer of funds or credit by a U.S. 
financial institution between blocked accounts in its branches or 
offices is authorized, provided that no transfer is made from an account 
within the United States to an account held outside the United States, 
and further provided that a transfer from a blocked account may only be 
made to another blocked account held in the same name.

    Note to Sec. 586.504: Please refer to Sec. 501.603 of this chapter 
for mandatory reporting requirements regarding financial transfers. See 
also Sec. 586.203 concerning the obligation to hold blocked funds in 
interest-bearing accounts.


<R05>
Sec. 586.505  Payment of obligations to U.S. persons authorized.

    (a) The transfer of funds after the effective date by, through, or 
to any U.S. financial institution or other U.S. person not blocked 
pursuant to this chapter solely for the purpose of payment of 
obligations to U.S. persons of persons whose property or interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 586.201 is authorized, provided 
that the obligation arose prior to the effective date or is otherwise 
authorized pursuant to statute or the provisions of this part, and the 
payment requires no debit to a blocked account. Property is not blocked 
by virtue of being transferred or received pursuant to this section.
    (b) A person receiving payment under this section may distribute all 
or part of that payment to any person, provided that any such payment to 
a person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
Sec. 586.201 must be to a blocked account in a U.S. financial 
institution.

    Note to Sec. 586.505: Please refer to Sec. 501.603 of this chapter

violate, conspires to violate, or causes a violation of any license, 
order, regulation, or prohibition issued under the Act.

Act provides for a maximum civil penalty not to exceed the greater of 
$250,000 or an amount that is twice the amount of the transaction that 
is the basis of the violation with respect to which the penalty is 
imposed.

    (2) A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, or 
willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of a 
violation of any license, order, regulation, or prohibition shall, upon 
conviction, be fined not more than $1,000,000, or if a natural person,

    (b) Adjustments to penalty amounts. (1) The civil penalties provided

<R05>
Sec. 586.702  Prepenalty notice.

    (a) When required. If the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control has reasonable cause to believe that there has occurred a 
violation of any provision of this part or a violation of the provisions 
of any license, ruling, regulation, order, direction, or instruction 
issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary 
of the Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and the Director determines 
that further proceedings are warranted, the Director shall notify the 
alleged violator of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty by 
issuing a prepenalty notice. The prepenalty notice shall be in writing. 
The prepenalty notice may be issued whether or not another agency has 
taken any action with respect to the matter.
    (b) Contents of notice--(1) Facts of violation. The prepenalty 
notice shall describe the violation, specify the laws and regulations 
allegedly violated, and state the amount of the proposed monetary 
penalty.
    (2) Right to respond. The prepenalty notice also shall inform the 
respondent of respondent's right to make a written presentation within 
the applicable 30-day period set forth in Sec. 586.703 as to why a 
monetary penalty should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the monetary 
penalty should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (c) Informal settlement prior to issuance of prepenalty notice. At 
any time prior to the issuance of a prepenalty notice, an alleged 
violator may request in writing that, for a period not to exceed sixty 
(60) days, the agency withhold issuance of the prepenalty notice for the 
exclusive purpose of effecting settlement of the agency's potential 
civil monetary penalty claims. In the event the Director grants the 
request, under terms and conditions within his discretion, the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control will agree to withhold issuance of the prepenalty 
notice for a period not to exceed 60 days and will enter into settlement 
negotiations of the potential civil monetary penalty claim.

<R05>
Sec. 586.703  Response to prepenalty notice; informal settlement.

    (a) Deadline for response. The respondent may submit a response to 
the prepenalty notice within the applicable 30-day period set forth in 
this paragraph. The Director may grant, at his discretion, an extension 
of time in which to submit a response to the prepenalty notice. The 
failure to submit a response within the applicable time period set forth 
in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to 
respond.
    (1) Computation of time for response. A response to the prepenalty 
notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or 
foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider 
(if transmitted to OFAC by courier) on or before the 30th day after the 
postmark date on the envelope in which the prepenalty notice was mailed. 
If the respondent refused delivery or otherwise avoided receipt of the 
prepenalty notice, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or 
before the 30th day after the date on the stamped postal receipt 
maintained at the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If the prepenalty 
notice was personally delivered to the respondent by a non-U.S. Postal 
Service agent authorized by the Director, a response must be postmarked 
or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (2) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at 
the Director's discretion, only upon the respondent's specific request 
to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (b) Form and method of response. The response must be submitted in 
writing and may be handwritten or typed. The response need not be in any 
particular form. A copy of the written response may be sent by 
facsimile, but the original must also be sent to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control Civil Penalties Division by mail or courier and must be 
postmarked or date-stamped, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) Contents of response. A written response must contain 
information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the 
prepenalty notice.
    (1) A written response must include the respondent's full name, 
address, telephone number, and facsimile number, if available, or those 
of the representative of the respondent.
    (2) A written response should either admit or deny each specific 
violation alleged in the prepenalty notice and also state if the 
respondent has no knowledge of a particular violation. If the written 
response fails to address any specific violation alleged in the 
prepenalty notice, that alleged violation shall be deemed to be 
admitted.
    (3) A written response should include any information in defense, 
evidence in support of an asserted defense, or other factors that the 
respondent requests the Office of Foreign Assets Control to consider. 
Any defense or explanation previously made to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control or any other agency must be repeated in the written 
response. Any defense not raised in the written response will be 
considered waived. The written response should also set forth the 
reasons why the respondent believes the penalty should not be imposed or 
why, if imposed, it should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (d) Default. If the respondent elects not to submit a written 
response within the time limit set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section, the Office of Foreign Assets Control will conclude that the 
respondent has decided not to respond to the prepenalty notice. The 
agency generally will then issue a written penalty notice imposing the 
penalty proposed in the prepenalty notice.
    (e) Informal settlement. In addition to or as an alternative to a 
written response to a prepenalty notice, the respondent or respondent's 
representative may contact the Office of Foreign Assets Control as 
advised in the prepenalty notice to propose the settlement of 
allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and related matters. 
However, the requirements set forth in paragraph (f) of this section as 
to oral communication by the representative must first be fulfilled. In 
the event of settlement at the prepenalty stage, the claim proposed in 
the prepenalty notice will be withdrawn, the respondent

[[Page 446]]

will not be required to take a written position on allegations contained 
in the prepenalty notice, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control will 
make no final determination as to whether a violation occurred. The 
amount accepted in settlement of allegations in a prepenalty notice may 
vary from the civil penalty that might finally be imposed in the event 
of a formal determination of violation. In the event no settlement is 
reached, the time limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section for 
written response to the prepenalty notice will remain in effect unless 
additional time is granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (f) Representation. A representative of the respondent may act on 
behalf of the respondent, but any oral communication with the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission regarding the 
specific allegations contained in the prepenalty notice must be preceded 
by a written letter of representation, unless the prepenalty notice was 
served upon the respondent in care of the representative.

Sec. 586.704  Penalty imposition or withdrawal.

    (a) No violation. If, after considering any response to the 
prepenalty notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control determines that there was no violation by the 
respondent named in the prepenalty notice, the Director shall notify the 
respondent in writing of that determination and the cancellation of the 
proposed monetary penalty.
    (b) Violation. (1) If, after considering any written response to the 
prepenalty notice, or default in the submission of a written response, 
and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control determines that there was a violation by the respondent named in 
the prepenalty notice, the Director is authorized to issue a written 
penalty notice to the respondent of the determination of violation and 
the imposition of the monetary penalty.
    (2) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent that payment or 
arrangement for installment payment of the assessed penalty must be made 
within 30 days of the date of mailing of the penalty notice by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent of the 
requirement to furnish the respondent's taxpayer identification number 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 7701 and that such number will be used for 
purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent penalty amount.
    (4) The issuance of the penalty notice finding a violation and 
imposing a monetary penalty shall constitute final agency action. The 
respondent has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency 
action in federal district court.

recover the penalty in a civil suit in federal district court.

      Subpart A_Relation of This Part to Other Laws and Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 587.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to 
part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in 
this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing 
foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No 
license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other 
provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by 
this part. No license contained in or issued pursuant to this part 
relieves the involved parties from complying with any other applicable 
laws or regulations.


<R04>
                         Subpart B_Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 587.201  Prohibited transactions involving blocked property.

    (a) Except as authorized by regulations, orders, directives, 
rulings, instructions, licenses or otherwise, and notwithstanding any 
contracts entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the 
effective date, property or interests in property of any person 
designated below that are in the United States, that hereafter come 
within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the 
possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas 
branches, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, 
withdrawn or otherwise dealt in:
    (1) Any person listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13192 of 
January 17, 2001 (66 FR 7379, January 23, 2001); and
    (2) Any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State:
    (i) To be under open indictment by the International Criminal 
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, subject to applicable laws and 
procedures;
    (ii) To have sought, or to be seeking, through repressive measures 
or otherwise, to maintain or reestablish illegitimate control over the 
political processes or institutions or the economic resources or 
enterprises of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Republic of 
Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro or the territory of Kosovo;
    (iii) To have provided material support or resources to any person 
designated in the Annex to Executive Order 13192 or any person otherwise 
designated by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this section; or
    (iv) To be owned or controlled by or acting or purporting to act 
directly or indirectly for or on behalf of any person designated in the 
Annex to Executive Order 13192 or any person otherwise designated by the 
Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this section.

    Note to paragraph (a) of Sec. 587.201: Persons designated pursuant 
to Sec. 587.201(a)(1) or (2) are listed with the acronym [FRYM] in 
appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V. Section 501.807 of this chapter V sets 
forth the procedures to be followed by persons seeking administrative 
reconsideration of their designation or who wish to assert that the 
circumstances resulting in designation no longer apply. Similarly, when 
a transaction results in the blocking of funds at a financial 
institution pursuant to this section and a party to the transaction 
believes the funds to have been blocked due to mistaken identity, that 
party may seek to have such funds unblocked pursuant to the 
administrative procedures set forth in Sec. 501.806 of this chapter.

    (b) Except as authorized by regulations, orders, directives, 
rulings, instructions, licenses or otherwise, and notwithstanding any 
contracts entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the 
effective date, any transaction or dealing by U.S. persons, wherever 
located, or within the United States in property or interests in 
property of any person designated in or pursuant to Sec. 587.201(a) are 
prohibited.

[[Page 449]]

    (c) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any security 
(or evidence thereof) held within the possession or control of a U.S. 
person and either registered or inscribed in the name of or known to be 
held for the benefit of any person designated in or pursuant to Sec. 
587.201(a) is prohibited. This prohibition includes but is not limited 
to the transfer (including the transfer on the books of any issuer or 
agent thereof), disposition, transportation, importation, exportation, 
or withdrawal of any such security or the endorsement or guaranty of 
signatures on any such security. This prohibition applies irrespective 
of the fact that at any time (whether prior to, on, or subsequent to the 
effective date) the registered or inscribed owner of any such security 
may have or might appear to have assigned, transferred, or otherwise 
disposed of the security.


<R05>
Sec. 587.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that 
involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec. 
587.201(a), is null and void and shall not be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or 
privilege with respect to such property or property interests.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in property 
blocked pursuant to Sec. 587.201(a), unless the person with whom such 
property is held or maintained, prior to that date, had written notice 
of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, or 
after a transfer shall validate such transfer or make it enforceable to 
the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the 
provisions of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, this 
part, and any regulation, order, directive, ruling, instruction, or 
license issued pursuant to this part.
    (d) Transfers of property that otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property was held or maintained (and as to such person only) in 
cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property was held 
or maintained;
    (2) The person with whom such property was held or maintained did 
not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts 
and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer 
required a license or authorization issued pursuant to this part and was 
not so licensed or authorized, or, if a license or authorization did 
purport to cover the transfer, that such license or authorization had 
been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding of 
material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property was held or maintained filed 
with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth in full 
the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon discovery 
that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or 
any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other direction or 
authorization issued pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director of 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.


[[Page 450]]


    Note to paragraph (d) of Sec. 587.202: The filing of a report in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall 
not be deemed evidence that the terms of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of 
this section have been satisfied.

    (e) Unless licensed pursuant to this part, any attachment, judgment, 
decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial process is null 
and void with respect to any property in which on or since the effective 
date of Sec. 587.201 there existed an interest of a person designated 
in or pursuant to Sec. 587.201(a).


<R05>
Sec. 587.203  Holding of funds in interest-bearing accounts;

person holding funds, such as currency, bank deposits, or liquidated 
financial obligations subject to Sec. 587.201(a) shall hold or place 
such funds in a blocked interest-bearing account located in the United 
States.
    (b)(1) For purposes of this section, the term blocked interest-
bearing account means a blocked account:
    (i) In a federally-insured U.S. bank, thrift institution, or credit 
union, provided the funds are earning interest at rates that are 
commercially reasonable; or

Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provided 
the funds are invested in a money market fund or in U.S. Treasury bills.

if it is the rate currently offered to other depositors on deposits or 
instruments of comparable size and maturity.
    (3) Funds held or placed in a blocked account pursuant to this 
paragraph (b) may not be invested in instruments the maturity of which 
exceeds 180 days. If interest is credited to a separate blocked account 
or subaccount, the name of the account party on each account must be the 
same.
    (c) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 
180 days at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 587.201(a) may 
continue to be held until maturity in the original instrument, provided 
any interest, earnings, or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid 
into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph (b) 
or (d) of this section.
    (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the United 
States at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 587.201(a) may 
continue to be held in the same type of accounts or instruments, 
provided the funds earn interest at rates that are commercially 
reasonable.
    (e) This section does not create an affirmative obligation for the 
holder of blocked tangible property, such as chattels or real estate, or 
of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to sell or 
liquidate such property at the time the property becomes subject to 
Sec. 587.201(a). However, the Office of Foreign Assets Control may 
issue licenses permitting or directing such sales in appropriate cases.
    (f) Funds subject to this section may not be held, invested, or 
reinvested in a manner that provides immediate financial or economic 
benefit or access to any person designated in or pursuant to Sec. 
587.201(a), nor may their holder cooperate in or facilitate the pledging 
or other attempted use as collateral of blocked funds or other assets.


<R05>
Sec. 587.204  Evasions; attempts; conspiracies.

or after the effective date that evades or avoids, has the purpose of

    (b) No regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizes any 
transaction prohibited under this part unless the regulation, ruling, 
instruction or license is issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
and specifically refers to this part. No regulation, ruling,

authorize any transaction prohibited by any provision of this chapter 
unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license specifically 
refers to such provision.
    (c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizing any 
transaction otherwise prohibited under this part has the effect of 
removing a prohibition contained in this part from the transaction, but 
only to the extent specifically stated by its terms. Unless the

    The Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control reserves the

upon all persons receiving actual or constructive notice of the 
exclusions or restrictions.

United States to an account held outside the United States, and further 
provided that a transfer from a blocked account may only be made to

United States for this purpose;
    (b) The proceeds of such investments and reinvestments shall not be

<R05>
Sec. 587.701  Penalties.

    (a) Attention is directed to section 206 of the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (the ``Act'') (50 U.S.C. 1705), which is 
applicable to violations of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the

[[Page 457]]

Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under the 
Act.
    (1) A civil penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in Section 
206 of the Act may be imposed on any person who violates, attempts to 
violate, conspires to violate, or causes a violation of any license, 
order, regulation, or prohibition issued under the Act.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 587.701: As of June 10, 2008, the 
Act provides for a maximum civil penalty not to exceed the greater of 
$250,000 or an amount that is twice the amount of the transaction that 
is the basis of the violation with respect to which the penalty is 
imposed.

    (2) A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, or 
willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of a 
violation of any license, order, regulation, or prohibition shall, upon 
conviction, be fined not more than $1,000,000, or if a natural person, 
may be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.
    (b) Adjustments to penalty amounts. (1) The civil penalties provided 
in the Act are subject to adjustment pursuant to the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410, as amended, 
28 U.S.C. 2461 note).
    (2) The criminal penalties provided in the Act are subject to 
adjustment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571.
    (c) Attention is directed to section 5 of the United Nations 
Participation Act (22 U.S.C. 287c(b)), which provides that any person 
who willfully violates or evades or attempts to violate or evade any 
order, rule, or regulation issued by the President pursuant to the 
authority granted in that section, upon conviction, shall be fined not 
more than $10,000 and, if a natural person, may also be imprisoned for 
not more than 10 years; and the officer, director, or agent of any 
corporation who knowingly participates in such violation or evasion 
shall be punished by a like fine, imprisonment, or both, and any 
property, funds, securities, papers, or other articles or documents, or 
any vessel, together with her tackles, apparel, furniture, and 
equipment, or vehicle, or aircraft, concerned in such violation shall be 
forfeited to the United States. The criminal penalties provided in the 
United Nations Participation Act are subject to increase pursuant to 18 
U.S.C. 3571.
    (d) Attention is also directed to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides 
that whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, 
legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States,

fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or makes or uses 
any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially 
false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry shall be fined under 
title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not more than five years, or

<R05>
Sec. 587.702  Prepenalty notice.

    (a) When required. If the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control has reasonable cause to believe that there has occurred a 
violation of any provision of this part or a violation of the provisions 
of any license, ruling, regulation, order, direction, or instruction 
issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary 
of the Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and the Director determines 
that further proceedings are warranted, the Director shall notify the 
alleged violator of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty by 
issuing a prepenalty notice. The prepenalty notice shall be in writing. 
The prepenalty notice may be issued whether or not another agency has 
taken any action with respect to the matter.
    (b) Contents of notice--(1) Facts of violation. The prepenalty 
notice shall describe the violation, specify the laws and regulations 
allegedly violated, and state the amount of the proposed monetary 
penalty.
    (2) Right to respond. The prepenalty notice also shall inform the 
respondent of respondent's right to make a written presentation within 
the applicable 30 day period set forth in Sec. 587.703 as to

[[Page 458]]

why a monetary penalty should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the 
monetary penalty should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (c) Informal settlement prior to issuance of prepenalty notice. At 
any time prior to the issuance of a prepenalty notice, an alleged 
violator may request in writing that, for a period not to exceed sixty 
(60) days, the agency withhold issuance of the prepenalty notice for the 
exclusive purpose of effecting settlement of the agency's potential 
civil monetary penalty claims. In the event the Director grants the 
request, under terms and conditions within his discretion, the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control will agree to withhold issuance of the prepenalty 
notice for a period not to exceed 60 days and will enter into settlement 
negotiations of the potential civil monetary penalty claim.


<R05>
Sec. 587.703  Response to prepenalty notice; informal settlement.

    (a) Deadline for response. The respondent may submit a response to 
the prepenalty notice within the applicable 30 day period set forth in 
this paragraph. The Director may grant, at his discretion, an extension 
of time in which to submit a response to the prepenalty notice. The 
failure to submit a response within the applicable time period set forth 
in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to 
respond.
    (1) Computation of time for response. A response to the prepenalty 
notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or 
foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider 
(if transmitted to OFAC by courier) on or before the 30th day after the 
postmark date on the envelope in which the prepenalty notice was mailed. 
If the respondent refused delivery or otherwise avoided receipt of the 
prepenalty notice, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or 
before the 30th day after the date on the stamped postal receipt 
maintained at the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If the prepenalty 
notice was personally delivered to the respondent by a non-U.S. Postal 
Service agent authorized by the Director, a response must be postmarked 
or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (2) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at 
the Director's discretion, only upon the respondent's specific request 
to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (b) Form and method of response. The response must be submitted in 
writing and may be handwritten or typed. The response need not be in any 
particular form. A copy of the written response may be sent by 
facsimile, but the original also must be sent to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control Civil Penalties Division by mail or courier and must be 
postmarked or date-stamped, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) Contents of response. A written response must contain 
information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the 
prepenalty notice.
    (1) A written response must include the respondent's full name, 
address, telephone number, and facsimile number, if available, or those 
of the representative of the respondent.
    (2) A written response should either admit or deny each specific 
violation alleged in the prepenalty notice and also state if the 
respondent has no knowledge of a particular violation. If the written 
response fails to address any specific violation alleged in the 
prepenalty notice, that alleged violation shall be deemed to be 
admitted.
    (3) A written response should include any information in defense, 
evidence in support of an asserted defense, or other factors that the 
respondent requests the Office of Foreign Assets Control to consider. 
Any defense or explanation previously made to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control or any other agency must be repeated in the written 
response. Any defense not raised in the written response will be 
considered waived. The written response also should set forth the 
reasons why the respondent believes the penalty should not be imposed or 
why, if imposed, it should be in a lesser amount than proposed.

[[Page 459]]

    (d) Default. If the respondent elects not to submit a written 
response within the time limit set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section, the Office of Foreign Assets Control will conclude that the 
respondent has decided not to respond to the prepenalty notice. The 
agency generally will then issue a written penalty notice imposing the 
penalty proposed in the prepenalty notice.
    (e) Informal settlement. In addition to or as an alternative to a 
written response to a prepenalty notice, the respondent or respondent's 
representative may contact the Office of Foreign Assets Control as 
advised in the prepenalty notice to propose the settlement of 
allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and related matters. 
However, the requirements set forth in paragraph (f) of this section as 
to oral communication by the representative must first be fulfilled. In 
the event of settlement at the prepenalty stage, the claim proposed in 
the prepenalty notice will be withdrawn, the respondent will not be 
required to take a written position on allegations contained in the 
prepenalty notice, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control will make no 
final determination as to whether a violation occurred. The amount 
accepted in settlement of allegations in a prepenalty notice may vary 
from the civil penalty that might finally be imposed in the event of a 
formal determination of violation. In the event no settlement is 
reached, the time limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section for 
written response to the prepenalty notice will remain in effect unless 
additional time is granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (f) Representation. A representative of the respondent may act on 
behalf of the respondent, but any oral communication with the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission regarding the 
specific allegations contained in the prepenalty notice must be preceded 
by a written letter of representation, unless the prepenalty notice was 
served upon the respondent in care of the representative.


<R05>
Sec. 587.704  Penalty imposition or withdrawal.

    (a) No violation. If, after considering any response to the 
prepenalty notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control determines that there was no violation by the 
respondent named in the prepenalty notice, the Director shall notify the 
respondent in writing of that determination and of the cancellation of 
the proposed monetary penalty.
    (b) Violation. (1) If, after considering any written response to the 
prepenalty notice, or default in the submission of a written response, 
and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control determines that there was a violation by the respondent named in 
the prepenalty notice, the Director is authorized to issue a written 
penalty notice to the respondent of the determination of violation and 
the imposition of the monetary penalty.
    (2) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent that payment or 
arrangement for installment payment of the assessed penalty must be made 
within 30 days of the date of mailing of the penalty notice by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent of the 
requirement to furnish the respondent's taxpayer identification number 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 7701 and that such number will be used for 
purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent penalty amount.
    (4) The issuance of the penalty notice finding a violation and 
imposing a monetary penalty shall constitute final agency action. The 
respondent has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency 
action in federal district court.


<R05>
Sec. 587.705  Administrative collection; referral to United States Department of Justice.

    In the event that the respondent does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control within 30 days of the 
date of mailing of the penalty notice, the matter may be referred for 
administrative collection measures by the Department of the Treasury or 
to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate action to 
recover the penalty in a civil suit in a federal district court.

      Subpart A_Relation of This Part to Other Laws and Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 588.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to 
part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in 
this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing 
foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No 
license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other 
provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by 
this part. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant 
to this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations.


<R04>
                         Subpart B_Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 588.201  Prohibited transactions involving blocked property.

    (a) Except as authorized by regulations, orders, directives, 
rulings, instructions, licenses or otherwise, and notwithstanding any 
contracts entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the 
effective date, property or interests in property of the following 
persons that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the 
United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or 
control of U.S. persons, including their overseas branches, are blocked 
and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn or otherwise dealt 
in:
    (1) Any person listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13219 of June 
26, 2001 (3 CFR, 2001 Comp., p. 778); and
    (2) Any person designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, because they are found:
    (i) To have committed, or to pose a significant risk of committing, 
acts of violence that have the purpose or effect of threatening the 
peace in or diminishing the stability or security of any area or state 
in the Western Balkans region, undermining the authority, efforts, or 
objectives of international organizations or entities present in the 
region, or endangering the safety of persons participating in or 
providing support to the activities of those international organizations 
or entities; or
    (ii) To have actively obstructed, or to pose a significant risk of 
actively obstructing, implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia or 
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999, in 
Kosovo; or
    (iii) Materially to assist in, sponsor, or provide financial support 
for, or goods or services in support of, such acts of violence and 
obstructionism; or

[[Page 462]]

    (iv) To be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act 
directly or indirectly for or on behalf of, any person designated in the 
Annex to Executive Order 13219 or any person otherwise designated by the 
Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this section.

    Note to paragraph (a) of Sec. 588.201: The names of persons whose 
property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section will be published on OFAC's website, announced in the 
Federal Register and incorporated on an ongoing basis with the 
identifier [BALKANS] into appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V. Section 
501.807 of this chapter V sets forth the procedures to be followed by 
persons seeking administrative reconsideration of their designation 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section or who wish to assert that 
the circumstances resulting in designation no longer apply. Similarly, 
when a transaction results in the blocking of funds at a financial 
institution pursuant to this section and a party to the transaction 
believes the funds to have been blocked due to mistaken identity, that 
party may seek to have such funds unblocked pursuant to the 
administrative procedures set forth in Sec. 501.806 of this chapter.

    (b) The blocking of property and interests in property pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section includes, but is not limited to, the 
prohibition of the making or receiving by a United States person of any 
contribution or provision of funds, goods or services to or for the 
benefit of a person whose property or interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any security 
(or evidence thereof) held within the possession or control of a U.S. 
person and either registered or inscribed in the name of or known to be 
held for the benefit of any person whose property or interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is 
prohibited. This prohibition includes but is not limited to the transfer 
(including the transfer on the books of any issuer or agent thereof), 
disposition, transportation, importation, exportation, or withdrawal of 
any such security or the endorsement or guaranty of signatures on any 
such security. This prohibition applies irrespective of the fact that at 
any time (whether prior to, on, or subsequent to the effective date) the 
registered or inscribed owner of any such security may have or might 
appear to have assigned, transferred, or otherwise disposed of the 
security.


<R05>
Sec. 588.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that 
involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec. 
588.201(a), is null and void and shall not be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or 
privilege with respect to such property or property interests.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in property 
blocked pursuant to Sec. 588.201(a), unless the person with whom such 
property is held or maintained, prior to that date, had written notice 
of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, or 
after a transfer shall validate such transfer or make it enforceable to 
the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the 
provisions of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.), this part, and any regulation, order, directive, ruling, 
instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part.
    (d) Transfers of property that otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property was held or maintained (and as to such person only) in 
cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:

[[Page 463]]

    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property was held 
or maintained;
    (2) The person with whom such property was held or maintained did 
not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts 
and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer 
required a license or authorization issued pursuant to this part and was 
not so licensed or authorized, or, if a license or authorization did 
purport to cover the transfer, that such license or authorization had 
been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding of 
material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property was held or maintained filed 
with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth in full 
the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon discovery 
that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or 
any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other direction or 
authorization issued pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director of 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

    Note to paragraph (d) of Sec. 588.202: The filing of a report in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall 
not be deemed evidence that the terms of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of 
this section have been satisfied.

    (e) Unless licensed pursuant to this part, any attachment, judgment, 
decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial process is null 
and void with respect to any property in which on or since the effective 
date there existed an interest of a person whose property or interests 
in property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 588.201(a).


<R05>
Sec. 588.203  Holding of funds in interest-bearing accounts; investment and reinvestment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, or 
as otherwise directed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any U.S. 
person holding funds, such as currency, bank deposits, or liquidated 
financial obligations subject to Sec. 588.201(a) shall hold or place 
such funds in a blocked interest-bearing account located in the United 
States.
    (b)(1) For purposes of this section, the term blocked interest-
bearing account means a blocked account:
    (i) In a federally-insured U.S. bank, thrift institution, or credit 
union, provided the funds are earning interest at rates that are 
commercially reasonable; or
    (ii) With a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 
78a et seq.), provided the funds are invested in a money market fund or 
in U.S. Treasury bills.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a rate is commercially reasonable 
if it is the rate currently offered to other depositors on deposits or 
instruments of comparable size and maturity.
    (3) Funds held or placed in a blocked account pursuant to this 
paragraph (b) may not be invested in instruments the maturity of which 
exceeds 180 days. If interest is credited to a separate blocked account 
or subaccount, the name of the account party on each account must be the 
same.
    (c) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 
180 days at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 588.201(a) may 
continue to be held until maturity in the original instrument, provided 
any interest, earnings, or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid 
into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph (b) 
or (d) of this section.
    (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the United 
States at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 588.201(a) may 
continue to be held in the same type of accounts or instruments, 
provided the funds earn interest at rates that are commercially 
reasonable.

[[Page 464]]

    (e) This section does not create an affirmative obligation for the 
holder of blocked tangible property, such as chattels or real estate, or 
of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to sell or 
liquidate such property at the time the property becomes subject to 
Sec. 588.201(a). However, the Office of Foreign Assets Control may 
issue licenses permitting or directing such sales in appropriate cases.
    (f) Funds subject to this section may not be held, invested, or 
reinvested in a manner that provides immediate financial or economic 
benefit or access to any person whose property or interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to Sec. 588.201(a), nor may their holder cooperate 
in or facilitate the pledging or other attempted use as collateral of 
blocked funds or other assets.

all expenses incident to the maintenance of physical property blocked 
pursuant to Sec. 588.201(a) shall be the responsibility of the owners 
or operators of such property, which expenses shall not be met from

account in the name of the owner of the property.


<R05>

or leasing of such capacity or facilities to a person whose property or 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 588.201(a) are 
prohibited.
    (c) Travel. The prohibitions contained in this part do not apply to 
transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country,

authorize any transaction prohibited by any provision of this chapter 
unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license specifically 
refers to such provision.

Sec. 588.503  Exclusion from licenses.

    The Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control reserves the

within the United States to an account held outside the United States, 
and further provided that a transfer from a blocked account may only be

name at the same U.S. financial institution, or within the possession or 
control of a U.S. person, but funds shall not be transferred outside the 
United States for this purpose;
    (b) The proceeds of such investments and reinvestments shall not be 
credited to a blocked account or subaccount under any name or 
designation that differs from the name or designation of the specific 
blocked account or subaccount in which such funds or securities were

    (b) The provision of any other legal services to persons whose 
property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 
588.201(a), not otherwise authorized in this part, requires the issuance 
of a specific license.
    (c) Entry into a settlement agreement affecting property or 
interests in property or the enforcement of any lien, judgment, arbitral 
award, decree, or other order through execution, garnishment, or other

                           Subpart G_Penalties


<R05>
Sec. 588.701  Penalties.

    (a) Attention is directed to section 206 of the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (the ``Act'') (50 U.S.C. 1705), which is 
applicable to violations of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant 
to this part or otherwise under the Act.
    (1) A civil penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in Section 
206 of the Act may be imposed on any person who violates, attempts to 
violate, conspires to violate, or causes a violation of any license, 
order, regulation, or prohibition issued under the Act.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 588.701: As of June 10, 2008, the 
Act provides for a maximum civil penalty not to exceed the greater of 
$250,000 or an amount that is twice the amount of the transaction that 
is the basis of the violation with respect to which the penalty is 
imposed.

    (2) A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, or 
willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of a 
violation of any license, order, regulation, or prohibition shall, upon 
conviction, be fined not more than $1,000,000, or if a natural person, 
may be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.
    (b) Adjustments to penalty amounts. (1) The civil penalties provided 
in the Act are subject to adjustment pursuant to the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410, as amended, 
28 U.S.C. 2461 note).
    (2) The criminal penalties provided in the Act are subject to 
adjustment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571.
    (c) Attention is also directed to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides 
that whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, 
legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, 
knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any

[[Page 471]]

trick, scheme, or device, a material fact, or makes any materially 
false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or makes 
or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any 
materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry shall be 
fined under title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not more than 
five years, or both.
    (d) Violations of this part may also be subject to relevant 
provisions of other applicable laws.

FR 32655, June 10, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 588.702  Prepenalty notice.

    (a) When required. If the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control has reasonable cause to believe that there has occurred a 
violation of any provision of this part or a violation of the provisions 
of any license, ruling, regulation, order, direction, or instruction 
issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary 
of the Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and the Director determines 
that further proceedings are warranted, the Director shall notify the 
alleged violator of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty by 
issuing a prepenalty notice. The prepenalty notice shall be in writing. 
The prepenalty notice may be issued whether or not another agency has 
taken any action with respect to the matter.
    (b) Contents of notice--(1) Facts of violation. The prepenalty 
notice shall describe the violation, specify the laws and regulations 
allegedly violated, and state the amount of the proposed monetary 
penalty.
    (2) Right to respond. The prepenalty notice also shall inform the 
respondent of the respondent's right to make a written presentation 
within the applicable 30 day period set forth in Sec. 588.703 as to why 
a monetary penalty should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the 
monetary penalty should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (c) Informal settlement prior to issuance of prepenalty notice. At 
any time prior to the issuance of a prepenalty notice, an alleged 
violator may request in writing that, for a period not to exceed sixty 
(60) days, the agency withhold issuance of the prepenalty notice for the 
exclusive purpose of effecting settlement of the agency's potential 
civil monetary penalty claims. In the event the Director grants the 
request, under terms and conditions within his discretion, the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control will agree to withhold issuance of the prepenalty 
notice for a period not to exceed 60 days and will enter into settlement 
negotiations of the potential civil monetary penalty claim.


<R05>
Sec. 588.703  Response to prepenalty notice; informal settlement.

    (a) Deadline for response. The respondent may submit a response to 
the prepenalty notice within the applicable 30-day period set forth in 
this paragraph. The Director may grant, at his discretion, an extension 
of time in which to submit a response to the prepenalty notice. The 
failure to submit a response within the applicable time period set forth 
in this paragraph (a) shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to 
respond.
    (1) Computation of time for response. A response to the prepenalty 
notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or 
foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider 
(if transmitted to OFAC by courier) on or before the 30th day after the 
postmark date on the envelope in which the prepenalty notice was mailed. 
If the respondent refused delivery or otherwise avoided receipt of the 
prepenalty notice, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or 
before the 30th day after the date on the stamped postal receipt 
maintained at the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If the prepenalty 
notice was personally delivered to the respondent by a non-U.S. Postal 
Service agent authorized by the Director, a response must be postmarked 
or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (2) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at 
the Director's discretion, only

[[Page 472]]

upon the respondent's specific request to the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control.
    (b) Form and method of response. The response must be submitted in 
writing and may be handwritten or typed. The response need not be in any 
particular form. A copy of the written response may be sent by 
facsimile, but the original also must be sent to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control Civil Penalties Division by mail or courier and must be 
postmarked or date-stamped, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) Contents of response. A written response must contain 
information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the 
prepenalty notice.
    (1) A written response must include the respondent's full name, 
address, telephone number, and facsimile number, if available, or those 
of the representative of the respondent.
    (2) A written response should either admit or deny each specific 
violation alleged in the prepenalty notice and also state if the 
respondent has no knowledge of a particular violation. If the written 
response fails to address any specific violation alleged in the 
prepenalty notice, that alleged violation shall be deemed to be 
admitted.
    (3) A written response should include any information in defense, 
evidence in support of an asserted defense, or other factors that the 
respondent requests the Office of Foreign Assets Control to consider. 
Any defense or explanation previously made to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control or any other agency must be repeated in the written 
response. Any defense not raised in the written response will be 
considered waived. The written response also should set forth the 
reasons why the respondent believes the penalty should not be imposed or 
why, if imposed, it should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (d) Default. If the respondent elects not to submit a written 
response within the time limit set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section, the Office of Foreign Assets Control will conclude that the 
respondent has decided not to respond to the prepenalty notice. The 
agency generally will then issue a written penalty notice imposing the 
penalty proposed in the prepenalty notice.
    (e) Informal settlement. In addition to or as an alternative to a 
written response to a prepenalty notice, the respondent or respondent's 
representative may contact the Office of Foreign Assets Control as 
advised in the prepenalty notice to propose the settlement of 
allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and related matters. 
However, the requirements set forth in paragraph (f) of this section as 
to oral communication by the representative must first be fulfilled. In 
the event of settlement at the prepenalty stage, the claim proposed in 
the prepenalty notice will be withdrawn, the respondent will not be 
required to take a written position on allegations contained in the 
prepenalty notice, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control will make no 
final determination as to whether a violation occurred. The amount 
accepted in settlement of allegations in a prepenalty notice may vary 
from the civil penalty that might finally be imposed in the event of a 
formal determination of violation. In the event no settlement is 
reached, the time limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section for 
written response to the prepenalty notice will remain in effect unless 
additional time is granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (f) Representation. A representative of the respondent may act on 
behalf of the respondent, but any oral communication with the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission regarding the 
specific allegations contained in the prepenalty notice must be preceded 
by a written letter of representation, unless the prepenalty notice was 
served upon the respondent in care of the representative.


<R05>
Sec. 588.704  Penalty imposition or withdrawal.

    (a) No violation. If, after considering any response to the 
prepenalty notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control determines that there was no violation by the 
respondent named in the prepenalty notice, the Director shall notify the 
respondent in writing of that determination and of the cancellation of 
the proposed monetary penalty.
    (b) Violation. (1) If, after considering any written response to the 
prepenalty

[[Page 473]]

notice, or default in the submission of a written response, and any 
relevant facts, the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
determines that there was a violation by the respondent named in the 
prepenalty notice, the Director is authorized to issue a written penalty 
notice to the respondent of the determination of the violation and the 
imposition of the monetary penalty.
    (2) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent that payment or 
arrangement for installment payment of the assessed penalty must be made 
within 30 days of the date of mailing of the penalty notice by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent of the 
requirement to furnish the respondent's taxpayer identification number 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 7701 and that such number will be used for 
purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent penalty amount.
    (4) The issuance of the penalty notice finding a violation and 
imposing a monetary penalty shall constitute final agency action. The 
respondent has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency 
action in federal district court.


<R05>
Sec. 588.705  Administrative collection; referral to United States Department of Justice.

    In the event that the respondent does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control within 30 days of the 
date of mailing of the penalty notice, the matter may be referred for 
administrative collection measures by the Department of the Treasury or 
to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate action to 
recover the penalty in a civil suit in a federal district court.

Sec. 592.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and procedures of which apply 
to this part. Actions taken pursuant to part 501 of this chapter with 
respect to the prohibitions contained in this part are considered 
actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing foreign policy and 
national security circumstances may result in differing interpretations 
of similar language among the parts of this chapter. No license or 
authorization contained in or issued pursuant to those other parts 
authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No license or 
authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other provision of 
law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part.


<R04>
                         Subpart B_Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 592.201  Prohibited importation and exportation of any rough diamond; permitted importation or exportation of any rough diamond.

    (a) Except to the extent provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
and notwithstanding the existence of any rights or obligations conferred 
or imposed by any contract entered into or any license or permit granted 
prior to the effective date, the importation into, or exportation from, 
the United States on or after July 30, 2003, of any rough diamond, from 
whatever source, is prohibited, unless the rough diamond has been 
controlled through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.
    (b) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section regarding the 
importation into, or exportation from, the United States of any rough 
diamond not controlled through the Kimberley Process Certification 
Scheme do not apply to an importation from, or exportation to, any 
country with respect to which the Secretary of State has granted a 
waiver pursuant to section 4(b) of the Clean Diamond Trade Act (Pub. L. 
108-19) and section 2(a)(i) of Executive Order 13312.

    Note to Sec. 592.201. An importation of any rough diamond from, or 
an exportation of any rough diamond to, a non-Participant is not 
controlled through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme and thus 
is not permitted, except in the following circumstance. The Secretary of 
State may, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Clean Diamond Trade Act, 
waive the prohibitions contained in section 4(a) of that Act with 
respect to a particular country for periods of not more than one year 
each. The Secretary of State

[[Page 475]]

will publish a notice in the Federal Register identifying any country 
with respect to which a waiver applies and specifying the relevant time 
period during which the waiver will apply.


<R05>
Sec. 592.202  Evasions; attempts; conspiracies.

    (a) Notwithstanding the existence of any rights or obligations 
conferred or imposed by any contract entered into or any license or 
permit granted prior to July 30, 2003, any transaction by a United 
States person anywhere, or any transaction that occurs in whole or in 
part within the United States, on or after the effective date that 
evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts 
to violate, any of the prohibitions set forth in this part is 
prohibited.
    (b) Notwithstanding the existence of any rights or obligations 
conferred or imposed by any contract entered into or any license or 
permit granted prior to July 30, 2003, any conspiracy formed to violate 
any of the prohibitions of this part is prohibited.


<R04>
                      Subpart C_General Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 592.301  Controlled through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the term controlled through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme 
refers to the following requirements that apply, as appropriate, to the 
importation into the United States from a Participant, or to the 
exportation from the United States to a Participant, of any shipment 
including any rough diamond:
    (1) Kimberley Process Certificate. A shipment of rough diamonds 
imported into, or exported from, the United States must be accompanied 
by an original Kimberley Process Certificate. The certificate must be 
presented in connection with an importation or exportation of rough 
diamonds if demanded by United States customs officials. Pursuant to 31 
CFR Sec. Sec. 501.601 and 501.602, the person identified as the 
ultimate consignee (see Customs Directive 3550-079A) on the Customs Form 
7501 Entry Summary or its electronic equivalent filed with U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection in connection with an importation of rough 
diamonds must retain the original Kimberley Process Certificate for a 
period of at least five years from the date of importation and must make 
such certificate available for examination upon demand.
    (2) Tamper-resistant container. A shipment of rough diamonds 
imported into, or exported, from the United States must be sealed in a 
tamper-resistant container;
    (3) Notification requirements for importations into the United 
States. The person identified as the ultimate consignee (see Customs 
Directive 3550-079A) on the Customs Form 7501 Entry Summary or its 
electronic equivalent filed with U.S. Customs and Border Protection in 
connection with an importation of rough diamonds must report that 
person's receipt of a shipment of rough diamonds to the relevant foreign 
exporting authority within 15 calendar days of the date that the 
shipment arrived at the U.S. port of entry. The report must refer to the 
relevant Kimberley Process Certificate by its unique identifying number; 
specify the number of parcels in the shipment; specify the total carat 
weight of the shipment; and identify the importer and exporter of the 
shipment. The report need not be in any particular form and may be 
submitted electronically or by mail or courier; and
    (4) Validation of Kimberley Process Certificate for exportations 
from the United States. With respect to the exportation of rough 
diamonds from the United States and regardless of the destination, the 
U.S. Census Bureau requires the filing of export information through the 
Automated Export System. Submission of export information through the 
Automated Export System must be done in advance and must be confirmed by 
the return of an Internal Transaction Number. The return to the filer of 
the Internal Transaction Number shall constitute the validation of the 
Kimberley Process Certificate for an exportation of rough diamonds from 
the United States to a Participant. The exporter is required to report 
the Internal Transaction Number on the Kimberley Process Certificate 
accompanying any exportation from the

[[Page 476]]

United States. The Internal Transaction Number is a unique confirmation 
number generated by the Automated Export System to the filer who 
provides in a timely manner the complete commodity shipment data when 
such data have been accepted by the system.
    (b) The Secretary of State, consistent with section 3(2)(B) of the 
Clean Diamond Trade Act (Pub. L. 108-19), may modify the requirements 
set forth in paragraph (a) of this section upon making a determination 
that a Participant has established an alternative system of control for 
rough diamonds that meets substantially the standards, practices, and 
procedures of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.

    Note 1 to Sec. 592.301. The Secretary of State will periodically 
publish in the Federal Register an up-to-date listing of all 
Participants and their importing and exporting authorities. Where 
appropriate, such listing also will describe any modification of the 
requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
    Note 2 to Sec. 592.301. Pursuant to 31 CFR Sec. Sec. 501.601 and 
501.602, the recordkeeping and reporting requirements imposed by Sec. 
592.501 apply to all U.S. persons engaged in the importation into, or 
exportation from, the United States of any shipment of rough diamonds.
    Note 3 to Sec. 592.301. Effective November 1, 2004, customs 
brokers, importers, and filers making entry of a shipment of rough 
diamonds must either submit through U.S. Customs' Automated Broker 
Interface (ABI) system the unique identifying number of the Kimberley 
Process Certificate accompanying the shipment or, for non-ABI entries, 
indicate the certificate number on the Customs Form 7501 Entry Summary 
at each entry line.
    Note 4 to Sec. 592.301. As of May 21, 2008, any diamond, regardless 
of value, that is described in subheadings 7102.10, 7102.21 or 7102.31, 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States and is imported into the 
United States shall not be released from the custody of U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection (CBP) except by a formal entry for consumption, as 
defined in Sec. 141.0a(f) of the CBP regulations. See 19 CFR 141.0a(f).

                           Subpart F_Penalties


<R05>
Sec. 592.601  Penalties.

    (a) Attention is directed to section 8 of the Clean Diamond Trade 
Act (the ``Act'') (Pub. L. 108-19), which provides that:
    (1) A civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 per violation may be 
imposed on any person who violates, or attempts

[[Page 479]]

to violate, any order or regulation issued under the Act;
    (2) Whoever willfully violates, or willfully attempts to violate, 
any order or regulation issued under this Act shall, upon conviction, be 
fined not more than $50,000, or, if a natural person, may be imprisoned 
for not more than 10 years, or both; and any officer, director, or agent 
of any corporation who willfully participates in such violation may be 
punished by a like fine, imprisonment, or both; and
    (3) Those customs laws of the United States, both civil and 
criminal, including those laws relating to seizure and forfeiture, that 
apply to articles imported in violation of such laws shall apply with 
respect to any rough diamond imported in violation of the Act.

    Note to paragraph (a). As reflected in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of 
this section, section 8(a) of the Clean Diamond Trade Act (Pub. L. 108-
19) establishes penalties with respect to any violation of any 
regulation issued under the Act. OFAC prepenalty, penalty, and 
administrative collection procedures relating to such violations are set 
forth below in Sec. Sec. 592.602 through 592.605. Section 8(c) of the 
Act also authorizes the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and 
the U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as appropriate, 
to enforce the penalty provisions set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section and to enforce the laws and regulations governing exports of 
rough diamonds, including with respect to the validation of the 
Kimberley Process Certificate by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. The 
Office of Foreign Assets Control civil penalty procedures set forth 
below are separate from, and independent of, any penalty procedures that 
may be followed by the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and 
the U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in their exercise 
of the authorities set forth in section 8(c) of the Clean Diamond Trade 
Act.

    (b) The criminal penalties provided in the Act are subject to 
increase pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571.
    (c) Attention is also directed to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides 
that whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, 
legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, 
knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, 
scheme, or device, a material fact, or makes any materially false, 
fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation or makes or uses 
any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially 
false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry shall be fined under 
title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not more than five years, or 
both.
    (d) Violations of this part may also be subject to relevant 
provisions of other applicable laws.


<R05>
Sec. 592.602  Prepenalty notice.

    (a) When required. If the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control has reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of any 
provision of this part or a violation of the provisions of any 
regulation or order issued by or pursuant to the direction or 
authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this part or 
otherwise under the Clean Diamond Trade Act, and the Director determines 
that further civil proceedings are warranted, the Director shall notify 
the alleged violator of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty 
by issuing a prepenalty notice. The prepenalty notice shall be in 
writing. The prepenalty notice may be issued whether or not another 
agency has taken any action with respect to the matter.
    (b) Contents of notice--(1) Facts of violation. The prepenalty 
notice shall describe the violation, specify the laws and regulations 
allegedly violated, and state the amount of the proposed monetary 
penalty.
    (2) Right to respond. The prepenalty notice also shall inform the 
respondent of the respondent's right to make a written presentation 
within the applicable 30-day period set forth in Sec. 592.603 as to why 
a monetary penalty should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the 
monetary penalty should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (c) Informal settlement prior to issuance of prepenalty notice. At 
any time prior to the issuance of a prepenalty notice, an alleged 
violator may request in writing that, for a period not to exceed sixty 
(60) days, the agency withhold issuance of the prepenalty notice for the 
exclusive purpose of effecting settlement of the agency's potential 
civil monetary penalty claims. In the event the Director grants the 
request, under

[[Page 480]]

terms and conditions within his discretion, the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control will agree to withhold issuance of the prepenalty notice for a 
period not to exceed 60 days and will enter into settlement negotiations 
of the potential civil monetary penalty claim.


<R05>
Sec. 592.603  Response to prepenalty notice; informal settlement.

    (a) Deadline for response. The respondent may submit a response to 
the prepenalty notice within the applicable 30-day period set forth in 
this paragraph. The Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control may 
grant, at his discretion, an extension of time in which to submit a 
response to the prepenalty notice. The failure to submit a response 
within the applicable time period set forth in this paragraph shall be 
deemed to be a waiver of the right to respond.
    (1) Computation of time for response. A response to the prepenalty 
notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or 
foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider 
(if transmitted to the Office of Foreign Assets Control by courier) on 
or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the envelope in which 
the prepenalty notice was mailed. If the respondent refused delivery or 
otherwise avoided receipt of the prepenalty notice, a response must be 
postmarked or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date on 
the stamped postal receipt maintained at the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control. If the prepenalty notice was personally delivered to the 
respondent by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent authorized by the 
Director, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or before the 
30th day after the date of delivery.
    (2) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at 
the Director's discretion, only upon the respondent's specific request 
to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (b) Form and method of response. The response must be submitted in 
writing and may be handwritten or typed. The response need not be in any 
particular form. A copy of the written response may be sent by 
facsimile, but the original also must be sent to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control Civil Penalties Division by mail or courier and must be 
postmarked or date-stamped, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) Contents of response. A written response must contain 
information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the 
prepenalty notice and must include the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
identification number listed on the prepenalty notice.
    (1) A written response must include the respondent's full name, 
address, telephone number, and facsimile number, if available, or those 
of the representative of the respondent.
    (2) A written response should either admit or deny each specific 
violation alleged in the prepenalty notice and also state if the 
respondent has no knowledge of a particular violation. If the written 
response fails to address any specific violation alleged in the 
prepenalty notice, that alleged violation shall be deemed to be 
admitted.
    (3) A written response should include any information in defense, 
evidence in support of an asserted defense, or other factors that the 
respondent requests the Office of Foreign Assets Control to consider. 
Any defense or explanation previously made to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control or any other agency must be repeated in the written 
response. Any defense not raised in the written response will be 
considered waived. The written response also should set forth the 
reasons why the respondent believes the penalty should not be imposed or 
why, if imposed, it should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (d) Failure to respond. Where the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
receives no response to a prepenalty notice within the applicable time 
period set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, a penalty notice 
generally will be issued, taking into account the mitigating and/or 
aggravating factors present in the record. If there are no mitigating 
factors present in the record, or the record contains a preponderance of 
aggravating factors, the proposed

[[Page 481]]

prepenalty amount generally will be assessed as the final penalty.
    (e) Informal settlement. In addition to or as an alternative to a 
written response to a prepenalty notice, the respondent or respondent's 
representative may contact the Office of Foreign Assets Control as 
advised in the prepenalty notice to propose the settlement of 
allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and related matters. 
However, the requirements set forth in paragraph (f) of this section as 
to oral communication by the representative must first be fulfilled. In 
the event of settlement at the prepenalty stage, the claim proposed in 
the prepenalty notice will be withdrawn, the respondent will not be 
required to take a written position on allegations contained in the 
prepenalty notice, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control will make no 
final determination as to whether a violation occurred. The amount 
accepted in settlement of allegations in a prepenalty notice may vary 
from the civil penalty that might finally be imposed in the event of a 
formal determination of violation. In the event no settlement is 
reached, the time limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section for 
written response to the prepenalty notice will remain in effect unless 
additional time is granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (f) Representation. A representative of the respondent may act on 
behalf of the respondent, but any oral communication with the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission regarding the 
specific allegations contained in the prepenalty notice must be preceded 
by a written letter of representation, unless the prepenalty notice was 
served upon the respondent in care of the representative.


<R05>
Sec. 592.604  Penalty imposition or withdrawal.

    (a) No violation. If, after considering any response to the 
prepenalty notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control determines that there was no violation by the 
respondent named in the prepenalty notice, the Director shall notify the

      Subpart A_Relation of This Part to Other Laws and Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 593.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to 
part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in 
this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing 
foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
any other provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction 
prohibited by this part. No license contained in or issued pursuant to 
this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations.


<R04>
                         Subpart B_Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 593.201  Prohibited transactions involving blocked property.

    (a) Except as authorized by regulations, orders, directives, 
rulings, instructions, licenses or otherwise, and notwithstanding any 
contracts entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the 
effective date, property and interests in property that are in the 
United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are 
or hereafter come within the possession or control of U.S. persons, 
including their overseas branches, of the following persons are blocked 
and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise 
dealt in:
    (1) Any person listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13348 of July 
22, 2004 (69 FR 44885, July 27, 2004); and
    (2) Any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State:
    (i) To be or have been an immediate family member of Charles Taylor;
    (ii) To have been a senior official of the former Liberian regime 
headed by Charles Taylor or otherwise to have been or be a close ally or 
associate of Charles Taylor or the former Liberian regime;
    (iii) To have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support 
of, the unlawful depletion of Liberian resources, the removal of 
Liberian resources from that country, and the secreting of Liberian

property are blocked pursuant to this paragraph (a); or
    (iv) To be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act

property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section are published on the Office of Foreign Assets Control's 
Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked

[[Page 484]]

Persons List (the ``SDN List''), which is accessible via the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control's Web site, announced in the Federal Register, 
and incorporated on an ongoing basis with the identifier [LIBERIA] into 
Appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V. In addition, section 203 of the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) 
(``IEEPA'') explicitly authorizes the blocking of property and interests 
in property of a person or entity during the pendency of an 
investigation. The names of such persons also are published on the SDN 
List, announced in the Federal Register, and incorporated on an ongoing 
basis with the identifier [BPI-LIBERIA] into Appendix A to 31 CFR 
chapter V. Sections 501.806 and 501.807 of this chapter V describe the 
procedures to be followed by persons seeking, respectively, the 
unblocking of funds that they believe were blocked due to mistaken 
identity, or administrative reconsideration of their listing or 
designation pursuant to Sec. 593.201(a).

    (b) The blocking of property and interests in property pursuant to 
Sec. 593.201(a) includes, but is not limited to, the prohibition of the 
making or receiving by a United States person of any contribution or 
provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of a 
person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
Sec. 593.201(a).
    (c) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any security 
(or evidence thereof) held within the possession or control of a U.S. 
person and either registered or inscribed in the name of, or known to be 
held for the benefit of, or issued by, any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 593.201(a) is 
prohibited. This prohibition includes but is not limited to the transfer 
(including the transfer on the books of any issuer or agent thereof), 
disposition, transportation, importation, exportation, or withdrawal of, 
or the endorsement or guaranty of signatures on, any such security on or 
after the effective date. This prohibition applies irrespective of the 
fact that at any time (whether prior to, on, or subsequent to the 
effective date) the registered or inscribed owner of any such security 
may have or might appear to have assigned, transferred, or otherwise 
disposed of the security.


<R05>
Sec. 593.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that 
involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec. 
593.201(a), is null and void and shall not be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or 
privilege with respect to such property or property interests.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in property 
blocked pursuant to Sec. 593.201(a), unless the person with whom such 
property is held or maintained, prior to that date, had written notice 
of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, or 
after a transfer shall validate such transfer or make it enforceable to 
the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the 
provisions of IEEPA, Executive Order 13348, this part, and any 
regulation, order, directive, ruling, instruction, or license issued 
pursuant to this part.
    (d) Transfers of property that otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property is or was held or maintained (and as to such person only) 
in cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction 
of the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property is or was 
held or maintained;
    (2) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
did not have reasonable cause to know or

[[Page 485]]

suspect, in view of all the facts and circumstances known or available 
to such person, that such transfer required a license or authorization 
issued pursuant to this part and was not so licensed or authorized, or, 
if a license or authorization did purport to cover the transfer, that 
such license or authorization had been obtained by misrepresentation of 
a third party or withholding of material facts or was otherwise 
fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
filed with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth 
in full the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon 
discovery that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or 
any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other direction or 
authorization issued pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director of 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

    Note to paragraph (d) of Sec. 593.202: The filing of a report in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall 
not be deemed evidence that the terms of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of 
this section have been satisfied.

    (e) Except to the extent otherwise provided by law, unless licensed 
pursuant to this part, any attachment, judgment, decree, lien, 
execution, garnishment, or other judicial process is null and void with 
respect to any property in which, on or since the effective date, there 
existed an interest of a person whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to Sec. 593.201(a).


<R05>
Sec. 593.203  Holding of blocked funds in interest-bearing accounts; investment and reinvestment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, or 
as otherwise directed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any U.S.

financial obligations, subject to Sec. 593.201(a) shall hold or place 
such funds in a blocked interest-bearing account located in the United 
States.
    (b)(1) For purposes of this section, the term blocked interest-
bearing account means a blocked account:
    (i) In a federally-insured U.S. bank, thrift institution, or credit 
union, provided the funds are earning interest at rates that are 
commercially reasonable; or
    (ii) With a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 
78a et seq.), provided the funds are invested in a money market fund or 
in U.S. Treasury bills.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a rate is commercially reasonable 
if it is the rate currently offered to other depositors on deposits or 
instruments of comparable size and maturity.
    (3) Funds held or placed in a blocked account pursuant to this 
paragraph (b) may not be invested in instruments the maturity of which 
exceeds 180 days. If interest is credited to a separate blocked account 
or subaccount, the name of the account party on each account must be the 
same.
    (c) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 
180 days at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 593.201(a) may 
continue to be held until maturity in the original instrument, provided 
any interest, earnings, or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid 
into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph (b) 
or (d) of this section.
    (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the United 
States at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 593.201(a) may 
continue to be held in the same type of accounts or instruments, 
provided the funds earn interest at rates that are commercially 
reasonable.
    (e) This section does not create an affirmative obligation for the 
holder of blocked tangible property, such as chattels or real estate, or 
of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to sell or 
liquidate such property at the time the property becomes subject to 
Sec. 593.201(a). However, the Office of Foreign Assets Control

[[Page 486]]

may issue licenses permitting or directing such sales in appropriate 
cases.
    (f) Funds subject to this section may not be held, invested, or 
reinvested in a manner that provides immediate financial or economic 
benefit or access to any person whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to Sec. 593.201(a), nor may their holder cooperate 
in or facilitate the pledging or other attempted use as collateral of 
blocked funds or other assets.


<R05>
Sec. 593.204  Expenses of maintaining blocked physical property; liquidation of blocked account.

    (a) Except as otherwise authorized, and notwithstanding the

<R05>
Sec. 593.702  Prepenalty notice.

    (a) When required. If the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control has reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of any 
provision of this part or a violation of the provisions of any license, 
ruling, regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or 
pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the 
Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under IEEPA, and the 
Director determines that further proceedings are warranted, the Director 
shall notify the alleged violator of the agency's intent to impose a 
monetary penalty by issuing a prepenalty notice. The prepenalty notice 
shall be in writing. The prepenalty notice may be issued whether or not 
another agency has taken any action with respect to the matter.
    (b) Contents of notice--(1) Facts of violation. The prepenalty 
notice shall describe the violation, specify the laws and regulations 
allegedly violated, and state the amount of the proposed monetary 
penalty.
    (2) Right to respond. The prepenalty notice also shall inform the 
respondent of the respondent's right to make a written presentation 
within the applicable 30-day period set forth in Sec. 593.703 as to why 
a monetary penalty should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the 
monetary penalty should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (c) Informal settlement prior to issuance of prepenalty notice. At 
any time prior to the issuance of a prepenalty notice, an alleged 
violator may request in writing that, for a period not to exceed 60 
days, the agency withhold issuance of the prepenalty notice for the 
exclusive purpose of effecting settlement of the agency's potential 
civil monetary penalty claims. In the event the Director grants the 
request, under terms and conditions within the Director's discretion, 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control will agree to withhold issuance of 
the prepenalty notice for a period not to exceed 60 days and will enter 
into settlement negotiations of the potential civil monetary penalty 
claim.


<R05>
Sec. 593.703  Response to prepenalty notice; informal settlement.

    (a) Deadline for response. The respondent may submit a response to 
the prepenalty notice within the applicable 30-day period set forth in 
this paragraph. The Director may grant, at the Director's discretion, an 
extension of time in which to submit a response to the prepenalty 
notice. The failure to submit a response within the applicable time 
period set forth in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of the 
right to respond.
    (1) Computation of time for response. A response to the prepenalty 
notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or 
foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider 
(if transmitted to the Office of Foreign Assets Control by courier) on 
or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the envelope in which 
the prepenalty notice was mailed. If the prepenalty notice was

[[Page 494]]

personally delivered to the respondent by a non-U.S. Postal Service 
agent authorized by the Director, a response must be postmarked or date-
stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (2) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
Federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at 
the Director's discretion, only upon the respondent's specific request 
to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (b) Form and method of response. The response need not be in any 
particular form, but it must be typewritten and signed by the respondent 
or a representative thereof. A copy of the written response may be sent 
by facsimile, but the original also must be sent to the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control Civil Penalties Division by mail or courier and 
must be postmarked or date-stamped, in accordance with paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (c) Contents of response. A written response must contain 
information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the 
prepenalty notice and must identify the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
identification number listed on the prepenalty notice.
    (1) A written response must include the respondent's full name, 
address, telephone number, and facsimile number, if available, or those 
of the representative of the respondent.
    (2) A written response should either admit or deny each specific 
violation alleged in the prepenalty notice and also state if the 
respondent has no knowledge of a particular violation. If the written 
response fails to address any specific violation alleged in the 
prepenalty notice, that alleged violation shall be deemed to be 
admitted.
    (3) A written response should include any information in defense, 
evidence in support of an asserted defense, or other factors that the 
respondent requests the Office of Foreign Assets Control to consider. 
Any defense or explanation previously made to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control or any other agency must be repeated in the written 
response. Any defense not raised in the written response will be 
considered waived. The written response also should set forth the 
reasons why the respondent believes the penalty should not be imposed or 
why, if imposed, it should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (d) Failure to respond. If the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
receives no response to a prepenalty notice within the applicable time 
period set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, a penalty notice 
generally will be issued, taking into account the mitigating and/or 
aggravating factors present in the record. If there are no mitigating 
factors present in the record, or the record contains a preponderance of 
aggravating factors, the proposed prepenalty amount generally will be 
assessed as the final penalty.
    (e) Informal settlement. In addition to or as an alternative to a 
written response to a prepenalty notice, the respondent or respondent's 
representative may contact the Office of Foreign Assets Control's Civil 
Penalties Division as advised in the prepenalty notice to propose the 
settlement of allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and related 
matters. However, the requirements set forth in paragraph (g) of this 
section as to oral communication by the representative must first be 
fulfilled. In the event of settlement at the prepenalty stage, the claim 
proposed in the prepenalty notice will be withdrawn, the respondent will 
not be required to take a written position on allegations contained in 
the prepenalty notice, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control will 
make no final determination as to whether a violation occurred. The 
amount accepted in settlement of allegations in a prepenalty notice may 
vary from the civil penalty that might finally be imposed in the event 
of a formal determination of violation. In the event no settlement is 
reached, the time limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section for 
written response to the prepenalty notice will remain in effect unless 
additional time is granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (f) Guidelines. Guidelines for the imposition or settlement of civil 
penalties by the Office of Foreign Assets Control are available on 
OFAC's Web site (http://www.treas.gov/ofac).

[[Page 495]]

    (g) Representation. A representative of the respondent may act on 
behalf of the respondent, but any oral communication with the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission regarding the 
specific allegations contained in the prepenalty notice must be preceded 
by a written letter of representation, unless the prepenalty notice was 
served upon the respondent in care of the representative.


<R05>
Sec. 593.704  Penalty imposition or withdrawal.

    (a) No violation. If, after considering any response to the 
prepenalty notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of

respondent named in the prepenalty notice, the Director shall notify the 
respondent in writing of that determination and of the cancellation of 
the proposed monetary penalty.
    (b) Violation. (1) If, after considering any written response to the 
prepenalty notice, or default in the submission of a written response, 
and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control determines that there was a violation by the respondent named in 
the prepenalty notice, the Director is authorized to issue a written 
penalty notice to the respondent of the determination of the violation 
and the imposition of the monetary penalty.
    (2) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent that payment or 
arrangement for installment payment of the assessed penalty must be made 
within 30 days of the date of mailing of the penalty notice by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent of the 
requirement to furnish the respondent's taxpayer identification number 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 7701 and that such number will be used for 
purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent penalty amount.
    (4) The issuance of the penalty notice finding a violation and 
imposing a monetary penalty shall constitute final agency action. The 
respondent has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency 
action in Federal district court.

      Subpart A_Relation of This Part to Other Laws and Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 594.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to 
part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in 
this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing 
foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No 
license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other 
provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by 
this part. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant 
to this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations.


<R04>
                         Subpart B_Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 594.201  Prohibited transactions involving blocked property.

    (a) Except as authorized by statutes, regulations, orders, 
directives, rulings, instructions, licenses or otherwise, and 
notwithstanding any contracts entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the effective date, property and interests in property 
of the following persons that are in the United States, that hereafter 
come within the United States, or that hereafter come within the 
possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas 
branches, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, 
withdrawn or otherwise dealt in:
    (1) Foreign persons listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13224 of 
September 23, 2001, as may be amended;
    (2) Foreign persons determined by the Secretary of State, in 
consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security and the Attorney General, to have committed, or to 
pose a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism that threaten 
the security of U.S. nationals or the national security, foreign policy, 
or economy of the United States;
    (3) Persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland 
Security and the Attorney General, to be owned or controlled by, or to 
act for or on behalf of, any person whose property or interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), or 
(a)(4)(i) of this section; or
    (4) Except as provided in section 5 of Executive Order 13224, any 
person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with 
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the 
Attorney General:
    (i) To assist in, sponsor, or provide financial, material, or 
technological support for, or financial or other services to or in 
support of:
    (A) Acts of terrorism that threaten the security of U.S. nationals 
or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United 
States, or
    (B) Any person whose property or interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section; or
    (ii) To be otherwise associated with any person whose property or 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), 
(a)(3), or (a)(4)(i) of this section.

    Note 1 to paragraph (a): Section 5 of Executive Order 13224, as 
amended, provides that, with respect to those persons designated 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in the exercise of his discretion and in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney 
General, may take such other actions than the complete blocking of 
property or interests in property as the President is authorized to take 
under the International

[[Page 498]]

Emergency Economic Powers Act and the United Nations Participation Act 
if the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of 
State, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, 
deems such other actions to be consistent with the national interests of 
the United States, considering such factors as he deems appropriate.
    Note 2 to paragraph (a): The names of persons whose property or 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 594.201(a) are 
published on OFAC's website, announced in the Federal Register and 
incorporated on an ongoing basis with the identifier [SDGT] in appendix 
A to 31 CFR chapter V.
    Note 3 to paragraph (a): Section 501.807 of this chapter V sets 
forth the procedures to be followed by persons seeking administrative 
reconsideration of their designation pursuant to Sec. 594.201(a) or who 
wish to assert that the circumstances resulting in designation no longer 
apply. Similarly, when a transaction results in the blocking of funds at 
a financial institution pursuant to this section and a party to the 
transaction believes the funds to have been blocked due to mistaken 
identity, that party may seek to have such funds unblocked pursuant to 
the administrative procedures set forth in Sec. 501.806 of this 
chapter.

    (b) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any security 
(or evidence thereof) held within the possession or control of a U.S. 
person and either registered or inscribed in the name of or known to be 
held for the benefit of any person whose property or interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 594.201(a) is prohibited. This 
prohibition includes but is not limited to the transfer (including the 
transfer on the books of any issuer or agent thereof), disposition, 
transportation, importation, exportation, or withdrawal of any such 
security or the endorsement or guaranty of signatures on any such 
security. This prohibition applies irrespective of the fact that at any 
time (whether prior to, on, or subsequent to the effective date) the 
registered or inscribed owner of any such security may have or might 
appear to have assigned, transferred, or otherwise disposed of the 
security.

    Note 1 to Sec. 594.201: Section 106 of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 
(Pub. L. 107-56, Oct. 26, 2001) amended section 203 of the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1702) to authorize explicitly 
the blocking of property and interests in property of a person or entity 
during the pendency of an investigation. The name of any person or 
entity whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
this authority appears on the Office of Foreign Assets Control's (OFAC) 
blocked persons list with the descriptor ``[BPI-PA].'' The scope of the 
property or interests in property blocked during the pendency of an 
investigation may be more limited than the scope of the blocking set 
forth in Sec. 594.201(a). Inquiries regarding the scope of any such 
blocking should be directed to OFAC's Compliance Division at 202/622-
2490.
    Note 2 to Sec. 594.201. The prohibitions set forth in this part are 
separate from and in addition to other parts of 31 CFR chapter V, 
including but not limited to the Terrorism Sanctions Regulations (part 
595), the Terrorism List Government Sanctions Regulations (part 596), 
and the Foreign Terrorist Organizations Sanctions Regulations (part 
597). The prohibitions set forth in this part also are separate and 
apart from the criminal prohibition, set forth at 18 U.S.C. 2339B, 
against providing material support or resources to foreign terrorist 
organizations designated pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act, as amended.

[68 FR 34197, June 6, 2003, as amended at 72 FR 4206, Jan. 30, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 594.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that 
involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec. 
594.201(a), is null and void and shall not be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or 
privilege with respect to such property or property interests.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in property 
blocked pursuant to Sec. 594.201(a), unless the person with whom such 
property is held or maintained, prior to that date, had written notice 
of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer.

[[Page 499]]

    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, or 
after a transfer shall validate such transfer or make it enforceable to 
the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the 
provisions of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, this 
part, and any regulation, order, directive, ruling, instruction, or 
license issued pursuant to this part.
    (d) Transfers of property that otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property was held or maintained (and as to such person only) in 
cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property was held 
or maintained;
    (2) The person with whom such property was held or maintained did 
not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts 
and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer 
required a license or authorization issued pursuant to this part and was 
not so licensed or authorized, or, if a license or authorization did 
purport to cover the transfer, that such license or authorization had 
been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding of 
material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property was held or maintained filed 
with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth in full 
the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon discovery 
that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or 
any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other direction or 
authorization issued pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director of 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

    Note to paragraph (d). The filing of a report in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall not be deemed 
evidence that the terms of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section 
have been satisfied.

    (e) Except to the extent otherwise provided by law or unless 
licensed pursuant to this part, any attachment, judgment, decree, lien, 
execution, garnishment, or other judicial process is null and void with 
respect to any property in which on or since the effective date there 
existed an interest of a person whose property or interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to Sec. 594.201(a).


<R05>
Sec. 594.203  Holding of funds in interest-bearing accounts; investment and reinvestment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, or 
as otherwise directed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any U.S. 
person holding funds, such as currency, bank deposits, or liquidated 
financial obligations, subject to Sec. 594.201(a) shall hold or place 
such funds in a blocked interest-bearing account located in the United 
States.
    (b)(1) For purposes of this section, the term blocked interest-
bearing account means a blocked account:
    (i) In a federally-insured U.S. bank, thrift institution, or credit 
union, provided the funds are earning interest at rates that are 
commercially reasonable; or
    (ii) With a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provided 
the funds are invested in a money market fund or in U.S. Treasury bills.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a rate is commercially reasonable 
if it is the rate currently offered to other depositors on deposits or 
instruments of comparable size and maturity.
    (3) Funds held or placed in a blocked account pursuant to this 
paragraph (b) may not be invested in instruments the

[[Page 500]]

maturity of which exceeds 180 days. If interest is credited to a 
separate blocked account or subaccount, the name of the account party on 
each account must be the same.
    (c) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 
180 days at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 594.201(a) may 
continue to be held until maturity in the original instrument, provided 
any interest, earnings, or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid 
into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph (b) 
or (d) of this section.
    (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the United 
States at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 594.201(a) may 
continue to be held in the same type of accounts or instruments, 
provided the funds earn interest at rates that are commercially 
reasonable.
    (e) This section does not create an affirmative obligation for the 
holder of blocked tangible property, such as chattels or real estate, or 
of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to sell or 
liquidate such property at the time the property becomes subject to 
Sec. 594.201(a). However, the Office of Foreign Assets Control may 
issue licenses permitting or directing such sales or liquidation in 
appropriate cases.
    (f) Funds subject to this section may not be held, invested, or 
reinvested in a manner that provides immediate financial or economic 
benefit or access to any person whose property or interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to Sec. 594.201(a), nor may their holder cooperate 
in or facilitate the pledging or other attempted use as collateral of 
blocked funds or other assets.

entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective 
date, any conspiracy formed for the purpose of engaging in a transaction 
prohibited by this part is prohibited.


<R05>

existence of any rights or obligations conferred or imposed by any 
international agreement or contract entered into or any license or 
permit granted before the effective date, all expenses incident to the 
maintenance of physical property blocked pursuant to Sec. 594.201(a) 
shall be the responsibility of the owners or operators of such property, 
which expenses shall not be met from blocked funds.
    (b) Property blocked pursuant to Sec. 594.201(a) may, in the 
discretion of the Director, Office of Foreign Assets Control, be sold or 
liquidated and the net proceeds placed in a blocked interest-bearing 
account in the name of the owner of the property.

<R04>
                           Subpart G_Penalties


<R05>
Sec. 594.701  Penalties.

    (a) Attention is directed to section 206 of the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (the ``Act'') (50 U.S.C. 1705), which is 
applicable to violations of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant 
to this part or otherwise under the Act.
    (1) A civil penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in Section 
206 of the Act may be imposed on any person who violates, attempts to 
violate, conspires to violate, or causes a violation of any

[[Page 509]]

license, order, regulation, or prohibition issued under the Act.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 594.701: As of June 10, 2008, the 
Act provides for a maximum civil penalty not to exceed the greater of 
$250,000 or an amount that is twice the amount of the transaction that 
is the basis of the violation with respect to which the penalty is 
imposed.

    (2) A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, or 
willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of a 
violation of any license, order, regulation, or prohibition shall, upon 
conviction, be fined not more than $1,000,000, or if a natural person, 
may be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.
    (b) Adjustments to penalty amounts. (1) The civil penalties provided 
in the Act are subject to adjustment pursuant to the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410, as amended, 
28 U.S.C. 2461 note).
    (2) The criminal penalties provided in the Act are subject to 
adjustment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571.
    (c) Attention is directed to section 5 of the United Nations 
Participation Act (22 U.S.C. 287c(b)), which provides that any person 
who willfully violates or evades or attempts to violate or evade any 
order, rule, or regulation issued by the President pursuant to the 
authority granted in that section, upon conviction, shall be fined not 
more than $10,000 and, if a natural person, may also be imprisoned for 
not more than 10 years; and the officer, director, or agent of any 
corporation who knowingly participates in such violation or evasion 
shall be punished by a like fine, imprisonment, or both and any 
property, funds, securities, papers, or other articles or documents, or 
any vessel, together with her tackle, apparel, furniture, and equipment, 
or vehicle, or aircraft, concerned in such violation shall be forfeited 
to the United States. The criminal penalties provided in the United 
Nations Participation Act are subject to increase pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
3571.
    (d) Attention is also directed to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides 
that whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, 
legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, 
knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, 
scheme, or device, a material fact, or makes any materially false, 
fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation or makes or uses 
any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially 
false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry shall be fined under 
title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not more than five years, or 
both.
    (e) Violations of this part may also be subject to relevant 
provisions of other applicable laws.

<R05>
Sec. 594.702  Prepenalty notice.

    (a) When required. If the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control has reasonable cause to believe that there has occurred a 
violation of any provision of this part or a violation of the provisions 
of any license, ruling, regulation, order, direction, or instruction 
issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary 
of the Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and the Director determines 
that further proceedings are warranted, the Director shall notify the 
alleged violator of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty by 
issuing a prepenalty notice. The prepenalty notice shall be in writing. 
The prepenalty notice may be issued whether or not another agency has 
taken any action with respect to the matter.
    (b) Contents of notice--(1) Facts of violation. The prepenalty 
notice shall describe the violation, specify the laws and regulations 
allegedly violated, and state the amount of the proposed monetary 
penalty.
    (2) Right to respond. The prepenalty notice also shall inform the 
respondent of the respondent's right to make a written presentation 
within the applicable 30-day period set forth in Sec. 594.703 as to why 
a monetary penalty should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the 
monetary penalty should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (c) Informal settlement prior to issuance of prepenalty notice. At 
any time prior to the issuance of a prepenalty notice,

[[Page 510]]

an alleged violator may request in writing that, for a period not to 
exceed sixty (60) days, the agency withhold issuance of the prepenalty 
notice for the exclusive purpose of effecting settlement of the agency's 
potential civil monetary penalty claims. In the event the Director 
grants the request, under terms and conditions within his discretion, 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control will agree to withhold issuance of 
the prepenalty notice for a period not to exceed 60 days and will enter 
into settlement negotiations of the potential civil monetary penalty 
claim.


<R05>
Sec. 594.703  Response to prepenalty notice; informal settlement.

    (a) Deadline for response. The respondent may submit a response to 
the prepenalty notice within the applicable 30-day period set forth in 
this paragraph. The Director may grant, at his discretion, an extension 
of time in which to submit a response to the prepenalty notice. The 
failure to submit a response within the applicable time period set forth 
in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to 
respond.
    (1) Computation of time for response. A response to the prepenalty 
notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or 
foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider 
(if transmitted to OFAC by courier) on or before the 30th day after the 
postmark date on the envelope in which the prepenalty notice was mailed. 
If the respondent refused delivery or otherwise avoided receipt of the 
prepenalty notice, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or 
before the 30th day after the date on the stamped postal receipt 
maintained at the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If the prepenalty 
notice was personally delivered to the respondent by a non-U.S. Postal 
Service agent authorized by the Director, a response must be postmarked 
or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (2) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at 
the Director's discretion, only upon the respondent's specific request 
to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (b) Form and method of response. The response must be submitted in 
writing and may be handwritten or typed. The response need not be in any 
particular form. A copy of the written response may be sent by 
facsimile, but the original also must be sent to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control Civil Penalties Division by mail or courier and must be 
postmarked or date-stamped, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) Contents of response. A written response must contain 
information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the 
prepenalty notice.
    (1) A written response must include the respondent's full name, 
address, telephone number, and facsimile number, if available, or those 
of the representative of the respondent.
    (2) A written response should either admit or deny each specific 
violation alleged in the prepenalty notice and also state if the 
respondent has no knowledge of a particular violation. If the written 
response fails to address any specific violation alleged in the 
prepenalty notice, that alleged violation shall be deemed to be 
admitted.
    (3) A written response should include any information in defense, 
evidence in support of an asserted defense, or other factors that the 
respondent requests the Office of Foreign Assets Control to consider. 
Any defense or explanation previously made to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control or any other agency must be repeated in the written 
response. Any defense not raised in the written response will be 
considered waived. The written response also should set forth the 
reasons why the respondent believes the penalty should not be imposed or 
why, if imposed, it should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (d) Default. If the respondent elects not to submit a written 
response within the time limit set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section, the Office of Foreign Assets Control will conclude that the 
respondent has decided not to respond to the prepenalty notice. The 
agency generally will then issue a written penalty notice imposing the 
penalty proposed in the prepenalty notice.

[[Page 511]]

    (e) Informal settlement. In addition to or as an alternative to a 
written response to a prepenalty notice, the respondent or respondent's 
representative may contact the Office of Foreign Assets Control as 
advised in the prepenalty notice to propose the settlement of 
allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and related matters. 
However, the requirements set forth in paragraph (f) of this section as 
to oral communication by the representative must first be fulfilled. In 
the event of settlement at the prepenalty stage, the claim proposed in 
the prepenalty notice will be withdrawn, the respondent will not be 
required to take a written position on allegations contained in the 
prepenalty notice, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control will make no 
final determination as to whether a violation occurred. The amount 
accepted in settlement of allegations in a prepenalty notice may vary 
from the civil penalty that might finally be imposed in the event of a 
formal determination of violation. In the event no settlement is 
reached, the time limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section for 
written response to the prepenalty notice will remain in effect unless 
additional time is granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (f) Representation. A representative of the respondent may act on 
behalf of the respondent, but any oral communication with the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission regarding the 
specific allegations contained in the prepenalty notice must be preceded 
by a written letter of representation, unless the prepenalty notice was 
served upon the respondent in care of the representative.


<R05>
Sec. 594.704  Penalty imposition or withdrawal.

    (a) No violation. If, after considering any response to the 
prepenalty notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control determines that there was no violation by the 
respondent named in the prepenalty notice, the Director shall notify the 
respondent in writing of that determination and of the cancellation of 
the proposed monetary penalty.
    (b) Violation. (1) If, after considering any written response to the 
prepenalty notice, or default in the submission of a written response, 
and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control determines that there was a violation by the respondent named in 
the prepenalty notice, the Director is authorized to issue a written 
penalty notice to the respondent of the determination of the violation 
and the imposition of the monetary penalty.
    (2) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent that payment or 
arrangement for installment payment of the assessed penalty must be made 
within 30 days of the date of mailing of the penalty notice by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent of the 
requirement to furnish the respondent's taxpayer identification number 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 7701 and that such number will be used for 
purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent penalty amount.
    (4) The issuance of the penalty notice finding a violation and 
imposing a monetary penalty shall constitute final agency action. The 
respondent has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency 
action in a federal district court.


<R05>
Sec. 594.705  Administrative collection; referral to United States Department of Justice.

    In the event that the respondent does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control within 30 days of the 
date of mailing of the penalty notice, the matter may be referred for 
administrative collection measures by the Department of the Treasury or 
to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate action to 
recover the penalty in a civil suit in a federal district court.

Sec. 595.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    (a) This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts 
of this chapter with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Differing foreign policy 
and national security contexts may result in differing interpretations 
of similar language among the parts of this chapter. No license or 
authorization contained in or issued pursuant to those other parts 
authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No license or 
authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other provision of 
law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part.
    (b) No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations.

States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or 
hereafter come within the possession or control of U.S. persons, 
including their overseas branches, may be transferred, paid, exported, 
withdrawn or otherwise dealt in.
    (b) When a transaction results in the blocking of funds at a 
financial institution pursuant to this section and a party to the 
transaction believes the funds have been blocked due to mistaken 
identity, that party may seek to have such funds unblocked pursuant to 
the administrative procedures set forth in Sec. 501.806 of this

Sec. 595.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date, which is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, license, or other authorization hereunder and 
involves any property held in the name of a specially designated 
terrorist or in which a specially designated terrorist has or has had an 
interest since such date, is null and void and shall not be the basis 
for the assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, 
power or privilege with respect to such property.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or interest in, any property held in the name of a specially 
designated terrorist or in which a specially designated terrorist has an 
interest, or has had an interest since such date, unless

[[Page 514]]

the person with whom such property is held or maintained, prior to such 
date, had written notice of the transfer or by any written evidence had 
recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, or 
after a transfer shall validate such transfer or render it enforceable 
to the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the 
provisions of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, this 
part, and any regulation, order, directive, ruling, instruction, or 
license issued hereunder.
    (d) Transfers of property which otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property was held or maintained (and as to such person only) in 
cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property was held 
or maintained;
    (2) The person with whom such property was held or maintained did 
not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts 
and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer 
required a license or authorization by or pursuant to this part and was 
not so licensed or authorized, or if a license or authorization did 
purport to cover the transfer, that such license or authorization had 
been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or the withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property was held or maintained filed 
with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth in full 
the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon discovery 
that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or 
any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other direction or 
authorization hereunder; or
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director of 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or the 
withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

    Note: The filing of a report in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall not be deemed evidence that the 
terms of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section have been satisfied.

    (e) Unless licensed or authorized pursuant to this part, any 
attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other 
judicial process is null and void with respect to any property which, on 
or since the effective date, was held in the name of a specially 
designated terrorist or in which there existed an interest of a 
specially designated terrorist.


<R05>
Sec. 595.203  Holding of certain types of blocked property in interest-bearing accounts.

    (a)(1) Any person, including a U.S. financial institution, currently 
holding property subject to Sec. 595.201 which, as of the effective 
date or the date of receipt if subsequent to the effective date, is not 
being held in an interest-bearing account, or otherwise invested in a 
manner authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, shall 
transfer such property to, or hold such property or cause such property 
to be held in, an interest-bearing account or interest-bearing status in 
a U.S. financial institution as of the effective date or the date of 
receipt if subsequent to the effective date of this section, unless 
otherwise authorized or directed by the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control.
    (2) The requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
shall apply to currency, bank deposits, accounts, obligations, and any 
other financial or economic resources or assets, and any proceeds 
resulting from the sale of tangible or intangible property. If interest 
is credited to an account separate from that in which the interest-
bearing asset is held, the name of the account party on both accounts 
must be the

[[Page 515]]

same and must clearly indicate the specially designated terrorist having 
an interest in the accounts. If the account is held in the name of a 
specially designated terrorist, the name of the account to which 
interest is credited must be the same.
    (b) For purposes of this section, the term interest-bearing account 
means a blocked account in a U.S. financial institution earning interest 
at rates that are commercially reasonable for the amount of funds in the 
account. Except as otherwise authorized, the funds may not be invested 
or held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 90 days.
    (c) This section does not apply to blocked tangible property, such 
as chattels, nor does it create an affirmative obligation on the part of 
the holder of such blocked tangible property to sell or liquidate the 
property and put the proceeds in a blocked account. However, the Office 
of Foreign Assets Control may issue licenses permitting or directing 
sales of tangible property in appropriate cases.


<R05>
Sec. 595.204  Prohibited dealing in property; contributions of funds, goods, or services.

    Except as otherwise authorized, no U.S. person may deal in property 
or interests in property of a specially designated terrorist, including 
the making or receiving of any contribution of funds, goods, or services 
to or for the benefit of a specially designated terrorist.


<R05>

      Subpart A_Relation of This Part to Other Laws and Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 597.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    (a) This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts 
of this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Differing statutory 
authority and foreign policy and national security contexts may result 
in differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No 
license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other 
provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by 
this part.
    (b) No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations. This part does not implement, construe, 
or limit the scope of any other part of this chapter, including (but not 
limited to) the Terrorism Sanctions Regulations, part 595 of this 
chapter, and does not excuse any person from complying with any other 
part of this chapter, including (but not limited to) part 595 of this 
chapter.
    (c) This part does not implement, construe, or limit the scope of 
any criminal statute, including (but not limited to) 18 U.S.C. 
2339B(a)(1) and 2339A, and does not excuse any person from complying 
with any criminal statute, including (but not limited to) 18 U.S.C. 
2339B(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. 2339A.

Sec. 597.201  Prohibited transactions involving blocked assets or funds
of foreign terrorist organizations or their agents.

    (a) Upon notification to Congress of the Secretary of State's intent 
to designate an organization as a foreign terrorist organization 
pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1189(a), until the publication in the Federal 
Register as described in paragraph (c) of this section, any U.S. 
financial institution receiving notice from the Secretary of the 
Treasury by means of order, directive, instruction, regulation, ruling, 
license, or otherwise shall, except as otherwise provided in such 
notice, block all financial transactions involving any assets of such 
organization within the possession or control of such U.S. financial 
institution until further directive from the Secretary of the Treasury, 
Act of Congress, or order of court.
    (b) Except as otherwise authorized by order, directive, instruction, 
regulation, ruling, license, or otherwise, from and after the 
designation of an organization as a foreign terrorist organization 
pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1189(a), any U.S. financial institution that 
becomes aware that it has possession of or control over any funds in 
which the designated foreign terrorist organization or its agent has an 
interest shall:
    (1) Retain possession of or maintain control over such funds; and
    (2) Report to the Secretary of the Treasury the existence of such 
funds in accordance with Sec. 501.603 of this chapter.
    (c) Publication in the Federal Register of the designation of an 
organization as a foreign terrorist organization pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 
1189(a) shall be deemed to constitute a further directive from the 
Secretary of the Treasury for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, 
and shall require the actions contained in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (d) The requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall remain 
in effect until the effective date of an administrative, judicial, or 
legislative revocation of the designation of an organization as a 
foreign terrorist organization,

[[Page 532]]

or until the designation lapses, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1189.
    (e) When a transaction results in the blocking of funds at a 
financial institution pursuant to this section and a party to the 
transaction believes the funds have been blocked due to mistaken 
identity, that party may seek to have such funds unblocked pursuant to 
the administrative procedures set forth in Sec. 501.806 of this 
chapter. Requests for the unblocking of funds pursuant to Sec. 501.806 
must be submitted to the attention of the Compliance Programs Division.


<R05>
Sec. 597.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date which is in violation of 
Sec. 597.201 or any other provision of this part or of any regulation, 
order, directive, ruling, instruction, license, or other authorization 
hereunder and involves any funds or assets held in the name of a foreign 
terrorist organization or its agent or in which a foreign terrorist 
organization or its agent has or has had an interest since such date, is 
null and void and shall not be the basis for the assertion or 
recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power or privilege with 
respect to such funds or assets.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or interest in, any funds or assets held in the name of a 
foreign terrorist organization or its agent or in which a foreign 
terrorist organization or its agent has an interest, or has had an 
interest since such date, unless the financial institution with whom 
such funds or assets are held or maintained, prior to such date, had 
written notice of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized 
such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, or 
after a transfer shall validate such transfer or render it enforceable 
to the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the 
provisions of this part, and any regulation, order, directive, ruling, 
instruction, or license issued hereunder.
    (d) Transfers of funds or assets which otherwise would be null and 
void or unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall 
not be deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any financial 
institution with whom such funds or assets were held or maintained (and 
as to such financial institution only) in cases in which such financial 
institution is able to establish to the satisfaction of the Director of 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the financial institution with whom such 
funds or assets were held or maintained;
    (2) The financial institution with which such funds or assets were 
held or maintained did not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in 
view of all the facts and circumstances known or available to such 
institution, that such transfer required a license or authorization by 
or pursuant to this part and was not so licensed or authorized, or if a 
license or authorization did purport to cover the transfer, that such 
license or authorization had been obtained by misrepresentation of a 
third party or the withholding of material facts or was otherwise 
fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) The financial institution with which such funds or assets were 
held or maintained filed with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a 
report setting forth in full the circumstances relating to such transfer 
promptly upon discovery that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or 
any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other direction or 
authorization hereunder; or
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director of 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or the 
withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

    Note to paragraph (d): The filing of a report in accordance with the 
provisions of

[[Page 533]]

paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall not be deemed evidence that the 
terms of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section have been satisfied.

    (e) Except for exercises of judicial authority pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 
1189(b), unless licensed or authorized pursuant to this part, any 
attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other 
judicial process is null and void with respect to any funds or assets 
which, on or since the effective date, were in the possession or control 
of a U.S. financial institution and were held in the name of a foreign 
terrorist organization or its agent or in which there existed an 
interest of a foreign terrorist organization or its agent.

pursuant to this paragraph may not be invested in instruments the

on each account must be the same and must clearly indicate the foreign 
terrorist organization or agent having an interest in the accounts.
    (c) Blocked funds held as of the effective date in the form of 
stocks, bonds, debentures, letters of credit, or instruments which 
cannot be negotiated for the purpose of placing the funds in a blocked 
interest-bearing account pursuant to paragraph (a) may continue to be

liquidation or maturity, provided that any dividends, interest income, 
or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid into a blocked interest-
bearing account in accordance with the requirements of this section.

Sec. 597.702  Prepenalty notice.

    (a) When required. If the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control has reasonable cause to believe that there has occurred a 
violation of any provision of this part or a violation of the provisions 
of any license, ruling, regulation, order, direction or instruction 
issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary 
of the Treasury pursuant to this part, and the Director, acting in 
coordination with the Attorney General, determines that civil penalty 
proceedings are warranted, the Director shall issue to the person 
concerned a notice of intent to impose a monetary penalty. The 
prepenalty notice shall be issued whether or not another agency has 
taken any action with respect to this matter.
    (b) Contents--(1) Facts of violation. The prepenalty notice shall 
describe the violation, specify the laws and regulations allegedly 
violated, and state the amount of the proposed monetary penalty.
    (2) Right to respond. The prepenalty notice also shall inform the 
respondent of respondent's right to respond within 30 days of mailing of 
the notice as to why a monetary penalty should not be imposed, or, if 
imposed, why it should be in a lesser amount than proposed.


<R05>
Sec. 597.703  Response to prepenalty notice.

    (a) Time within which to respond. The respondent shall have 30 days 
from the

[[Page 542]]

date of mailing of the prepenalty notice to respond in writing to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (b) Form and contents of written response. The written response need 
not be in any particular form, but shall contain information sufficient 
to indicate that it is in response to the prepenalty notice. It should 
respond to the allegations in the prepenalty notice and set forth the 
reasons why the respondent believes the penalty should not be imposed 
or, if imposed, why it should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (c) Informal settlement. In addition or as an alternative to a 
written response to a prepenalty notice pursuant to this section, the 
respondent or respondent's representative may contact the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control as advised in the prepenalty notice to propose 
the settlement of allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and 
related matters. In the event of settlement at the prepenalty stage, the 
prepenalty notice will be withdrawn, the respondent is not required to 
take a written position on allegations contained in the prepenalty 
notice, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control will make no final 
determination as to whether a violation occurred. The amount accepted in 
settlement of allegations in a prepenalty notice may vary from the civil 
penalty that might finally be imposed in the event of a formal 
determination of violation. In the event no settlement is reached, the 
30-day period specified in paragraph (a) of this section for written 
response to the prepenalty notice remains in effect unless additional 
time is granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.

    (a) No violation. If, after considering any written response to the 
prepenalty notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control determines that there was no violation by the 
respondent, the Director promptly shall notify the respondent in writing 
of that determination and that no monetary penalty will be imposed.
    (b) Violation. (1) If, after considering any written response to the 
prepenalty notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control determines that there was a violation by the 
respondent, the Director promptly shall issue a written notice of the 
imposition of the monetary penalty on the respondent. The issuance of a 
written notice of the imposition of a monetary penalty shall constitute 
final agency action.
    (2) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent that payment of 
the assessed penalty must be made within 30 days of the mailing of the 
penalty notice.
    (3) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent of the 
requirement to furnish respondent's taxpayer identification number 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 7701 and that the Department intends to use such 
number for the purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent 
penalty amount in the event of a failure to pay the penalty imposed.


<R05>
Sec. 597.705  Administrative collection; referral to United States
Department of Justice.

mailing of the written notice of the imposition of the penalty, the 
matter may be referred for administrative collection measures by the 
Department of the Treasury or to the United States Department of Justice 
for appropriate action to recover the penalty in a civil suit in a 
Federal district court.

Sec. 598.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    (a) This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts 
of this chapter, including part 536 of this chapter, ``Narcotics 
Trafficking Sanctions Regulations,'' with the exception of part 501 of 
this chapter, the provisions of which apply to this part. Actions taken 
pursuant to part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions 
contained in this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this 
part. Differing foreign policy and national security contexts may result 
in differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No 
license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other 
provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by 
this part.
    (b) No license contained in or issued pursuant to this part relieves 
the involved parties from complying with any other applicable laws or 
regulations.


<R04>
                         Subpart B_Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 598.201  Applicability of sanctions.

    A specially designated narcotics trafficker is subject to any and 
all sanctions authorized by the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation 
Act and implemented in this part. The application of sanctions on any 
specially designated narcotics trafficker will remain in effect until 
revoked by the President pursuant to section 804(h)(2) of the Foreign 
Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, waived by the President pursuant to 
section 804(g)(1) of that Act, or revoked by the Secretary of the 
Treasury pursuant to section 805(e)(1)(A) of that Act.


<R05>
Sec. 598.202  Blocking of assets.

    Except to the extent provided in regulations, orders, instructions, 
licenses, or directives issued pursuant to this part, and 
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the effective date, there are blocked as of the 
effective date, and any date thereafter, all such property and interests 
in property within the United States, or within the possession or 
control of any United States person, which are owned or controlled by a 
specially designated narcotics trafficker.


<R05>
Sec. 598.203  Prohibited transactions involving blocked property.

    (a) Except to the extent provided in regulations, orders, 
instructions, licenses, or directives issued pursuant to this part, and 
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the effective date, any transaction or dealing by a 
United States person, or within the United States, in property or 
interests in property of a specially designated narcotics trafficker is 
prohibited.
    (b) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any security 
(or evidence thereof) held within the possession or control of a U.S. 
person and either registered or inscribed in the name of or known to be 
held for the benefit of any specially designated narcotics trafficker is 
prohibited. This prohibition includes but is not limited to the transfer 
(including the transfer on the books of any issuer or agent thereof), 
disposition, transportation, importation, exportation, or withdrawal of 
any such security or the endorsement or guaranty of signatures on any 
such security.

[[Page 545]]

    (c) When a transaction results in the blocking of funds at a 
financial institution pursuant to this section and a party to the 
transaction believes the funds have been blocked due to mistaken 
identity, that party may seek to have such funds unblocked pursuant to 
the administrative procedures set forth in Sec. 501.806 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 598.204  Evasions; attempts; conspiracies.

    Except to the extent provided in regulations, orders, instructions, 
licenses, or directives issued pursuant to this part, and 
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the effective date, any transaction or dealing by any 
United States person, or within the United States, that evades or 
avoids, or has the effect of evading or avoiding, and any endeavor, 
attempt, or conspiracy to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in 
this part is prohibited.


<R05>
Sec. 598.205  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that 
involves any property or interest in property of a specially designated 
narcotics trafficker is null and void and shall not be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or 
privilege with respect to such property or property interests.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with 
respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in property of 
a specially designated narcotics trafficker, unless the person with whom 
such property is held or maintained, prior to that date, had written 
notice of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such 
transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, or 
after a transfer shall validate such transfer or make it enforceable to 
the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the 
provisions of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, this part, 
and any regulation, order, directive, ruling, instruction, or license 
issued pursuant to this part.
    (d) Property transfers that otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property was held or maintained (and as to such person only) in 
cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction of 
the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property was held 
or maintained;
    (2) The person with whom such property was held or maintained did 
not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts 
and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer 
required a license issued pursuant to this part and was not so licensed, 
or if a license did purport to cover the transfer, that such license had 
been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding of 
material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property was held or maintained filed 
with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth in full 
the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon discovery 
that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or 
any regulation, ruling, instruction, direction, or license issued 
pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director of 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

    Note to paragraph (d) of Sec. 598.205: The filing of a report in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall 
not be deemed evidence that the terms of

[[Page 546]]

paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section have been satisfied.

    (e) Unless licensed or authorized pursuant to this part, any 
attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other 
judicial process is null and void with respect to any property in which 
on or since the effective date there existed an interest of a specially 
designated narcotics trafficker.


<R05>
Sec. 598.206  Holding of funds in interest-bearing accounts; investment
and reinvestment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, or 
as otherwise directed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any U.S. 
person holding funds, such as currency, bank deposits, or liquidated 
financial obligations, subject to Sec. 598.202 shall hold or place such 
funds in a blocked interest-bearing account located in the United 
States.
    (b)(1) For purposes of this section, the term blocked interest-
bearing account means a blocked account:
    (i) In a federally-insured U.S. bank, thrift institution, or credit 
union, provided the funds are earning interest at rates that are 
commercially reasonable; or
    (ii) With a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provided 
the funds are invested in a money market fund or in U.S. Treasury bills.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a rate is commercially reasonable 
if it is the rate currently offered to other depositors on deposits or 
instruments of comparable size and maturity.
    (3) Funds held or placed in a blocked account pursuant to this 
paragraph (b) may not be invested in instruments the maturity of which 
exceeds 180 days. If interest is credited to a separate blocked account 
or sub-account, the name of the account party on each account must be 
the same.
    (c) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 
180 days at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 598.202 may 
continue to be held until maturity in the original instrument, provided 
any interest, earnings, or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid 
into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph (b) 
or (d) of this section.
    (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the United 
States at the time the funds become subject to Sec. 598.202 may 
continue to be held in the same type of accounts or instruments, 
provided the funds earn interest at rates that are commercially 
reasonable.
    (e) This section does not create an affirmative obligation for the 
holder of blocked tangible property, such as chattels or real estate, or 
of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to sell or 
liquidate such property at the time the property becomes subject to 
Sec. 598.202. However, the Office of Foreign Assets Control may issue 
licenses permitting or directing such sales in appropriate cases.
    (f) Funds subject to this section may not be held, invested, or 
reinvested in a manner that provides immediate financial or economic 
benefit or access to specially designated narcotics traffickers, nor may 
their holder cooperate in or facilitate the pledging or other attempted 
use as collateral of blocked funds or other assets.

    Note to Sec. 598.206: Please refer to Sec. 598.505 for authorized 
investment and reinvestment of certain funds held in blocked accounts.

                        Subpart D_Interpretations


<R05>
Sec. 598.401  Reference to amended sections.

    Except as otherwise specified, reference to any provision in or 
appendix to this part or chapter or to any regulation, ruling, order, 
instruction, direction, or license issued pursuant to this part refers 
to the same as currently amended.


<R05>
Sec. 598.402  Effect of amendment.

    Unless otherwise specifically provided, any amendment, modification, 
or revocation of any provision in or appendix to this part or chapter or 
of any order, regulation, ruling, instruction, or license issued by or 
under the direction of the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control does not affect any act done or omitted, or any civil or 
criminal suit or proceeding commenced or pending prior to such 
amendment, modification, or revocation. All penalties, forfeitures, and 
liabilities under any such order, regulation, ruling, instruction, or 
license continue and may be enforced as if such amendment, modification, 
or revocation had not been made.


<R05>
Sec. 598.403  Termination and acquisition of an interest in blocked property.

    (a) Whenever a transaction licensed pursuant to this part results in 
the transfer of property (including any property interest) away from a 
specially designated narcotics trafficker, the transferred property will 
no longer be considered property in which that person has or has had an 
interest. Provided no other specially designated narcotics trafficker 
has any interest in the transferred property following the transfer, the 
transferred property will no longer be considered property blocked 
pursuant to Sec. 598.202.
    (b) Unless otherwise specifically provided in a license issued 
pursuant to this part, if property (including any property interest) is 
transferred or attempted to be transferred to a specially designated 
narcotics trafficker, such property shall be deemed to be property in 
which that person has an interest, and such property is therefore 
blocked pursuant to Sec. 598.202.


<R05>
Sec. 598.404  Setoffs prohibited.

    A setoff against blocked property (including a blocked account), 
whether by a U.S. financial institution or other U.S. person, is a 
prohibited transfer under Sec. 598.203 if effected after the effective 
date.


<R05>
Sec. 598.405  Transactions incidental to a licensed transaction.

    Any transaction ordinarily incident to a licensed transaction and 
necessary to give effect to the licensed transaction is also authorized 
by the license. Except as specifically authorized by the terms of a 
license, prohibited transactions by specially designated narcotics 
traffickers and debits to accounts blocked pursuant to Sec. 598.202 are 
not considered incidental to a licensed transaction and therefore remain 
prohibited.


<R05>
Sec. 598.406  Provision of services.

    (a) The prohibitions contained in Sec. 598.203 apply to services 
performed by U.S. persons, wherever located:
    (1) On behalf of or for the benefit of a specially designated 
narcotics trafficker; or
    (2) With respect to property interests of a specially designated 
narcotics trafficker.

pursuant to this part, provide legal, accounting, financial, brokering,

licensing policy with regard to the provision of certain legal services.

Sec. 598.407  Offshore transactions.

[[Page 550]]

reason to know, that a specially designated narcotics trafficker has or 
has had an interest since the effective date.


<R05>
Sec. 598.408  Alleged change in ownership or control of an entity 
designated as a specially designated narcotics trafficker.

    (a) A change or alleged change in ownership or control of an entity 
designated as a specially designated narcotics trafficker shall not be 
the basis for removal of that entity from the list of specially 
designated narcotics traffickers unless, upon investigation by the 
Office of Foreign Control and submission of evidence by the entity, it 
is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control that the transfer to a bona fide purchaser at 
arm's length, or other means of changing ownership or control, is 
legitimate and that the entity no longer meets the criteria for 
designation under Sec. 598.314. Evidence submitted must conclusively 
demonstrate that all ties with other specially designated narcotics 
traffickers have been completely severed, and may include, but is not 
limited to, articles of incorporation; identification of new directors, 
officers, shareholders, and sources of capital; and contracts evidencing 
the sale of the entity to its new owners.
    (b) Any continuing substantial financial obligations on the part of 
the new owners to any specially designated narcotics traffickers, 
including long-term payment plans, leases, or rents, will be considered 
as evidence of continuing control of the entity by the specially 
designated narcotics trafficker. Purchase of a designated entity without 
ongoing substantial financial obligations to a specially designated 
narcotics trafficker may nonetheless be a basis for subsequent 
designation of the purchaser, if the transaction is determined 
materially to assist in or provide financial support for the 
international narcotics trafficking activities of specially designated 
narcotics traffickers for purposes of Sec. 598.314(b)(1). For example, 
any acquisition transaction resulting in a direct cash transfer to or 
other enrichment of a specially designated narcotics trafficker could 
lead to designation of the purchaser. Mere change in name of an entity 
will not be considered as constituting a change of the entity's status.


<R05>
Sec. 598.409  Credit extended and cards issued by U.S. financial institutions.

    The prohibition in Sec. 598.203 on dealing in property in which a 
specially designated narcotics trafficker has an interest prohibits U.S. 
financial institutions from performing under any existing credit 
agreements, including, but not limited to, charge cards, debit cards, or 
other credit facilities issued by a U.S. financial institution to a 
specially designated narcotics trafficker.


<R05>
Sec. 598.410  Payments from blocked accounts to U.S. exporters and for 
other obligations prohibited.

    No debits may be made to a blocked account to pay obligations to 
U.S. persons or other persons, including payment for goods or services 
exported prior to the effective date of the blocking, except as 
authorized pursuant to this part.

Control pursuant to this part, authorizes or validates any transaction 
effected prior to the issuance of the license, unless the prior

instruction, or license referring to this part authorizes any 
transaction prohibited by any provision of this chapter unless the 
regulation, ruling, instruction, or license specifically refers to such 
provision.
    (c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizing any 
transaction otherwise prohibited by this part has the effect of removing 
from the transaction a prohibition or prohibitions contained in this 
part, but only to the extent specifically stated by its terms. Unless 
the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license otherwise specifies, 
such an authorization does not create any right, duty, obligation, 
claim, or interest that would not otherwise exist under ordinary 
principles of law in or with respect to any property.


<R05>
Sec. 598.503  Exclusion from licenses.

    The Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control reserves the 
right to exclude any person, property, or transaction from the operation 
of any license or from the privileges conferred by any license. The 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control also reserves the right 
to restrict the applicability of any license to particular persons, 
property, transactions, or classes thereof. Such actions are binding 
upon all persons receiving actual or constructive notice of the 
exclusions or restrictions.


<R05>
Sec. 598.504  Payments and transfers to blocked accounts in U.S. 
financial institutions.

    Any payment of funds or transfer of credit in which a specially 
designated narcotics trafficker has any interest that comes within the 
possession or control of a U.S. financial institution must be blocked in 
an account on the books of that financial institution. A transfer of 
funds or credit by a U.S. financial institution between blocked accounts 
in its branches or offices is authorized, provided that no transfer is 
made from an account within the United States to an account held outside 
the United States, and further provided that a transfer from a blocked 
account may only be made to another blocked account held in the same 
name.

    Note to Sec. 598.504: Please refer to part 501, subpart C of this 
chapter for mandatory reporting requirements regarding financial

institutions are authorized to invest and reinvest assets held in

    (a) The assets representing such investments and reinvestments are 
credited to a blocked account or subaccount that is held in the same 
name at the same U.S. financial institution, or within the possession or 
control of a U.S. person, but in no case may funds be transferred 
outside the United States for this purpose;
    (b) The proceeds of such investments and reinvestments are not 
credited to a blocked account or subaccount under any name or 
designation that differs from the name or designation of the specific 
blocked account or subaccount in which such funds or securities were 
held; and
    (c) No immediate financial or economic benefit accrues (e.g., 
through pledging or other use) to the specially designated narcotics 
trafficker.


<R05>
Sec. 598.506  Entries in certain accounts for normal service charges 
authorized.

and compliance with the laws of any jurisdiction within the United 
States, provided that such advice and counseling is not provided to 
facilitate transactions that would violate any prohibition contained in 
this chapter;
    (2) Representation of a specially designated narcotics trafficker 
when named as a defendant in or otherwise made a party to domestic U.S. 
legal, arbitration, or administrative proceedings;
    (3) Initiation and conduct of domestic U.S. legal, arbitration, or 
administrative proceedings in defense of property interests subject to 
U.S. jurisdiction of a specially designated narcotics trafficker;
    (4) Representation of a specially designated narcotics trafficker 
before any federal or state agency with respect to the imposition,

    (d) Entry into a settlement agreement affecting property or 
interests in property of a specially designated narcotics trafficker or

the direction or authorization of the Secretary of Treasury pursuant to 
this part or otherwise under that Act. Section 807 of the Foreign 
Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, as adjusted pursuant to the Federal 
Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-410, as 
amended, 28 U.S.C. 2461 note), provides that:
    (1) Whoever willfully violates the provisions of the Foreign 
Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, or any license, rule, or regulation 
issued pursuant to that Act, or willfully neglects or refuses to comply 
with any order of the President issued under that Act, shall be 
imprisoned for not more than 10 years, fined in the amount provided in 
title 18, United States Code, or both, or, in the case of an entity, 
fined not more than $10,000,000;
    (2) Any officer, director, or agent of any entity who knowingly 
participates in a violation of the provisions of the Foreign Narcotics 
Kingpin Designation Act, shall be imprisoned for not more than 30 years, 
fined not more than $5,000,000, or both;

[[Page 553]]

    (3) A civil penalty not to exceed $1,075,000 per violation may be 
imposed by the Secretary of the Treasury on any person who violates any 
license, order, rule, or regulation issued in compliance with the 
provisions of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act.

    Note to paragraph (a)(3). The current $1,075,000 civil penalty cap 
may be adjusted for inflation pursuant to the Federal Civil Penalties 
Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990.

    (b) The criminal penalties provided in this part are subject to 
increase pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571.
    (c) Attention is directed to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides that 
whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or 
agency of the United States, knowingly and willfully falsifies, 
conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, 
or makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or 
representation, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing 
the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent 
statement or entry shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or 
imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
    (d) Violations of this part may also be subject to relevant 
provisions of other applicable laws.

<R05>
Sec. 598.702  Prepenalty notice.

    (a) When required. If the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control has reasonable cause to believe that there has occurred a 
violation of any provision of this part or a violation of the provisions 
of any license, ruling, regulation, order, direction, or instruction 
issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary 
of the Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under the Foreign 
Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, and the Director determines that 
further proceedings are warranted, the Director shall issue to the 
person concerned a notice of intent to impose a monetary penalty. This 
prepenalty notice shall be issued whether or not another agency has 
taken any action with respect to this matter.
    (b) Contents--(1) Facts of violation. The prepenalty notice shall 
describe the violation, specify the laws and regulations allegedly 
violated, and state the amount of the proposed monetary penalty.
    (2) Right to respond. The prepenalty notice also shall inform the 
respondent of respondent's right to make a written presentation within 
30 days of the date of mailing of the notice as to why a monetary 
penalty should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the monetary penalty 
should be in a lesser amount than proposed.


<R05>
Sec. 598.703  Response to prepenalty notice; informal settlement.

    (a) Deadline for response. The respondent shall have 30 days from 
the date of mailing of the prepenalty notice to make a written response 
to the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (b) Form and contents of response. The written response need not be 
in any particular form, but must contain information sufficient to 
indicate that it is in response to the prepenalty notice. It should 
contain responses to the allegations in the prepenalty notice and set 
forth the reasons why the respondent believes the penalty should not be 
imposed or why, if imposed, it should be in a lesser amount than 
proposed.
    (c) Informal settlement. In addition or as an alternative to a 
written response to a prepenalty notice issued pursuant to this section, 
the respondent or respondent's representative may contact the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control as advised in the prepenalty notice to propose 
the settlement of allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and 
related matters. In the event of settlement at the prepenalty stage, the 
claim proposed in the prepenalty notice will be withdrawn, the 
respondent will not be required to take a written position on 
allegations contained in the prepenalty notice, and the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control will make no final determination as to whether a 
violation occurred. The amount accepted in settlement of allegations in 
a prepenalty notice may vary from the civil penalty that might finally 
be imposed in the event of a formal determination of violation. In the 
event no

[[Page 554]]

settlement is reached, the 30-day period specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section for written response to the prepenalty notice remains in 
effect unless additional time is granted by the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control.


<R05>
Sec. 598.704  Penalty imposition or withdrawal.

    (a) No violation. If, after considering any response to a prepenalty 
notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control determines that there was no violation by the respondent 
named in the prepenalty notice, the Director promptly shall notify the 
respondent in writing of that determination and that no monetary penalty 
will be imposed.
    (b) Violation. If, after considering any response to a prepenalty 
notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control determines that there was a violation by the respondent 
named in the prepenalty notice, the Director promptly shall issue a 
written notice of the imposition of the monetary penalty to the 
respondent. The issuance of a written notice of the imposition of a 
monetary penalty shall constitute final agency action.
    (1) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent that payment of 
the assessed penalty must be made within 30 days of the date of mailing 
of the penalty notice.
    (2) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent of the 
requirement to furnish the respondent's taxpayer identification number 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 7701 and that such number will be used for 
purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent penalty amount.


<R05>
Sec. 598.705  Administrative collection; referral to United States
Department of Justice.

    In the event that the respondent does not pay a penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control within 30 days of the 
date of mailing of a penalty notice, the matter may be referred for 
administrative collection measures by the Department of the Treasury or 
to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate action to 
recover the penalty in a civil suit in a Federal district court.

                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 800.101  Scope.

    The regulations in this part implement section 721 of title VII of 
the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. App. 2170), as amended, 
hereinafter referred to as ``section 721.'' The definitions in this part 
are applicable to section 721 and these regulations. The principal 
purpose of section 721 is to authorize the President to suspend or 
prohibit any covered transaction when, in the President's judgment, 
there is credible evidence to believe that the foreign person exercising 
control over a U.S. business might take action that threatens to impair 
the national security, and when provisions of law other than section 721 
and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-
1706), do not, in the judgment of the President, provide adequate and 
appropriate authority for the President to protect the national security 
in the matter before the President. It is also a purpose of section 721

[[Page 774]]

to authorize the Committee to mitigate any threat to the national 
security of the United States that arises as a result of a covered 
transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 800.102  Effect on other law.

    Nothing in this part shall be construed as altering or affecting any 
other authority, process, regulation, investigation, enforcement 
measure, or review provided by or established under any other provision 
of federal law, including the International Emergency Economic Powers 
Act, or any other authority of the President or the Congress under the 
Constitution of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 800.103  Applicability rule; prospective application of certain 
provisions.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and 
otherwise in this part, the regulations in this part apply from the 
effective date (as defined in Section 800.210).
    (b) Sections 800.204 (Control), 800.205 (Conversion), 800.206 
(Convertible voting instrument), 800.211 (Entity), 800.212 (Foreign 
entity), 800.216 (Foreign person), 800.220 (Party or parties to a 
transaction), 800.223 (Solely for the purpose of passive investment), 
800.224 (Transaction), 800.226 (U.S. business), and 800.228 (Voting 
interest), and the regulations in subpart C (Coverage) do not apply to 
any transaction for which the following has occurred before the 
effective date, in which case corresponding provisions of the 
regulations in this part that were in effect the day before the 
effective date will apply:
    (1) The parties to the transaction have executed a written agreement 
or other document establishing the material terms of the transaction;
    (2) A party has made a public offer to shareholders to buy shares of 
a U.S. business;
    (3) A shareholder has solicited proxies in connection with an 
election of the board of directors of a U.S. business or has requested 
the conversion of convertible voting securities; or
    (4) The parties have, in the Committee's view, otherwise made a 
commitment to engage in a transaction.
    Note to Sec. 800.103: See subpart H of this part for specific 
applicability rules pertaining to that subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 800.104  Transactions or devices for avoidance.

    Any transaction or other device entered into or employed for the 
purpose of avoiding section 721 shall be disregarded, and section 721 
and the regulations in this part shall be applied to the substance of 
the transaction.

    Example. Corporation A is organized under the laws of a foreign 
state and is wholly owned and controlled by a foreign national. With a 
view towards avoiding possible application of section 721, Corporation A 
transfers money to a U.S. citizen, who, pursuant to informal 
arrangements with Corporation A and on its behalf, purchases all the 
shares in Corporation X, a U.S. business. That transaction is subject to 
section 721.


<R04>

[[Page 775]]

    (3) In the case of any entity lacking officers, directors, or 
partners, any individual within the organization exercising executive 
functions similar to those of an officer or director of a corporation or 
a general partner of a partnership; and
    (4) In the case of an individual, such individual or his or her 
legal representative.
    (c) In each case described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of 
this section, such designee must possess actual authority to make the 
certification on behalf of the party to the transaction filing a notice 
or information.
    Note to Sec. 800.202: A sample certification may be found at the

<R05>
Sec. 800.203  Committee; Chairperson of the Committee; Staff Chairperson.

<R05>
Sec. 800.204  Control.

    (a) The term control means the power, direct or indirect, whether or 
not exercised, through the ownership of a majority or a dominant 
minority of the total outstanding voting interest in an entity, board 
representation, proxy voting, a special share, contractual arrangements, 
formal or informal arrangements to act in concert, or other means, to 
determine, direct, or decide important matters affecting an entity; in 
particular, but without limitation, to determine, direct, take, reach, 
or cause decisions regarding the following matters, or any other 
similarly important matters affecting an entity:
    (1) The sale, lease, mortgage, pledge, or other transfer of any of 
the tangible or intangible principal assets of the entity, whether or 
not in the ordinary course of business;
    (2) The reorganization, merger, or dissolution of the entity;
    (3) The closing, relocation, or substantial alteration of the 
production, operational, or research and development facilities of the 
entity;
    (4) Major expenditures or investments, issuances of equity or debt, 
or dividend payments by the entity, or approval of the operating budget 
of the entity;
    (5) The selection of new business lines or ventures that the entity 
will pursue;
    (6) The entry into, termination, or non-fulfillment by the entity of 
significant contracts;
    (7) The policies or procedures of the entity governing the treatment 
of non-public technical, financial, or other proprietary information of 
the entity;
    (8) The appointment or dismissal of officers or senior managers;
    (9) The appointment or dismissal of employees with access to

    (10) The amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, constituent 
agreement, or other organizational documents of the entity with respect 
to the matters described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (9) of this 
section.
    (b) In examining questions of control in situations where more than 
one foreign person has an ownership interest in an entity, consideration 
will be given to factors such as whether the foreign persons are related 
or have formal or informal arrangements to act in concert, whether they 
are agencies or instrumentalities of the national or subnational 
governments of a single foreign state, and whether a given foreign 
person and another person that has an ownership interest in the entity 
are both controlled by any of the national or subnational governments of 
a single foreign state.
    (c) The following minority shareholder protections shall not in 
themselves be deemed to confer control over an entity:
    (1) The power to prevent the sale or pledge of all or substantially 
all of the assets of an entity or a voluntary filing for bankruptcy or 
liquidation;
    (2) The power to prevent an entity from entering into contracts with 
majority investors or their affiliates;
    (3) The power to prevent an entity from guaranteeing the obligations 
of majority investors or their affiliates;

[[Page 776]]

    (4) The power to purchase an additional interest in an entity to 
prevent the dilution of an investor's pro rata interest in that entity 
in the event that the entity issues additional instruments conveying 
interests in the entity;
    (5) The power to prevent the change of existing legal rights or 
preferences of the particular class of stock held by minority investors, 
as provided in the relevant corporate documents governing such shares; 
and
    (6) The power to prevent the amendment of the Articles of 
Incorporation, constituent agreement, or other organizational documents 
of an entity with respect to the matters described in paragraphs (c)(1) 
through (5) of this section.
    (d) The Committee will consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether 
minority shareholder protections other than those listed in paragraph 
(c) of this section do not confer control over an entity.
    (e) Any transaction in which a foreign person acquires an additional 
interest in a U.S. business that was previously the subject of a covered 
transaction for which the Committee concluded all action under section 
721 shall not be deemed to be a transaction that could result in foreign 
control over that U.S. business (i.e., it is not a covered transaction). 
However, if a foreign person that did not acquire control of the U.S. 
business in the prior transaction is a party to the later transaction, 
the later transaction may be a covered transaction.

    Example 1. Corporation A is a U.S. business. A U.S. investor owns 50 
percent of the voting interest in Corporation A, and the remaining 
voting interest is owned in equal shares by five unrelated foreign 
investors. The foreign investors jointly financed their investment in 
Corporation A and vote as a single block on matters affecting 
Corporation A. The foreign investors have an informal arrangement to act 
in concert with regard to Corporation A, and, as a result, the foreign 
investors control Corporation A.
    Example 2. Same facts as in Example 1 with regard to the composition 
of Corporation A's shareholders. The foreign investors in Corporation A 
have no contractual or other commitments to act in concert, and have no 
informal arrangements to do so. Assuming no other relevant facts, the 
foreign investors do not control Corporation A.
    Example 3. Corporation A, a foreign person, is a private equity fund 
that routinely acquires substantial interests in companies and manages 
them for a period of time. Corporation B is a U.S. business. In addition 
to its acquisition of seven percent of Corporation B's voting shares, 
Corporation A acquires the right to terminate significant contracts of 
Corporation B. Corporation A controls Corporation B.
    Example 4. Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a nine percent 
interest in the shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business. As part of the 
transaction, Corporation A also acquires certain veto rights that 
determine important matters affecting Corporation B, including the right 
to veto the dismissal of senior executives of Corporation B. Corporation 
A controls Corporation B.
    Example 5. Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a thirteen 
percent interest in the shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business, and 
the right to appoint one member of Corporation B's seven-member Board of 
Directors. Corporation A receives minority shareholder protections 
listed in Sec. 800.204(c), but receives no other positive or negative 
rights with respect to Corporation B. Assuming no other relevant facts, 
Corporation A does not control Corporation B.
    Example 6. Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a twenty 
percent interest in the shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business. 
Corporation A has negotiated an irrevocable passivity agreement that 
completely precludes it from controlling Corporation B. Corporation A 
does, however, receive the right to prevent Corporation B from entering 
into contracts with majority investors or their affiliates and to 
prevent Corporation B from guaranteeing the obligations of majority 
investors or their affiliates. Assuming no other relevant facts, 
Corporation A does not control Corporation B.
    Example 7. Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a 40 percent 
interest and important rights in Corporation B, a U.S. business. The 
documentation pertaining to the transaction gives no indication that 
Corporation A's interest in Corporation B may increase at a later date. 
Following its review of the transaction, the Committee informs the 
parties that the notified transaction is a covered transaction, and 
concludes action under section 721. Three years later, Corporation A 
acquires the remainder of the voting interest in Corporation B. Assuming 
no other relevant facts, because the Committee concluded all action with 
respect to Corporation A's earlier investment in the same U.S. business, 
and because no other foreign person is a party to this subsequent 
transaction, this subsequent transaction is not a covered transaction.
    Example 8. Limited Partnership A comprises two limited partners, 
each of which

[[Page 777]]

holds 49 percent of the interest in the partnership, and a general 
partner, which holds two percent of the interest. The general partner 
has sole authority to determine, direct, and decide important matters 
affecting the partnership and a fund operated by the partnership. The 
general partner alone controls Limited Partnership A and the fund.
    Example 9. Same facts as in Example 8, except that each of the 
limited partners has the authority to veto major investments proposed by 
the general partner and to choose the fund's representatives on the 
boards of the fund's portfolio companies. The general partner and the 
limited partners each have control over Limited Partnership A and the 
fund.

    Note to Sec. 800.204: See Sec. 800.302(b) regarding the 
Committee's treatment of transactions in which a foreign person holds or 
acquires ten percent or less of the outstanding voting interest in a 
U.S. business solely for the purpose of passive investment.

missile technology), as well as those that are controlled for reasons of 
regional stability or surreptitious listening;
    (c) Specially designed and prepared nuclear equipment, parts and

in a particular location or for particular products or services; and any 
government (including a foreign national or subnational government, the 
United States Government, a subnational government within the United

corporation, or organization organized under the laws of a foreign state 
if either its principal place of business is outside the United States 
or its equity securities are primarily traded on one or more foreign 
exchanges.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, any branch, 
partnership, group or sub-group, association, estate, trust, corporation 
or division of a corporation, or organization that demonstrates that a 
majority of the equity interest in such entity is ultimately owned by 
U.S. nationals is not a foreign entity.


<R05>
Sec. 800.213  Foreign government.

    The term foreign government means any government or body exercising 
governmental functions, other than the United States Government or a 
subnational government of the United States. The term includes, but is 
not limited to, national and subnational governments, including their 
respective departments, agencies, and instrumentalities.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 800.215  Foreign national.

    The term foreign national means any individual other than a U.S. 
national.


<R05>
Sec. 800.216  Foreign person.

    The term foreign person means:
    (a) Any foreign national, foreign government, or foreign entity; or
    (b) Any entity over which control is exercised or exercisable by a 
foreign national, foreign government, or foreign entity.

    Example 1. Corporation A is organized under the laws of a foreign 
state and is only engaged in business outside the United States. All of 
its shares are held by Corporation X, which controls Corporation A. 
Corporation X is organized in the United States and is wholly owned and 
controlled by U.S. nationals. Assuming no other relevant facts, 
Corporation A, although organized and only operating outside the United 
States, is not a foreign person.
    Example 2. Same facts as in the first sentence of Example 1. The 
government of the foreign state under whose laws Corporation A is 
organized exercises control over Corporation A through government 
interveners. Corporation A is a foreign person.
    Example 3. Corporation A is organized in the United States, is 
engaged in interstate commerce in the United States, and is controlled 
by Corporation X. Corporation X is organized under the laws of a foreign 
state, its principal place of business is located outside the United 
States, and 50 percent of its shares are held by foreign nationals and 
50 percent of its shares are held by U.S. nationals. Both Corporation A 
and Corporation X are foreign persons. Corporation A is also a U.S. 
business.
    Example 4. Corporation A is organized under the laws of a foreign 
state and is owned and controlled by a foreign national. A branch of

also a U.S. business.
    Example 5. Corporation A is a corporation organized under the laws 
of a foreign state and its principal place of business is located 
outside the United States. Forty-five percent of the voting interest in 
Corporation A is owned in equal shares by numerous unrelated foreign 
investors, none of whom has control. The foreign investors have no 
formal or informal arrangement to act in concert with regard to 
Corporation A with any other holder of voting interest in Corporation A. 
Corporation A demonstrates that the remainder of the voting interest in 
Corporation A is held by U.S. nationals. Assuming no other relevant 
facts, Corporation A is not a foreign person.
    Example 6. Same facts as Example 5, except that one of the foreign 
investors controls Corporation A. Assuming no other relevant facts, 
Corporation A is not a foreign entity pursuant to Sec. 800.212(b), but 
it is a foreign person because it is controlled by a foreign person.


<R05>
Sec. 800.217  Hold.

of this section with respect to another entity (i.e., the intermediate 
parent) is also a parent of any other entity of which the intermediate 
parent is a parent.

    Example 1. Corporation P holds 50 percent of the voting interest in 
Corporations R and S. Corporation R holds 40 percent of the voting 
interest in Corporation X; Corporation S holds 50 percent of the voting 
interest in Corporation Y, which in turn holds 50 percent of the voting 
interest in Corporation Z. Corporation P is a parent of Corporations R, 
S, Y, and Z, but not of Corporation X. Corporation S is a parent of 
Corporation Y and Z, and Corporation Y is a parent of Corporation Z.
    Example 2. Corporation A holds warrants which when exercised will

in a role comparable to that of a person described in paragraphs (a) 
through (e) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 800.221  Person.

    The term person means any individual or entity.


<R05>
Sec. 800.222  Section 721.

    The term section 721 means section 721 of title VII of the Defense 
Production Act of 1950, 50 U.S.C. App. 2170.


<R05>
Sec. 800.223  Solely for the purpose of passive investment.

    Ownership interests are held or acquired solely for the purpose of 
passive investment if the person holding or acquiring such interests 
does not plan or intend to exercise control, does not possess or develop 
any purpose other than passive investment, and does not take any action 
inconsistent with holding or acquiring such interests solely for the 
purpose of passive investment. (See Sec. 800.302(b).)

    Example. Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a voting interest 
in Corporation B, a U.S. business. In addition to the voting interest, 
Corporation A negotiates the right to appoint a member of Corporation 
B's Board of Directors. The acquisition by Corporation A of a voting 
interest in Corporation B is not solely for the purpose of passive 
investment.


<R05>
Sec. 800.224  Transaction.

    The term transaction means a proposed or completed merger, 
acquisition, or takeover. It includes:
    (a) The acquisition of an ownership interest in an entity.
    (b) The acquisition or conversion of convertible voting instruments 
of an entity.

[[Page 780]]

    (c) The acquisition of proxies from holders of a voting interest in 
an entity.
    (d) A merger or consolidation.
    (e) The formation of a joint venture.
    (f) A long-term lease under which a lessee makes substantially all 
business decisions concerning the operation of a leased entity, as if it 
were the owner.

    Note to Sec. 800.224(b): See Sec. 800.304 regarding factors the 
Committee will consider in determining whether to include the rights to 
be acquired by a foreign person upon the conversion of convertible 
voting instruments as part of the Committee's assessment of whether a 
transaction that involves such instruments is a covered transaction.

    Example. Corporation A, a foreign person, signs a concession 
agreement to operate the toll road business of Corporation B, a U.S. 
business, for 99 years. Corporation B, however, is required under the 
agreement to perform safety and security functions with respect to the 
business and to monitor compliance by Corporation A with the operating 
requirements of the agreement on an ongoing basis. Corporation B may 
terminate the agreement or impose other penalties for breach of these 
operating requirements. Assuming no other relevant facts, this is not a 
transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 800.225  United States.

    The term United States or U.S. means the United States of America, 
the States of the United States, the District of Columbia, and any 
commonwealth, territory, dependency, or possession of the United States, 
or any subdivision of the foregoing, and includes the Outer Continental 
Shelf, as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331(a). For purposes of these 
regulations and their examples, an entity organized under the laws of 
the United States of America, one of the States, the District of 
Columbia, or a commonwealth, territory, dependency, or possession of the 
United States is an entity organized ``in the United States.''


<R05>
Sec. 800.226  U.S. business.

    The term U.S. business means any entity, irrespective of the 
nationality of the persons that control it, engaged in interstate 
commerce in the United States, but only to the extent of its activities 
in interstate commerce.

    Example 1. Corporation A is organized under the laws of a foreign 
state and is wholly owned and controlled by a foreign national. It 
engages in interstate commerce in the United States through a branch or 
subsidiary. Its branch or subsidiary is a U.S. business. Corporation A 
and its branch or subsidiary is each also a foreign person should any of 
them engage in a transaction involving a U.S. business.
    Example 2. Same facts as in the first sentence of Example 1. 
Corporation A, however, does not have a branch office, subsidiary, or 
fixed place of business in the United States. It exports and licenses 
technology to an unrelated company in the United States. Assuming no 
other relevant facts, Corporation A is not a U.S. business.
    Example 3. Corporation A, a company organized under the laws of a 
foreign state, is wholly owned and controlled by Corporation X. 
Corporation X is organized in the United States and is wholly owned and 
controlled by U.S. nationals. Corporation A does not have a branch 
office, subsidiary, or fixed place of business in the United States. It 
exports goods to Corporation X and to unrelated companies in the United 
States. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A is not a U.S. 
business.


<R05>
Sec. 800.227  U.S. national.

    The term U.S. national means a citizen of the United States or an 
individual who, although not a citizen of the United States, owes 
permanent allegiance to the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 800.228  Voting interest.

    The term voting interest means any interest in an entity that 
entitles the owner or holder of that interest to vote for the election 
of directors of the entity (or, with respect to unincorporated entities, 
individuals exercising similar functions) or to vote on other matters 
affecting the entity.


<R04>
                           Subpart C_Coverage


<R05>
Sec. 800.301  Transactions that are covered transactions.

    Transactions that are covered transactions include, without 
limitation:
    (a) A transaction which, irrespective of the actual arrangements for 
control provided for in the terms of the transaction, results or could 
result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person.

    Example 1. Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to purchase all 
of the shares of Corporation X, which is a U.S. business. As the sole 
owner, Corporation A will have the right

[[Page 781]]

to elect directors and appoint other primary officers of Corporation X, 
and those directors will have the right to make decisions about the 
closing and relocation of particular production facilities and the 
termination of significant contracts. The directors also will have the 
right to propose to Corporation A, the sole shareholder, the dissolution 
of Corporation X and the sale of its principal assets. The proposed 
transaction is a covered transaction.
    Example 2. Same facts as in Example 1, except that Corporation A 
plans to retain the existing directors of Corporation X, all of whom are 
U.S. nationals. Although Corporation A may choose not to exercise its 
power to elect new directors for Corporation X, Corporation A 
nevertheless will have that exercisable power. The proposed transaction 
is a covered transaction.
    Example 3. Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to purchase 50 
percent of the shares in Corporation X, a U.S. business, from 
Corporation B, also a U.S. business. Corporation B would retain the 
other 50 percent of the shares in Corporation X, and Corporation A and 
Corporation B would contractually agree that Corporation A would not 
exercise its voting and other rights for ten years. The proposed 
transaction is a covered transaction.

    (b) A transaction in which a foreign person conveys its control of a 
U.S. business to another foreign person.

    Example. Corporation X is a U.S. business, but is wholly owned and 
controlled by Corporation Y, a foreign person. Corporation Z, also a 
foreign person, but not related to Corporation Y, seeks to acquire 
Corporation X from Corporation Y. The proposed transaction is a covered 
transaction because it could result in control of Corporation X, a U.S. 
business, by another foreign person, Corporation Z.

    (c) A transaction that results or could result in control by a 
foreign person of any part of an entity or of assets, if such part of an 
entity or assets constitutes a U.S. business. (See Sec. 800.302(c).)

    Example 1. Corporation X, a foreign person, has a branch office 
located in the United States. Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes 
to buy that branch office. The proposed transaction is a covered 
transaction.
    Example 2. Corporation A, a foreign person, buys a branch office 
located entirely outside the United States of Corporation Y, which is 
incorporated in the United States. Assuming no other relevant facts, the 
branch office of Corporation Y is not a U.S. business, and the 
transaction is not a covered transaction.
    Example 3. Corporation A, a foreign person, makes a start-up, or 
``greenfield,'' investment in the United States. That investment 
involves such activities as separately arranging for the financing of 
and the construction of a plant to make a new product, buying supplies 
and inputs, hiring personnel, and purchasing the necessary technology. 
The investment may involve the acquisition of shares in a newly 
incorporated subsidiary. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A 
will not have acquired a U.S. business, and its greenfield investment is 
not a covered transaction.
    Example 4. Corporation A, a foreign person, purchases substantially 
all of the assets of Corporation B. Corporation B, which is incorporated 
in the United States, was in the business of producing industrial 
equipment, but stopped producing and selling such equipment one week 
before Corporation A purchased substantially all of its assets. At the 
time of the transaction, Corporation B continued to have employees on 
its payroll, maintained know-how in producing the industrial equipment 
it previously produced, and maintained relationships with its prior 
customers, all of which were transferred to Corporation A. The 
acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Corporation B by 
Corporation A is a covered transaction.
    Example 5. Corporation A, a foreign person, owns businesses both 
outside the United States and in the United States. Corporation B, a 
foreign person, acquires Corporation A. The acquisition of Corporation A 
by Corporation B is a covered transaction with respect to Corporation 
A's businesses in the United States.
    Example 6. Corporation X, a foreign person, seeks to acquire from 
Corporation A, a U.S. business, an empty warehouse facility located in 
the United States. The acquisition would be limited to the physical 
facility, and would not include customer lists, intellectual property, 
or other proprietary information, or other intangible assets or the 
transfer of personnel. Assuming no other relevant facts, the facility is 
not an entity and therefore not a U.S. business, and the proposed 
acquisition of the facility is not a covered transaction.
    Example 7. Same facts as Example 6, except that, in addition to the 
proposed acquisition of Corporation A's warehouse facility, Corporation 
X would acquire the personnel, customer list, equipment, and inventory 
management software used to operate the facility. Under these facts, 
Corporation X is acquiring a U.S. business, and the proposed acquisition 
is a covered transaction.

    (d) A joint venture in which the parties enter into a contractual or 
other similar arrangement, including an agreement on the establishment 
of a new entity, but only if one or more of

[[Page 782]]

the parties contributes a U.S. business and a foreign person could 
control that U.S. business by means of the joint venture.

    Example 1. Corporation A, a foreign person, and Corporation X, a 
U.S. business, form a separate corporation, JV Corporation, to which 
Corporation A contributes only cash and Corporation X contributes a U.S. 
business. Each owns 50 percent of the shares of JV Corporation and, 
under the Articles of Incorporation of JV Corporation, both Corporation 
A and Corporation X have veto power over all of the matters affecting JV 
Corporation identified under Sec. 800.204(a)(1) through (10), giving 
them both control over JV Corporation. The formation of JV Corporation 
is a covered transaction.
    Example 2. Corporation A, a foreign person, and Corporation X, a 
U.S. business, form a separate corporation, JV Corporation, to which 
Corporation A contributes funding and managerial and technical 
personnel, while Corporation X contributes certain land and equipment 
that do not in this example constitute a U.S. business. Corporations A 
and B each have a 50 percent interest in the joint venture. Assuming no 
other relevant facts, the formation of JV Corporation is not a covered 
transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 800.302  Transactions that are not covered transactions.

    Transactions that are not covered transactions include, without 
limitation:
    (a) A stock split or pro rata stock dividend that does not involve a 
change in control.

    Example. Corporation A, a foreign person, holds 10,000 shares of 
Corporation B, a U.S. business, constituting ten percent of the stock of 
Corporation B. Corporation B pays a 2-for-1 stock dividend. As a result 
of this stock split, Corporation A holds 20,000 shares of Corporation B, 
still constituting ten percent of the stock of Corporation B. Assuming 
no other relevant facts, the acquisition of additional shares is not a 
covered transaction.

    (b) A transaction that results in a foreign person holding ten 
percent or less of the outstanding voting interest in a U.S. business 
(regardless of the dollar value of the interest so acquired), but only 
if the transaction is solely for the purpose of passive investment. (See 
Sec. 800.223.)

    Example 1. In an open market purchase solely for the purpose of 
passive investment, Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires seven 
percent of the voting securities of Corporation X, which is a U.S. 
business. Assuming no other relevant facts, the acquisition of the 
securities is not a covered transaction.
    Example 2. Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires nine percent of 
the voting shares of Corporation X, a U.S. business. Corporation A also 
negotiates contractual rights that give it the power to control 
important matters of Corporation X. The acquisition by Corporation A of 
the voting shares of Corporation X is not solely for the purpose of 
passive investment and is a covered transaction.
    Example 3. Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires five percent of 
the voting shares in Corporation B, a U.S. business. In addition to the 
securities, Corporation A obtains the right to appoint one out of eleven 
seats on Corporation B's Board of Directors. The acquisition by 
Corporation A of Corporation B's securities is not solely for the 
purpose of passive investment. Whether the transaction is a covered 
transaction would depend on whether Corporation A obtains control of 
Corporation B as a result of the transaction.

    (c) An acquisition of any part of an entity or of assets, if such 
part of an entity or assets do not constitute a U.S. business. (See 
Sec. 800.301(c).)

    Example 1. Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires, from separate 
U.S. nationals: (a) products held in inventory, (b) land, and (c) 
machinery for export. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A 
has not acquired a U.S. business, and this acquisition is not a covered 
transaction.
    Example 2. Corporation X, a U.S. business, produces armored 
personnel carriers in the United States. Corporation A, a foreign 
person, seeks to acquire the annual production of those carriers from 
Corporation X. under a long-term contract. Assuming no other relevant 
facts, this transaction is not a covered transaction.
    Example 3. Same facts as Example 2, except that Corporation X, a 
U.S. business, has developed important technology in connection with the 
production of armored personnel carriers. Corporation A seeks to 
negotiate an agreement under which it would be licensed to manufacture 
using that technology. Assuming no other relevant facts, neither the 
proposed acquisition of technology pursuant to that license agreement, 
nor the actual acquisition, is a covered transaction.
    Example 4. Same facts as Example 2, except that Corporation A enters 
into a contractual arrangement to acquire the entire armored personnel 
carrier business operations of Corporation X, including production 
facilities, customer lists, technology, and staff. This transaction is a 
covered transaction.
    Example 5. Same facts as Example 2, except that Corporation X 
suspended all activities of its armored personnel carrier business a

[[Page 783]]

year ago and currently is in bankruptcy proceedings. Existing equipment 
provided by Corporation X is being serviced by another company, which 
purchased the service contracts from Corporation X. The business's 
production facilities are idle but still in working condition, some of 
its key former employees have agreed to return if the business is 
resuscitated, and its technology and customer and vendor lists are still 
current. Corporation X's personnel carrier business constitutes a U.S. 
business, and its purchase by Corporation A is a covered transaction.

    (d) An acquisition of securities by a person acting as a securities 
underwriter, in the ordinary course of business and in the process of 
underwriting.
    (e) An acquisition pursuant to a condition in a contract of 
insurance relating to fidelity, surety, or casualty obligations if the 
contract was made by an insurer in the ordinary course of business.


<R05>
Sec. 800.303  Lending transactions.

    (a) The extension of a loan or a similar financing arrangement by a 
foreign person to a U.S. business, regardless of whether accompanied by 
the creation in the foreign person of a secured interest in securities 
or other assets of the U.S. business, shall not, by itself, constitute a 
covered transaction.
    (1) The Committee will accept notices concerning a loan or a similar 
financing arrangement that does not, by itself, constitute a covered 
transaction only at the time that, because of imminent or actual default 
or other condition, there is a significant possibility that the foreign 
person may obtain control of a U.S. business as a result of the default 
or other condition.
    (2) Where the Committee accepts a notice concerning a loan or a 
similar financing arrangement pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, and a party to the transaction is a foreign person that makes 
loans in the ordinary course of business, the Committee will take into 
account whether the foreign person has made any arrangements to transfer 
management decisions and day-to-day control over the U.S. business to 
U.S. nationals for purposes of determining whether such loan or 
financing arrangement constitutes a covered transaction.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a loan or a 
similar financing arrangement through which a foreign person acquires an 
interest in profits of a U.S. business, the right to appoint members of 
the board of directors of the U.S. business, or other comparable 
financial or governance rights characteristic of an equity investment 
but not of a typical loan may constitute a covered transaction.
    (c) An acquisition of voting interest or assets of a U.S. business 
by a foreign person upon default or other condition involving a loan or 
a similar financing arrangement does not constitute a covered 
transaction, provided that the loan was made by a syndicate of banks in 
a loan participation where the foreign lender (or lenders) in the 
syndicate:
    (1) Needs the majority consent of the U.S. participants in the 
syndicate to take action, and cannot on its own initiate any action vis-
[agrave]-vis the debtor; or
    (2) Does not have a lead role in the syndicate, and is subject to a 
provision in the loan or financing documents limiting its ability to 
control the debtor such that control for purposes of Sec. 800.204 could 
not be acquired.

    Example 1. Corporation A, which is a U.S. business, borrows funds 
from Corporation B, a bank organized under the laws of a foreign state 
and controlled by foreign persons. As a condition of the loan, 
Corporation A agrees not to sell or pledge its principal assets to any 
person. Assuming no other relevant facts, this lending arrangement does 
not alone constitute a covered transaction.
    Example 2. Same facts as in Example 1, except that Corporation A 
defaults on its loan from Corporation B and seeks bankruptcy protection. 
Corporation A has no funds with which to satisfy Corporation B's claim, 
which is greater than the value of Corporation A's principal assets. 
Corporation B's secured claim constitutes the only secured claim against 
Corporation A's principal assets, creating a high probability that 
Corporation B will receive title to Corporation A's principal assets, 
which constitute a U.S. business. Assuming no other relevant facts, the 
Committee would accept a notice of the impending bankruptcy court 
adjudication transferring control of Corporation A's principal assets to 
Corporation B, which would constitute a covered transaction.
    Example 3. Corporation A, a foreign bank, makes a loan to 
Corporation B, a U.S. business. The loan documentation extends to 
Corporation A rights in Corporation B that

[[Page 784]]

are characteristic of an equity investment but not of a typical loan, 
including dominant minority representation on the board of directors of 
Corporation B and the right to be paid dividends by Corporation B. This 
loan is a covered transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 800.304  Timing rule for convertible voting instruments.

    (a) For purposes of determining whether to include the rights that a 
holder of convertible voting instruments will acquire upon conversion of 
those instruments in the Committee's assessment of whether a notified 
transaction is a covered transaction, the Committee will consider 
factors that include:
    (1) The imminence of conversion;
    (2) Whether conversion depends on factors within the control of the 
acquiring party; and
    (3) Whether the amount of voting interest and the rights that would 
be acquired upon conversion can be reasonably determined at the time of 
acquisition.
    (b) When the Committee, applying paragraph (a) of this section, 
determines that the rights that the holder will acquire upon conversion 
will not be included in the Committee's assessment of whether a notified 
transaction is a covered transaction, the Committee will disregard the 
convertible voting instruments for purposes of that transaction except 
to the extent that they convey immediate rights to the holder with 
respect to the governance of the entity that issued the instruments.

    Example 1. Corporation A, a foreign person, notifies the Committee 
that it intends to buy common stock and debentures of Corporation X, a 
U.S. business. By their terms, the debentures are convertible into 
common stock only upon the occurrence of an event the timing of which is 
not in the control of Corporation A, and the number of common shares 
that would be acquired upon conversion cannot now be determined. 
Assuming no other relevant facts, the Committee will disregard the 
debentures in the course of its covered transaction analysis at the time 
that Corporation A acquires the debentures. In the event that it 
determines that the acquisition of the common stock is not a covered 
transaction, the Committee will so inform the parties. Once the 
conversion of the instruments becomes imminent, it may be appropriate 
for the Committee to consider the rights that would result from the 
conversion and whether the conversion is a covered transaction. The 
conversion of those debentures into common stock could be a covered 
transaction, depending on what percentage of Corporation X's voting 
securities Corporation A would receive and what powers those securities 
would confer on Corporation A.
    Example 2. Same facts as Example 1, except that the debentures at 
issue are convertible at the sole discretion of Corporation A after six 
months, and if converted, would represent a 50 percent interest in 
Corporation X. The Committee may consider the rights that would result 
from the conversion as part of its assessment.

    Example. Corporation A, a foreign person, intends to acquire 
Corporation X, which is wholly owned and controlled by a U.S. national 
and which has a Facility Security Clearance under the Department of 
Defense Industrial Security Program. See Department of Defense, 
``Industrial Security Regulation,'' DOD 5220.22-R, and ``Industrial 
Security Manual for Safeguarding Classified Information,'' DOD 5220.22-
M. Corporation X accordingly files a revised Form DD SF-328, and enters 
into discussions with the Defense Security Service about effectively 
insulating

[[Page 789]]

its facilities from the foreign person. Corporation X may also have made 
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of 
Commerce, the Department of State, or other federal departments and 
agencies. Paragraph (d) of this section requires that certain specific 
information about these filings be reported to the Committee in a 
voluntary notice.

    (e) In the case of the establishment of a joint venture in which one 
or more of the parties is contributing a U.S. business, information for 
the voluntary notice shall be prepared on the assumption that the 
foreign person that is party to the joint venture has made an 
acquisition of the existing U.S. business that the other party to the 
joint venture is contributing or transferring to the joint venture. The 
voluntary notice shall describe the name and address of the joint 
venture and the entities that established, or are establishing, the 
joint venture.
    (f) In the case of the acquisition of some but not all of the assets 
of an entity, Sec. 800.402(c) requires submission of the specified 
information only with respect to the assets of the entity that have been 
or are proposed to be acquired.
    (g) Persons filing a voluntary notice shall, with respect to the 
foreign person that is a party to the transaction, its immediate parent, 
the U.S. business that is the subject of the transaction, and each 
entity of which the foreign person is a parent, append to the voluntary 
notice the most recent annual report of each such entity, in English. 
Separate reports are not required for any entity whose financial results 
are included within the consolidated financial results stated in the 
annual report of any parent of any such entity, unless the transaction 
involves the acquisition of a U.S. business whose parent is not being 
acquired, in which case the notice shall include the most recent audited 
financial statement of the U.S. business that is the subject of the 
transaction. If a U.S. business does not prepare an annual report and 
its financial results are not included within the consolidated financial 
results stated in the annual report of a parent, the filing shall 
include, if available, the entity's most recent audited financial 
statement (or, if an audited financial statement is not available, the 
unaudited financial statement).
    (h) Persons filing a voluntary notice shall, during the time that 
the matter is pending before the Committee or the President, promptly 
advise the Staff Chairperson of any material changes in plans, facts and 
circumstances addressed in the notice, and information provided or 
required to be provided to the Committee under Sec. 800.402, and shall 
file amendments to the notice to reflect such material changes. Such 
amendments shall become part of the notice filed by such persons under 
Sec. 800.401, and the certification required under Sec. 800.402(l) 
shall apply to such amendments. (See also Sec. 800.701(d).)
    (i) Persons filing a voluntary notice shall include a copy of the 
most recent asset or stock purchase agreement or other document 
establishing the agreed terms of the transaction.
    (j) Persons filing a voluntary notice shall include:
    (1) An organizational chart illustrating all of the entities or 
individuals above the foreign person that is a party to the transaction 
up to the person or persons having ultimate control of that person, 
including the percentage of shares held by each; and
    (2) The opinion of the person regarding whether:
    (i) It is a foreign person;
    (ii) It is controlled by a foreign government; and
    (iii) The transaction has resulted or could result in control of a 
U.S. business by a foreign person, and the reasons for its view, 
focusing in particular on any powers (for example, by virtue of a 
shareholders agreement, contract, statute, or regulation) that the 
foreign person will have with regard to the U.S. business, and how those 
powers can or will be exercised.
    (k) Persons filing a voluntary notice shall include information as 
to whether:
    (1) Any party to the transaction is, or has been, a party to a 
mitigation agreement entered into or condition imposed under section 
721, and if so, shall specify the date and purpose of such agreement or 
condition and the United States Government signatories; and

[[Page 790]]

    (2) Any party to the transaction has been a party to a transaction 
previously notified to the Committee.
    (l) Each party filing a voluntary notice shall provide a 
certification of the notice consistent with Sec. 800.202. A sample 
certification may be found on the Committee's section of the Department 
of the Treasury Web site, available at http://www.treas.gov/offices/
international-affairs/cfius/index.shtml.
    (m) Persons filing a voluntary notice shall include with the notice 
a list identifying each document provided as part of the notice, 
including all documents provided as attachments or exhibits to the 
narrative response.


<R05>
Sec. 800.403  Deferral, rejection, or disposition of certain voluntary 
notices.

    (a) The Committee, acting through the Staff Chairperson, may:
    (1) Reject any voluntary notice that does not comply with Sec. 
800.402 and so inform the parties promptly in writing;
    (2) Reject any voluntary notice at any time, and so inform the 
parties promptly in writing, if, after the notice has been submitted and 
before action by the Committee or the President has been concluded:
    (i) There is a material change in the transaction as to which 
notification has been made; or
    (ii) Information comes to light that contradicts material 
information provided in the notice by the parties;
    (3) Reject any voluntary notice at any time after the notice has 
been accepted, and so inform the parties promptly in writing, if the 
party or parties that have submitted the voluntary notice do not provide 
follow-up information requested by the Staff Chairperson within three 
business days of the request, or within a longer time frame if the 
parties so request in writing and the Staff Chairperson grants that 
request in writing; or
    (4) Reject any voluntary notice before the conclusion of a review or 
investigation, and so inform the parties promptly in writing, if one of 
the parties submitting the voluntary notice has not submitted the final 
certification required by Sec. 800.701(d).
    (b) Notwithstanding the authority of the Staff Chairperson under 
paragraph (a) of this section to reject an incomplete notice, the Staff 
Chairperson may defer acceptance of the notice, and the beginning of the 
thirty-day review period, to obtain any information required under this 
section that has not been submitted by the notifying party or parties or 
other parties to the transaction. Where necessary to obtain such 
information, the Staff Chairperson may inform any non-notifying party or 
parties that notice has been filed with respect to a proposed 
transaction involving the party, and request that certain information 
required under this section, as specified by the Staff Chairperson, be 
provided to the Committee within seven days after receipt of the Staff 
Chairperson's request.
    (c) The Staff Chairperson shall notify the parties when the 
Committee has found that the transaction that is the subject of a 
voluntary notice is not a covered transaction.

    Example 1. The Staff Chairperson receives a joint notice from 
Corporation A, a foreign person, and Corporation X, a company that is 
owned and controlled by U.S. nationals, with respect to Corporation A's 
intent to purchase all of the shares of Corporation X. The joint notice 
does not contain any information described under Sec. 
800.402(c)(3)(iii) and (iv) concerning classified materials and products 
or services supplied to the U.S. military services. The Staff 
Chairperson may reject the notice or defer the start of the thirty-day 
review period until the parties have supplied the omitted information.
    Example 2. Same facts as in the first sentence of Example 1, except 
that the joint notice indicates that Corporation A does not intend to 
purchase Corporation X's Division Y, which is engaged in classified work 
for a U.S. Government agency. Corporations A and X notify the Committee 
on the 25th day of the 30-day notice period that Division Y will also be 
acquired by Corporation A. This fact constitutes a material change with 
respect to the transaction as originally notified, and the Staff 
Chairperson may reject the notice.
    Example 3. The Staff Chairperson receives a joint notice by 
Corporation A, a foreign person, and Corporation X, a U.S. business, 
indicating that Corporation A intends to purchase five percent of the 
voting securities of Corporation X. Under the particular facts and 
circumstances presented, the Committee concludes that Corporation A's 
purchase of this interest in Corporation X could not result in foreign 
control of Corporation X. The Staff Chairperson shall advise the parties 
in

[[Page 791]]

writing that the transaction as presented is not subject to section 721.
    Example 4. The Staff Chairperson receives a voluntary notice 
involving the acquisition by Company A, a foreign person, of the entire 
interest in Company X, a U.S. business. The notice mentions the 
involvement of a second foreign person in the transaction, Company B, 
but states that Company B is merely a passive investor in the 
transaction. During the course of the review, the parties provide 
information that clarifies that Company B has the right to appoint two 
members of Company X's board of directors. This information contradicts 
the material assertion in the notice that Company B is a passive 
investor. The Committee may reject this notice without concluding review 
under section 721.

        Subpart E_Committee Procedures: Review and Investigation


<R05>
Sec. 800.501  General.

    (3) Provisions of law, other than section 721 and the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act, provide adequate and appropriate 
authority to protect the national security of the United States.
    (b) During the thirty-day review period or during an investigation,

mitigated; or
    (2) The lead agency recommends, and the Committee concurs, that an 
investigation be undertaken.
    (b) The Committee shall also undertake, after a review of a covered 
transaction under Sec. 800.502, an investigation to determine the

    (1) Is a foreign government-controlled transaction; or
    (2) Would result in control by a foreign person of critical 
infrastructure of or within the United States, if the Committee 
determines that the transaction could impair the national security and 
such impairment has not been mitigated.
    (c) The Committee shall undertake an investigation as described in 
paragraph (b) of this section unless the Chairperson of the Committee 
(or the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury) and the head of any lead 
agency (or his or her delegee at the deputy level or equivalent) 
designated by the Chairperson determine on the basis of the review that 
the covered transaction will not impair the national security of the 
United States.


<R05>
Sec. 800.504  Determination not to undertake an investigation.

Sec. 800.702  Confidentiality.

    (a) Any information or documentary material filed with the Committee 
pursuant to this part, including information or documentary material 
filed pursuant to Sec. 800.401(f), shall be exempt from disclosure 
under 5 U.S.C. 552 and no such information or documentary material may 
be made public, except as may be relevant to any administrative or 
judicial action or proceeding. Nothing in this part shall be construed 
to prevent disclosure to either House of Congress or to any duly 
authorized committee or subcommittee of the Congress, in accordance with 
subsections (b)(3) and (g)(2)(A) of section 721.
    (b) This section shall continue to apply with respect to information

transaction;
    (2) A request to withdraw notice is granted under Sec. 800.507, or 
where notice has been rejected under Sec. 800.403;
    (3) The Committee determines that a notified transaction is not a 
covered transaction; or
    (4) Such information or documentary material was filed pursuant to 
Sec. 800.401(f) and the parties do not subsequently file a notice 
pursuant to Sec. 800.401(a).
    (c) Nothing in paragraph (a) of this section shall be interpreted to 
prohibit the public disclosure by a party of documentary material or 
information that it has filed with the Committee. Any such documentary 
material or information so disclosed may subsequently be reflected in 
the public statements of the Chairperson, who is authorized to 
communicate with the public and the Congress on behalf of the Committee, 
or of the Chairperson's designee.
    (d) The provisions of 50 U.S.C. App. 2155(d) relating to fines and 
imprisonment shall apply with respect to the disclosure of information 
or documentary material filed with the Committee under these 
regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 800.801  Penalties.

    (a) Any person who, after the effective date, intentionally or 
through gross negligence, submits a material misstatement or omission in 
a notice or makes a false certification under Sec. Sec. 800.402(l) or

damages as a reasonable assessment of the harm to the national security 
that could result from a breach of the agreement. Any mitigation 
agreement containing a liquidated damages provision shall include a 
provision specifying that the Committee will consider the severity of 
the breach in deciding whether to seek a lesser amount than that 
stipulated in the contract.
    (d) A determination to impose penalties under paragraph (a) or (b) 
of this section must be made by the named members of the Committee, 
except to the extent delegated by such official. Notice of the penalty,

of the penalty, shall be sent to the penalized party by U.S. mail.
    (e) Upon receiving notice of the imposition of a penalty under 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the penalized party may, within 15 
days of receipt of the notice of the penalty, submit a petition for 
reconsideration to the Staff Chairperson, including a defense, 
justification, or explanation for the penalized conduct. The Committee 
will review the petition and issue a final decision within 15 days of 
receipt of the petition.
    (f) The penalties authorized in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section may be recovered in a civil action brought by the United States

<R05>
Sec. 900.1  Prescription of standards.

    (a) The Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General of the 
United States are issuing the regulations in parts 900-904 of this 
chapter under the authority contained in 31 U.S.C. 3711(d)(2). The 
regulations in this chapter prescribe standards for Federal agency use 
in the administrative collection, offset, compromise, and the suspension 
or termination of collection activity for civil claims for money, funds, 
or property, as defined by 31 U.S.C. 3701(b), unless specific Federal 
agency statutes or regulations apply to such activities or, as provided 
for by Title 11 of the United States Code, when the claims involve 
bankruptcy. Federal agencies include agencies of the executive, 
legislative, and judicial branches of the Government, including 
Government corporations. The regulations in this chapter also prescribe 
standards for referring debts to the Department of Justice for 
litigation. Additional guidance is contained in the Office of Management 
and Budget's Circular A-129 (Revised), ``Policies for Federal Credit 
Programs and Non-Tax Receivables,'' the Department of the Treasury's 
``Managing Federal Receivables,'' and other publications concerning debt 
collection and debt management. These publications are available from 
the Debt Management Services, Financial Management Service, Department 
of the Treasury, 401 14th Street SW., Room 151, Washington, DC 20227.
    (b) Additional rules governing centralized administrative offset and 
the transfer of delinquent debt to the Department of the Treasury 
(Treasury) or Treasury-designated debt collection centers for collection 
(cross-servicing) under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, 
Public Law 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321, 1358 (April 26, 1996), are issued in 
separate regulations by Treasury. Rules governing the use of certain 
debt collection tools created under the Debt Collection Improvement Act 
of 1996, such as administrative wage garnishment, also are issued in 
separate regulations by Treasury. See generally 31 CFR part 285.
    (c) Agencies are not limited to the remedies contained in parts 900-
904 of this chapter and are encouraged to use all authorized remedies, 
including alternative dispute resolution and arbitration, to collect 
civil claims, to the extent that such remedies are not inconsistent with 
the Federal Claims Collection Act, as amended, Public Law 89-508, 80 
Stat. 308 (July 19, 1966), the Debt Collection Act of 1982, Public Law 
97-365, 96 Stat. 1749 (October 25, 1982), the Debt Collection 
Improvement Act of 1996, or other relevant statutes. The regulations in 
this chapter are not intended to impair agencies' common law rights to 
collect debts.
    (d) Standards and policies regarding the classification of debt for 
accounting purposes (for example, write off of uncollectible debt) are 
contained in the Office of Management and Budget's Circular A-129 
(Revised), ``Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax 
Receivables.''


<R05>
Sec. 900.2  Definitions and construction.

    (a) For the purposes of the standards in this chapter, the terms 
``claim'' and ``debt'' are synonymous and interchangeable. They refer to 
an amount of money, funds, or property that has been determined by an 
agency official to be due the United States from any person, 
organization, or entity, except another Federal agency. For the purposes 
of administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716, the terms ``claim'' and 
``debt'' include an amount of money, funds, or property owed by a person 
to a State (including past-due support being enforced by a State), the 
District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin 
Islands, the

[[Page 800]]

Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico.
    (b) A debt is ``delinquent'' if it has not been paid by the date 
specified in the agency's initial written demand for payment or 
applicable agreement or instrument (including a post-delinquency payment 
agreement), unless other satisfactory payment arrangements have been 
made.
    (c) In parts 900-904 of this chapter, words in the plural form shall 
include the singular and vice versa, and words signifying the masculine 
gender shall include the feminine and vice versa. The terms ``includes'' 
and ``including'' do not exclude matters not listed but do include 
matters that are in the same general class.
    (d) Recoupment is a special method for adjusting debts arising under 
the same transaction or occurrence. For example, obligations arising 
under the same contract generally are subject to recoupment.
    (e) For purposes of the standards in this chapter, unless otherwise 
stated, ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the Treasury or the 
Secretary's delegate.


<R05>
Sec. 900.3  Antitrust, fraud, and tax and interagency claims excluded.

    (a) The standards in parts 900-904 of this chapter relating to 
compromise, suspension, and termination of collection activity do not 
apply to any debt based in whole or in part on conduct in violation of 
the antitrust laws or to any debt involving fraud, the presentation of a 
false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any party 
having an interest in the claim. Only the Department of Justice has the 
authority to compromise, suspend, or terminate collection activity on 
such claims. The standards in parts 900-904 of this chapter relating to 
the administrative collection of claims do apply, but only to the extent 
authorized by the Department of Justice in a particular case. Upon 
identification of a claim based in whole or in part on conduct in 
violation of the antitrust laws or any claim involving fraud, the 
presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the 
debtor or any party having an interest in the claim, agencies shall 
promptly refer the case to the Department of Justice for action. At its 
discretion, the Department of Justice may return the claim to the 
forwarding agency for further handling in accordance with the standards 
in parts 900-904 of this chapter.
    (b) Parts 900-904 of this chapter do not apply to tax debts.
    (c) Parts 900-904 of this chapter do not apply to claims between 
Federal agencies. Federal agencies should attempt to resolve interagency 
claims by negotiation in accordance with Executive Order 12146 (3 CFR, 
1980 Comp., pp. 409-412).


<R05>
Sec. 900.4  Compromise, waiver, or disposition under other statutes not 
precluded.

    Nothing in parts 900-904 of this chapter precludes agency 
disposition of any claim under statutes and implementing regulations 
other than subchapter II of chapter 37 of Title 31 of the United States 
Code (Claims of the United States Government) and the standards in this 
chapter. See, e.g., the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act, Public Law 
87-693, 76 Stat. 593 (September 25, 1962) (codified at 42 U.S.C. 2651 et 
seq.), and applicable regulations, 28 CFR part 43. In such cases, the 
laws and regulations that are specifically applicable to claims 
collection activities of a particular agency generally take precedence 
over parts 900-904 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 900.5  Form of payment.

    Claims may be paid in the form of money or, when a contractual basis 
exists, the Government may demand the return of specific property or the 
performance of specific services.


<R05>
Sec. 900.6  Subdivision of claims not authorized.

    Debts may not be subdivided to avoid the monetary ceiling 
established by 31 U.S.C. 3711(a)(2). A debtor's liability arising from a 
particular transaction or contract shall be considered a single debt in 
determining whether the debt is one of less than $100,000 (excluding 
interest, penalties, and administrative costs) or such higher amount as 
the Attorney General shall from time to time prescribe for purposes of 
compromise

[[Page 801]]

or suspension or termination of collection activity.


<R05>
Sec. 900.7  Required administrative proceedings.

    Agencies are not required to omit, foreclose, or duplicate 
administrative proceedings required by contract or other laws or 
regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 900.8  No private rights created.

    The standards in this chapter do not create any right or benefit, 
substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by a party 
against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any other 
person, nor shall the failure of an agency to comply with any of the 
provisions of parts 900-904 of this chapter be available to any debtor 
as a defense.

<R05>
Sec. 901.1  Aggressive agency collection activity.

    (a) Federal agencies shall aggressively collect all debts arising 
out of activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services 
to, that agency. Collection activities shall be undertaken promptly with 
follow-up action taken as necessary. Nothing contained in parts 900-904 
of this chapter requires the Department of Justice, Treasury, or other 
Treasury-designated debt collection centers, to duplicate collection 
activities previously undertaken by other agencies or to perform 
collection activities that other agencies should have undertaken.
    (b) Debts referred or transferred to Treasury, or Treasury-
designated debt collection centers under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 
3711(g), shall be serviced, collected, or compromised, or the collection 
action will be suspended or terminated, in accordance with the statutory 
requirements and authorities applicable to the collection of such debts.
    (c) Agencies shall cooperate with one another in their debt 
collection activities.
    (d) Agencies should consider referring debts that are less than 180 
days delinquent to Treasury or to Treasury-designated ``debt collection 
centers'' to accomplish efficient, cost effective debt collection. 
Treasury is a debt collection center, is authorized to designate other 
Federal agencies as debt collection centers based on their performance 
in collecting delinquent debts, and may withdraw such designations. 
Referrals to debt collection centers shall be at the discretion of, and 
for a time period acceptable to, the Secretary. Referrals may be for 
servicing, collection, compromise, suspension, or termination of 
collection action.
    (e) Agencies shall transfer to the Secretary any debt that has been 
delinquent for a period of 180 days or more so that the Secretary may 
take appropriate action to collect the debt or terminate collection 
action. See 31 CFR 285.12 (Transfer of Debts to Treasury for 
Collection). This requirement does not apply to any debt that:
    (1) Is in litigation or foreclosure;
    (2) Will be disposed of under an approved asset sale program;
    (3) Has been referred to a private collection contractor for a 
period of time acceptable to the Secretary;
    (4) Is at a debt collection center for a period of time acceptable 
to the Secretary (see paragraph (d) of this section);
    (5) Will be collected under internal offset procedures within three 
years after the debt first became delinquent; or

[[Page 802]]

    (6) Is exempt from this requirement based on a determination by the 
Secretary that exemption for a certain class of debt is in the best 
interest of the United States. Agencies may request that the Secretary 
exempt specific classes of debts.
    (f) Agencies operating Treasury-designated debt collection centers 
are authorized to charge a fee for services rendered regarding referred 
or transferred debts. The fee may be paid out of amounts collected and 
may be added to the debt as an administrative cost (see Sec. 901.10).


<R05>
Sec. 901.2  Demand for payment.

    (a) Written demand as described in paragraph (b) of this section 
shall be made promptly upon a debtor of the United States in terms that 
inform the debtor of the consequences of failing to cooperate with the 
agency to resolve the debt. The specific content, timing, and number of 
demand letters shall depend upon the type and amount of the debt and the 
debtor's response, if any, to the agency's letters or telephone calls. 
Generally, one demand letter should suffice. In determining the timing 
of the demand letter(s), agencies should give due regard to the need to 
refer debts promptly to the Department of Justice for litigation, in 
accordance with Sec. 904.1 of this chapter or otherwise. When necessary 
to protect the Government's interest (for example, to prevent the 
running of a statute of limitations), written demand may be preceded by 
other appropriate actions under parts 900-904 of this chapter, including 
immediate referral for litigation.
    (b) Demand letters shall inform the debtor of:
    (1) The basis for the indebtedness and the rights, if any, the 
debtor may have to seek review within the agency;
    (2) The applicable standards for imposing any interest, penalties, 
or administrative costs;
    (3) The date by which payment should be made to avoid late charges 
(i.e. interest, penalties, and administrative costs) and enforced 
collection, which generally should not be more than 30 days from the 
date that the demand letter is mailed or hand-delivered; and
    (4) The name, address, and phone number of a contact person or 
office within the agency.
    (c) Agencies should exercise care to ensure that demand letters are 
mailed or hand-delivered on the same day that they are dated. There is 
no prescribed format for demand letters. Agencies should utilize demand 
letters and procedures that will lead to the earliest practicable 
determination of whether the debt can be resolved administratively or 
must be referred for litigation.
    (d) Agencies should include in demand letters such items as the 
agency's willingness to discuss alternative methods of payment; its 
policies with respect to the use of credit bureaus, debt collection 
centers, and collection agencies; the agency's remedies to enforce 
payment of the debt (including assessment of interest, administrative 
costs and penalties, administrative garnishment, the use of collection 
agencies, Federal salary offset, tax refund offset, administrative 
offset, and litigation); the requirement that any debt delinquent for 
more than 180 days be transferred to the Department of the Treasury for 
collection; and, depending on applicable statutory authority, the 
debtor's entitlement to consideration of a waiver.
    (e) Agencies should respond promptly to communications from debtors, 
within 30 days whenever feasible, and should advise debtors who dispute 
debts to furnish available evidence to support their contentions.
    (f) Prior to the initiation of the demand process or at any time 
during or after completion of the demand process, if an agency 
determines to pursue, or is required to pursue, offset, the procedures 
applicable to offset should be followed (see Sec. 901.3). The 
availability of funds or money for debt satisfaction by offset and the 
agency's determination to pursue collection by offset shall release the 
agency from the necessity of further compliance with paragraphs (a), 
(b), (c), and (d) of this section.
    (g) Prior to referring a debt for litigation, agencies should advise 
each person determined to be liable for the debt that, unless the debt 
can be collected administratively, litigation may be initiated. This 
notification should

[[Page 803]]

comply with Executive Order 12988 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp., pp. 157-163) and 
may be given as part of a demand letter under paragraph (b) of this 
section or in a separate document. Litigation counsel for the Government 
should be advised that this notice has been given.
    (h) When an agency learns that a bankruptcy petition has been filed 
with respect to a debtor, before proceeding with further collection 
action, the agency should immediately seek legal advice from its agency 
counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code on any pending or 
contemplated collection activities. Unless the agency determines that 
the automatic stay imposed at the time of filing pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 
362 has been lifted or is no longer in effect, in most cases collection 
activity against the debtor should stop immediately.
    (1) After seeking legal advice, a proof of claim should be filed in 
most cases with the bankruptcy court or the Trustee. Agencies should 
refer to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 106 relating to the consequences on 
sovereign immunity of filing a proof of claim.
    (2) If the agency is a secured creditor, it may seek relief from the 
automatic stay regarding its security, subject to the provisions and 
requirements of 11 U.S.C. 362.
    (3) Offset is stayed in most cases by the automatic stay. However, 
agencies should seek legal advice from their agency counsel to determine 
whether their payments to the debtor and payments of other agencies 
available for offset may be frozen by the agency until relief from the 
automatic stay can be obtained from the bankruptcy court. Agencies also 
should seek legal advice from their agency counsel to determine whether 
recoupment is available.


<R05>
Sec. 901.3  Collection by administrative offset.

    (a) Scope. (1) The term ``administrative offset'' has the meaning 
provided in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1).
    (2) This section does not apply to:
    (i) Debts arising under the Social Security Act, except as provided 
in 42 U.S.C. 404;
    (ii) Payments made under the Social Security Act, except as provided 
for in 31 U.S.C. 3716(c) (see 31 CFR 285.4, Federal Benefit Offset);
    (iii) Debts arising under, or payments made under, the Internal 
Revenue Code (see 31 CFR 285.2, Tax Refund Offset) or the tariff laws of 
the United States;
    (iv) Offsets against Federal salaries to the extent these standards 
are inconsistent with regulations published to implement such offsets 
under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716 (see 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, 
and 31 CFR 285.7, Federal Salary Offset);
    (v) Offsets under 31 U.S.C. 3728 against a judgment obtained by a 
debtor against the United States;
    (vi) Offsets or recoupments under common law, State law, or Federal 
statutes specifically prohibiting offsets or recoupments of particular 
types of debts; or
    (vii) Offsets in the course of judicial proceedings, including 
bankruptcy.
    (3) Unless otherwise provided for by contract or law, debts or 
payments that are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 
3716 may be collected by administrative offset under the common law or 
other applicable statutory authority.
    (4) Unless otherwise provided by law, administrative offset of 
payments under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3716 to collect a debt may not 
be conducted more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect 
the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right 
to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been 
known by the official or officials of the Government who were charged 
with the responsibility to discover and collect such debts. This 
limitation does not apply to debts reduced to a judgment.
    (5) In bankruptcy cases, agencies should seek legal advice from 
their agency counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, 
particularly 11 U.S.C. 106, 362, and 553, on pending or contemplated 
collections by offset.
    (b) Mandatory centralized administrative offset. (1) Creditor 
agencies are required to refer past due, legally enforceable nontax 
debts which are over 180 days delinquent to the Secretary for collection 
by centralized administrative offset. Debts which are less than 180 days 
delinquent also may be

[[Page 804]]

referred to the Secretary for this purpose. See Sec. 901.3(b)(5) for 
debt certification requirements.
    (2) The names and taxpayer identifying numbers (TINs) of debtors who 
owe debts referred to the Secretary as described in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section shall be compared to the names and TINs on payments to be 
made by Federal disbursing officials. Federal disbursing officials 
include disbursing officials of Treasury, the Department of Defense, the 
United States Postal Service, other Government corporations, and 
disbursing officials of the United States designated by the Secretary. 
When the name and TIN of a debtor match the name and TIN of a payee and 
all other requirements for offset have been met, the payment will be 
offset to satisfy the debt.
    (3) Federal disbursing officials will notify the debtor/payee in 
writing that an offset has occurred to satisfy, in part or in full, a 
past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt. The notice shall include 
a description of the type and amount of the payment from which the 
offset was taken, the amount of offset that was taken, the identity of 
the creditor agency requesting the offset, and a contact point within 
the creditor agency who will respond to questions regarding the offset.
    (4)(i) Before referring a delinquent debt to the Secretary for 
administrative offset, agencies must have prescribed administrative 
offset regulations consistent with this section or have adopted this 
section without change by cross-reference.
    (ii) Such regulations shall provide that offsets may be initiated 
only after the debtor:
    (A) Has been sent written notice of the type and amount of the debt, 
the intention of the agency to use administrative offset to collect the 
debt, and an explanation of the debtor's rights under 31 U.S.C. 3716; 
and
    (B) The debtor has been given:
    (1) The opportunity to inspect and copy agency records related to 
the debt;
    (2) The opportunity for a review within the agency of the 
determination of indebtedness; and
    (3) The opportunity to make a written agreement to repay the debt.
    (iii) Agency regulations may provide for the omission of the 
procedures set forth in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section when:
    (A) The offset is in the nature of a recoupment;
    (B) The debt arises under a contract as set forth in Cecile 
Industries, Inc. v. Cheney, 995 F.2d 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (notice and 
other procedural protections set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) do not 
supplant or restrict established procedures for contractual offsets 
accommodated by the Contracts Disputes Act); or
    (C) In the case of non-centralized administrative offsets conducted 
under paragraph (c) of this section, the agency first learns of the 
existence of the amount owed by the debtor when there is insufficient 
time before payment would be made to the debtor/payee to allow for prior 
notice and an opportunity for review. When prior notice and an 
opportunity for review are omitted, the agency shall give the debtor 
such notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable and 
shall promptly refund any money ultimately found not to have been owed 
to the Government.
    (iv) When an agency previously has given a debtor any of the 
required notice and review opportunities with respect to a particular 
debt (see, e.g., Sec. 901.2), the agency need not duplicate such notice 
and review opportunities before administrative offset may be initiated.
    (5) Agencies referring delinquent debts to the Secretary must 
certify, in a form acceptable to the Secretary, that:
    (i) The debt(s) is (are) past due and legally enforceable; and
    (ii) The agency has complied with all due process requirements under 
31 U.S.C. 3716(a) and the agency's regulations.
    (6) Payments that are prohibited by law from being offset are exempt 
from centralized administrative offset. The Secretary shall exempt 
payments under means-tested programs from centralized administrative 
offset when requested in writing by the head of the payment certifying 
or authorizing agency. Also, the Secretary may exempt other classes of 
payments from

[[Page 805]]

centralized offset upon the written request of the head of the payment 
certifying or authorizing agency.
    (7) Benefit payments made under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
301 et seq.), part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 921 et 
seq.), and any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (other 
than tier 2 benefits), may be offset only in accordance with Treasury 
regulations, issued in consultation with the Social Security 
Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board, and the Office of 
Management and Budget. See 31 CFR 285.4.
    (8) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(f), the Secretary may waive 
the provisions of the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 
1988 concerning matching agreements and post-match notification and 
verification (5 U.S.C. 552a(o) and (p)) for centralized administrative 
offset upon receipt of a certification from a creditor agency that the 
due process requirements enumerated in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) have been met. 
The certification of a debt in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section will satisfy this requirement. If such a waiver is granted, only 
the Data Integrity Board of the Department of the Treasury is required 
to oversee any matching activities, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 
3716(g). This waiver authority does not apply to offsets conducted under 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
    (c) Non-centralized administrative offset. (1) Generally, non-
centralized administrative offsets are ad hoc case-by-case offsets that 
an agency conducts, at the agency's discretion, internally or in 
cooperation with the agency certifying or authorizing payments to the 
debtor. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, when centralized 
administrative offset is not available or appropriate, past due, legally 
enforceable nontax delinquent debts may be collected through non-
centralized administrative offset. In these cases, a creditor agency may 
make a request directly to a payment authorizing agency to offset a 
payment due a debtor to collect a delinquent debt. For example, it may 
be appropriate for a creditor agency to request that the Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) offset a Federal employee's lump sum payment 
upon leaving Government service to satisfy an unpaid advance.
    (2) Before requesting a payment authorizing agency to conduct a non-
centralized administrative offset, agencies must adopt regulations 
providing that such offsets may occur only after:
    (i) The debtor has been provided due process as set forth in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and
    (ii) The payment authorizing agency has received written 
certification from the creditor agency that the debtor owes the past 
due, legally enforceable delinquent debt in the amount stated, and that 
the creditor agency has fully complied with its regulations concerning 
administrative offset.
    (3) Payment authorizing agencies shall comply with offset requests 
by creditor agencies to collect debts owed to the United States, unless 
the offset would not be in the best interests of the United States with 
respect to the program of the payment authorizing agency, or would 
otherwise be contrary to law. Appropriate use should be made of the 
cooperative efforts of other agencies in effecting collection by 
administrative offset.
    (4) When collecting multiple debts by non-centralized administrative 
offset, agencies should apply the recovered amounts to those debts in 
accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined 
by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, particularly the 
applicable statute of limitations.
    (d) Requests to OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future 
benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. 
Upon providing OPM written certification that a debtor has been afforded 
the procedures provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, creditor 
agencies may request OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future 
benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund 
(Fund) in accordance with regulations codified at 5 CFR 831.1801-
831.1808. Upon receipt of such a request, OPM will identify and ``flag'' 
a debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests, 
or becomes eligible to receive, payments from the Fund. This will 
satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to the expiration 
of

[[Page 806]]

the time limitations referenced in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (e) Review requirements. (1) For purposes of this section, whenever 
an agency is required to afford a debtor a review within the agency, the 
agency shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an 
oral hearing when the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and 
the agency determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be 
resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the 
validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity.
    (2) Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this 
section is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although the 
agency should carefully document all significant matters discussed at 
the hearing.
    (3) This section does not require an oral hearing with respect to 
debt collection systems in which a determination of indebtedness rarely 
involves issues of credibility or veracity and the agency has determined 
that review of the written record is ordinarily an adequate means to 
correct prior mistakes.
    (4) In those cases when an oral hearing is not required by this 
section, an agency shall accord the debtor a ``paper hearing,'' that is, 
a determination of the request for reconsideration based upon a review 
of the written record.


<R05>
Sec. 901.4  Reporting debts.

    (a) Agencies shall develop and implement procedures for reporting 
delinquent debts to credit bureaus and other automated databases. 
Agencies also may develop procedures to report non-delinquent debts to 
credit bureaus. See 31 U.S.C. 3711(e).
    (1) In developing procedures for reporting debts to credit bureaus, 
agencies shall comply with the Bankruptcy Code and the Privacy Act of 
1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended. The provisions of the Privacy Act do 
not apply to credit bureaus.
    (2) Agency procedures for reporting delinquent consumer debts to 
credit bureaus shall be consistent with the due process and other 
requirements contained in 31 U.S.C. 3711(e). When an agency has given a 
debtor any of the required notice and review opportunities with respect 
to a particular debt, the agency need not duplicate such notice and 
review opportunities before reporting that delinquent consumer debt to 
credit bureaus.
    (b) Agencies should report delinquent debts to the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development's Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response 
System (CAIVRS). For information about the CAIVRS program, agencies 
should contact the Director of Information Resources Management Policy 
and Management Division, Office of Information Technology, Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, 451 7th Street, SW., Washington, DC 
20410.


<R05>
Sec. 901.5  Contracting with private collection contractors and with 
entities that locate and recover unclaimed assets.

    (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, 
Federal agencies may contract with private collection contractors, as 
defined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(f), to recover delinquent debts provided that:
    (1) Agencies retain the authority to resolve disputes, compromise 
debts, suspend or terminate collection activity, and refer debts for 
litigation;
    (2) The private collection contractor is not allowed to offer the 
debtor, as an incentive for payment, the opportunity to pay the debt 
less the private collection contractor's fee unless the agency has 
granted such authority prior to the offer;
    (3) The contract provides that the private collection contractor is 
subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 to the extent specified in 5 U.S.C. 
552a(m), and to applicable Federal and state laws and regulations 
pertaining to debt collection practices, including but not limited to 
the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692; and
    (4) The private collection contractor is required to account for all 
amounts collected.
    (b) Agencies shall use government-wide debt collection contracts to 
obtain debt collection services provided by private collection 
contractors. However, agencies may refer debts to private collection 
contractors pursuant to a contract between the agency and the private 
collection contractor only if

[[Page 807]]

such debts are not subject to the requirement to transfer debts to 
Treasury for debt collection. See 31 U.S.C. 3711(g); 31 CFR 285.12(e).
    (c) Agencies may fund private collection contractor contracts in 
accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718(d), or as otherwise permitted by law.
    (d) Agencies may enter into contracts for locating and recovering 
assets of the United States, such as unclaimed assets. Agencies must 
establish procedures that are acceptable to the Secretary before 
entering into contracts to recover assets of the United States held by a 
state government or a financial institution.
    (e) Agencies may enter into contracts for debtor asset and income 
search reports. In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718(d), such contracts may 
provide that the fee a contractor charges the agency for such services 
may be payable from the amounts recovered, unless otherwise prohibited 
by statute.


<R05>
Sec. 901.6  Suspension or revocation of eligibility for loans and loan 
guaranties, licenses, permits, or privileges.

    (a) Unless waived by the head of the agency, agencies are not 
permitted to extend financial assistance in the form of a loan, loan 
guarantee, or loan insurance to any person delinquent on a nontax debt 
owed to a Federal agency. This prohibition does not apply to disaster 
loans. The authority to waive the application of this section may be 
delegated to the Chief Financial Officer and redelegated only to the 
Deputy Chief Financial Officer of the agency. Agencies may extend credit 
after the delinquency has been resolved. The Secretary may exempt 
classes of debts from this prohibition and has prescribed standards 
defining when a ``delinquency'' is ``resolved'' for purposes of this 
prohibition. See 31 CFR 285.13 (Barring Delinquent Debtors From 
Obtaining Federal Loans or Loan Insurance or Guarantees).
    (b) In non-bankruptcy cases, agencies seeking the collection of 
statutory penalties, forfeitures, or other types of claims should 
consider the suspension or revocation of licenses, permits, or other 
privileges for any inexcusable or willful failure of a debtor to pay 
such a debt in accordance with the agency's regulations or governing 
procedures. The debtor should be advised in the agency's written demand 
for payment of the agency's ability to suspend or revoke licenses, 
permits, or privileges. Any agency making, guaranteeing, insuring, 
acquiring, or participating in, loans should consider suspending or 
disqualifying any lender, contractor, or broker from doing further 
business with the agency or engaging in programs sponsored by the agency 
if such lender, contractor, or broker fails to pay its debts to the 
Government within a reasonable time or if such lender, contractor, or 
broker has been suspended, debarred, or disqualified from participation 
in a program or activity by another Federal agency. The failure of any 
surety to honor its obligations in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9305 should 
be reported to the Treasury. The Treasury will forward to all interested 
agencies notification that a surety's certificate of authority to do 
business with the Government has been revoked by the Treasury.
    (c) The suspension or revocation of licenses, permits, or privileges 
also should extend to Federal programs or activities that are 
administered by the states on behalf of the Federal Government, to the 
extent that they affect the Federal Government's ability to collect 
money or funds owed by debtors. Therefore, states that manage Federal 
activities, pursuant to approval from the agencies, should ensure that 
appropriate steps are taken to safeguard against issuing licenses, 
permits, or privileges to debtors who fail to pay their debts to the 
Federal Government.
    (d) In bankruptcy cases, before advising the debtor of an agency's 
intention to suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or privileges, 
agencies should seek legal advice from their agency counsel concerning 
the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 362 and 525, 
which may restrict such action.


<R05>
Sec. 901.7  Liquidation of collateral.

    (a) Agencies should liquidate security or collateral through the 
exercise of a power of sale in the security instrument or a nonjudicial 
foreclosure, and apply the proceeds to the applicable debt(s), if the 
debtor fails to pay

[[Page 808]]

the debt(s) within a reasonable time after demand and if such action is 
in the best interest of the United States. Collection from other 
sources, including liquidation of security or collateral, is not a 
prerequisite to requiring payment by a surety, insurer, or guarantor 
unless such action is expressly required by statute or contract.
    (b) When an agency learns that a bankruptcy petition has been filed 
with respect to a debtor, the agency should seek legal advice from its 
agency counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, including, 
but not limited to, 11 U.S.C. 362, to determine the applicability of the 
automatic stay and the procedures for obtaining relief from such stay 
prior to proceeding under paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 901.8  Collection in installments.

    (a) Whenever feasible, agencies shall collect the total amount of a 
debt in one lump sum. If a debtor is financially unable to pay a debt in 
one lump sum, agencies may accept payment in regular installments. 
Agencies should obtain financial statements from debtors who represent 
that they are unable to pay in one lump sum and independently verify 
such representations whenever possible (see Sec. 902.2(g) of this 
chapter). Agencies that agree to accept payments in regular installments 
should obtain a legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor 
that specifies all of the terms of the arrangement and that contains a 
provision accelerating the debt in the event of default.
    (b) The size and frequency of installment payments should bear a 
reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to 
pay. If possible, the installment payments should be sufficient in size 
and frequency to liquidate the debt in three years or less.
    (c) Security for deferred payments should be obtained in appropriate 
cases. Agencies may accept installment payments notwithstanding the 
refusal of the debtor to execute a written agreement or to give 
security, at the agency's option.


<R05>
Sec. 901.9  Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this 
section, agencies shall charge interest, penalties, and administrative 
costs on debts owed to the United States pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717. An 
agency shall mail or hand-deliver a written notice to the debtor, at the 
debtor's most recent address available to the agency, explaining the 
agency's requirements concerning these charges except where these 
requirements are included in a contractual or repayment agreement. These 
charges shall continue to accrue until the debt is paid in full or 
otherwise resolved through compromise, termination, or waiver of the 
charges.
    (b) Agencies shall charge interest on debts owed the United States 
as follows:
    (1) Interest shall accrue from the date of delinquency, or as 
otherwise provided by law.
    (2) Unless otherwise established in a contract, repayment agreement, 
or by statute, the rate of interest charged shall be the rate 
established annually by the Secretary in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. 
Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717, an agency may charge a higher rate of 
interest if it reasonably determines that a higher rate is necessary to 
protect the rights of the United States. The agency should document the 
reason(s) for its determination that the higher rate is necessary.
    (3) The rate of interest, as initially charged, shall remain fixed 
for the duration of the indebtedness. When a debtor defaults on a 
repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, the agency 
may require payment of interest at a new rate that reflects the current 
value of funds to the Treasury at the time the new agreement is 
executed. Interest shall not be compounded, that is, interest shall not 
be charged on interest, penalties, or administrative costs required by 
this section. If, however, a debtor defaults on a previous repayment 
agreement, charges that accrued but were not collected under the 
defaulted agreement shall be added to the principal under the new 
repayment agreement.

[[Page 809]]

    (c) Agencies shall assess administrative costs incurred for 
processing and handling delinquent debts. The calculation of 
administrative costs should be based on actual costs incurred or upon 
estimated costs as determined by the assessing agency.
    (d) Unless otherwise established in a contract, repayment agreement, 
or by statute, agencies shall charge a penalty, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 
3717(e)(2), not to exceed six percent a year on the amount due on a debt 
that is delinquent for more than 90 days. This charge shall accrue from 
the date of delinquency.
    (e) Agencies may increase an ``administrative debt'' by the cost of 
living adjustment in lieu of charging interest and penalties under this 
section. ``Administrative debt'' includes, but is not limited to, a debt 
based on fines, penalties, and overpayments, but does not include a debt 
based on the extension of Government credit, such as those arising from 
loans and loan guaranties. The cost of living adjustment is the 
percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of 
the calendar year preceding the adjustment exceeds the Consumer Price 
Index for the month of June of the calendar year in which the debt was 
determined or last adjusted. Increases to administrative debts shall be 
computed annually. Agencies should use this alternative only when there 
is a legitimate reason to do so, such as when calculating interest and 
penalties on a debt would be extremely difficult because of the age of 
the debt.
    (f) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts 
received by the Government shall be applied first to any contingency 
fees added to the debt, second to outstanding penalties, third to 
administrative costs other than contingency fees, fourth to interest, 
and last to principal. For purposes of this paragraph (f), ``contingency 
fees'' are administrative costs resulting from fees paid by a Federal 
agency to other Federal agencies or private collection contractors for 
collection services rendered when the fees are paid from the amounts 
collected from a debtor.
    (g) Agencies shall waive the collection of interest and 
administrative costs imposed pursuant to this section on the portion of 
the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest 
began to accrue. Agencies may extend this 30-day period on a case-by-
case basis. In addition, agencies may waive interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs charged under this section, in whole or in part, 
without regard to the amount of the debt, either under the criteria set 
forth in these standards for the compromise of debts, or if the agency 
determines that collection of these charges is against equity and good 
conscience or is not in the best interest of the United States.
    (h) Agencies shall set forth in their regulations the circumstances 
under which interest and related charges will not be imposed for periods 
during which collection activity has been suspended pending agency 
review.
    (i) Agencies are authorized to impose interest and related charges 
on debts not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717, in accordance with the common 
law.

[65 FR 70396, Nov. 22, 2000, as amended at 73 FR 12274, Mar. 7, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 901.10  Analysis of costs.

    Agency collection procedures should provide for periodic comparison 
of costs incurred and amounts collected. Data on costs and corresponding 
recovery rates for debts of different types and in various dollar ranges 
should be used to compare the cost effectiveness of alternative 
collection techniques, establish guidelines with respect to points at 
which costs of further collection efforts are likely to exceed 
recoveries, assist in evaluating offers in compromise, and establish 
minimum debt amounts below which collection efforts need not be taken.


<R05>
Sec. 901.11  Use and disclosure of mailing addresses.

    (a) When attempting to locate a debtor in order to collect or 
compromise a debt under parts 900-904 of this chapter or other 
authority, agencies may send a request to the Secretary (or designee) to 
obtain a debtor's mailing address from the records of the Internal 
Revenue Service.

[[Page 810]]

    (b) Agencies are authorized to use mailing addresses obtained under 
paragraph (a) of this section to enforce collection of a delinquent debt 
and may disclose such mailing addresses to other agencies and to 
collection agencies for collection purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 901.12  Exemptions.

    (a) The preceding sections of this part, to the extent they reflect 
remedies or procedures prescribed by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and 
the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, such as administrative 
offset, use of credit bureaus, contracting for collection agencies, and 
interest and related charges, do not apply to debts arising under, or 
payments made under, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 
U.S.C. 1 et seq.); the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), 
except to the extent provided under 42 U.S.C. 404 and 31 U.S.C. 3716(c); 
or the tariff laws of the United States. These remedies and procedures, 
however, may be authorized with respect to debts that are exempt from 
the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the Debt Collection Improvement Act 
of 1996, to the extent that they are authorized under some other statute 
or the common law.
    (b) This section should not be construed as prohibiting the use of 
these authorities or requirements when collecting debts owed by persons 
employed by agencies administering the laws cited in paragraph (a) of 
this section unless the debt arose under those laws.

<R05>
Sec. 902.1  Scope and application.

    (a) The standards set forth in this part apply to the compromise of 
debts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711. An agency may exercise such compromise 
authority for debts arising out of activities of, or referred or 
transferred for collection services to, that agency when the amount of 
the debt then due, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative 
costs, does not exceed $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the 
Attorney General. Agency heads may designate officials within their 
respective agencies to exercise the authorities in this section.
    (b) Unless otherwise provided by law, when the principal balance of 
a debt, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, 
exceeds $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney 
General, the authority to accept the compromise rests with the 
Department of Justice. The agency should evaluate the compromise offer, 
using the factors set forth in this part. If an offer to compromise any 
debt in excess of $100,000 is acceptable to the agency, the agency shall 
refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating 
division in the Department of Justice using a Claims Collection 
Litigation Report (CCLR). Agencies may obtain the CCLR from the 
Department of Justice's National Central Intake Facility. The referral 
shall include appropriate financial information and a recommendation for 
the acceptance of the compromise offer. Justice Department approval is 
not required if the agency rejects a compromise offer.


<R05>
Sec. 902.2  Bases for compromise.

    (a) Agencies may compromise a debt if the Government cannot collect 
the full amount because:
    (1) The debtor is unable to pay the full amount in a reasonable 
time, as verified through credit reports or other financial information;
    (2) The Government is unable to collect the debt in full within a 
reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings;
    (3) The cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced 
collection of the full amount; or

[[Page 811]]

    (4) There is significant doubt concerning the Government's ability 
to prove its case in court.
    (b) In determining the debtor's inability to pay, agencies should 
consider relevant factors such as the following:
    (1) Age and health of the debtor;
    (2) Present and potential income;
    (3) Inheritance prospects;
    (4) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly 
transferred by the debtor; and
    (5) The availability of assets or income that may be realized by 
enforced collection proceedings.
    (c) Agencies should verify the debtor's claim of inability to pay by 
using a credit report and other financial information as provided in 
paragraph (g) of this section. Agencies should consider the applicable 
exemptions available to the debtor under state and Federal law in 
determining the Government's ability to enforce collection. Agencies 
also may consider uncertainty as to the price that collateral or other 
property will bring at a forced sale in determining the Government's 
ability to enforce collection. A compromise effected under this section 
should be for an amount that bears a reasonable relation to the amount 
that can be recovered by enforced collection procedures, with regard to 
the exemptions available to the debtor and the time that collection will 
take.
    (d) If there is significant doubt concerning the Government's 
ability to prove its case in court for the full amount claimed, either 
because of the legal issues involved or because of a bona fide dispute 
as to the facts, then the amount accepted in compromise of such cases 
should fairly reflect the probabilities of successful prosecution to 
judgment, with due regard given to the availability of witnesses and 
other evidentiary support for the Government's claim. In determining the 
litigative risks involved, agencies should consider the probable amount 
of court costs and attorney fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice 
Act, 28 U.S.C. 2412, that may be imposed against the Government if it is 
unsuccessful in litigation.
    (e) Agencies may compromise a debt if the cost of collecting the 
debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount. The 
amount accepted in compromise in such cases may reflect an appropriate 
discount for the administrative and litigative costs of collection, with 
consideration given to the time it will take to effect collection. 
Collection costs may be a substantial factor in the settlement of small 
debts. In determining whether the cost of collecting justifies enforced 
collection of the full amount, agencies should consider whether 
continued collection of the debt, regardless of cost, is necessary to 
further an enforcement principle, such as the Government's willingness 
to pursue aggressively defaulting and uncooperative debtors.
    (f) Agencies generally should not accept compromises payable in 
installments. This is not an advantageous form of compromise in terms of 
time and administrative expense. If, however, payment of a compromise in 
installments is necessary, agencies should obtain a legally enforceable 
written agreement providing that, in the event of default, the full 
original principal balance of the debt prior to compromise, less sums 
paid thereon, is reinstated. Whenever possible, agencies also should 
obtain security for repayment in the manner set forth in part 901 of 
this chapter.
    (g) To assess the merits of a compromise offer based in whole or in 
part on the debtor's inability to pay the full amount of a debt within a 
reasonable time, agencies should obtain a current financial statement 
from the debtor, executed under penalty of perjury, showing the debtor's 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Agencies also may obtain 
credit reports or other financial information to assess compromise 
offers. Agencies may use their own financial information form or may 
request suitable forms from the Department of Justice or the local 
United States Attorney's Office.


<R05>
Sec. 902.3  Enforcement policy.

    Pursuant to this part, agencies may compromise statutory penalties, 
forfeitures, or claims established as an aid to enforcement and to 
compel compliance, if the agency's enforcement policy in terms of 
deterrence and securing compliance, present and future, will be

[[Page 812]]

adequately served by the agency's acceptance of the sum to be agreed 
upon.


<R05>
Sec. 902.4  Joint and several liability.

    (a) When two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, 
agencies should pursue collection activity against all debtors, as 
appropriate. Agencies should not attempt to allocate the burden of 
payment between the debtors but should proceed to liquidate the 
indebtedness as quickly as possible.
    (b) Agencies should ensure that a compromise agreement with one 
debtor does not release the agency's claim against the remaining 
debtors. The amount of a compromise with one debtor shall not be 
considered a precedent or binding in determining the amount that will be 
required from other debtors jointly and severally liable on the claim.


<R05>
Sec. 902.5  Further review of compromise offers.

    If an agency is uncertain whether to accept a firm, written, 
substantive compromise offer on a debt that is within the agency's 
delegated compromise authority, it may refer the offer to the Civil 
Division or other appropriate litigating division in the Department of 
Justice, using a CCLR accompanied by supporting data and particulars 
concerning the debt. The Department of Justice may act upon such an 
offer or return it to the agency with instructions or advice.


<R05>
Sec. 902.6  Consideration of tax consequences to the Government.

    In negotiating a compromise, agencies should consider the tax 
consequences to the Government. In particular, agencies should consider 
requiring a waiver of tax-loss-carry-forward and tax-loss-carry-back 
rights of the debtor. For information on discharge of indebtedness 
reporting requirements see Sec. 903.5 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 902.7  Mutual releases of the debtor and the Government.

    In all appropriate instances, a compromise that is accepted by an 
agency should be implemented by means of a mutual release, in which the 
debtor is released from further non-tax liability on the compromised 
debt in consideration of payment in full of the compromise amount and 
the Government and its officials, past and present, are released and 
discharged from any and all claims and causes of action arising from the 
same transaction that the debtor may have. In the event a mutual release 
is not executed when a debt is compromised, unless prohibited by law, 
the debtor is still deemed to have waived any and all claims and causes 
of action against the Government and its officials related to the 
transaction giving rise to the compromised debt.

Sec.
903.1 Scope and application.
903.2 Suspension of collection activity.
903.3 Termination of collection activity.
903.4 Exception to termination.
903.5 Discharge of indebtedness; reporting requirements.

    Authority: 31 U.S.C. 3711.

    Source: 65 FR 70403, Nov. 22, 2000, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 903.1  Scope and application.

    (a) The standards set forth in this part apply to the suspension or 
termination of collection activity pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711 on debts 
that do not exceed $100,000, or such other amount as the Attorney 
General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative 
costs, after deducting the amount of partial payments or collections, if 
any. Prior to referring a debt to the Department of Justice for 
litigation, agencies may suspend or terminate collection under this part 
with respect to debts arising out of activities of, or referred or 
transferred for collection services to, that agency.
    (b) If, after deducting the amount of any partial payments or 
collections, the principal amount of a debt exceeds $100,000, or such 
other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, 
penalties, and administrative costs, the authority to suspend or 
terminate rests solely with the Department of Justice. If the agency 
believes that suspension or termination of any

[[Page 813]]

debt in excess of $100,000 may be appropriate, the agency shall refer 
the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division 
in the Department of Justice, using the CCLR. The referral should 
specify the reasons for the agency's recommendation. If, prior to 
referral to the Department of Justice, an agency determines that a debt 
is plainly erroneous or clearly without legal merit, the agency may 
terminate collection activity regardless of the amount involved without 
obtaining Department of Justice concurrence.


<R05>
Sec. 903.2  Suspension of collection activity.

    (a) Agencies may suspend collection activity on a debt when:
    (1) The agency cannot locate the debtor;
    (2) The debtor's financial condition is expected to improve; or
    (3) The debtor has requested a waiver or review of the debt.
    (b) Based on the current financial condition of the debtor, agencies 
may suspend collection activity on a debt when the debtor's future 
prospects justify retention of the debt for periodic review and 
collection activity and:
    (1) The applicable statute of limitations has not expired; or
    (2) Future collection can be effected by administrative offset, 
notwithstanding the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations 
for litigation of claims, with due regard to the 10-year limitation for 
administrative offset prescribed by 31 U.S.C. 3716(e)(1); or
    (3) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the amount of the debt on 
which collection will be suspended, and such suspension is likely to 
enhance the debtor's ability to pay the full amount of the principal of 
the debt with interest at a later date.
    (c)(1) Agencies shall suspend collection activity during the time 
required for consideration of the debtor's request for waiver or 
administrative review of the debt if the statute under which the request 
is sought prohibits the agency from collecting the debt during that 
time.
    (2) If the statute under which the request is sought does not 
prohibit collection activity pending consideration of the request, 
agencies may use discretion, on a case-by-case basis, to suspend 
collection. Further, an agency ordinarily should suspend collection 
action upon a request for waiver or review if the agency is prohibited 
by statute or regulation from issuing a refund of amounts collected 
prior to agency consideration of the debtor's request. However, an 
agency should not suspend collection when the agency determines that the 
request for waiver or review is frivolous or was made primarily to delay 
collection.
    (d) When an agency learns that a bankruptcy petition has been filed 
with respect to a debtor, in most cases the collection activity on a 
debt must be suspended, pursuant to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 362, 
1201, and 1301, unless the agency can clearly establish that the 
automatic stay has been lifted or is no longer in effect. Agencies 
should seek legal advice immediately from their agency counsel and, if 
legally permitted, take the necessary legal steps to ensure that no 
funds or money are paid by the agency to the debtor until relief from 
the automatic stay is obtained.


<R05>
Sec. 903.3  Termination of collection activity.

    (a) Agencies may terminate collection activity when:
    (1) The agency is unable to collect any substantial amount through 
its own efforts or through the efforts of others;
    (2) The agency is unable to locate the debtor;
    (3) Costs of collection are anticipated to exceed the amount 
recoverable;
    (4) The debt is legally without merit or enforcement of the debt is 
barred by any applicable statute of limitations;
    (5) The debt cannot be substantiated; or
    (6) The debt against the debtor has been discharged in bankruptcy.
    (b) Before terminating collection activity, the agency should have 
pursued all appropriate means of collection and determined, based upon 
the results of the collection activity, that the debt is uncollectible. 
Termination of collection activity ceases active collection of the debt. 
The termination of collection activity does not preclude the agency

[[Page 814]]

from retaining a record of the account for purposes of:
    (1) Selling the debt, if the Secretary determines that such sale is 
in the best interests of the United States;
    (2) Pursuing collection at a subsequent date in the event there is a 
change in the debtor's status or a new collection tool becomes 
available;
    (3) Offsetting against future income or assets not available at the 
time of termination of collection activity; or
    (4) Screening future applicants for prior indebtedness.
    (c) Generally, agencies shall terminate collection activity on a 
debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy, regardless of the amount. 
Agencies may continue collection activity, however, subject to the 
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, for any payments provided under a 
plan of reorganization. Offset and recoupment rights may survive the 
discharge of the debtor in bankruptcy and, under some circumstances, 
claims also may survive the discharge. For example, the claims of an 
agency that it is a known creditor of a debtor may survive a discharge 
if the agency did not receive formal notice of the proceedings. Agencies 
should seek legal advice from their agency counsel if they believe they 
have claims or offsets that may survive the discharge of a debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 903.4  Exception to termination.

    When a significant enforcement policy is involved, or recovery of a 
judgment is a prerequisite to the imposition of administrative 
sanctions, agencies may refer debts for litigation even though 
termination of collection activity may otherwise be appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 903.5  Discharge of indebtedness; reporting requirements.

    (a) Before discharging a delinquent debt (also referred to as a 
close out of the debt), agencies shall take all appropriate steps to 
collect the debt in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(g), including, as 
applicable, administrative offset, tax refund offset, Federal salary 
offset, referral to Treasury, Treasury-designated debt collection 
centers or private collection contractors, credit bureau reporting, wage 
garnishment, litigation, and foreclosure. Discharge of indebtedness is 
distinct from termination or suspension of collection activity under 
part 903 of this title and is governed by the Internal Revenue Code. 
When collection action on a debt is suspended or terminated, the debt 
remains delinquent and further collection action may be pursued at a 
later date in accordance with the standards set forth in this chapter. 
When an agency discharges a debt in full or in part, further collection 
action is prohibited. Therefore, agencies should make the determination 
that collection action is no longer warranted before discharging a debt. 
Before discharging a debt, agencies must terminate debt collection 
action.
    (b) Section 3711(i), title 31, United States Code, requires agencies 
to sell a delinquent nontax debt upon termination of collection action 
if the Secretary determines such a sale is in the best interests of the 
United States. Since the discharge of a debt precludes any further 
collection action (including the sale of a delinquent debt), agencies 
may not discharge a debt until the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3711(i) 
have been met.
    (c) Upon discharge of an indebtedness, agencies must report the 
discharge to the IRS in accordance with the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 
6050P and 26 CFR 1.6050P-1. An agency may request Treasury or Treasury-
designated debt collection centers to file such a discharge report to 
the IRS on the agency's behalf.
    (d) When discharging a debt, agencies must request that litigation 
counsel release any liens of record securing the debt.

<R05>
Sec. 904.1  Prompt referral.

    (a) Agencies shall promptly refer to the Department of Justice for 
litigation debts on which aggressive collection activity has been taken 
in accordance with part 901 of this chapter and that cannot be 
compromised, or on which collection activity cannot be suspended or 
terminated, in accordance with parts 902 and 903 of this chapter. 
Agencies may refer those debts arising out of activities of, or referred 
or transferred for collection services to, that agency. Debts for which 
the principal amount is over $1,000,000, or such other amount as the 
Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest and penalties, shall 
be referred to the Civil Division or other division responsible for 
litigating such debts at the Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. 
Debts for which the principal amount is $1,000,000, or less, or such 
other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest 
or penalties, shall be referred to the Department of Justice's 
Nationwide Central Intake Facility as required by the CCLR instructions. 
Debts should be referred as early as possible, consistent with 
aggressive agency collection activity and the observance of the 
standards contained in parts 900-904 of this chapter, and, in any event, 
well within the period for initiating timely lawsuits against the 
debtors. Agencies shall make every effort to refer delinquent debts to 
the Department of Justice for litigation within one year of the date 
such debts last became delinquent. In the case of guaranteed or insured 
loans, agencies should make every effort to refer these delinquent debts 
to the Department of Justice for litigation within one year from the 
date the loan was presented to the agency for payment or re-insurance.
    (b) The Department of Justice has exclusive jurisdiction over the 
debts referred to it pursuant to this section. The referring agency 
shall immediately terminate the use of any administrative collection 
activities to collect a debt at the time of the referral of that debt to 
the Department of Justice. The agency should advise the Department of 
Justice of the collection activities which have been utilized to date, 
and their result. The referring agency shall refrain from having any 
contact with the debtor and shall direct all debtor inquiries concerning 
the debt to the Department of Justice. The referring agency shall 
immediately notify the Department of Justice of any payments credited by 
the agency to the debtor's account after referral of a debt under this 
section. The Department of Justice shall notify the referring agency, in 
a timely manner, of any payments it receives from the debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 904.2  Claims Collection Litigation Report.

    (a) Unless excepted by the Department of Justice, agencies shall 
complete the CCLR (see Sec. 902.1(b) of this chapter), accompanied by a 
signed Certificate of Indebtedness, to refer all administratively 
uncollectible claims to the Department of Justice for litigation. 
Referring agencies shall complete all of the sections of the CCLR 
appropriate to each claim as required by the CCLR instructions and 
furnish such other information as may be required in specific cases.
    (b) Agencies shall indicate clearly on the CCLR the actions they 
wish the Department of Justice to take with respect to the referred 
claim. The CCLR permits the agency to indicate specifically any of a 
number of litigative activities which the Department of Justice may 
pursue, including enforced collection, judgment lien only, renew 
judgment lien only, renew judgment lien and enforce collection, program 
enforcement, foreclosure only, and foreclosure and deficiency judgment.
    (c) Agencies also shall use the CCLR to refer claims to the 
Department of Justice to obtain approval of any proposals to compromise 
the claims or to suspend or terminate agency collection activity.


<R05>
Sec. 904.3  Preservation of evidence.

    Referring agencies must take care to preserve all files and records 
that may be needed by the Department of Justice to prove their claims in 
court. Agencies ordinarily should include certified copies of the 
documents that form the basis for the claim in the packages referring 
their claims to the Department of Justice for litigation. Agencies shall 
provide originals of such documents

[[Page 816]]

immediately upon request by the Department of Justice.


<R05>
Sec. 904.4  Minimum amount of referrals to the Department of Justice.

    (a) Agencies shall not refer for litigation claims of less than 
$2,500, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, or 
such other amount as the Attorney General shall from time to time 
prescribe. The Department of Justice shall promptly notify referring 
agencies if the Attorney General changes this minimum amount.
    (b) Agencies shall not refer claims of less than the minimum amount 
unless:
    (1) Litigation to collect such smaller claims is important to ensure 
compliance with the agency's policies or programs;
    (2) The claim is being referred solely for the purpose of securing a 
judgment against the debtor, which will be filed as a lien against the 
debtor's property pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 3201 and returned to the 
referring agency for enforcement; or
    (3) The debtor has the clear ability to pay the claim and the 
Government effectively can enforce payment, with due regard for the 
exemptions available to the debtor under state and Federal law and the 
judicial remedies available to the Government.
    (c) Agencies should consult with the Financial Litigation Staff of 
the Executive Office for United States Attorneys in the Department of 
Justice prior to referring claims valued at less than the minimum 
amount.
