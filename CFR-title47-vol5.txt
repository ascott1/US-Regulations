                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2012), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    Distress signal. The distress signal is a digital selective call 
using an internationally recognized distress call format in the bands 
used for terrestrial communication or an internationally recognized 
distress message format, in which case it is relayed through space 
stations, which indicates that a person, ship, aircraft, or other 
vehicle is threatened by grave and imminent danger and requests 
immediate assistance.
    (1) In radiotelephony, the international distress signal consists of 
the enunciation of the word ``Mayday'', pronounced as the French 
expression ``m'aider''. In case of distress, transmission of this 
particular signal is intended to ensure recognition of a radiotelephone 
distress call by stations of any nationality.
    (2) For GMDSS, distress alerts result in an audible alarm and visual 
indication that a ship or person is threatened by grave and imminent 
danger and requests immediate assistance. These automatic systems 
contain sufficient information in the distress alert message to identify 
the vessel, prepare to assist and begin a search. However, except when 
transmitted via satellite EPIRB, the distress alert is just the initial 
call for help. Communication between the vessel or person in distress 
and the Rescue Coordination Center (RCC) or ship assisting should always 
follow.

Sec. 80.57  Canada/U.S.A. channeling arrangement for VHF maritime 
public correspondence.

    (a) Canada/U.S.A. arrangement. Pursuant to arrangements between the 
United States and Canada, assignment of VHF frequencies in the band 156-
162 MHz to public coast stations in certain areas of Washington state, 
the Great Lakes and the east coast of the United States must be made in 
accordance with the provisions of this section.
    (b) Definitions. On the west coast, specific terms are defined as 
follows:
    (1) Inland Waters Public Correspondence Sector. A distinct 
geographical area in which one primary and one supplementary channel is 
allotted. A number of local channels may also be authorized.
    (2) Coastal Waters Public Correspondence Sector. A distinct 
geographical area in which one primary and one supplementary channel is 
allotted. Local channels may also be authorized.
    (3) Inland waters. Inland waters of western Washington and British 
Columbia bounded by 47 degrees latitude on the south, the Canada/U.S.A. 
Coordination Zone Line B on the north, and to the west by 124 degrees 40 
minutes longitude at the west entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
    (4) Coastal waters. Waters along the Pacific Coast of Washington 
state and Vancouver Island within the Canada/U.S.A. Coordination Zone.
    (5) Inland Waters Primary Channel. A channel intended to cover the 
greater portion of an Inland Waters Public Correspondence Sector. It may 
provide some coverage to an adjacent sector but must not provide 
coverage beyond the adjacent sector. Harmful interference beyond the 
adjacent sector must not occur. Only one primary

[[Page 26]]

channel will be authorized in any sector.
    (6) Inland waters of western Washington and British Columbia bounded 
by 46[deg]59[min]59.3[sec] north latitude on the south, the Canada/
U.S.A. Coordination Zone Line B on the south, and to the west by 
124[deg]40[min]4.7[sec] west latitude at the west entrance to the Strait 
of Juan de Fuca.

    Note: All coordinates are referenced to North American Datum 1983 
(NAD83).

    (7) Inland Waters Local Channel. A channel designed to provide local 
coverage of certain bays, inlets and ports where coverage by primary or 
supplementary channels is poor or where heavy traffic loading warrants. 
A local channel must not cause harmful interference to any primary or 
supplementary channels. Coverage must be confined to the designated 
sector.
    (8) Coastal Waters Primary Channel. Same as (5) except for technical 
characteristics.
    (9) Coastal Waters Supplementary Channel. Same as (6) except for 
technical characteristics.
    (10) Coastal Waters Local Channel. Same as (7) except for technical 
characteristics.
    (c) Technical characteristics. On the west coast, technical 
characteristics of public correspondence stations will be as follows:
    (1) Inland Waters Primary and Supplementary Channels. The effective 
radiated power (ERP) must not exceed 60 watts. Antenna height must not 
exceed 152 meters (500 feet) above mean sea level (AMSL) with the 
exceptions noted in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
    (2) Inland Waters Local Channel. ERP must not exceed 8 watts with an 
antenna height of no more than 15 meters (50 feet) AMSL or the ERP must 
not exceed 2 watts with an antenna height of no more than 30 meters (100 
feet) AMSL.
    (3) Coastal Waters Primary and Supplementary Channels. ERP must not 
exceed 125 watts with no antenna restrictions.
    (4) Coastal Waters Local Channel. ERP must not exceed 10 watts with 
a maximum antenna height of 76 meters (250 feet) AMSL.
    (5) Harmful interference will be determined and resolved using the 
definition and procedures of the ITU Radio Regulations.
    (6) To keep the ERP and antenna elevations at a minimum and to limit 
coverage to the desired areas, an informal application may be filed for 
special temporary authority in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.41 and 1.931 
of this chapter to conduct a field survey to obtain necessary data for 
informal application. Such data may accompany the application and be 
used in lieu of theoretical calculations as required in subpart P of 
this part. The Seattle FCC District Office must be notified in advance 
of scheduled tests.
    (d) Canada/U.S.A. channeling arrangement for West Coast VHF maritime 
mobile public correspondence. (1) The provisions of the Canada/U.S. 
channeling arrangement apply to waters of the State of Washington and of 
the Province of British Columbia within the coordination boundaries of 
``Arrangement A'' of the Canada/U.S.A. Frequency Coordination Agreement 
above 30 MHz. In addition, all inland waters as far south as Olympia are 
to be included. A map of these waters is contained in paragraph (d)(6) 
of this section, Figure 1.
    (2) The channeling arrangement applies to the following VHF public 
correspondence channels: Channels 24, 84, 25, 85, 26, 86, 27, 87 and 28.
    (3) Public correspondence stations may be established by either 
country in accordance with the provisions of the arrangements. However, 
there must be an exchange of information prior to the establishment of 
new stations or a change in technical parameters of existing stations. 
Any channel except that used as primary or supplementary channel in a 
given sector is available for use as a local channel in that sector. 
Local channels are not protected from interference caused by primary or 
supplementary channels in adjacent sectors if these stations are in 
compliance with this section.
    (4) Preliminary local Canadian/U.S. coordination is required for all 
applications at variance with this section. This coordination will be in 
accordance with the provisions of Arrangement ``A'' of the Canada/U.S. 
Frequency Coordination Agreement over 30 MHz.

[[Page 27]]

Stations at variance with the arrangement are not protected from 
interference and must not cause interference to existing or future 
stations which are in accordance with the agreement.
    (5) The agreed channeling arrangements for the west coast are as 
follows:

    (2) A certification that the ship has passed an inspection must be 
entered into the ship's log by the inspecting technician. The technician 
conducting the inspection and providing the certification must not be 
the vessel's owner, operator, master, or employee or their affiliates. 
Additionally, the vessel owner, operator, or ship's master must certify 
in the station log that the inspection was satisfactory. There are no 
FCC prior notice requirements for

[[Page 30]]

any inspection pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section. An 
inspection of the bridge-to-bridge radio stations on board vessels 
subject to the Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Act must be 
conducted by the same FCC-licensed technician.
    (3) Additionally, for passenger vessels operated on an international 
voyage the inspecting technician must send a completed FCC Form 806 to 
the Officer in Charge, Marine Safety Office, United States Coast Guard 
in the Marine Inspection Zone in which the ship is inspected.
    (4) In the event that a ship fails to pass an inspection the 
inspecting technician must make a log entry detailing the reason that 
the ship did not pass the inspection. Additionally, the technician must 
notify the vessel owner, operator, or ship's master that the vessel has 
failed the inspection.
    (5) Because such inspections are intended to ensure the availability 
of communications capability during a distress the Commission will 
vigorously investigate reports of fraudulent inspections, or violations 
of the Communications Act or the Commission's Rules related to ship 
inspections. FCC-licensed technicians, ship owners or operators should 
report such violations to the Commission through its National Call 
Center at 1-888-CALL FCC (1-888-225-5322).
    (b) Inspection and certification of a ship subject to the Great 
Lakes Agreement. The FCC will not inspect Great Lakes Agreement vessels. 
An inspection and certification of a ship subject to the Great Lakes 
Agreement must be made by a technician holding one of the following: an 
FCC General Radiotelephone Operator License, a GMDSS Radio Maintainer's 
License, a Second Class Radiotelegraph Operator's Certificate, or a 
First Class Radiotelegraph Operator's Certificate. The certification 
required by Sec. 80.953 must be entered into the ship's log. The 
technician conducting the inspection and providing the certification 
must not be the vessel's owner, operator, master, or an employee of any 
of them. Additionally, the vessel owner, operator, or ship's master must 
certify that the inspection was satisfactory. There are no FCC prior 
notice requirements for any inspection pursuant to Sec. 80.59(b).
    (c) Application for exemption. (1) Applications for exemption from 
the radio provisions of part II or III of title III of the

Sec. 80.60  Partitioned licenses and disaggregated spectrum.

    (a) Except as specified in Sec. 20.15(c) of this chapter with 
respect to commercial mobile radio service providers, charges must not 
be made for service of:
    (1) VHF Public Coast area licensees, see Sec. 80.371(c)(1)(ii), may 
partition their geographic service area or disaggregate their spectrum 
pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section.
    (2) AMTS geographic area licensees, see Sec. 80.385(a)(3), may 
partition their geographic service area or disaggregate their spectrum 
pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section. Site-based AMTS 
public coast station licensees may partition their license or 
disaggregate their spectrum pursuant to the procedures set forth in this 
section, provided that the partitionee or disaggregatee's predicted 38 
dBu signal level contour does not extend beyond the partitioner or 
disaggregator's predicted 38 dBu signal level contour. The predicted 38 
dBu signal level contours shall be calculated using the F(50, 50) field 
strength chart for Channels 7-13 in Sec. 73.699 (Fig. 10) of this 
chapter, with a 9 dB correction for antenna height differential.
    (3) Nationwide or multi-region LF, MF, and HF public coast station 
licensees, see Sec. Sec. 80.357(b)(1), 80.361(a), 80.363(a)(2), 
80.371(b), and 80.374, may partition their spectrum pursuant to the 
procedures set forth in this section, except that frequencies or 
frequency pairs licensed to more than one licensee as of March 13, 2002 
may be partitioned only by the earliest licensee,

[[Page 32]]

and only on the condition that the partitionee shall operate on a 
secondary, non-interference basis to stations licensed as of March 13, 
2002 other than the earliest licensee. Coordination with government 
users is required for partitioning of spectrum the licensing of which is 
subject to coordination with government users.
    (b) Technical standards--(1) Partitioning. In the case of 
partitioning, all requests for authorization for partial assignment of a 
license must include, as an attachment, a description of the partitioned 
service area. The partitioned service area shall be defined by 
coordinate points at every 3 degrees along the partitioned service area 
unless an FCC-recognized service area is utilized (e.g., Metropolitan 
Service Area, Rural Service Area, or Economic Area) or county lines are 
used. The geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, 
and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude, and must be 
based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83). In a case where an 
FCC-recognized service area or county lines are utilized, applicants 
need only list the specific area(s) (through use of FCC designations or 
county names) that constitute the partitioned area.
    (2) Disaggregation. VHF (156-162 MHz) spectrum may only be 
disaggregated according to frequency pairs. AMTS spectrum may be 
disaggregated in any amount.
    (3) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. The Commission will 
consider requests for partial assignment of licenses that propose 
combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.
    (c) License term. The license term for a partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's term as provided for in Sec. 80.25 of this part.
    (d) Construction Requirements--(1) Partitioning. Partial assignors 
and assignees for license partitioning have two options to meet 
construction requirements. Under the first option, the partitionor and 
partitionee would each certify that they will independently satisfy the 
substantial service requirement for their respective partitioned areas. 
If either licensee failed to meet its substantial service showing 
requirement, only the non-performing licensee's renewal application 
would be subject to dismissal. Under the second option, the partitioner 
certifies that it has met or will meet the substantial service 
requirement for the entire market. If the partitioner fails to meet the 
substantial service standard, however, only its renewal application 
would be subject to forfeiture at renewal.
    (2) Disaggregation. Partial assignors and assignees for license 
disaggregation have two options to meet construction requirements. Under 
the first option, the disaggregator and disaggregatee would certify that 
they each will share responsibility for meeting the substantial service 
requirement for the geographic service area. If parties choose this 
option and either party fails to do so, both licenses would be subject 
to forfeiture at renewal. The second option would allow the parties to 
agree that either the disaggregator or the disaggregatee would be 
responsible for meeting the substantial service requirement for the 
geographic service area. If parties choose this option, and the party 
responsible for meeting the construction requirement fails to do so, 
only the license of the nonperforming party would be subject to 
forfeiture at renewal.
    (3) Site-based AMTS, and nationwide or multi-region LF, MF, and HF 
public coast. Parties seeking to acquire a partitioned license or 
disaggregated spectrum from a site-based AMTS, or nationwide or multi-
region LF, MF, and HF public coast licensee will be required to 
construct and commence ``service to subscribers'' in all facilities 
acquired through such transactions within the original construction 
deadline for each facility as set forth in Sec. 80.49. Failure to meet 
the individual construction deadline will result in the automatic 
termination of the facility's authorization.

telegraphy emission normally used by the station. The call sign must be 
transmitted at 20 minute intervals when transmission is sustained for 
more than 20 minutes. When a ship station is exchanging public 
correspondence communications, the identification may be deferred until 
completion of each communication with any other station.
    (b) The requirements of this section do not apply to survival craft 
stations when transmitting distress signals automatically or when 
operating on 121.500 MHz for radiobeacon purposes.
    (c) Emergency position indicating radiobeacon stations do not 
require identification.


<R05>
Sec. 80.100  Morse code requirement.

    The code employed for telegraphy must be the Morse code specified in 
the Telegraph Regulations annexed to the International Telecommunication 
Convention. Pertinent extracts from the

Maritime Mobile and Maritime Mobile-Satellite Services'' published by 
the International Telecommunication Union.


<R05>
Sec. 80.101  Radiotelephone testing procedures.

    This section is applicable to all stations using telephony except 
where otherwise specified.
    (a) Station licensees must not cause harmful interference. When 
radiation is necessary or unavoidable, the testing procedure described 
below must be followed:
    (1) The operator must not interfere with transmissions in progress.
    (2) The testing station's call sign, followed by the word ``test'', 
must be announced on the radio-channel being used for the test.
    (3) If any station responds ``wait'', the test must be suspended for 
a minimum of 30 seconds, then repeat the call sign followed by the word 
``test'' and listen again for a response. To continue the test, the 
operator must use counts or phrases which do not conflict with normal 
operating signals, and must end with the station's call sign. Test 
signals must not exceed ten seconds, and must not be repeated until at 
least one minute has elapsed. On the frequency 2182 kHz or 156.800 MHz, 
the time between tests must be a minimum of five minutes.
    (b) Testing of transmitters must be confined to single frequency 
channels on working frequencies. However, 2182 kHz and 156.800 MHz may 
be used to contact ship or coast stations as appropriate when signal 
reports are necessary. Short tests on 4125 kHz are permitted by vessels 
equipped with MF/HF radios to evaluate the compatibility of the 
equipment for distress and safety purposes. U.S. Coast Guard stations 
may be contacted on 2182 kHz or 156.800 MHz for test purposes only when 
tests are being conducted by Commission employees, when FCC-licensed 
technicians are conducting inspections on behalf of the Commission, when 
qualified technicians are installing or repairing radiotelephone 
equipment, or when qualified ship's personnel conduct an operational 
check requested by the U.S. Coast Guard. In these cases the test must be 
identified as ``FCC'' or ``technical.''
    (c) Survival craft transmitter tests must not be made within 
actuating range of automatic alarm receivers.

call sign.
    (d) Ship stations operating in a vessel traffic service system or on 
a waterway under the control of a U.S. Government agency or a foreign 
authoriy, when communicating with such an agency or authority may be 
identified by the name of the ship in lieu of the call sign, or as 
directed by the agency or foreign authority.
    (e) Voice traffic in the INMARSAT system is closed to other parties 
except the two stations involved and the identification is done 
automatically with the establishment of the call. Therefore, it is not 
necessary for these stations to identify themselves periodically during 
the communication. For terrestrial systems using DSC to establish 
radiotelephone communications, the identification is made at the 
beginning of the call. In these cases, both parties must identify 
themselves by ship name, call sign or MMSI at least

[[Page 40]]

once every 15 minutes during radiotelephone communications.
    (f) VHF public coast stations licensed to serve a predetermined 
geographic service area are not required to provide station 
identification under this section. A site-based VHF public coast station 
may identify by means of the approximate geographic location of the 
station or the area it serves when it is the only VHF public coast 
station serving the location or there will be no conflict with the 
identification of any other station.

Sec. 80.111  Radiotelephone operating procedures for coast stations.

    This section applies to all coast stations using telephony which are 
subject to this part.
    (a) Limitations on calling. (1) Except when transmitting a general 
call to all stations for announcing or preceding the transmission of 
distress, urgency, or safety messages, a coast station must call the 
particular station(s) with which it intends to communicate.
    (2) Coast stations must call ship stations by voice unless it is 
known that the particular ship station may be contacted by other means 
such as automatic actuation of a selective ringing or calling device.
    (3) Coast stations may be authorized emission for selective calling 
on each working frequency.
    (4) Calling a particular station must not continue for more than one 
minute in each instance. If the called station does not reply, that 
station must not again be called for two minutes. When a called station 
does not reply to a call sent three times at intervals of two minutes, 
the calling must cease for fifteen minutes. However, if harmful 
interference will not be caused to other communications in progress, the 
call may be repeated after three minutes.
    (5) A coast station must not attempt to communicate with a ship 
station that has specifically called another coast station until it 
becomes evident that the called station does not answer, or that 
communication between the ship station and the called station cannot be 
carried on because of unsatisfactory operating conditions.
    (6) Calls to establish communication must be initiated on an 
available common working frequency when such a frequency exists and it 
is known that the called ship maintains a simultaneous watch on the 
common working frequency and the appropriate calling frequency(ies).
    (b) Time limitation on calling frequency. Transmissions by coast 
stations on 2182 kHz or 156.800 MHz must be minimized and any one 
exchange of communications must not exceed one minute in duration.
    (c) Change to working frequency. After establishing communications 
with another station by call and reply on 2182 kHz or 156.800 MHz coast 
stations must change to an authorized working channel for the 
transmission of messages.
    (d) Use of busy signal. A coast station, when communicating with a 
ship station which transmits to the coast station on a radio channel 
which is a different channel from that used by the coast station for 
transmission, may transmit a ``busy'' signal whenever

[[Page 42]]

transmission from the ship station is being received. The 
characteristics of the ``busy'' signal are contained in Sec. 80.74.

156.800 MHz or on commercial or noncommercial VHF intership frequencies 
appropriate to the class of ship station with which it is associated.
    (2) Except for safety purposes, it must only be used to communicate 
with the ship station with which it is associated or with associated 
ship units of the same ship station. Such associated ship units may not 
be used from shore.
    (3) It must be equipped to transmit on the frequency 156.800 MHz and 
at least one appropriate intership frequency.
    (4) Calling must occur on the frequency 156.800 MHz unless calling 
and working on an intership frequency has been prearranged.
    (5) Power is limited to one watt.
    (6) The station must be identified by the call sign of the ship 
station with which it is associated and an appropriate unit designator.
    (b) State or local government vehicles used to tow vessels involved 
in search and rescue operations are authorized to operate on maritime 
mobile frequencies as associated ship units. Such operations must be in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, except that the 
associated ship unit: May be operated from shore; may use Distress,

<R05>
Sec. 80.116  Radiotelephone operating procedures for ship stations.

    (a) Calling coast stations. (1) Use by ship stations of the 
frequency 2182 kHz for calling coast stations and for replying to calls 
from coast stations is authorized. However, such calls and replies 
should be on the appropriate ship-shore working frequency.
    (2) Use by ship stations and marine utility stations of the 
frequency 156.800 MHz for calling coast stations and marine utility 
stations on shore, and for replying to calls from such stations, is 
authorized. However, such calls and replies should be made on the 
appropriate ship-shore working frequency.
    (b) Calling ship stations. (1) Except when other operating procedure 
is used to expedite safety communication, ship stations, before 
transmitting on the intership working frequencies 2003, 2142, 2638, 
2738, or 2830 kHz, must first establish communications with other ship 
stations by call and reply on 2182 kHz. Calls may be initiated on an 
intership working frequency when it is known that the called vessel 
maintains a simultaneous watch on the working frequency and on 2182 kHz.
    (2) Except when other operating procedures are used to expedite 
safety communications, the frequency 156.800 MHz must be used for call 
and reply by ship stations and marine utility stations before 
establishing communication on one of the intership working frequencies. 
Calls may be initiated on an intership working frequency when it is 
known that the called vessel maintains a simultaneous watch on the 
working frequency and on 156.800 MHz.
    (c) Change to working frequency. After establishing communication 
with another station by call and reply on 2182 kHz or 156.800 MHz 
stations on board ship must change to an authorized

[[Page 43]]

working frequency for the transmission of messages.
    (d) Limitations on calling. Calling a particular station must not 
continue for more than 30 seconds in each instance. If the called 
station does not reply, the station must not again be called until after 
an interval of 2 minutes. When a called station called does not reply to 
a call sent three times at intervals of 2 minutes, the calling must 
cease and must not be renewed until after an interval of 15 minutes; 
however, if there is no reason to believe that harmful interference will 
be caused to other communications in progress, the call sent three times 
at intervals of 2 minutes may be repeated after a pause of not less than 
3 minutes. In event of an emergency involving safety, the provisions of 
this paragraph do not apply.
    (e) Limitations on working. Any one exchange of communications 
between any two ship stations on 2003, 2142, 2638, 2738, or 2830 kHz or 
between a ship station and a private coast station on 2738 or 2830 kHz 
must not exceed 3 minutes after the stations have established contact. 
Subsequent to such exchange of communications, the same two stations 
must not again use 2003, 2142, 2638, 2738, or 2830 kHz for communication 
with each other until 10 minutes have elapsed.
    (f) Transmission limitation on 2182 kHz and 156.800 MHz. To 
facilitate the reception of distress calls, all transmissions on 2182 
kHz and 156.800 MHz (channel 16) must be minimized and transmissions on 
156.800 MHz must not exceed 1 minute.
    (g) Limitations on commercial communication. On frequencies in the 
band 156-162 MHz, the exchange of commercial communication must be 
limited to the minimum practicable transmission time. In the conduct of 
ship-shore communication other than distress, stations on board ship 
must comply with instructions given by the private coast station or 
marine utility station on shore with which they are communicating.

Sec. 80.213  Modulation requirements.

    (a) Transmitters must meet the following modulation requirements:
    (1) When double sideband emission is used the peak modulation must 
be maintained between 75 and 100 percent;
    (2) When phase or frequency modulation is used in the 156-162 MHz 
band the peak modulation must be maintained between 75 and 100 percent. 
A frequency deviation of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 kHz is defined as 100 
percent peak modulation; and
    (3) In single sideband operation the upper sideband must be 
transmitted. Single sideband transmitters must automatically limit the 
peak envelope power to their authorized operating power and meet the 
requirements in Sec. 80.207(c).
    (b) Radiotelephone transmitters using A3E, F3E and G3E emission must 
have a modulation limiter to prevent any modulation over 100 percent. 
This requirement does not apply to survival craft transmitters, to 
transmitters that do not require a license or to transmitters whose 
output power does not exceed 3 watts.
    (c) Coast station transmitters operated in the 72.0-73.0 MHz and 
75.4-76.0 MHz bands must be equipped with an audio low-pass filter. The 
filter must be installed between the modulation limiter and the 
modulated radio frequency stage. At frequencies between 3 kHz and 15 kHz 
it must have an attenuation greater than at 1 kHz by at least 
40log<INF>10</INF> (f/3) dB where ``f'' is the frequency in kilohertz. 
At frequencies above 15 kHz the attenuation must be at least 28 dB 
greater than at 1 kHz.
    (d) Ship and coast station transmitters operating in the 156-162 MHz 
and 216-220 bands must be capable of proper operation with a frequency 
deviation that does not exceed <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 kHz when using

between the modulation limiter and the modulated radio frequency stage. 
At frequencies between 3 kHz and 20 kHz it must have an attenuation 
greater than at 1 kHz by at least 60log<INF>10</INF>(f/3) dB where ``f'' 
is the audio frequency in kilohertz. At frequencies above 20 kHz the 
attenuation must be at least 50 dB greater than at 1 kHz.
    (f) Radiodetermination ship stations operating on 154.585 MHz, 
159.480 MHz, 160.725 MHz, 160.785 MHz, 454.000 MHz and 459.000 MHz must 
employ a duty cycle with a maximum transmission period of 60 seconds 
followed by a minimum quiescent period four times the duration of the 
transmission period.
    (g) Radar stations operating in the bands above 2.4 GHz may use any 
type of modulation consistent with the bandwidth requirements in Sec. 
80.209(b).
    (h) Radar transponder coast stations using the 2900-3100 MHz or 
9300-9500 MHz band must operate in a variable frequency mode and respond 
on their operating frequencies with a maximum error equivalent to 100 
meters. Additionally, their response must be encoded with a Morse 
character starting with a dash. The duration of a Morse dot is defined 
as equal to the width of a space and \1/3\ of the width of a Morse dash. 
The duration of the response code must not exceed 50 microseconds. The 
sensitivity of the stations must be adjustable so that received signals 
below -10 dBm at the antenna will not activate the transponder. Antenna 
polarization must be horizontal when operating in the 9300-9500 MHz band 
and either horizontal or both horizontal and vertical when operating in 
the 2900-3100 MHz band. Racons using frequency agile transmitting 
techniques must include circuitry designed to reduce interference caused 
by triggering from radar antenna sidelobes.
    (i) Variable frequency ship station transponders operating in the 
2900-3100 MHz or 9300-9500 MHz band that are not used for search and 
rescue purposes must meet the following requirements:

dot-dot-dot), meaning ``You should not come any closer''. The width of a 
Morse dot is defined as equal to the width of a space and \1/3\ of the 
width of a Morse dash;
    (iii) When they employ swept frequency techniques they must not 
transmit on any frequency for more than 10 seconds in any 120 second 
period;

pause on the fixed frequency;
    (v) The duration of the response code must not exceed 50 
microseconds;

received signals below -10 dBm at the antenna input will not activate 
the transponder;

9300-9500 MHz band and either horizontal or both horizontal and vertical 
when operating in the 2900-3100 MHz band.

circuitry designed to reduce interference caused by triggering from 
radar antenna sidelobes.
    (2) Selectable transponders must be authorized under part 5 of the 
Commission's rules until standards for their use are developed.
    (j) The transmitted signals of search and rescue transponders must 
cause to appear on a radar display a series of at least 20 equally

    (b) A coast station is exempt from compliance with the watch 
requirement when Federal, State, or Local Government stations maintain a 
watch on 156.800 MHz over 95% of the coast station's service area. Each 
licensee exempted by rule must notify the nearest district office of the 
U.S. Coast Guard at least thirty days prior to discontinuing the watch, 
or in the case of new stations, at least thirty days prior to commencing 
service. The Coast Guard may require any coast station to maintain the 
watch temporarily or permanently. The Coast Guard may also require any 
coast station to remain capable of either immediately resuming the watch 
or providing the Coast Guard direct dial-up access to the necessary

[[Page 71]]

156.800 MHz transceiver at no charge so that the Coast Guard can 
maintain the watch.
    (c) If the government station(s) providing the 156.800 MHz watch 
over the service area of an exempt station temporarily discontinues that

<R05>
Sec. 80.305  Watch requirements of the Communications Act and the
Safety Convention.

    (a) Each ship of the United States which is equipped with a 
radiotelegraph station for compliance with part II of title III of the 
Communications Act or chapter IV of the Safety Convention must:
    (1) If it is not carrying MF-DSC radio equipment, keep a continuous 
and efficient watch on the radiotelephone distress frequency 2182 kHz 
from the principal radio operating position or the room from which the 
vessel is normally steered while being navigated in the open sea outside 
a harbor or port.
    (2) Keep a continuous and efficient watch on the VHF distress 
frequency 156.800 MHz from the room from which the vessel is normally 
steered while in the open sea outside a harbor or port. The watch must 
be maintained by a designated member of the crew who may perform other 
duties, relating to the operation or navigation of the vessel, provided 
such other duties do not interfere with the effectiveness of the watch. 
Use of a properly adjusted squelch or brief interruptions due to other 
nearby VHF transmissions are not considered to adversely affect the 
continuity or efficiency of the required watch on the VHF distress 
frequency. This watch need not be maintained by vessels subject to the 
Bridge-to-Bridge Act and participating in a Vessel Traffic Services 
(VTS) system as required or recommended by the U.S. Coast Guard, when an 
efficient listening watch is maintained on both the bridge-to-bridge 
frequency and a separate assigned VTS frequency.
    (b) Each cargo ship of the United States which is equipped with a 
radiotelephone station for compliance with part II of title III of the 
Communications Act or chapter IV of the Safety Convention must while 
being navigated outside of a harbor or port:
    (1) If it is not carrying MF-DSC radio equipment, keep a continuous 
watch on 2182 kHz in the room from which the vessel is normally steered 
while at sea, whenever such station is not being used for authorized 
traffic. Such watch must be maintained by at least one officer or 
crewmember who may perform other duties relating to the operation or 
navigation of the vessel, provided such other duties do not interfere 
with the watch.
    (2) Keep a continuous watch on 156.800 MHz from the room from which 
the vessel is normally steered. The watch must be maintained by a 
crewmember who may perform other duties, relating to the operation or 
navigation of the vessel, provided such other duties do not interfere 
with the watch. Use of properly adjusted squelch of brief interruptions 
due to other nearby VHF transmissions are not considered to adversely 
affect the watch. This watch need not be maintained by vessels subject 
to the Bridge-to-Bridge Act and participating in a Vessel Traffic 
Services (VTS) system when a watch is maintained on both the bridge-to-
bridge frequency and a VTS frequency.
    (c) Each vessel of the United States transporting more than six 
passengers

[[Page 72]]

for hire, which is equipped with a radiotelephone station for compliance 
with 47 U.S.C. 381-386 but which is not carrying MF-DSC radio equipment, 
must, while being navigated in the open sea or any tidewater within the 
jurisdiction of the United States adjacent or contiguous to the open 
sea, keep a continuous watch on 2182 kHz while the vessel is beyond VHF 
communication range of the nearest VHF coast station, whenever the 
radiotelephone station is not being used for authorized traffic. A VHF 
watch must be kept on 156.800 MHz whenever such station is not being 
used for authorized traffic. The VHF watch must be maintained at the 
vessel's steering station actually in use by the qualified operator as 
defined by Sec. 80.157 or by a crewmember who may perform other duties 
relating to the operation or navigation of the vessel, provided such 
other duties do not interfere with the watch. The use of a properly 
adjusted squelch is not considered to adversely affect the watch. The 
VHF watch need not be maintained by vessels subject to the Bridge-to-
Bridge Act and participating in a Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system 
when an efficient listening watch is maintained on both the bridge-to-
bridge frequency and a VTS frequency.

Agreement must when underway keep a watch on:
    (1) 156.800 MHz on board a vessel 20 meters (65 feet) and over in 
length, a vessel engaged in towing (See Sec. 80.951(b)), or a vessel 
carrying more than 6 passengers for hire. This watch must be maintained 
whenever the station is not being used for authorized traffic. However, 
a watch on 156.800 MHz need not be maintained by a vessel maintaining a 
watch on the bridge-to-bridge frequency 156.650 MHz and participating in 
a Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system and maintaining a watch on the 
specified VTS frequency.
    (2) 156.650 MHz on board a vessel 38 meters (124 feet) and over in 
length, a vessel engaged in towing (See Sec. 80.951(b)), or a vessel 
carrying more than six passengers for hire. This watch must be 
maintained continuously and effectively. Sequential monitoring is not 
sufficient. Portable VHF equipment may be used to meet this requirement. 
Vessels are exempted from this requirement while transiting the St. 
Lawrence Seaway and complying with the Joint Regulations of the St. 
Lawrence Seaway Authority and St. Lawrence Seaway Development 
Corporation between the lower exit of St. Lambert Lock at Montreal and 
Crossover Island, New York and in the Welland Canal and approaches 
between Calling in Point No. 15 and No. 16.
    (b) The watch must be maintained by the master, or person designated 
by the master, who may perform other duties provided they do not 
interfere with the effectiveness of the watch.

             Distress, Alarm, Urgency and Safety Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 80.311  Authority for distress transmission.

    A mobile station in distress may use any means at its disposal to 
attract attention, make known its position, and obtain help. A distress 
call and message, however, must be transmitted only on the authority of 
the master or person responsible for the mobile station. No person shall 
knowingly transmit, or cause to be transmitted, any false or fraudulent 
signal of distress or related communication.


<R05>
Sec. 80.312  Priority of distress transmissions.

    The distress call has absolute priority over all other 
transmissions. All stations which hear it must immediately cease any 
transmission capable of interfering with the distress traffic and must 
continue to listen on the frequency used for the emission of the 
distress call. This call must not be addressed to a particular station. 
Acknowledgement of receipt must not be given before the distress message 
which follows it is sent.


<R05>
Sec. 80.313  Frequencies for use in distress.

    The frequencies specified in the bands below are for use by mobile 
stations in distress. The conventional emission is shown. When a ship 
station cannot transmit on the designated frequency or the conventional 
emission, it may use any available frequency or emission. Frequencies 
for distress and safety calling using digital selective calling 
techniques are listed in Sec. 80.359(b). Distress and safety NB-DP 
frequencies are indicated by footnote 2 in Sec. 80.361(b).

Sec. 80.314  Distress communications.

    (a) The international radiotelephone distress signal consists of the 
word MAYDAY, pronounced as the French expression ``m'aider''.
    (b) These distress signals indicate that a mobile station is 
threatened by grave and imminent danger and requests immediate 
assistance.
    (c) The radiotelephone distress call consists of:
    (1) The distress signal MAYDAY spoken three times;
    (2) The words THIS IS;

[[Page 74]]

    (3) The call sign (or name, if no call sign assigned) of the mobile 
station in distress, spoken three times;
    (4) Particulars of the station's position;
    (5) The nature of the distress;
    (6) The kind of assistance desired; and
    (7) Any other information which might facilitate rescue, for 
example, the length, color, and type of vessel, or number of persons on 
board.
    (d) The procedures for canceling false distress alerts are contained 
in Sec. 80.335.

<R05>
Sec. 80.317  Radiotelegraph and radiotelephone alarm signals.

    (a) The international radiotelegraph alarm signal consists of a 
series of twelve dashes sent in one minute, the duration of each dash 
being four seconds and the duration of the interval between consecutive 
dashes one second. The purpose of this special signal is the actuation 
of automatic devices giving the alarm to attract the attention of the 
operator when there is no listening watch on the distress frequency.
    (b) The international radiotelephone alarm signal consists of two 
substantially sinusoidal audio frequency tones transmitted alternately. 
One tone must have a frequency of 2200 Hertz and the other a frequency 
of 1300 Hertz, the duration of each tone being 250 milliseconds. When 
generated by automatic means, the radiotelephone alarm signal must be 
transmitted continuously for a period of at least 30 seconds, but not 
exceeding one minute; when generated by other means, the signal must be 
transmitted as continuously as practicable over a period of 
approximately one minute. The purpose of this special signal is to 
attract the attention of the person on watch or to actuate automatic 
devices giving the alarm.


<R05>
Sec. 80.318  Use of alarm signals.

    (a) The radiotelegraph or radiotelephone alarm signal, as 
appropriate, must only be used to announce:
    (1) That a distress call or message is about to follow;
    (2) The transmission of an urgent cyclone warning. In this case the 
alarm signal may only be used by coast stations authorized by the 
Commission to do so; or
    (3) The loss of a person or persons overboard. In this case the 
alarm signal may only be used when the assistance of other ships is 
required and cannot be satisfactorily obtained by the use of the urgency 
signal only, but the alarm signal must not be repeated by other 
stations. The message must be preceded by the urgency signal.
    (b) In cases described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, 
the transmission of the warning or message by radiotelegraphy must not 
begin until two minutes after the end of the radiotelegraph alarm 
signal.


<R05>
Sec. 80.319  Radiotelegraph distress call and message transmission
procedure.

    (a) The radiotelegraph distress procedure consists of the following 
six steps: however, when time is vital, the first and second steps may 
be omitted. These two steps of the distress procedure may also be 
omitted in circumstances when transmission of the alarm signal is 
considered unnecessary:
    (1) The radiotelegraph alarm signal;
    (2) The distress call and an interval of two minutes;
    (3) The distress call;
    (4) The distress message;
    (5) Two dashes of ten to fifteen seconds each;
    (6) The call sign of the mobile station in distress.
    (b) The radiotelegraph distress transmissions must be sent by means 
of the international Morse code at a speed not exceeding 16 words per 
minute nor less than 8 words per minute.
    (c) The distress message, preceded by the distress call, must be 
repeated at intervals until an answer is received. The radiotelegraph 
alarm signal may also be repeated, if necessary.
    (d) The transmissions under paragraphs (a) (5) and (6) of this 
section, which are to permit direction finding stations to determine the 
position of the station in distress, may be repeated at frequent 
intervals if necessary.
    (e) When the mobile station in distress receives no answer to a 
distress

[[Page 75]]

message transmitted on the distress frequency, the message may be 
repeated on any other available frequency on which attention might be 
attracted.

<R05>
Sec. 80.320  Radiotelephone distress call and message transmission 
procedure.

    (a) The radiotelephone distress procedure consists of:
    (1) The radiotelephone alarm signal (whenever possible);
    (2) The distress call;
    (3) The distress message.
    (b) The DSC distress procedure consists of:
    (1) Transmission by a mobile unit in distress;
    (2) Reception;
    (3) Acknowledgement of distress calls;
    (4) Distress relays.
    (c) Radiotelephone distress transmissions must be made slowly and 
distinctly, each word being clearly pronounced to facilitate 
transcription.
    (d) After the transmission by radiotelephony of its distress 
message, the mobile station may be requested to transmit suitable 
signals followed by its call sign or name, to permit direction-finding 
stations to determine its position. This request may be repeated at 
frequent intervals if necessary.
    (e) The distress message, preceded by the distress call, must be 
repeated at intervals until an answer is received. This repetition must 
be preceded by the radiotelephone alarm signal whenever possible.
    (f) When the mobile station in distress receives no answer to a 
distress message transmitted on the distress frequency, the message may 
be repeated on any other available frequency on which attention might be 
attracted.

<R05>
Sec. 80.321  Acknowledgement of receipt of distress message.

    (a) Stations of the maritime mobile service which receive a distress 
message from a mobile station which is beyond any possible doubt in 
their vicinity must immediately acknowledge receipt. However, in areas 
where reliable communication with one or more coast stations is 
practicable, ship stations may defer this acknowledgement for a short 
interval so that a coast station may acknowledge receipt.
    (b) Stations of the maritime mobile service which receive a distress 
message from a mobile station which beyond any possible doubt is not in 
their vicinity, must allow a short interval of time to elapse before 
acknowledging receipt of the message in order to permit stations nearer 
to the mobile station in distress to acknowledge receipt without 
interference.


<R05>
Sec. 80.322  Form of acknowledgement.

    (a) The acknowledgement of receipt of a radiotelegraph distress 
message is transmitted in the following form:
    (1) The distress signal SOS;
    (2) The call sign of the station sending the distress message, sent 
three times;
    (3) The word DE;
    (4) The call sign of the station acknowledging receipt, sent three 
times;
    (5) The group RRR;
    (6) The message signal SOS.
    (b) The acknowledgement of receipt of a radiotelephone distress 
message is transmitted in the following form:
    (1) The distress signal MAYDAY;
    (2) The call sign or other identification of the station sending the 
distress message, spoken three times;
    (3) The words THIS IS;
    (4) The call sign or other identification of the station 
acknowledging receipt, spoken three times;
    (5) The word RECEIVED;
    (6) The distress signal MAYDAY.


<R05>
Sec. 80.323  Information furnished by an acknowledging station.

    (a) Every mobile station which acknowledges receipt of a distress 
message must on the order of the master or person responsible for the 
ship, aircraft, or other vehicle carrying such mobile station, transmit 
as soon as possible the following information in the order shown:
    (1) Its identifier;
    (2) Its position;
    (3) The speed at which it is proceeding towards, and the approximate

[[Page 76]]

time it will take to reach the mobile station in distress.
    (b) Before sending this message, the station must ensure that it 
will not interfere with the emissions of other stations better situated 
to render immediate assistance to the station in distress.


<R05>
Sec. 80.324  Transmission of distress message by station not itself
in distress.

    (a) A mobile station or a land station which learns that a mobile 
station is in distress must transmit a distress message in any of the 
following cases:
    (1) When the station in distress cannot transmit the distress 
message.
    (2) When the master or person responsible for the ship, aircraft, or 
other vehicle not in distress, or for the land station, believes that 
further help is necessary.
    (3) When, although not in a position to assist, it has heard a 
distress message which has not been acknowledged. When a mobile station 
transmits such a distress message, it must notify the authorities who 
may be able to assist.
    (b) Transmission must be made on the international distress 
frequencies or on any other available frequency on which attention might 
be attracted.
    (c) Transmission of the distress message must always be preceded by 
the call indicated below, which must itself be preceded whenever 
possible by the radiotelegraph or radiotelephone alarm signal. This call 
consists of:
    (1) When radiotelegraphy is used:
    (i) The signal DDD SOS SOS SOS DDD:
    (ii) The word DE;
    (iii) The call sign of the transmitting station, sent three times.
    (2) When radiotelephony is used:
    (i) The signal MAYDAY RELAY, spoken three times;
    (ii) The words THIS IS;
    (iii) The call sign or other identification of the transmitting 
station, spoken three times.
    (d) When the radiotelegraph alarm signal is used, an interval of two 
minutes must be allowed, whenever this is considered necessary, before 
the transmission of the call mentioned in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 80.325  Control of distress traffic.

    (a) Distress traffic consists of all messages relating to the 
immediate assistance required by the mobile station in distress. In 
distress traffic, the distress signal must be sent before the call and 
at the beginning of the preamble of any radiotelegram.
    (b) The control of distress traffic is the responsibility of the 
mobile station in distress or of the station which has sent the distress 
message. These stations may delegate the control of the distress traffic 
to another station.
    (c) The station in distress or the station in control of distress 
traffic may impose silence either on all stations of the mobile service 
in the area or on any station which interferes with the distress 
traffic. It must address these instructions ``to all stations'' or to 
one station only, according to circumstances. In either case, it must 
use one of the following signals which are reserved for use by the 
mobile station in distress and for the station controlling distress 
traffic:
    (1) In radiotelegraphy, the abbreviation QRT, followed by the 
distress signal SOS.
    (2) In radiotelephony, the signal SEELONCE MAYDAY.
    (d) If essential, any station of the mobile service near the ship, 
aircraft, or other vehicle in distress may also impose silence. It must 
use for this purpose:
    (1) In radiotelegraphy, the abbreviation QRT, followed by the word 
DISTRESS and its own call sign;
    (2) In radiotelephony, the word SEELONCE, followed by the word 
DISTRESS and its own call sign or other identification.


<R05>
Sec. 80.326  Notification of resumption of normal working.

    (a) When distress traffic has ceased, or when complete silence is no 
longer necessary on a frequency which has been used for distress 
traffic, the station which has controlled this traffic must transmit on 
that frequency a message addressed ``to all stations'' indicating that 
normal working may be resumed.
    (1) In radiotelegraphy, this message consists of:
    (i) The distress signal SOS;

[[Page 77]]

    (ii) The call ``to all stations'' (CQ), sent three times;
    (iii) The word DE;
    (iv) The call sign of the station sending the message;
    (v) The time of handing in the message;
    (vi) The name and call sign of the mobile station which was in 
distress;
    (vii) The service abbreviation QUM.
    (2) In radiotelephony, this message consists of:
    (i) The distress signal MAYDAY;
    (ii) The call ``Hello all stations'', spoken three times;
    (iii) The words THIS IS;
    (iv) The call sign or other identification of the station sending 
the message;
    (v) The time of handing in of the message;
    (vi) The name and call sign of the mobile station which was in 
distress;
    (vii) The words SEELONCE FEENEE OR PRU-DONCE.
    (b) Until they receive the foregoing message indicating that normal 
or limited working may be resumed, all stations which are aware of the 
distress traffic, and which are not taking part in it, are forbidden to 
transmit on the frequencies on which the distress traffic is taking 
place.


<R05>
Sec. 80.327  Urgency signals and messages.

    (a) The urgency signal indicates that the calling station has a very 
urgent message to transmit concerning the safety of a ship, aircraft, or 
other vehicle, or the safety of a person. The urgency signal must be 
sent only on the authority of the master or person responsible for the 
mobile station.
    (b) In radiotelegraphy, the urgency signal consists of three 
repetitions of the group XXX, sent with the individual letters of each 
group, and the successive groups clearly separated from each other. It 
must be transmitted before the call.
    (c) In radiotelephony, the urgency signal consists of three oral 
repetitions of the group of words PAN PAN transmitted before the call.
    (d) The urgency signal has priority over all other communications 
except distress. All mobile and land stations which hear it must not 
interfere with the transmission of the message which follows the urgency 
signal.
    (e) The urgency signal and call, and the message following it, must 
be sent on one of the international distress frequencies. Stations which 
cannot transmit on a distress frequency may use any other available 
frequency on which attention might be attracted.
    (f) Mobile stations which hear the urgency signal must continue to 
listen for at least three minutes. At the end of this period, if no 
urgency message has been heard, they may resume their normal service. 
However, land and mobile stations which are in communication on 
frequencies other than those used for the transmission of the urgency 
signal and of the call which follows it may continue their normal work 
without interruption provided the urgency message is not addressed ``to 
all stations''.
    (g) When the urgency signal has been sent before transmitting a 
message ``to all stations'' which calls for action by the stations 
receiving the message, the station responsible for its transmission must 
cancel it as soon as it knows that action is no longer necessary. This 
message of cancellation must likewise be addressed ``to all stations''.

73 FR 4485, Jan. 25, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 80.329  Safety signals and messages.

    (a) The safety signal indicates that the station is about to 
transmit a message concerning the safety of navigation or giving 
important meteorological warnings.
    (b) In radiotelegraphy, the safety signal consists of three 
repetitions of the group TTT, sent with the individual letters of each 
group, and the successive groups clearly separated from each other. It 
must be sent before the call.
    (c) In radiotelephony, the safety signal consists of the word 
SECURITE, pronounced as in French, spoken three times and transmitted 
before the call.
    (d) The safety signal and call must be sent on one of the 
international distress frequencies (2182 kHz or 156.8 MHz 
radiotelephone). Stations which cannot transmit on a distress frequency 
may use any other available frequency on which attention might be 
attracted.

[[Page 78]]

    (e) The safety signal and call must be followed by the safety 
message. Where practicable, the safety message should be sent on a 
working frequency, and a suitable announcement to this effect must be 
made at the end of the call.
    (f) Messages about meteorological warnings, of cyclones, dangerous 
ice, dangerous wrecks, or any other imminent danger to marine navigation 
must be preceded by the safety signal.
    (g) Stations hearing the safety signal must not make any 
transmission likely to interfere with the message.

<R05>
Sec. 80.331  Bridge-to-bridge communication procedure.

    (a) Vessels subject to the Bridge-to-Bridge Act transmitting on the 
designated navigational frequency must conduct communications in a 
format similar to those given below:
    (1) This is the (name of vessel). My position is (give readily 
identifiable position, course and speed) about to (describe contemplated 
action). Out.
    (2) Vessel off (give a readily identifiable position). This is (name 
of vessel) off (give a readily identifiable position). I plan to (give 
proposed course of action). Over.
    (3) (Coast station), this is (vessel's name) off (give readily 
identifiable position). I plan to (give proposed course of action). 
Over.
    (b) Vessels acknowledging receipt must answer ``(Name of vessel 
calling). This is (Name of vessel answering). Received your call,'' and 
follow with an indication of their intentions. Communications must 
terminate when each ship is satisfied that the other no longer poses a 
threat to its safety and is ended with ``Out''.
    (c) Use of power greater than 1 watt in a bridge-to-bridge station 
shall be limited to the following three situations:
    (1) Emergency.
    (2) Failure of the vessel being called to respond to a second call 
at low power.
    (3) A broadcast call as in paragraph (a)(1) of this section in a 
blind situation, e.g., rounding a bend in a river.


<R05>
Sec. 80.332  Equipment to aid search and rescue operations.

    (a) Survival craft stations may transmit distress, urgency and 
safety signals, calls and messages.
    (b) EPIRB's may transmit only in accordance with the requirements of 
subparts V and X of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 80.333  Stations in the maritime mobile-satellite service.

    The provisions of Sec. Sec. 80.311 and 80.324 apply to the 
operations of ship earth stations in the maritime mobile-satellite 
service.


<R05>
Sec. 80.334  False distress alerts.

    A distress alert is false if it was transmitted without any 
indication that a mobile unit or person was in distress and required 
immediate assistance. Transmitting a false distress alert is prohibited 
and may be subject to the provisions of part 1, subpart A of this 
chapter if that alert:
    (a) Was transmitted intentionally;
    (b) Was not cancelled in accordance with Sec. 80.335;
    (c) Could not be verified as a result of either the ship's failure 
to keep watch on appropriate frequencies in accordance with Sec. 
80.1123 or subpart G of this part, or its failure to respond to calls 
from the U.S. Coast Guard;
    (d) Was repeated; or
    (e) Was transmitted using a false identity.

[68 FR 46968, Aug. 7, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 80.335  Procedures for canceling false distress alerts.

    If a distress alert is inadvertently transmitted, the following 
steps shall be taken to cancel the distress alert.
    (a) VHF Digital Selective Calling.
    (1) Reset the equipment immediately;
    (2) Immediately cancel the distress alert orally over the telephony 
distress traffic channel associated with each DSC channel on which the 
distress alert was transmitted;
    (3) Set to Channel 16; and
    (4) Transmit a broadcast message to ``All stations'' giving the 
ship's name, call sign or registration number, and MMSI, and cancel the 
false distress alert.
    (b) MF Digital Selective Calling.

[[Page 79]]

    (1) Reset the equipment immediately;
    (2) Immediately cancel the distress alert orally over the telephony 
distress traffic channel associated with each DSC channel on which the 
distress alert was transmitted; and
    (3) Tune for radiotelephony transmission on 2182 kHz; and
    (4) Transmit a broadcast message to ``All stations'' giving the 
ship's name, call sign or registration number, and MMSI, and cancel the 
false distress alert.
    (c) HF Digital Selective Calling;
    (1) Reset the equipment immediately;
    (2) Immediately cancel the distress alert orally over the telephony 
distress traffic channel associated with each DSC channel on which the 
distress alert was transmitted;
    (3) Tune for radiotelephony on the distress and safety frequency in 
each band in which a false distress alert was transmitted; and
    (4) Transmit a broadcast message to ``All stations'' giving the 
ship's name, call sign or registration number, and MMSI, and cancel the 
false distress alert frequency in each band in which a false distress 
alert was transmitted.
    (d) INMARSAT ship earth station. Immediately notify the appropriate 
rescue coordination center that the alert is cancelled by sending a 
distress priority message by way of the same land earth station through 
which the false distress alert was sent. Provide ship name, call sign or 
registration number, and INMARSAT identity with the cancelled alert 
message.
    (e) EPIRB. If for any reason an EPIRB is activated inadvertently, 
immediately contact the nearest U.S. Coast Guard unit or appropriate 
rescue coordination center by telephone, radio or ship earth station and 
cancel the distress alert.
    (f) General and other distress alerting systems. Notwithstanding 
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, ships may use additional 
appropriate means available to them to inform the nearest appropriate 
U.S. Coast Guard rescue coordination center that a false distress alert 
has been transmitted and should be cancelled.

Sec. 80.355  Distress, urgency, safety, call and reply Morse code 
frequencies.

    This section describes the distress, urgency, safety, call and reply 
carrier frequencies assignable to stations for Morse code 
radiotelegraphy.
    (a) Frequencies in the 100-160 kHz band. The international calling 
frequency in the 100-160 kHz band is 143 kHz using A1A or J2A emission. 
When a ship station operating in the 100-160 kHz band desires to 
communicate with a coast station, it must call on the frequency 143 kHz 
unless the International List of Coast Stations provides otherwise. 
Coast stations must reply on their normal working frequency in this 
band. Only individual calls, replies to such calls, and transmission of 
signals preparatory to traffic may be transmitted on 143 kHz.
    (b) Frequencies in the 2000-27500 kHz band--(1) Ship station 
frequencies. The following table describes the calling frequencies in 
the 4000-27500 kHz band which are available for use by authorized ship 
stations equipped with crystal-controlled oscillators for A1A, J2A, J2B, 
or J2D radiotelegraphy. There are two series of frequencies for 
worldwide use and two series of frequencies for each geographic region. 
Ship stations with synthesized transmitters may operate on every full 
100 Hz increment in the 0.5 kHz channel for the frequencies listed, 
except for 100 Hz above and below those designated for worldwide use. 
During normal business hours when not communicating on other 
frequencies, all U.S. coast radiotelegraph stations must monitor the 
worldwide

[[Page 80]]

frequencies and the initial calling frequencies for the region in which 
it is located. The specific frequencies which must be monitored by a 
coast station will vary with propagation conditions. The calling 
frequencies which are routinely monitored by specific coast stations can 
be determined by reference to the ITU publication entitled ``List of 
Coast Stations.'' Initial calls by ship stations must be made on the 
appropriate initial calling frequency first. Calls on the worldwide 
frequencies may be made only after calls on the appropriate initial 
calling frequency are unsuccessful.

\1\ The frequency 410 kHz may be used on a secondary basis for the
  transmission of radiodetermination information and for transmitting by
  radiotelegraph radiodetermination related messages to direction-
  finding stations.
\2\ The frequency 512 kHz may be used as a supplementary calling
  frequency when 500 kHz is used for distress, safety and urgency
  communications. The use of the 512 kHz as a working frequency is
  prohibited in areas where it is used as a supplementary calling
  frequency when 500 kHz is used for distress, safety, and urgency
  communications.
\3\ The frequency 518 kHz is a receive only frequency by ship stations.
  It is used by U.S. Coast Guard coast stations for NB-DP transmissions
  of meteorological and navigational warnings to ships.

    (3) Frequencies in the 2000-27500 kHz band. This paragraph describes 
the working frequencies and Channel Series in the 2000-27500 kHz band 
which are assignable to ship stations.
    (i) Two Channel Series will be assigned for routine use to each ship 
station. Frequencies from any other Channel Series may be used if the 
frequencies in the assigned Channel Series are not adequate for 
communications.

these frequencies:
    (i) Frequencies in the 100-160 kHz band are assignable to coast 
stations for high seas communications only;
    (ii) Frequencies above 5 MHz may be assigned primarily to stations 
serving the high seas and secondarily to stations serving inland waters 
of the United States, including the Great Lakes, under the condition 
that interference will not be caused to any coast station serving the 
high seas.
    (iii) The frequency 410 kHz may be used on a secondary basis for the 
transmission of radiodetermination information and for transmitting by 
radiotelegraph radiodetermination messages to direction-finding 
stations; and

Sec. 80.359  Frequencies for digital selective calling (DSC).

    (a) General purpose calling. The following table describes the 
calling frequencies for use by authorized ship and coast stations for 
general purpose DSC. There are three series of paried frequencies. One 
series is for worldwide use; the other two series are for regional use. 
The ``Series A'' designation includes coast stations along, and ship 
stations in, the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean 
Sea. The ``Series B'' designation includes stations in any remaining 
areas. Stations must initiate contact on the appropriate regional 
frequency depending upon the location of the called station and 
propagation conditions. Acknowledgement is made on the paired frequency. 
The worldwide frequencies may be used for international calling, if 
calls on the appropriate regional frequencies are unsuccessful, or the 
regional series does not contain the appropriate band (e.g., 2 MHz). 
During normal working hours, all public coast stations capable of DSC 
operations must monitor the worldwide and regional frequencies 
appropriate for its location. The specific frequencies to be monitored 
will vary with propagation conditions.

Sec. 80.369  Distress, urgency, safety, call and reply frequencies.

    This section describes the general uses and frequencies assignable 
to maritime stations for distress, urgency, safety, call and reply 
radiotelephony communications.
    (a) In the 1605-3500 kHz band, the frequency 2182 is an 
international radiotelephony distress, urgency and safety frequency for 
ship stations, public and private coast stations, and survival craft 
stations. It is also used for call and reply by ship stations on a 
primary basis and by public coast stations on a secondary basis. The 
carrier frequency 2191 kHz may be used as a supplementary calling 
frequency in areas of heavy usage of 2182 kHz. All stations must use J3E 
emission when operating on 2182 and 2191 kHz, except that:
    (1) H3E emission may be used on 2182 kHz for communications with 
foreign coast and ship stations; or,
    (2) A3E emission may be used on 2182 kHz by portable survival craft 
stations, or transmitters authorized for use prior to January 1, 1972. 
See Sec. 80.203(c).
    (b) The frequencies 4125.0 kHz, 6215 kHz, 8291 kHz, 12290 kHz, and 
16420 kHz may be used by coast and ship stations on a simplex basis for 
distress and safety communications. The frequency 4125.0 kHz may also be 
used for distress and safety communications between aircraft and 
maritime mobile stations.
    (c) The frequency 5167.5 kHz is available to any station for 
emergency communications in the State of Alaska. Peak envelope power of 
stations operating on this frequency must not exceed 150 watts. This 
frequency may also be used by Alaska private fixed stations for calling 
and listening, but only for establishing communication.
    (d) In the 4000-27500 kHz band, the following coast frequencies are 
available for assignment to public coast stations for call and reply 
communications. The paired ship frequencies are available for use by 
authorized ship stations.

\1\ Unlimited hours of use from December 15 to April 1 and day only from
  April 1 to December 15. Harmful interference must not be caused to any
  station in the Great Lakes region.
\2\ In the Great Lakes region 2206 kHz is not available for transmission
  to U.S. ships except in the case of distress. U.S. coast stations in
  the Great Lakes area may use 2514, 2550 and 2582 kHz on a shared basis
  with coast stations of Canada. Except in the case of distress, the
  frequency 2550 kHz must not be used for transmission to ship stations
  of Canada since the associated ship station transmit frequency 2158
  kHz is not available to Canadian ship stations for transmission and
  2582 kHz must not be used for public correspondence transmissions to
  U.S. ship stations since the associated ship transmit frequency 2206
  kHz is not available to U.S. ship stations for transmissions except in
  the case of distress.
\3\ Limited to a peak envelope power of 150 watts.
\4\ Harmful interference must not be caused to any coast station in the
  Caribbean region.
\5\ But see section 80.373(c)(3) of this chapter.

    (b) Working frequencies in the 4000-27500 kHz band. This paragraph 
describes the working carrier frequencies in the 4000-27500 kHz band. 
With respect to frequencies that are assignable in more than one 
geographical area, once the frequency is assigned to one licensee, any 
subsequent license will be authorized on a secondary, non-interference 
basis with respect to the incumbent license's existing operation. If the 
first licensee later seeks authorization to operate in an additional 
geographic area, such authorization will be on a secondary, non-
interference basis to other co-channel licensees.
    (1) The following table specifies the carrier frequencies available 
for assignment to public coast stations. The paired ship frequencies are 
available for use by authorized ship stations. The specific frequency 
assignment available to public coast stations for a particular 
geographic area is indicated by an ``x'' under the appropriate column. 
The allotment areas are in accordance with the ``Standard Defined 
Areas'' as identified in the International Radio Regulations, Appendix 
25 Planning System, and indicated in the preface to the International 
Frequency List (IFL).

    (2) The following table specifies the non-paired carrier frequencies 
that are available for assignment to public coast stations for simplex 
operations. These frequencies are available for use by authorized ship 
stations for transmissions to coast stations (simplex operations). 
Assignments on these frequencies must accept interference. They are 
shared with government users and are considered ``common use'' 
frequencies under the international Radio Regulations. They cannot be 
notified for inclusion in the Master International Frequency Register, 
which provides stations with interference protection, but may be listed 
in the international List of Coast Stations. (See Radio Regulation No. 
1220 and Recommendation 304.)

\2\ Available on a secondary basis for intership communications by ships
  involved in non-commercial fishing.

    (2) Except for 2093.0 kHz and 2214.0 kHz the frequencies shown in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section are authorized primarily for intership 
safety communications in the indicated geographic area.
    (3) Except for the frequencies 2093.0 kHz, 2214.0 kHz and 2670.0 
kHz, the frequencies shown in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be 
used on a non-interference basis to safety communications, for 
operational communications and, in the case of commercial transport 
ships and ships of municipal and state governments, for business 
communications.
    (4) Ship stations may communicate with government coast stations on 
2003.0 kHz about passage of vessels. Interference must not be caused to 
communications on the St. Lawrence Seaway and on the St. Mary's River.
    (5) Ship stations may use 2670.0 kHz for communications with coast 
and ship stations of the U.S. Coast Guard. When a ship is not equipped 
to transmit on 2670.0 kHz or in the band 156-162 MHz the frequency 
2003.0 kHz may be used on the Great Lakes for communications must not 
cause harmful interference to intership safety, operational and business 
communications.

    (4) Channels in the 219-220 MHz band are also used on a secondary, 
non-interference basis by amateur stations participating in digital 
message forwarding systems. Amateur stations may not cause harmful 
interference to AMTS operations and must accept any harmful interference 
from AMTS operation. Amateur stations within 80 km (50 miles) of an AMTS 
coast station must obtain written approval from the AMTS licensee prior 
to operating in the 219-220 MHz band. Amateur stations within 640 km 
(398 miles) of an AMTS coast station must notify the AMTS licensee in 
writing at least 30 days prior to initiation of operations in the 219-
220 MHz band. All amateur stations must notify the American Radio Relay 
League in writing at least 30 days prior to initiation of operations in 
the 219-220 MHz band (ARRL, 225 Main St., Newington, CT 06111-1494).
    (b) Subject to the requirements of Sec. 1.924 of this chapter, 
Sec. Sec. 80.215(h), and 80.475(a), each AMTS geographic area licensee 
may place stations anywhere within its region without obtaining prior 
Commission approval provided:
    (1) The AMTS geographic area licensee must locate its stations at 
least 120 kilometers from the stations of co-channel site-based AMTS 
licensees. Shorter separations between such stations will be considered 
by the Commission on a case-by-case basis upon

[[Page 108]]

submission of a technical analysis indicating that at least 18 dB 
protection will be provided to a site-based licensee's predicted 38 dBu 
signal level contour. The site-based licensee's predicted 38 dBu signal 
level contour shall be calculated using the F(50, 50) field strength 
chart for Channels 7-13 in Sec. 73.699 (Fig. 10) of this chapter, with 
a 9 dB correction for antenna height differential. The 18 dB protection 
to the site-based licensee's predicted 38 dBu signal level contour shall 
be calculated using the F(50, 10) field strength chart for Channels 7-13 
in Sec. 73.699 (Fig. 10a) of this chapter, with a 9 dB correction 
factor for antenna height differential.
    (2) The locations and/or technical parameters of the transmitters 
are such that individual coordination of the channel assignment(s) with 
a foreign administration, under applicable international agreements and 
rules in this part, is not required.
    (3) For any construction or alteration that would exceed the 
requirements of Sec. 17.7 of this chapter, licensees must notify the 
appropriate Regional Office of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA 
Form 7460-1) and file a request for antenna height clearance and 
obstruction marking and lighting specifications (FCC Form 854) with the 
FCC, Attn: Information Processing Branch, 1270 Fairfield Rd., 
Gettysburg, PA 17325-7245.
    (4) The transmitters must not have a significant environmental 
effect as defined by Sec. Sec. 1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter.
    (c) Any recovered frequency blocks will revert automatically to the 
holder of the geographic area license within which such frequencies are 
included. Any frequency blocks recovered where there is no geographic 
area licensee will be retained by the Commission for future licensing.

or contour intervals must be taken from U.S. Geological Survey 
topographic quadrangle maps, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maps or 
Tennessee Valley Authority maps, whichever is the latest, for all areas 
for which maps are available. If such maps are not published for the 
area in question, the next best topographic information must be used. 
The maps used must include the principal area to be served. U.S. 
Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps may be obtained from the 
Eastern Distribution Branch, U.S. Geological Survey, 1200 South Eads 
Street, Arlington, VA 22202, for maps of areas east of the Mississippi 
River, including Minnesota, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, and 
from the Western Distribution

Branch, U.S. Geological Survey, Federal Center, Denver CO 80225, for 
maps of areas west of the Mississippi River, including Alaska, Hawaii, 
Louisiana, Guam and American Samoa. Sectional aeronautical charts are 
available from the Distribution Division, National Ocean Service, 
Riverdale, MD 20840.
    (b) In lieu of maps, the average terrain elevation may be computer 
generated, using elevations from a 30 second point or better topographic 
data file such as those available for the U.S. Geological Survey's 
National Geographic Information Center or the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration's National Geophysical Data Center. In case 
of dispute maps will be used to determine the correct value.


<R05>
Sec. 80.759  Average terrain elevation.

    (a)(1) Draw radials from the antenna site for each 45 degrees of 
azimuth starting with true north. Any such radial which extends entirely 
over land from the antenna site to the point of +17 dBu field strength 
need not be drawn.
    (2) If the distance from the antenna site to the point of +17 dBu 
field strength between any of the 45 degrees radials would be less than 
the distances calculated along these radials, an additional radial 
between such adjacent radials must be plotted and calculations made in 
each case. Each additional radial must be that radial along which it 
appears by inspection that transmission loss would be greatest.
    (b) Draw a circle of 16 km (10 statute mile) radius using the 
antenna site as the center. Divide each radial into 320 meter (0.2 
statute mile) increments inside the circumference to the 3.2 km (2 
statute mile) point.
    (c) Calculate the height above sea level of each 320 meter (0.2 
statute mile) division by interpolating the contour intervals of the 
map, and record the value.
    (d) Average the values by adding them and dividing by the number of 
readings along each radial.
    (e) Calculate the height above average terrain by averaging the 
values calculated for each radial.

Sec. 80.763  Effective antenna height.

    The effective height of the antenna is the vertical distance between 
the center of the radiating system above the mean sea level and the 
average terrain elevation.

[[Page 129]]


<R05>
Sec. 80.765  Effective radiated power.

    Effective radiated power is used in computing the service area 
contour. The effective radiated power is derived from the transmitter 
output power, loss in the transmission system including duplexers, 
cavities, circulators, switches and filters, and the gain relative to a 
half-wave dipole of the antenna system.


<R05>
Sec. 80.767  Propagation curve.

    The propagation graph, Sec. 80.767 Graph 1, must be used in 
computing the service area contour. The graph provides data for field 
strengths in dBu for an effective radiated power of 1 kW, over sea 
water, fresh water or land (smooth earth); transmitting antena heights 
of 4,800, 3,200, 1,600, 800, 400, 200, and 100 feet; based on a 
receiving antenna height of 9 meters (30 feet), for the 156-162 MHz 
band. The use of this is described in this section.
    (a) Calculate the effective radiated power of the coast station, Ps 
in dB referred to 1 kW (dBk), as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC02AP91.005

where,

Pt=Transmitter output power in dB referred to 1 kW: Transmitter output 
          power in watts is converted to dBk by Pt=10 [log10 (Power in 
          watts)]-30. Also see Sec. 80.761 Graph 1 for a conversion 
          graph.
G=Antenna gain in dB referred to a standard half-wave dipole, in the 
          direction of each plotted radial, and
L=Line losses between the transmitter and the antenna, in dB.

    Notes: 1. To determine field strengths where the distance is known, 
for effective radiated powers other than 1kW (0 dBk): Enter the graph 
from the ``statute miles'' scale at the known distance, read up to 
intersection with the curve for the antenna height, read left to the 
``dBu for 1 kW radiated'' scale and note the referenced field strength 
(Fe). The value of the actual field strength (F) in dBu will be F=Fe+Ps 
where Ps is the effective radiated power calculated above.
    2. To determine distance, where the actual field strength is 
specified, for effective radiated powers other than 0 dBk: The value of 
the field referenced strength will be Fe=F-Ps in dBu. Enter the graph, 
from the ``dBu for 1 kW radiated'' scale at the corrected value of Fe, 
read right to intersection with the antenna height, read down to 
``statute miles'' scale.

    (b) Determine the antenna height. For antenna heights between the 
heights for which this graph is drawn, use linear interpolation; assume 
linear height-gain for antennas higher than 4,800 feet.
    (c) For receiver antenna heights lower than 9 meters (30 feet), 
assume that the field strength is the same as at 9 meters (30 feet).
    (d) Assume that propagation over fresh water or over land is the 
same as that over sea water.

Sec. 80.769  Shadow loss.

    Where the transmission path is obstructed the received signal must 
be adjusted to include shadow loss. Attenuation due to shadowing must be 
taken from Sec. 80.769 Graph 1, as follows:
    (a) Inspect the map(s) to determine if a hill(s) obstructs an 
imaginary line of

[[Page 131]]

sight (dashed line on illustrative profiles of Sec. 80.769 Graph 1 from 
the average terrain elevation at the coast station antenna to the water 
level at the ship location. If average terrain elevation exceeds the 
actual ground elevation at the antenna site, the latter elevation must 
be used as the average terrain elevation.
    (b) If a hill appears to obstruct the radio path, plot the antenna 
site elevation, the obstruction elevation and the height of the ship 
station on rectangular coordinate paper using elevation above mean sea 
level as the vertical scale and distance in statute miles as the 
horizontal scale. Then draw a straight line between the antenna and the 
ship.
    (c) If a hill obstructs the imaginary line of sight, determine its 
height (H) above the imaginary line and its distance (D) from either the 
coast or ship station, whichever is nearer, as illustrated by examples 
``A'' and ``B'' on Graph 1.
    (d) Read the shadow loss from this Graph 1 and subtract that loss 
from the computed received signal.
    (e) Where more than one hill obstructs the transmission path, 
determine the height and position of a single equivalent hill, as 
illustrated by example ``C'' on this graph. Read the shadow loss from 
this graph for the equivalent hill.

according to the procedures in Sec. Sec. 80.757-80.761.
    (b) Determine the effective radiated power according to Sec. 
80.765. Determine

[[Page 133]]

for each radial the distance from the antenna site to the +17 dBu point 
of field strength using procedures of Sec. Sec. 80.765 and 80.767.
    (c) Plot on a suitable map each point of +17 dBu field strength for 
all radials and draw the contour by connecting the adjacent points by a 
smooth curve.


<R05>
Sec. 80.773  Co-channel interference protection.

    (a) Where a VHF public coast station geographic area licensee shares 
a frequency with an incumbent VHF public coast station licensee, the 
ratio of desired to undesired signal strengths must be at least 12 dB 
within the service area of the station.
    (b) Where a VHF public coast station geographic area licensee shares 
a frequency with an incumbent private land mobile radio licensee, the 
VHF public coast station geographic area licensee must provide at least 
10 dB protection to the PLMR incumbent's predicted 38 dBu signal level 
contour. The PLMR incumbent's predicted 38 dBu signal level contour is 
calculated using the F(50, 50) field strength chart for Channels 7-13 in 
Sec. 73.699 (Fig. 10a) of this chapter, with a 9 dB correction factor 
for antenna height differential, and is based on the licensee's 
authorized effective radiated power and antenna height-above-average-
terrain.
    (c) VHF public coast station geographic area licensees are 
prohibited from exceeding a field strength of +5 dBu (decibels 
referenced to 1 microvolt per meter) at their service area boundaries, 
unless all the affected VHF public coast station geographic area 
licensees agree to the higher field strength.

Lakes Radio Agreement defines the Great Lakes as ``all waters of Lakes 
Ontario, Erie, Huron (including Georgian Bay), Michigan, Superior, their 
connecting and tributary waters and the River St. Lawrence as far east 
as the lower exit of the St. Lambert Lock at Montreal in the Province of 
Quebec, Canada,'' but does not include such of the connecting and 
tributary waters as may be specified in the Technical Regulations. The 
Technical Regulations do not include any connecting and tributary waters 
except the St. Mary's River, the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, the 
Detroit River and the Welland Canal. A vessel to which the Great Lakes 
Radio Agreement applies and which falls into the specific categories by 
paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this section and not excepted by paragraph 
(d) or (e) of this section must comply with this subpart while navigated 
on the Great Lakes.

       Operating Procedures for Distress and Safety Communications


<R05>
Sec. 80.1109  Distress, urgency, and safety communications.

    (a) Distress traffic consists of all messages relating to the 
immediate assistance required by the ship in distress, including search 
and rescue communications and on-scene communications. Distress traffic 
must as far as possible be on the frequencies contained in Sec. 
80.1077.
    (b) Urgency and safety communications include: navigational and 
meteorological warnings and urgent information; ship-to-ship safety 
navigation communications; ship reporting communications; support 
communications for search and rescue operations; other urgency and 
safety messages and communications relating to the navigation, movements 
and needs of ships and weather observation messages destined for an 
official meteorological service.
    (c) Intership navigation safety communications are those VHF 
radiotelephone communications conducted between ships for the purpose of 
contributing to the safe movement of ships. The frequency 156.650 MHz is 
used for intership navigation safety communications (see Sec. 80.1077).


<R05>
Sec. 80.1111  Distress alerting.

    (a) The transmission of a distress alert indicates that a mobile 
unit or person is in distress and requires immediate assistance. The 
distress alert is a digital selective call using a distress call format 
in bands used for terrestrial radio communication or a distress message 
format, which is relayed through space stations.
    (b) The distress alert must be sent through a satellite either with 
absolute priority in general communication channels or on exclusive 
distress and safety frequencies or, alternatively, on the distress and 
safety frequencies in the MF, HF, and VHF bands using digital selective 
calling.
    (c) The distress alert must be sent only on the authority of the 
person responsible for the ship, aircraft or other vehicle carrying the 
mobile station or the mobile earth station.
    (d) All stations which receive a distress alert transmitted by 
digital selective calling must immediately cease any transmission 
capable of interfering with distress traffic and must continue watch on 
the digital selective call distress calling channel until the call has 
been acknowledged to determine if a coast station acknowledges the call 
using digital selective calling. Additionally, the station receiving the 
distress alert must set watch on the associated distress traffic 
frequency for five minutes to determine if distress traffic takes place. 
The ship can acknowledge the call using voice or narrowband direct 
printing as appropriate on this channel to the ship or to the rescue 
authority.

[57 FR 9065, Mar. 16, 1992, as amended at 68 FR 46980, Aug. 7, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 80.1113  Transmission of a distress alert.

    (a) The distress alert must identify the station in distress and its 
position. The distress alert may also contain information regarding the 
nature of the

[[Page 167]]

distress, the type of assistance required, the course and speed of the 
mobile unit, the time that this information was recorded and any other 
information which might facilitate rescue.
    (b) The format of distress calls and distress messages must be in 
accordance with ITU-R M.493-13 and ITU-R M.541-9 (both incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 80.7), as specified in Sec. 80.1101.
    (c) Ship-to-shore distress alerts are used to alert Rescue 
Coordination Centers via coast stations or coast earth stations that a 
ship is in distress. These alerts are based on the use of transmissions 
via satellites (from a ship earth station or a satellite EPIRB) and 
terrestrial services (from ship stations and EPIRBs).
    (d) Ship-to-ship distress alerts are used to alert other ships in 
the vicinity of the ship in distress and are based on the use of digital 
selective calling in the VHF and MF bands. The HF bands should not be 
used to notify ships in the vicinity unless no response is received 
within five minutes on VHF or MF.
    (e) Shore-to-ship distress alert relays are used by a station or 
Rescue Coordination Center to relay information about a ship in distress 
to, as appropriate, all ships, a selected group of ships, or a specific 
ship by satellite and/or terrestrial means. The distress alert relay 
must contain the identification of the mobile unit in distress, its 
position and all other information which might facilitate rescue.

Sec. 80.1114  False distress alerts.

    The provisions of Sec. Sec. 80.334 and 80.335 apply to false 
distress alerts.

[68 FR 46980, Aug. 7, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 80.1115  Transmission of a distress alert by a station not itself 
in distress.

    (a) A station in the mobile or mobile-satellite service which learns 
that a mobile unit is in distress must initiate and transmit a distress 
alert relay in any of the following cases:
    (1) When the mobile unit in distress is not itself in a position to 
transmit the distress alert; or
    (2) When the master or person responsible for the mobile unit not in 
distress or the person responsible for the land station determines that 
further help is necessary.
    (b) A station transmitting a distress alert relay in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section or Sec. 80.1121(c) must indicate that it 
is not itself in distress.


<R05>
Sec. 80.1117  Procedure for receipt and acknowledgement of distress
alerts.

    (a) Normally, distress calls received using digital selective 
calling are only acknowledged using a DSC acknowledgement by a coast 
station. Ships should delay any acknowledgement in order to give 
sufficient time for a coast station to acknowledge the call. In cases 
where no acknowledgement has been heard and no distress traffic has been 
heard, the ship should transmit a distress alert relay to the coast 
station. Upon advice from the Rescue Coordination Center, the ship may 
transmit a DSC acknowledgement call to stop it from being repeated. 
Acknowledgement by digital selective calling of receipt of a distress 
alert in the terrestrial services must comply with ITU-R M.541-9 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 80.7).
    (b) Acknowledgement through a satellite of receipt of a distress 
alert from a ship earth station must be sent immediately (see Sec. 
80.1119).
    (c) Acknowledgement by radiotelephony of receipt of a distress alert 
from a ship station or a ship earth station must be given in the 
following form:
    (1) The distress signal MAYDAY;
    (2) The call sign or other identification of the station sending the 
distress message, spoken three times;
    (3) The words THIS IS (or DE spoken as DELTA ECHO in case of 
language difficulties);
    (4) The call sign or other identification of the station 
acknowledging receipt, spoken three times;
    (5) The word RECEIVED (or RRR spoken as ROMEO ROMEO ROMEO in case of 
language difficulties);
    (6) The distress signal MAYDAY.

[[Page 168]]

    (d) The acknowledgement by direct-printing telegraphy of receipt of 
a distress alert from a ship station must be given in the following 
form:
    (1) The distress signal MAYDAY;
    (2) The call sign or other identification of the station sending the 
distress alert;
    (3) The word DE;
    (4) The call sign or other identification of the station 
acknowledging receipt of the distress alert;
    (5) The signal RRR;
    (6) The distress signal MAYDAY.
    (e) The acknowledgement by direct-printing telegraphy of receipt of 
a distress alert from a ship earth station must be given by the coast 
earth station receiving the distress alert by retransmitting the ship 
station identity of the ship transmitting the distress alert.

FR 4491, Jan. 25, 2008; 76 FR 67618, Nov. 2, 2011]


<R05>
Sec. 80.1119  Receipt and acknowledgement of distress alerts by coast
stations and coast earth stations.

    (a) Coast stations that receive a distress alert should defer 
acknowledgement for a short interval so that receipt may be acknowledged 
by a Rescue Coordination Center. Where an acknowledgement is not 
forthcoming within 3 minutes, the coast station in receipt of distress 
alerts must ensure that they are routed to a Rescue Coordination Center 
as soon as possible. Coast stations must provide assistance for distress 
communications when requested to do so by the U.S. Coast Guard. (This 
subpart does not specify any radio watches for coast stations.)
    (b) Coast earth stations in receipt of distress alerts must ensure 
that they are routed as soon as possible to a Rescue Coordination 
Center. Coast earth stations must relay, as soon as possible, an 
acknowledgement of a distress alert from a Rescue Coordination Center.
    (c) Certain messages must be carried without charge, regardless of 
the means by which they are transmitted:
    (1) Distress alert messages;
    (2) Search and rescue coordination messages;
    (3) Medical assistance messages where an imminent danger to life is 
present, or
    (4) Urgent meteorological or navigational danger messages passed in 
the ship-to-shore direction.


<R05>
Sec. 80.1121  Receipt and acknowledgement of distress alerts by ship
stations and ship earth stations.

    (a) Ship or ship earth stations that receive a distress alert must, 
as soon as possible, inform the master or person responsible for the 
ship of the contents of the distress alert.
    (b) For VHF and MF, ships in receipt of a distress alert shall not 
transmit a distress alert relay, but should listen on the distress 
traffic channel for 5 minutes and, if appropriate, acknowledge the alert 
by radiotelephony to the ship in distress and inform the coast station 
and/or Rescue Coordination Center. Distress alert relays to ``all 
ships'' on these bands may only be sent by a ship who has knowledge that 
another ship in distress is not itself able to transmit the distress 
alert, and the Master of the ship considers that further help is 
necessary.
    (c) For HF, ships in receipt of a distress alert shall listen on the 
distress traffic channel for 5 minutes. If no distress communications 
are heard and if the call is not acknowledged by a coast station, the 
ship shall transmit a distress relay on HF to the coast radio station 
and inform the Rescue Coordination Center. Distress alert relays to 
``all Ships'' on HF may only be sent by a ship who has knowledge that 
another ship in distress is not itself able to transmit the distress 
alert, and the Master of the ship considers that further help is 
necessary.
    (d) In cases where distress alert continues to be received from the 
same source, the ship may, after consultation with the Rescue 
Coordination Center, transmit a DSC acknowledgment to terminate the 
call.
    (e) A ship station in receipt of a shore-to-ship distress alert 
relay (see Sec. 80.1113(e)) should establish communication as directed 
and render such assistance as required and appropriate.

Sec. 80.1123  Watch requirements for ship stations.

    (a) While at sea, all ships must maintain a continuous watch:
    (1) On VHF DSC channel 70, if the ship is fitted with a VHF radio 
installation in accordance with Sec. 80.1085(a)(2);
    (2) On the distress and safety DSC frequency 2187.5 kHz, if the ship 
is fitted with an MF radio installation in accordance with Sec. 
80.1089(a)(2) or Sec. 80.1091(a)(3);
    (3) On the distress and safety DSC frequencies 2187.5 kHz and 8414.5 
kHz also on at least one of the distress and safety DSC frequencies 
4207.5 kHz, 6312 kHz, 12577 kHz, or 16804.5 kHz appropriate to the time 
of day and the geographical position of the ship, if the ship is fitted 
with an MF/HF radio installation in accordance with Sec. 
80.1091(a)(2)(ii) or Sec. 80.1093(a) of this part (this watch may be 
kept by means of a scanning receiver limited to six distress and safety 
DSC frequencies); and
    (4) For satellite shore-to-ship distress alert, if the ship is 
fitted with an INMARSAT ship earth station in accordance with Sec. 
80.1091(a)(1).
    (b) While at sea, all ships must maintain radio watches for 
broadcasts of maritime safety information on the appropriate frequency 
or frequencies on which such information is broadcast for the area in 
which the ship is navigating.
    (c) Every ship while at sea must maintain, when practicable, a 
continuous listening watch on VHF Channel 16. This watch must be kept at 
the position from which the ship is normally navigated or at a position 
which is continuously manned.
    (d) On receipt of a distress alert transmitted by use of digital 
selective calling techniques, ship stations must set watch on the 
radiotelephone distress and safety traffic frequency associated with the 
distress and safety calling frequency on which the distress alert was 
received.
    (e) Ship stations with narrow-band direct printing equipment must 
set watch on the narrow-band direct-printing frequency associated with 
the distress alert signal if it indicates that narrow-band direct-
printing is to be used for subsequent distress communications. If 
practicable, they should additionally set watch on the radiotelephone 
frequency associated with the distress alert frequency.

<R05>
Sec. 80.1125  Search and rescue coordinating communications.

    (a) The distress signal consists of the word MAYDAY, pronounced in 
radiotelephony as the French expression ``M'aider''. For distress 
traffic by radiotelephony, when establishing communications, calls must 
be prefixed by the distress signal MAYDAY.
    (b) Error correction techniques, in accordance with ITU-R M.625-3 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 80.7), as specified in Sec. 
80.1101, must be used for distress traffic by direct-printing 
telegraphy. All messages must be preceded by at least one carriage 
return, a line feed signal, a letter shift signal and the distress 
signal MAYDAY.
    (c) Distress communications by direct-printing telegraphy should be 
in the ARQ mode when ships are communicating directly to the Coast Guard 
or other coast stations on channels which they normally guard. Other 
distress communications, including those on simplex channels provided 
for that purpose, should be in the broadcast forward error correction 
mode. The ARQ mode may subsequently be used when it is advantageous to 
do so.
    (d) The Rescue Coordination Center responsible for controlling a 
search and rescue operation will also coordinate the distress traffic 
relating to the incident or may appoint another station to do so.
    (e) The Rescue Coordination Center coordinating distress traffic, 
the unit coordinating search and rescue operations, or the coast station 
involved may impose silence on stations which interfere with that 
traffic. This instruction may be addressed to all stations or to one 
station only, according to circumstances. In either case, the following 
will be used:
    (1) In radiotelephony, the signal SEELONCE MAYDAY, pronounced as the 
French expression ``silence, m'aider'';

[[Page 170]]

    (2) In narrow-band direct-printing telegraphy normally using 
forward-error correcting mode, the signal SILENCE MAYDAY. However, the 
ARQ mode may be used when it is advantageous to do so.
    (f) Until they receive the message indicating that normal working 
may be resumed (see paragraph (h) of this section), all stations which 
are aware of the distress traffic, and which are not taking part in it, 
and which are not in distress, are forbidden to transmit on the 
frequencies in which the distress traffic is taking place.
    (g) Stations following distress traffic that are able to continue 
normal service may do so when the distress traffic is well established 
and on condition that it observes the provisions of paragraph (f) of 
this section and that it does not interfere with distress traffic.
    (h) When distress traffic has ceased on frequencies which have been 
used for distress traffic, the Rescue Coordination Center controlling a 
search and rescue operation must initiate a message for transmission on 
these frequencies indicating that distress traffic has finished.
    (i) In radiotelephony, the message referred to in paragraph (h) of 
this section consists of:
    (1) The distress signal MAYDAY;
    (2) The call ``Hello all stations'' or CQ (spoken as CHARLIE QUEBEC) 
spoken three times;
    (3) The words THIS IS (or DE spoken as DELTA ECHO in the case of 
language difficulties);
    (4) The call sign or other identification of the station sending the 
message;
    (5) The time when the distress situation has ceased;
    (6) The name and call sign of the mobile station which was in 
distress;
    (7) The words SEELONCE FEENEE pronounced as the French words 
``silence fini''
    (j) In direct-printing telegraphy, the message referred to in 
paragraph (h) of this section consists of:
    (1) The distress signal MAYDAY;
    (2) The call CQ;
    (3) The word DE;
    (4) The call sign or other identification of the station sending the 
message;
    (5) The time when distress situation has ceased;
    (6) The name and call sign of the mobile station which was in 
distress; and
    (7) The words SILENCE FINI.

distress and assisting mobile units, and between the mobile units and 
unit coordinating search and rescue operations.
    (b) Control of on-scene communications is the responsibility of the 
unit coordinating search and rescue operations. Simplex communications 
must be used so that all on-scene mobile stations may share relevant 
information concerning the distress incident. If direct-printing 
telegraphy is used, it must be in the forward error-correcting mode in 
accordance with ITU-R Recommendation M.625-3, with Annex, as specified 
in Sec. 80.1101.
    (c) The preferred frequencies in radiotelephony for on-scene 
communications are 156.8 MHz and 2182 kHz. The frequency 2174.5 kHz may 
also be used for ship-to-ship on-scene communications using narrow-band 
direct-printing telegraphy in the forward error correcting mode in 
accordance with ITU-R M.625-3 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
80.7), as specified in Sec. 80.1101.
    (d) In addition to 156.8 MHz and 2182 kHz, the frequencies 3023 kHz, 
4125 kHz, 5680 kHz, 123.1 MHz and 156.3 MHz may be used for ship-to-
aircraft on-scene communications.
    (e) The selection or designation of on-scene frequencies is the 
responsibility of the unit coordinating search and rescue operations. 
Normally, once an on-scene frequency is established, a continuous aural 
or teleprinter watch is maintained by all participating on-scene mobile 
units on the selected frequency.

  <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>35 kHz of the carrier frequency.
\3\ This level is not applicable for intermodulation products.

[[Page 193]]

 
\4\ The upper limit for the excess power for any narrow-band spurious
  emission (excluding intermodulation products within a 30 kHz
  measurement bandwidth) shall be 10 dB above the power limit in this
  table.

    (2) The transmitter emission limit is a function of the modulation

<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.95 x SR............................           40
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where:

SR = Symbol Rate,
SR = 1 x channel rate for BPSK,
SR = 0.5 x channel rate for QPSK.

    The mask shall be defined by drawing straight lines through the 
above points.
    (j) When using G7D for differential GPS in the 112-118 MHz band, the 
amount of power during transmission under all operating conditions when 
measured over a 25 kHz bandwidth centered on either of the second 
adjacent channels shall not exceed -25 dBm and shall decrease 5 dB per 
octave until -52 dBm.
    (k) For VHF aeronautical stations and aircraft stations operating 
with G1D or G7D emissions:
    (1) The amount of power measured across either first adjacent 25 kHz 
channel shall not exceed 2 dBm.
    (2) For stations first installed before January 1, 2002, the amount

octave to a maximum value of -53 dBm.
    (3) The amount of power measured over a 16 kHz channel bandwidth 
centered on the first adjacent 25 kHz channel shall not exceed -18 dBm.
    (l)(1) For Universal Access Transceiver transmitters, the average

maximum emission level contained within the authorized bandwidth by at 
least:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             Attenuation
                      Frequency (MHz)                           (dB)

of 5 Watts or more must limit their emissions by at least 43 + 10 log 
(P) dB on any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 
250% of the authorized bandwidth. Those emissions shall be measured with 
a bandwidth of 100 kHz. P in the above equation is the average 
transmitter power measured within the occupied bandwidth in Watts.
    (3) Universal Access Transceiver transmitters with less than 5 Watts 
of output power must limit their emissions by at least 40 dB relative to 
the carrier peak on any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by 
more than 250% of the authorized bandwidth. Those emissions shall be 
measured with a bandwidth of 100 kHz.

discontinued until it is rendered capable of automatically preventing 
modulation in excess of 100 percent.
    (d) Single sideband transmitters must be able to operate in the 
following modes:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                        Level N(dB) of the carrier with
             Carrier mode                respect to peak envelope power

at least 40 log<INF>10</INF> (f/3) db where ``f'' is the frequency in 
kilohertz. Above 15 kHz, the attenuation must be at least 28 db greater 
than the attenuation at 1 kHz.
    (g) Except that symmetric side bands are not required, the 
modulation characteristics for ELTs must be in accordance with 
specifications contained in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
Technical Standard Order (TSO) Document TSO-C91a titled ``Emergency 
Locator Transmitter (ELT) Equipment'' dated April 29, 1985. TSO-C91a is 
incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a). TSO-C91a 
may be obtained from the Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation 
Administration, Office of Airworthiness, 800 Independence Avenue SW., 
Washington DC 20591.
    (h) ELTs must use A3X emission and may use A3E or NON emissions on 
an optional basis while transmitting. Each transmission of a synthesized 
or recorded voice message from an ELT must be preceded by the words 
``this is a recording''; transmission of A3E or NON emission must not 
exceed 90 seconds; and any transmission of A3E or NON emissions must be 
followed by at least three minutes of A3X emission.
    (i) ELTs manufactured on or after October 1, 1988, must have a 
clearly defined carrier frequency distinct from the modulation sidebands

Sec. 87.143  Transmitter control requirements.

    (a) Each transmitter must be installed so that it is not accessible 
to, or capable of being operated by persons other than those authorized 
by the licensee.
    (b) Each station must be provided with a control point at the 
location of the transmitting equipment, unless otherwise specifically 
authorized. Except for aeronautical enroute stations governed by 
paragraph (e) of this section, a control point is the location at which 
the radio operator is stationed.

[[Page 195]]

It is the position at which the transmitter(s) can immediately be turned 
off.
    (c) Applicants for additional control points at aeronautical 
advisory (unicom) stations must specify the location of each proposed 
control point.
    (d) Except for aeronautical enroute stations governed by paragraph 
(f) of this section, the control point must have the following 
facilities installed:
    (1) A device that indicates when the transmitter is radiating or 
when the transmitter control circuits have been switched on. This 
requirement does not apply to aircraft stations;
    (2) Aurally monitoring of all transmissions originating at dispatch 
points;
    (3) A way to disconnect dispatch points from the transmitter; and
    (4) A way to turn off the transmitter.
    (e) A dispatch point is an operating position subordinate to the 
control point. Dispatch points may be installed without authorization 
from the Commission, and dispatch point operators are not required to be 
licensed.
    (f) In the aeronautical enroute service, the control point for an 
automatically controlled enroute station is the computer facility which 
controls the transmitter. Any computer controlled transmitter must be 
equipped to automatically shut down after 3 minutes of continuous 
transmission of an unmodulated carrier.


<R05>
Sec. 87.145  Acceptability of transmitters for licensing.

    (a) Each transmitter must be certificated for use in these services, 
except as listed in paragraph (c) of this section. However, aircraft 
stations which transmit on maritime mobile frequencies must use 
transmitters certificated for use in ship stations in accordance with 
part 80 of this chapter. Certification under part 80 is not required for 
aircraft earth stations transmitting on maritime mobile-satellite 
frequencies. Such stations must be certificated under part 87.
    (b) Some radio equipment installed on air carrier aircraft must meet 
the requirements of the Commission and the requirements of the FAA. The 
FAA requirements may be obtained from the FAA, Aircraft Maintenance 
Division, 800 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20591.
    (c) The equipment listed below is exempted from certification. The 
operation of transmitters which have not been certificated must not 
result in harmful interference due to the failure of those transmitters 
to comply with technical standards of this subpart.
    (1) Flight test station transmitters for limited periods where 
justified.
    (2) U.S. Government transmitters furnished in the performance of a 
U.S. Government contract if the use of certificated equipment would 
increase the cost of the contract or if the transmitter will be 
incorporated in the finished product. However, such equipment must meet 
the technical standards contained in this subpart.
    (3) ELTs verified in accordance with Sec. 87.147(e).
    (4) Signal generators when used as radionavigation land test 
stations (MTF).
    (d) Aircraft earth stations must correct their transmit frequencies 
for Doppler effect relative to the satellite. The transmitted signal may 
not deviate more than 335 Hz from the desired transmit frequency. (This 
is a root sum square error which assumes zero error for the received 
ground earth station signal and includes the AES transmit/receive 
frequency reference error and the AES automatic frequency control 
residual errors.) The applicant must attest that the equipment provides 
adequate Doppler effect compensation and where applicable, that 
measurements have been made that demonstrate compliance. Submission of 
data demonstrating compliance is not required unless requested by the 
Commission.

Sec. 87.147  Authorization of equipment.

    (a) Certification may be requested by following the procedures in 
part 2 of this chapter. Aircraft transmitters must meet the requirements 
over an ambient temperature range of -20 degrees to +50 degrees Celsius.
    (b) ELTs manufactured after October 1, 1988, must meet the output 
power characteristics contained in Sec. 87.141(i) when tested in 
accordance with the Signal Enhancement Test contained in

[[Page 196]]

subpart N, part 2 of this chapter. A report of the measurements must be 
submitted with each application for certification. ELTs that meet the 
output power characteristics of the section must have a permanent label 
prominently displayed on the outer casing state, ``Meets FCC Rule for 
improved satellite detection.'' This label, however, must not be placed 
on the equipment without authorization to do so by the Commission. 
Application for such authorization may be made either by submission of a 
new application for certification accompanied by the required fee and 
all information and test data required by parts 2 and 87 of this chapter 
or, for ELTs approved prior to October 1, 1988, a letter requesting such 
authorization, including appropriate test data and a showing that all 
units produced under the original equipment authorization comply with 
the requirements of this paragraph without change to the original 
circuitry.
    (c) An applicant for a station license may request certification for 
an individual transmitter by following the procedure in part 2 of this 
chapter. Such a transmitter will be individually certified and so noted 
on the station license.
    (d) An applicant for certification of equipment intended for 
transmission in any of the frequency bands listed in paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section must notify the FAA of the filing of a certification 
application. The letter of notification must be mailed to: FAA, Office 
of Spectrum Policy and Management, ASR-1, 800 Independence Ave., SW., 
Washington, DC 20591 prior to the filing of the application with the 
Commission.
    (1) The notification must describe the equipment, give the 
manufacturer's identification, antenna characteristics, rated output 
power, emission type and characteristics, the frequency or frequencies 
of operation, and essential receiver characteristics if protection is 
required.
    (2) The certification application must include a copy of the 
notification letter to the FAA. The Commission will not act until it 
receives the FAA's determination regarding whether it objects to the 
application for equipment authorization. The FAA should mail its 
determination to: Office of Engineering and Technology Laboratory, 
Authorization and Evaluation Division, 7435 Oakland Mills Rd., Columbia, 
MD 21046. The Commission will consider the FAA determination before 
taking final action on the application.
    (3) The frequency bands are as follows:

90-110 kHz
190-285 kHz
325-435 kHz
74.800 MHz to 75.200 MHz

Sec. 87.151  Special requirements for differential GPS receivers.

    (a) The receiver shall achieve a message failure rate less than or 
equal to one failed message per 1000 full-length (222 bytes) application 
data messages, while operating over a range from -87 dBm to -1 dBm, 
provided that the variation in the average received signal power between 
successive bursts in a given time slot shall not exceed 40 dB. Failed 
messages include those lost by the VHF data receiver system or which do 
not pass the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) after application of the 
forward error correction (FEC).
    (b) The aircraft receiving antenna can be horizontally or vertically 
polarized. Due to the difference in the signal strength of horizontally 
and vertically polarized components of the broadcast signal, the total 
aircraft implementation loss is limited to 15 dB for horizontally 
polarized receiving antennas and 11 dB for vertically polarized 
receiving antennas.
    (c) Desensitization. The receiver shall meet the requirements 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section in the presence of VHF-FM 
broadcast signals in accord with following tables.

    (d) Intermodulation immunity. The receiver shall meet the 
requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section in the presence 
of interference from two-signal, third order intermodulation products of 
two VHF-FM broadcast signals having levels in accordance with the 
following:
    (1) 2N<INF>1</INF> + N<INF>2</INF> + 72 <= 0 for VHF-FM sound 
broadcasting signals in the range 107.7-108 MHz; and
    (2) 2N<INF>1</INF> + N<INF>2</INF> + 3 (24 -20log delta f/0.4) <= 0 
for VHF-FM sound broadcasting signals below 107.7 MHz, where the 
frequencies of the two VHF-FM sound broadcasting signals produce, within 
the receiver, a two signal, third-order intermodulation product on the 
desired VDB frequency.
    (3) In the formulas in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, 
N<INF>1</INF> and N<INF>2</INF> are the levels (dBm) of the two VHF FM 
sound broadcasting signals at the VHF data broadcast (VDB) receiver 
input. Neither level shall exceed the desensitization criteria set forth 
in paragraph (c) of this section. Delta f = 108.1 - f1, where f1 is the 
frequency of N<INF>1</INF>, the VHF FM sound broadcasting signal closer 
to 108.1 MHz.

homing beacon operating only on 121.500 MHz that meets all the 
requirements described in the RTCA Recommended Standards document 
described in paragraph (a) of this section. The 121.500 MHz homing 
beacon must have a continuous duty cycle that may be interrupted during 
the transmission of the 406.0-406.1 MHz signal only.
    (c) Prior to verification of a 406.0-406.1 MHz ELT, the ELT must be 
certified by a test facility recognized by one of the COSPAS/SARSAT 
Partners that the equipment satisfies the design characteristics 
associated with the COSPAS/SARSAT document COSPAS/SARSAT 406 MHz 
Distress Beacon Type Approval Standard (C/S T.007). Additionally, an 
independent test facility must certify that the ELT complies with the 
electrical and environmental standards associated with the RTCA 
Recommended Standards.
    (d) The procedures for verification are contained in subpart J of 
part 2 of this chapter.
    (e) An identification code, issued by the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States Program Manager for 
the 406.0-406.1 MHz COSPAS/SARSAT satellite system, must be programmed 
in each ELT unit to establish a unique identification for each ELT 
station. With each marketable ELT unit the manufacturer or grantee must 
include a postage pre-paid registration card printed with the ELT 
identification code addressed to: NOAA/SARSAT Beacon Registration, E/
SP3, Federal Building 4, Room 3320, 5200 Auth Road, Suitland, MD 20746-
4304. The registration card must request the owner's name, address, 
telephone, type of aircraft, alternate emergency contact, and other 
information as required by NOAA. The registration card must also contain 
information regarding the availability to register the ELT at NOAA's 
online Web-based registration database at: http://
www.beaconregistration.noaa.gov. Further, the following statement must 
be included: ``WARNING `` Failure to register this ELT with NOAA before 
installation could result in a monetary forfeiture being issued to the 
owner.''
    (f) To enhance protection of life and property, it is mandatory that 
each 406.0-406.1 MHz ELT must be registered with NOAA before 
installation and that information be kept up-to-date. In addition to the 
identification plate or

label requirements contained in Sec. Sec. 2.925 and 2.926 of this 
chapter, each 406.0-406.1 MHz ELT must be provided on the outside with a 
clearly discernable permanent plate or label containing the following 
statement: ``The owner of this 406.0-406.1 MHz ELT must register the 
NOAA identification code contained on this label with the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), whose address is: NOAA/
SARSAT Beacon Registration, E/SP3, Federal Building 4, Room 3320, 5200 
Auth Road, Suitland, MD 20746-4304.'' Aircraft owners shall advise NOAA 
in writing upon change of aircraft or ELT ownership, or any other change 
in registration information. Fleet operators must notify NOAA upon 
transfer of ELT to another aircraft outside of the owner's control, or 
an other change in registration information. NOAA will provide 
registrants with proof of registration and change of registration 
postcards.
    (g) For 406.0-406.1 MHz ELTs whose identification code can be 
changed after manufacture, the identification code shown on the plant or 
label must be easily replaceable using commonly available tools.

           Subpart G_Aeronautical Advisory Stations (Unicoms)


<R05>
Sec. 87.213  Scope of service.

    (a) An aeronautical advisory station (unicom) must provide service 
to any aircraft station upon request and without discrimination. A 
unicom must provide impartial information concerning available ground 
services.
    (b)(1) Unicom transmissions must be limited to the necessities of 
safe and expeditious operation of aircraft such as condition of runways, 
types of fuel available, wind conditions, weather information, 
dispatching, or other necessary information. At any airport at which a 
control tower, control tower remote communications outlet station (RCO) 
or FAA flight service station is located, unicoms must not transmit 
information pertaining to the conditions of runways, wind conditions, or 
weather information during the hours of operation of the control tower, 
RCO or FAA service station.
    (2) On a secondary basis, unicoms may transmit communications which 
pertain to the efficient portal-to-portal transit of an aircraft, such 
as requests for ground transportation, food or lodging.
    (3) Communications between unicoms and air carrier must be limited 
to the necessities of safety of life and property.
    (4) Unicoms may communicate with aeronautical utility stations and 
ground vehicles concerning runway conditions and safety hazards on the 
airport when neither a control tower nor FAA flight service station is 
in operation.
    (c) Unicoms must not be used for air traffic control (ATC) purposes 
other than to relay ATC information between the pilot and air traffic 
controller. Relaying of ATC information is limited to the following:
    (1) Revisions of proposed departure time;
    (2) Takeoff, arrival or flight plan cancellation time;
    (3) ATC clearances, provided a letter of agreement is obtained from 
the FAA by the licensee of the unicom.

<R05>
Sec. 87.215  Supplemental eligibility.

    (a) A unicom and any associated dispatch or control points must be 
located on the airport to be served.
    (b) Only one unicom will be authorized to operate at an airport 
which does not have a control tower, RCO or FAA flight service station 
that operates on the published common traffic advisory frequency. At any 
other airport, the one unicom limitation does not apply, and the airport 
operator and all aviation services organizations may be licensed to 
operate a unicom on the assigned frequency.
    (c) At an airport where only one unicom may be licensed, eligibility 
for new unicom licenses is restricted to State or local government 
entities, and to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that are 
authorized to apply for the license by a State or local government 
entity whose primary mission is the provision of public safety services.

[[Page 209]]

All applications submitted by NGOs must be accompanied by a new, written 
certification of support (for the NGO applicant to operate the applied 
for station) by the state or local government entity. Applications for a 
unicom license at the same airport, where only one unicom may be 
licensed, that are filed by two or more applicants meeting these 
eligibility criteria must be resolved through settlement or technical 
amendment.
    (d) At an airport where only one unicom may be licensed, the license 
may be assigned or transferred only to an entity meeting the 
requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (e) An applicant for renewal of a unicom license shall be granted a 
presumptive renewal expectancy regardless of whether the applicant is 
eligible for a new unicom license under paragraph (c) of this section. 
Unless the renewal expectancy is defeated, applications that are 
mutually exclusive with the renewal application will not be accepted. 
The renewal expectancy may be defeated only upon a determination, 
following a hearing duly designated on the basis of a petition to deny 
or on the Commission's own motion, that the renewal applicant has not 
provided substantial service. For purposes of this paragraph, 
substantial service means service which is sound, favorable, and 
substantially above a level of mediocre service during the applicant's 
past license term. If the renewal expectancy is defeated, the renewal 
application will be dismissed unless the renewal applicant is eligible 
for a new unicom license pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) At an airport where only one unicom may be licensed, when the 
Commission believes that the unicom has been abandoned or has ceased 
operation, another unicom may be licensed on an interim basis pending 
final determination of the status of the original unicom. An applicant 
for an interim license must notify the present licensee and must comply 
with the notice requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.
    (g) An applicant for a unicom license, renewal or modification of 
frequency assignment at an airport which does not have a control tower, 
RCO or FAA flight service station must notify in writing the owner of 
the airport and all aviation service organizations located at the 
airport. The notice must include the applicant's name and address, the 
name of the airport and a statement that the applicant intends to file 
an application with the Commission for a unicom. The notice must be 
given within the ten days preceding the filing of the application with 
the Commission. Each applicant must certify upon application that either 
notice has been given and include the date of notification, or notice is 
not required because the applicant owns the airport and there are no 
organizations that should be notified.

<R05>
Sec. 87.219  Automatic operations.

    (a) A station operator need not be present when an automated unicom 
is in operation.
    (b) Unicoms operating in an automated mode must comply with the 
requirements of paragraphs (1)-(5) of this section, in addition to the 
requirements applicable to non-automated unicom operations.
    (1) An automated unicom must transmit only in response to 
interrogating signals from aircraft, including but not limited to the 
brief keyed RF signals specified in Sec. 87.187(y).

[[Page 210]]

    (2) An automated unicom must monitor the unicom frequency prior to 
transmission, and provide a brief delay between the aircraft's 
interrogating signal and the automatic unicom's response.
    (3) Automated advisory transmissions must be as brief as possible, 
and must never exceed one minute in length.
    (4) An automated unicom may not provide weather information at an 
airport that has an operational, FAA-certified, automatic weather 
facility, unless the unicom itself is certified by the FAA.
    (5) If weather information is provided by an automated unicom:
    (i) Weather sensors must be placed in order to adequately represent 
the weather conditions at the airport(s) to be served;
    (ii) The weather information must be proceeded by the word 
``advisory;''
    (iii) The phrase ``automated advisory'' must be included when the 
weather information was gathered by real-time sensors or within the last 
minute; and,
    (iv) The time and date of the last update must be included when the 
weather information was not gathered within the last minute.
    (c) Only one automated unicom may be operated at an uncontrolled 
airport. Prior to the operation of an automated unicom at an airport 
with more than one unicom licensee, all of the licensees at that airport 
must sign a letter of agreement stating which licensee(s) control the 
automated unicom operations, and, if control is to be shared among 
several operators, how that control will be divided or scheduled. The 
original or a copy of the letter of agreement must be kept with each 
licensees' station records. Within 90 days of the date upon which a new 
unicom operator is licensed at an airport where more than one unicom is 
authorized, and an automated unicom is being operated, an amended letter 
of agreement that includes the new licensee's signature must be signed 
or automated unicom operations must cease.

<R05>
Sec. 87.237  Scope of service.

    (a) The communications of an aeronautical multicom station 
(multicom) must pertain to activities of a temporary, seasonal or 
emergency nature involving aircraft in flight. Communications are 
limited to directing or coordinating ground activities from the air or 
aerial activities from the ground. Air-to-air communications will be 
authorized if the communications are directly connected with the air-to-
ground or ground-to-air activities described above. Multicom 
communications must not include those air/ground communications provided 
for elsewhere in this part.
    (b) If there is not unicom and an applicant is unable to meet the 
requirements for a unicom license, the applicant will be eligible for a 
multicom license.
    (1) The multicom license becomes invalid when a unicom is 
established at the landing area.
    (2) Multicoms must not be used for ATC purposes other than the relay 
of ATC information between the pilot and air traffic controller. 
Relaying of ATC information is limited to the following:
    (i) Revisions of proposed departure time;
    (ii) Takeoff, arrival flight plan cancellation time;
    (iii) ATC clearances, provided a letter of agreement is obtained 
from the FAA by the licensee of the multicom.
    (3) Communications by a multicom must be limited to the safe and 
expeditious operation of private aircraft, pertaining to the conditions 
of runways, types of fuel available, wind conditions, weather 
information, dispatching or other information. On a secondary basis, 
multicoms may transmit communictions which pertain to efficient portal-
to-portal transit of an aircraft such as requests for ground 
transportation, food or lodging.


<R05>
Sec. 87.239  Supplemental eligibility.

    Each applicant for a multicom may be required to demonstrate why 
such a

     Subpart I_Aeronautical Enroute and Aeronautical Fixed Stations

                      Aeronautical Enroute Stations


<R05>
Sec. 87.261  Scope of service.

    (a) Aeronautical enroute stations provide operational control 
communications to aircraft along domestic or international air routes. 
Operational control communications include the safe, efficient and 
economical operation of aircraft, such as fuel, weather, position 
reports, aircraft performance, and essential services and supplies. 
Public correspondence is prohibited.
    (b) Service must be provided to any aircraft station licensee who 
makes cooperative arrangements for the operation, maintenance and 
liability of the stations which are to furnish enroute service. In 
emergency or distress situations service must be provided without prior 
arrangements.
    (c) Except in Alaska, only one aeronautical enroute station licensee 
will be authorized at any one location. In Alaska, only one aeronautical 
enroute station licensee in the domestic service and one aeronautical 
enroute station licensee in the international service will be authorized 
at any one location. (Because enroute stations may provide service over 
a large area containing a number of air routes or only provide 
communications in the local area of an airport, location here means the 
area which can be adequately served by the particular station.)
    (d) In Alaska, only stations which serve scheduled air carriers will 
be licensed to operate aeronautical enroute stations. Applicants must 
show that the station will provide communications only along routes 
served by scheduled air carriers.
    (e) Mobile units may be operated under an aeronautical enroute 
station authorization so long as the units are limited to use at an 
airport and are only used to communicate with aircraft on the ground or 
the associated aeronautical enroute station. Mobile units are further 
limited to operation on the VHF frequencies listed in 87.263(a)(1).
    (f) Mobile units licensed under paragraph (e) of this section shall 
not be operated on air traffic control frequencies, nor cause harmful 
interference to, communications on air traffic control frequencies.

Planning (SARDA).


<R05>
Sec. 87.395  Plan for the Security Control of Air Traffic and Air
Navigation Aids (Short Title: SCATANA).

    (a) The Plan for the Security Control of Air Traffic and Air 
Navigation Aids (SCATANA) is promulgated in furtherance of the Federal 
Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, the Communications Act and Executive 
Order 11490, as amended. SCATANA defines the responsibilities of the 
Commission for the security control of non-Federal air navigation aids.
    (b) Under the responsibilities defined in SCATANA, an FCC Support 
Plan for the Security Control of Non-Federal Air Navigation Aids has 
been developed by the Commission. The FCC Support Plan defines 
responsibilities, procedures, and instructions in consonance with 
SCATANA which will effect control of non-Federal air navigation aids 
when SCATANA is implemented. It permits the use of such navigation aids 
by aircraft of military and civil agencies when SCATANA is implemented. 
The FCC Support Plan highlights those parts of SCATANA which deal 
specifically with non-Federal air navigation aids. SCATANA and the FCC 
Support Plan apply to radionavigation stations authorized by the 
Commission in the following manner:
    (1) All licensees are subject to restrictions imposed by appropriate 
military authorities pursuant to SCATANA and the FCC Support Plan when 
an Air Defense Emergency or Defense Emergency exists or is imminent. The 
restrictions will be imposed through FAA Air Route Traffic Control 
Centers (ARTCCs).
    (2) All licensees of aeronautical radionavigation (VOR/DME, ILS, 
MLS, LF and MF non-directional beacons) stations will comply with 
SCATANA implementation instructions from FAA ARTCCs as follows:
    (i) Shut down the above navigation aids as directed. These 
instructions will permit time to land or disperse airborne aircraft, and 
will permit extension of time when the air traffic situation dictates.

[[Page 220]]

    (ii) Shut down as soon as possible stations which require more than 
five minutes control time, unless directed otherwise or unless such 
stations are essential for the handling of existing air traffic.
    (iii) Operate aeronautical radionavigation stations to ensure that 
required stations, as indicated in flight plans, will be available for 
authorized aircraft flights.
    (3) Licensees of aeronautical radionavigation stations will be 
notified of the reduction or removal of SCATANA restrictions by FAA 
ARTCCs when notice of the termination is issued.
    (4) Licensees of aeronautical radionavigation stations may 
voluntarily participate in SCATANA tests as requested by an ARTCC. 
SCATANA testing must not interrupt the normal service of non-Federal air 
navigation aids.


<R05>
Sec. 87.397  Emergency operations.

    (a) The licensee of any land station in the Aviation services, 
during a local emergency involving the safety of life and property may 
communicate in a manner other than that specified in the license (See 
Sec. 87.395). Such emergency operations may include operation at other 
locations or with equipment not specified in the license or by 
unlicensed personnel provided that:
    (1) Such operations are under the control and supervision of the 
station licensee,
    (2) The emergency use is discontinued as soon as practicable upon 
termination of the emergency,
    (3) In no event shall any station transmit on frequencies other than 
or with power in excess of that specified in the license,
    (4) The details of the emergency must be retained with the station 
license, and
    (5) At a controlled airport these communications must be coordinated 
with the FAA.
    (b) The unicom frequencies listed in subpart G may also be used for 
communications with private aircraft engaged in organized civil defense 
activities in preparation for, during an enemy attack or immediately 
after an enemy attack. When used for these purposes, unicoms may be 
moved from place to place or operated at unspecified locations, except 
at landing areas served by other unicoms or control towers.
    (c) In any case in which a license for unattended operation has been 
granted, the Commission may at any time, for national defense, modify 
the license.


<R04>
                Subpart O_Airport Control Tower Stations


<R05>
Sec. 87.417  Scope of service.

    (a) Airport control tower stations (control towers) and control 
tower remote communications outlet stations (RCOs) must limit their 
communications to the necessities of safe and expeditious operations of 
aircraft operating on or in the vicinity of the airport. Control towers 
and RCOs provide air traffic control services to aircraft landing, 
taking off and taxing on the airport as well as aircraft transiting the 
airport traffic area. Additionally, control towers and RCOs can provide 
air traffic control services to vehicles operating on airport movement 
areas (see subpart L of this part). Control towers and RCOs must serve 
all aircraft without discrimination. An RCO must be remotely operated 
from a control tower or other FAA control facility located at a nearby 
airport.
    (b) A control tower must maintain a continuous watch on the 
following frequencies during the hours of operation:

121.500 MHz
3023.0 kHz (Alaska only)
5680.0 kHz (Alaska only)

    The Commission may exempt from these watch requirements the licensee 
of an airport control tower station if a satisfactory showing has been 
made that such an exemption will not adversely affect life and property 
in the air.

Sec. 87.477  Condition of grant for radionavigation land stations.

    Radionavigation land stations may be designated by the FAA as part 
of the National Airspace System. Stations so designated will be required 
to serve the public under IFT conditions. This condition of grant is 
applicable to all radionavigation land stations.


<R05>
Sec. 87.479  Harmful interference to radionavigation land stations.

    (a) Military or other Government stations have been authorized to 
establish wide-band systems using frequency-hopping spread spectrum 
techniques in the 960-1215 MHz band. Authorization for a Joint Tactical 
Information Distribution Systems (JTIDS) has been permitted on the basis 
of non-interference to the established aeronautical radionavigation 
service in this band. In order to accommodate the requirements for the 
system within the band, restrictions are imposed. Transmissions will be 
automatically prevented if:
    (1) The frequency-hopping mode fails to distribute the JTIDS 
spectrum uniformly across the band;
    (2) The radiated pulse varies from the specified width of 6.4 
microseconds <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5%;
    (3) The energy radiated within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>7 MHz of 1030 
and 1090 MHz exceeds a level of 60 dB below the peak of the JTIDS 
spectrum as measured in a 300 kHz bandwidth. The JTIDS will be 
prohibited from transmitting if the time slot duty factor exceeds a 20 
percent duty factor for any single user and a 40 percent composite duty 
factor for all JTIDS emitters in a geographic area.
    (b) If radionavigation systems operating in the 960-1215 MHz band 
experience interference or unexplained loss of equipment performance, 
the situation must be reported immediately to the nearest office of the 
FAA, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, 
Washington, DC 20504, or the nearest Federal Communications Commission 
field office. The following information must be provided to the extent 
available:
    (1) Name, call sign and category of station experiencing the 
interference;
    (2) Date and time of occurrence;
    (3) Geographical location at time of occurrence;
    (4) Frequency interfered with;
    (5) Nature of interference; and
    (6) Other particulars.

Sec. 87.481  Unattended operation of domestic radiobeacon stations.

    (a) Radiobeacons may be licensed for unattended operation. An 
applicant must comply with the following:
    (1) The transmitter is crystal controlled and specifically designed 
for radiobeacon service and capable of transmitting by self-actuating 
means;
    (2) The emissions of the transmitter must be continuously monitored 
by a licensed operator, or by a direct positive automatic monitor, 
supplemented by aural monitoring at suitable intervals;
    (3) If as a result of aural monitoring it is determined that a 
deviation from the terms of the station license has occurred, the 
transmitters must be disabled immediately by a properly authorized 
person. If automatic monitoring is used, the monitor must insure that 
the operation of the transmitter meets the license terms or is disabled;
    (4) A properly authorized person must be able to reach the 
transmitter and disable it in a reasonable amount of time, so as not to 
adversely affect life or property in the air;
    (5) The equipment must be inspected at least every 180 days. Results 
of inspections must be kept in the station maintenance records;
    (6) The transmitter is not operable by or accessible to, other than 
authorized persons;
    (7) The transmitter is in a remote location.
    (b) Authority for unattended operation must be expressly stated in 
the station license.

Sec. 87.529  Frequencies.

    Prior to submitting an application, each applicant must notify the 
applicable FAA Regional Frequency Management Office. Each application 
must be accompanied by a statement showing the name of the FAA Regional 
Office and date notified. The Commission will assign the frequency. 
Normally, frequencies available for air traffic control operations set 
forth in subpart E will be assigned to an AWOS, ASOS, or to an ATIS. 
When a licensee has entered into an agreement with the FAA to operate 
the same station as both an AWOS and as an ATIS, or as an ASOS and an 
ATIS, the same frequency will be used in both modes of operation.

Sec. 90.15  Scope.

    The Public Safety Radio Pool covers the licensing of the radio 
communications of governmental entities and the following category of 
activities: Medical services, rescue organizations, veterinarians, 
persons with disabilities, disaster relief organizations, school buses, 
beach patrols, establishments in isolated places, communications standby 
facilities, and emergency repair of public communications facilities. 
Entities not meeting these eligibility criteria may also be licensed in 
the Public Safety Radio Pool solely to provide service to eligibles on 
one-way paging-only frequencies below 800 MHz, i.e., those frequencies 
with the assignment limitations appearing at Sec. 90.20(d)(13) or 
(d)(60). Private carrier systems licensed on other channels prior to 
June 1, 1990, may continue to provide radio communications service to 
eligibles. Rules as to eligibility for licensing, frequencies available, 
permissible communications and classes and number of stations, and any 
special requirements are set forth in the following sections.


<R05>
Sec. 90.16  Public Safety National Plan.

    The Commission has established a National Plan which specifies 
special policies and procedures governing the Public Safety Pool 
(formally Public Safety Radio Services and the Special Emergency Radio 
Service). The National Plan is contained in the Report and Order in 
General Docket No. 87-112. The principal spectrum resource for the 
National Plan is the 806-809 MHz and the 851-854 MHz bands at locations 
farther then 110 km (68.4 miles) from the U.S./Mexico border and 140 km 
(87 miles) from the U.S./Canadian border (``border regions''). In the 
border regions, the principal spectrum for the National Plan may be 
different. The National plan establishes planning regions covering all 
parts of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. No 
assignments will be made in the spectrum designated for the National 
Plan until a regional plan for the area has been accepted by the 
Commission.

    (g) Former public correspondence working channel in the maritime VHF 
(156-162 MHz) band allocated for public safety use in 33 inland Economic 
Areas. (1) We define service areas in the marine VHF (156-162 MHz) band 
by forty-two geographic areas called VHF Public Coast Service Areas 
(VPCSAs). See Sec. 80.371(c)(1)(ii) of this chapter (Public 
correspondence frequencies). VPCSAs are based on, and composed of one or 
more of, the U.S. Department of Commerce's 172 Economic Areas (EAs). See 
60 Fed Reg. 13114 (Mar. 10, 1995). You may inspect and copy maps of the 
EAs and VPCSAs at the FCC Reference Center, Room CY A-257, 445 12th St., 
SW., Washington, DC 20554. These maps and data are also available on the 
FCC website at http://www.fcc.gov/oet/info/maps/areas/. We number public 
correspondence channels in the maritime VHF (156-162 MHz) band as 
channels 24 to 28 and channels 84 to 88. Each channel number represents 
a channel pair. See Sec. 80.371(c) of this chapter.
    (2) In VHF Public Coast Service Areas (VPCSAs) 10-42, the duplex 
channel pair 157.250 MHz/161.850 MHz (VHF Maritime Channel 25) is 
allocated for public safety use by entities eligible for licensing under 
paragraph (a) of this section, and is designated primarily for the 
purpose of interoperability communications. See 47 CFR 80.371(c)(1)(ii) 
for the definitions of VPCSAs.
    (i) The channel pair 157.250 MHz/161.850 MHz was formerly allocated 
and assigned (under Sec. 80.371(c) (1997) of this chapter) as a public 
correspondence working channel in the maritime VHF 156-162 MHz band, and 
was also shared (under former Sec. 90.283 (1997) of this chapter) with 
private land mobile stations, including grandfathered public safety 
licensees. Thus, there are grandfathered licensees nationwide (maritime 
and private land mobile radio stations, including by rule waiver) 
operating on this channel both inside and outside of VPCSAs 10-42.
    (ii) The channel pairs 157.225 MHz/161.825 MHz and 157.275 MHz/
161.875 MHz were formerly allocated and assigned under this section as 
public safety interoperability channels but were reallocated for 
assignment as VHF public coast station channels under Sec. 80.371(c) of 
this chapter. Public safety operations licensed on these channels as of 
March 2, 2009 or licensed pursuant to an application filed prior to

corporate eligibility is not subject to the cooperative use provision of 
Sec. 90.179.
    (b) Eligibility is also provided for a nonprofit corporation or 
association that is organized for the purpose of furnishing a radio 
communications service to persons who meet the eligibility requirements 
of the Industrial/Business Pool. Such use is subject to the cooperative 
use provisions of Sec. 90.179.


<R05>
Sec. 90.35  Industrial/Business Pool.

    (a) Eligibility. Persons primarily engaged in any of the following 
activities are eligible to hold authorizations in the Industrial/
Business Pool to provide

[[Page 271]]

commercial mobile radio service as defined in part 20 of this chapter or 
to operate stations for transmission of communications necessary to such 
activities of the licensee:
    (1) The operation of a commercial activity;
    (2) The operation of educational, philanthropic, or ecclesiastical 
institutions;
    (3) Clergy activities; or
    (4) The operation of hospitals, clinics, or medical associations.
    (5) Public Safety Pool eligibles are eligible for Industrial/
Business Pool spectrum only to The extent that they are engaged in 
activities listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section. 
Industrial/Business Pool spectrum many not be utilized for the purposes 
set forth in Sec. 90.20(a).
    (b) Industrial/Business Pool frequencies. (1) The following table 
indicates frequencies available for assignment to Industrial/Business 
Pool stations, together with the class of station(s) to which they are 
normally assigned, the specific assignment limitations which are 
explained in paragraph (b) of this section, and the certified frequency 
coordinator for each frequency:
    (2) Unless otherwise specified, coordination of frequencies in the 
Industrial/Business pool must be done in accordance with the following:
    (i) Unless specified elsewhere in this part, frequencies without any 
coordinator specified in the Coordinator column of paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section may be coordinated by any frequency coordinator certified 
in the Industrial/Business Pool.
    (ii) A letter symbol in the Coordinator column of the frequency 
table in paragraph (b)(3) of this section designates the mandatory 
certified frequency coordinator for the associated frequency in the 
table. However, any coordinator certified in the Industrial/Business 
Pool may coordinate applications on such frequencies provided the prior 
written consent of the designated coordinator is obtained. Frequencies 
for which two coordinators are listed may be coordinated by either of 
the listed coordinators.
    (iii) For frequencies above 150 MHz, applications for new or 
modified facilities on frequencies shared prior to radio service 
consolidation by the former Manufacturers Radio Service, the Forest 
Products Radio Service, the Power Radio Service, the Petroleum Radio 
Service, the Motor Carrier Radio Service, the Railroad Radio Service, 
the Telephone Maintenance Radio Service and the Automobile Emergency 
Radio Service may be coordinated by any certified Industrial/Business 
Pool coordinator. However, in the event that the interference contour of 
a proposed station would overlap the service contour of an existing 
station licensed on one of these previously shared frequencies, the 
written concurrence of the coordinator associated with the industry for 
which the existing station license was issued, or the written 
concurrence of the licensee of the existing station, shall be obtained. 
For the purposes of this Sec. 90.35, the service contour for UHF 
stations is the 39 dBu contour; and the interference contour for UHF 
stations is the 21 dBu contour; the service contour for VHF stations is 
the 37 dBu contour; and the interference contour for VHF stations is the 
19 dBu contour.
    (iv) The letter symbols listed in the Coordinator column of the 
frequency table in paragraph (b)(3) of this section refer to specific 
frequency coordinators as follows:

IP--Petroleum Coordinator
IW--Power Coordinator
LR--Railroad Coordinator
LA--Automobile Emergency Coordinator

    (c) Explanation of assignment limitations appearing in the frequency 
table of paragraph (b) of this section:
    (1) This frequency band is shared with and stations operating in 
this frequency band in this service are on a secondary basis to stations 
licensed in the Maritime Mobile Service.
    (2) This frequency band is shared with and stations operating in 
this frequency band in this service are on a secondary basis to the 
LORAN Navigation System; all operations are limited to radiolocation 
land stations in accordance with footnote US104, Sec. 2.106 of this 
chapter.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (4) The non-Federal Government radiolocation service in this band is 
on a secondary basis to stations in the aeronautical radionavigation 
service operating on 1708 kHz.
    (5) Station assignments on frequencies in this band will be made 
subject to the conditions that the maximum output power shall not exceed 
375 watts and the maximum authorized bandwidth shall not exceed 2 kHz.
    (6) Because of the operation of stations having priority on the same 
or adjacent frequencies in this or in other countries, frequency 
assignments in this band may either be unavailable or may be subject to 
certain technical or operational limitations. Therefore, applications 
for frequency assignments in this band shall include information 
concerning the transmitter output

[[Page 309]]

power, the type and directional characteristics of the antenna and the 
minimum hours of operation (GMT).
    (7) [Reserved]
    (8) Frequencies in this band may only be assigned to radiolocation 
stations which are also assigned frequencies in the 1605-1800 kHz band, 
provided the use of frequencies in this band is necessary for the proper 
functioning of the particular radiolocation system. Operations in this 
band are on a secondary basis to stations operating in accordance with 
the Commission's table of frequency allocations contained in Sec. 2.106 
of this chapter.
    (9) This band is allocated to the Radiolocation Service on a 
secondary basis to other fixed or mobile services and must accept any 
harmful interference that may be experienced from such services or from 
the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) equipment operating in 
accordance with part 18 of this chapter. In the 2483.5-2500 MHz band, no 
applications for new or modification to existing stations to increase 
the number of transmitters will be accepted. Existing licensees as of 
July 25, 1985, or on a subsequent date following as a result of 
submitting an application for license on or before July 25, 1985, are 
grandfathered and their operation is co-primary with the 
Radiodetermination Satellite Service.
    (10) Speed measuring devices will not be authorized in this band.
    (11) This frequency band is shared with and is on a secondary basis 
to the Maritime Radionavigation Stations (part 80) and to the Government 
Radiolocation Service.
    (12) This frequency is shared with and is on a secondary basis to 
the Government Radiolocation Service.
    (13) Operations in this band are limited to survey operations using 
transmitters with a peak power not to exceed 5 watts into the antenna.
    (14) This frequency band is shared with and is on a secondary basis 
to the Aeronautical Radionavigation Service (part 87) and to the 
Government Radiolocation Service.
    (15) The non-Government Radiolocation Service in this band is 
secondary to the Maritime Radionavigation Stations (part 80), the 
Aeronautical Radionavigation Service (part 87) and the Government 
Radiolocation Service.
    (16) This frequency band is shared with and is on a secondary basis 
to the Maritime Radionavigation Stations (part 80) and the Government 
Meteorological Aids Service.
    (17) Operation in this frequency band is on a secondary basis to 
airborne Doppler radars at 8800 MHz.
    (18) Radiolocation installations will be coordinated with the 
Government Meteorological Aids Service, and insofar as practicable, will 
be adjusted to meet the needs of that service.
    (19) Operations in this band are on a secondary basis to the Amateur 
Radio Service (part 97). Pulsed emissions are prohibited.
    (20) This band is restricted to radiolocation systems using type N0N 
emission with a power not to exceed 40 watts into the antenna.
    (21) Non-Government radiolocation stations in the band are secondary 
to the Government Radiolocation Service, the Amateur Radio Service and 
the Amateur-Satellite Service. Pulse-ranging radiolocation stations in 
this band may be authorized along the shorelines of Alaska and the 
contiguous 48 states. Radiolocation stations using spread spectrum 
techniques may be authorized in the band 420-435 MHz for operation 
within the contiguous 48 states and Alaska. Also, stations using spread 
spectrum techniques shall be limited to a maximum output power of 50 
watts, shall be subject to the applicable technical standards in Sec. 
90.209 until such time as more definitive standards are adopted by the 
Commission and shall identify in accordance with Sec. 90.425(c)(2). 
Authorizations will be granted on a case-by-case basis; however, 
operations proposed to be located within the zones set forth in footnote 
US217, Sec. 2.106 of this chapter should not expect to be accommodated.
    (22) For frequencies 2455 MHz, 10,525 MHz, and 24,125 MHz, only 
unmodulated, continuous wave (NON) emission shall be employed. The 
frequency 24.10 GHz, and frequencies in the 24.20-24.25 GHz band may use 
NON emission along with an ancillary FM digital emission. The frequency 
24.10 GHz will be used for the purpose of alerting motorists of 
hazardous driving

[[Page 310]]

conditions and the presence of emergency vehicles. Equipment operating 
on 24.10 GHz must keep the deviation of the FM digital signal within 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 MHz. Equipment operating on this frequency must 
have a frequency stability of at least 2000 ppm and is exempt from the 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 90.403(c), 90.403(f), and 90.429 of this 
part.
    (23) Devices designed to operate as field disturbance sensors on 
frequencies between 2450 and 2500 MHz with a field strength equal to or 
less than 50,000 microvolts per meter at 30 meters, on a fundamental 
frequency, will not be licensed or certificated for use under this part. 
Such equipment must comply with the requirements for field disturbance 
sensors as set forth in part 15 of this chapter.
    (24) Devices designed to operate as field disturbance sensors on 
frequencies between 10,500 and 10,550 MHz and between 24,050 and 24,250 
MHz, with field strength equal to or less than 250,000 microvolts per 
meter at 30 meters, on the fundamental frequency, will not be licensed 
or certificated for use under this part. Such equipment must comply with 
the requirements for field disturbance sensors as set forth in part 15 
of this chapter.
    (25) Station assignments on frequencies in this band will be made 
subject to the conditions that the maximum output power shall not exceed 
375 watts and the maximum authorized bandwidth shall not exceed 1.0 kHz.
    (26) Each frequency assignment in this band is on an exclusive basis 
within the primary service area to which assigned. The primary service 
area is the area where the signal intensities are adequate for 
radiolocation purposes from all stations in the radiolocation system of 
which the station in question is a part; that is, the primary service 
area of the station coincides with the primary service area of the 
system. The normal minimum geographical separation between stations of 
different licensees shall be at least 1931 km (1200 miles) when the 
stations are operated on the same frequency or on different frequencies 
separated by less than 1.0 kHz. Where geographical separation of less 
than 1931 km (1200 miles) is requested under these circumstances, it 
must be shown that the desired separation will result in a protection 
ratio of at least 20 decibels throughout the primary service area of 
other stations.
    (27) Notwithstanding the bandwidth limitations otherwise set forth 
in this section of the rules, wideband systems desiring to operate in 
this band may use such bandwidth as is necessary for proper operation of 
the system provided that the field strength does not exceed 120 
microvolts per meter per square root Hertz (120 uv/m/Hz\1/2\) at 1.6 km 
(1 mile). Such wideband operations shall be authorized on a secondary 
basis to stations operating within otherwise applicable technical 
standards. Applications for wideband systems in this band will be 
accepted beginning December 15, 1985.
    (28) Until July 1, 1988, this band will be available only for 
licensees of existing systems operating in the 1605-1705 kHz portion of 
the 1605-1715 kHz band requesting modification of their authorizations 
to change frequencies to this band and for licensees of wideband 
systems. On July 1, 1988, requests for new station authorizations in 
this band will be accepted and, if necessary, will be subject to the 
random selection procedures outlined in Sec. 1.972 of the Commission's 
Rules.
    (29) This frequency band is shared with and is on secondary basis to 
the Fixed-Satellite Service and to the Government's Radiolocation, Space 
Research and Earth Exploration-Satellite Services. After January 1, 
2000, the Government's Space Research and Earth Exploration-Satellite 
Services shall operate on a co-equal secondary basis with the non-
Government Radiolocation Service, except that grandfathered space 
stations in the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System shall continue 
to be protected from harmful interference.
    (d) Other additional frequencies available. Radiolocation stations 
in this service may be authorized, on request, to use frequencies 
allocated exclusively to Federal Government stations, in those instances 
where the Commission finds, after consultation with the appropriate 
Government agency or agencies, that such assignment is necessary

[[Page 311]]

or required for coordination with Government activities.

<R05>
Sec. 90.155  Time in which station must be placed in operation.

    (a) All stations authorized under this part, except as provided in 
Sec. Sec. 90.528, 90.529, 90.629, 90.631(f), 90.665, 90.685, and 
90.1209, must be placed in operation within twelve (12) months from the 
date of grant or the authorization cancels automatically and must be 
returned to the Commission.
    (b) A local government entity in the Public Safety Pool, applying 
for any frequency in this part, may also seek extended implementation 
authorization pursuant to Sec. 90.629.
    (c) For purposes of this section, a base station is not considered 
to be placed in operation unless at least one associated mobile station 
is also placed in operation. See also Sec. Sec. 90.633(d) and 
90.631(f).
    (d) Multilateration LMS EA-licensees, authorized in accordance with 
Sec. 90.353, must construct and place in operation a sufficient number 
of base stations that utilize multilateration technology (see paragraph 
(e) of this section) to provide multilateration location service to one-
third of the EA's population within five years of initial license grant, 
and two-thirds of the population within ten years. Licensees may, in the 
alternative, provide substantial service to their licensed area within 
the appropriate five- and ten-year benchmarks. In demonstrating 
compliance with the construction and coverage requirements, the 
Commission will allow licensees to individually determine an appropriate 
field strength for reliable service, taking into account the 
technologies employed in their system design and other relevant 
technical factors. At the five- and ten-year benchmarks, licensees will 
be required to file a map and FCC Form 601 showing compliance with the 
coverage requirements (see Sec. 1.946 of this chapter).
    (e) A multilateration LMS station will be considered constructed and 
placed in operation if it is built in accordance with its authorized 
parameters and is regularly interacting with one or more other stations 
to provide location service, using multilateration technology, to one or 
more mobile units. Specifically, LMS multilateration stations will only 
be considered constructed and placed in operation if they are part of a 
system that can interrogate a mobile, receive the response at 3 or more 
sites, compute the location from the time of arrival of the responses 
and transmit the location either back to the mobile or to a subscriber's 
fixed site.
    (f) For purposes of this section, a station licensed to provide 
commercial mobile radio service is not considered to have commenced 
service unless it provides service to at least one unaffiliated party.
    (g) Application for extension of time to commence service may be 
made on FCC Form 601. Extensions of time must be filed prior to the 
expiration of the construction period. Extensions will be

[[Page 315]]

granted only if the licensee shows that the failure to commence service 
is due to causes beyond its control. No extensions will be granted for 
delays caused by lack of financing, lack of site availability, for the 
assignment or transfer of control of an authorization, or for failure to 
timely order equipment. If the licensee orders equipment within 90 days 
of the license grant, a presumption of due diligence is created.
    (h) An application for modification of an authorization (under 
construction) at the existing location does not extend the initial 
construction period. If additional time to commence service is required, 
a request for such additional time must be submitted on FCC Form 601, 
either separately or in conjunction with the submission of the FCC Form 
601 requesting modification.
    (i) DSRCS Roadside Units (RSUs) in the 5850-5925 MHz band must be 
placed in operation within 12 months from the date of registration (see 
Sec. 90.375) or the authority to operate the RSUs cancels automatically 
(see Sec. 1.955 of this chapter). Such registration date(s) do not 
change the overall renewal period of the single license. Licensees must 
notify the Commission in accordance with Sec. 1.946 of this chapter 
when registered units are placed in operation within their construction 
period.

Sec. 90.157  Discontinuance of station operation.

    (a) An authorization shall cancel automatically upon permanent 
discontinuance of operations. Unless stated otherwise in this part or in 
a station authorization, for the purposes of this section, any station 
which has not operated for one year or more is considered to have been 
permanently discontinued.
    (b) For DSRCS Roadside Units (RSUs) in the 5850-5925 MHz band, it is 
the DSRCS licensee's responsibility to delete from the registration 
database any RSUs that have been discontinued.

    (b) An applicant proposing to operate a new land mobile radio 
station or modify an existing station below 470 MHz or in the one-way 
paging 929-930 MHz band (other than a commercial mobile radio service 
applicant or licensee on these bands) that is required to submit a 
frequency recommendation pursuant to paragraphs (b) through (h) of Sec. 
90.175 of this part may operate the proposed station during the pendency 
of its application for a period of up to one hundred eighty (180) days 
upon the filing of a properly completed formal Form 601 application that 
complies with Sec. 90.127 of this part if the application is 
accompanied by evidence of frequency coordination in accordance with 
Sec. 90.175 of this part and provided that the following conditions are 
satisfied:
    (1) For applicants proposing to operate below 470 MHz, that the 
proposed station location is south of Line A or west of Line C as

safety as required by Sec. 17.4 of the Commission's Rules; or the 
proposed antenna or tower structure does not exceed 6.1 meters (20 feet) 
above ground level or above an existing man-made structure (other than 
an antenna structure), if the antenna or tower has not been previously 
studied by the Federal Aviation Administration and cleared by the FCC.
    (3) The grant of the application does not require a waiver of the 
Commission's Rules.
    (4) The applicant has determined that the proposed facility will not 
significantly affect the environment as defined in Sec. 1.1307.
    (5) The applicant has determined that the proposed station affords 
the level of protection to radio quiet zones and radio receiving 
facilities as specified in Sec. 1.924 of this chapter.
    (6) The applicant has submitted an application to the Commission 
stating the frequency the applicant intends to use and that the 
frequency coordination requirements specified in Sec. 90.175 for 
selection and use of this frequency have been met and a minimum of ten 
business days has passed between submission of the application to the 
Commission and the onset of operation.
    (c) An applicant proposing to operate an itinerant station or an 
applicant seeking the assignment of authorization or transfer of control 
of a license for an existing station below 470 MHz or in the 929-930 MHz 
band (other than a commercial mobile radio service applicant or licensee 
on these bands) may operate the proposed station during the pendency of 
the application for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days 
upon the filing of a properly completed formal Form 601 application that 
complies with Sec. 90.127 of this part. Conditional authority ceases 
immediately if the application is dismissed by the Commission. All other 
categories of applications listed in Sec. 90.175(i) of this part that 
do not require evidence of frequency coordination are excluded from the 
provisions of this section.
    (d) Conditional authorization does not prejudice any action the 
Commission may take on the subject application. Conditional authority is 
accepted with the express understanding that such authority may be 
modified or canceled by the Commission at any time without hearing if, 
in the Commission's discretion, the need for such action arises. 
Consistent with Sec. 90.175(g) of this part, the applicant assumes all 
risks associated with operation under conditional authority, the 
termination or modification of conditional authority, or the subsequent 
dismissal or denial of its application. Authority reverts back to the 
original licensee if an assignee or transferee's conditional authority 
is canceled.
    (e) The transmissions of new stations operating pursuant to 
conditional authority shall be identified by a temporary call sign 
consisting of the prefix ``WT'' followed by the applicant's local seven 
digit business telephone number as provided in Sec. 2.302.

  Special Rules Governing Facilities Used To Provide Commercial Mobile 
                             Radio Services

    Source: 59 FR 59959, Nov. 21, 1994; 63 FR 68964, Dec. 14, 1998, 
unless otherwise noted.

    Note: The following rules (Sec. Sec. 90.165 through 90.169) govern 
applications, licensing, and operation of radio facilities in the 220-
222 MHz (subpart T), Business Radio (subpart D), 929-930 MHz Paging 
(subpart P), and Specialized Mobile Radio (subpart S) services that are 
used to provide commercial mobile radio services (see Sec. Sec. 20.3 
and 20.9 of this chapter). Compliance with the rules relating to 
applications and licensing of facilities on paging-only channels in the 
Business Radio Service (see Sec. 90.75(c)(10)) and 929-930 MHz paging 
channels (see Sec. 90.494(a),(b)) is not required prior to August 10, 
1996. Compliance with Sec. 90.168 is also not required prior to August 
10, 1996 for reclassified commercial mobile radio service providers who 
are to be regulated as private carriers until August 10, 1996 as 
provided in the Second Report and Order in GN Docket No. 93-252, 9 FCC 
Rcd 2348 (1994), paras. 280-284. The licensing and operation of radio 
facilities in the 220-222 MHz (subpart T), Business Radio (subpart D), 
929-930 MHz Paging (subpart P), and Specialized Mobile Radio (subpart S) 
services that are

[[Page 317]]

used to provide commercial mobile radio services are also subject to 
rules elsewhere in this part that apply generally to Private Land Mobile 
Radio Services. In the case of any conflict between rules set forth in 
Sec. Sec. 90.165 through 90.169 and other rules in this part, 
Sec. Sec. 90.165 through 90.169 apply. 14-23. New Sec. Sec. 90.165 
through 90.169 are added to subpart G to read as follows:


<R05>
Sec. 90.165  Procedures for mutually exclusive applications.

    Mutually exclusive commercial mobile radio service applications are 
processed in accordance with part 1 of this chapter and with the rules 
in this section, except for mutually exclusive applications for licenses 
in the 220-222 MHz service and the 929-930 MHz Paging service, which are 
processed in accordance with the rules in subpart P and subpart T of 
this part.
    Two or more pending applications are mutually exclusive if the grant 
of one application would effectively preclude the grant of one or more 
of the others under Commission rules governing the services involved.
    (a) Separate applications. Any applicant that files an application 
knowing that it will be mutually exclusive with one or more applications 
should not include in the mutually exclusive application a request for 
other channels or facilities that would not, by themselves, render the 
application mutually exclusive with those other applications. Instead, 
the request for such other channels or facilities should be filed in a 
separate application.
    (b) Filing groups. Pending mutually exclusive applications are 
processed in filing groups. Mutually exclusive applications in a filing 
group are given concurrent consideration. The Commission may dismiss as 
defective (pursuant to Sec. 1.934 of this chapter) any mutually 
exclusive application(s) whose filing date is outside of the date range 
for inclusion in the filing group. The types of filing groups used in 
day-to-day application processing are specified in paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section. A filing group is one of the following types:
    (1) Renewal filing group. A renewal filing group comprises a timely-
filed application for renewal of an authorization and all timely-filed 
mutually exclusive competing applications (see section 1.949 of this 
chapter).
    (2) Same-day filing group. A same-day filing group comprises all 
mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is the same day, which 
is normally the filing date of the first-filed applications(s).
    (3) Thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group. A 30-day notice and 
cut-off filing group comprises mutually exclusive applications whose 
filing date is no later than thirty (30) days after the date of the 
Public Notice listing the first-filed application(s) (according to the 
filing dates) as acceptable for filing.
    (4) Window filing group. A window filing group comprises mutually 
exclusive applications whose filing date is within an announced filing 
window. An announced filing window is a period of time between and 
including two specific dates, which are the first and last dates on 
which applications (or amendments) for a particular purpose may be 
accepted for filing. In the case of a one-day filing window, the two 
dates are the same. The dates are made known to the public in advance.
    (c) Procedures. Generally, the Commission may grant one application 
in a filing group of mutually exclusive applications and dismiss the 
other application(s) in the filing group that are excluded by the grant, 
pursuant to Sec. 1.935 of this chapter.
    (1) Selection methods. In selecting the application to grant, the 
Commission may use competitive bidding, random selection, or comparative 
hearings, depending on the type of applications involved.
    (2) Dismissal of applications. The Commission may dismiss any 
application in a filing group that is defective or otherwise subject to 
dismissal under Sec. 1.934 of this chapter, either before or after 
employing selection procedures.
    (3) Type of filing group used. Except as otherwise provided in this 
part, the type of filing group used in processing of two or more 
mutually exclusive applications depends on the purpose(s) of the 
applications.
    (i) If one of the mutually exclusive applications is a timely-filed 
application for renewal of an authorization, a renewal filing group is 
used.
    (ii) If any mutually exclusive application filed on the earliest 
filing date

[[Page 318]]

is an application for modification and none of the mutually exclusive 
applications is a timely-filed application for renewal, a same-day 
filing group is used.
    (iii) If all of the mutually exclusive applications filed on the 
earliest filing date are applications for initial authorization, a 30-
day notice and cut-off filing group is used.
    (4) Disposition. If there is only one application in any type of 
filing group, the Commission may grant that application and dismiss 
without prejudice any mutually exclusive applications not in the filing 
group. If there is more than one mutually exclusive application in a 
filing group, the Commission disposes of these applications as follows:
    (i) Applications in a renewal filing group. All mutually exclusive 
applications in a renewal filing group are designated for comparative 
consideration in a hearing.
    (ii) Applications in a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group.
    (A) If all of the mutually exclusive applications in a 30-day notice 
and cut-off filing group are applications for initial authorization, the 
Commission administers competitive bidding procedures in accordance with 
subpart Q of part 1 of this chapter. After such procedures, the 
application of the successful bidder may be granted and the other 
applications may be dismissed without prejudice.
    (B) If any of the mutually exclusive applications in a 30-day notice 
and cut-off filing group is an application for modification or an 
application for facilities, the Commission may attempt to resolve the 
mutual exclusivity by facilitating a settlement between the applicants. 
If a settlement is not reached within a reasonable time, the Commission 
may designate all applications in the filing group for comparative 
consideration in a hearing. In this event, the result of the hearing 
disposes all of the applications in the filing group.
    (iii) Applications in a same-day filing group. If there are two or 
more mutually exclusive applications in a same-day filing group, the 
Commission may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating 
a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached 
within a reasonable time, the Commission may designate all applications 
in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this 
event, the result of the hearing disposes all of the applications in the 
filing group.
    (iv) Applications in a window filing group. Applications in a window 
filing group are processed in accordance with the procedures for a 30-
day notice and cut-off filing group in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this 
section.
    (d) Terminology. For the purposes of this section, terms have the 
following meanings:
    (1) The ``filing date'' of an application is the date on which that 
application was received in a condition acceptable for filing or the 
date on which the most recently filed major amendment to that 
application was received, whichever is later, excluding major amendments 
in the following circumstances:
    (i) The major amendment reflects only a change in ownership or 
control found by the Commission to be in the public interest;
    (ii) The major amendment as received is defective or otherwise found 
unacceptable for filing; or
    (iii) The application being amended has been designated for hearing 
and the Commission or the presiding officer accepts the major amendment.
    (2) An ``application for initial authorization'' is:
    (i) Any application requesting an authorization for a new system or 
station;
    (ii) Any application requesting authorization for an existing 
station to operate on an additional channel, unless the additional 
channel is for paired two-way radiotelephone operation, is in the same 
frequency range as the existing channel(s), and will be operationally 
integrated with the existing channel(s) such as by trunking; or
    (iii) any application requesting authorization for a new transmitter 
at a location more than 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from any existing 
transmitters of the applicant licensee on the requested channel or 
channel block.

little or no minority or female representation should be reviewed to 
determine whether this results from discrimination.
    (B) Giving minority groups and female employees equal opportunity 
for positions which lead to higher positions. Inquiring as to the 
interest and skills of all lower-paid employees with respect to any of 
the higher-paid positions, followed by assistance, counseling, and 
effective measures to enable employees with interest and potential to 
qualify themselves for such positions.
    (C) Reviewing seniority practices to insure that such practices are 
nondiscriminatory and do not have a discriminatory effect.
    (D) Avoiding use of selection techniques or tests that have the 
effect of discriminating against minority groups or females.
    (iv) to assure nondiscrimination in other areas of employment 
practices.
    (A) Examining rates of pay and fringe benefits for present employees 
with equivalent duties and adjusting any inequities found.
    (B) Providing opportunity to perform overtime work on a basis that 
does not discriminate against qualified minority groups or female 
employees.
    (b) EEO statement. Each licensee having sixteen (16) or more full-
time employees shall file with the Commission, no later than May 31st 
following the grant of that licensee's first Commercial Mobile Radio 
Services authorization, a statement describing fully its current equal 
employment opportunity program, indicating specific practices to be 
followed in order to assure equal employment opportunity on the basis of 
sex, race, color, religion, or national origin in such aspects of 
employment practices as regards recruitment, selection, training, 
placement, promotion, pay, working conditions, demotion, layoff, and 
termination. Any licensee having sixteen (16) or more full-time 
employees that changes its existing equal employment opportunity program 
shall file with the Commission, no later than May 31st thereafter, a 
revised statement reflecting the change(s).

    Note: Commercial mobile radio service licensees having sixteen (16) 
or more full-time employees that do not have a current EEO statement on 
file with the Commission as of January 2, 1995, must file the statement 
required by this paragraph no later than May 31, 1995.

    (c) Report of complaints filed against licensees. Each licensee, 
regardless of how many employees it has, shall submit an annual report 
to the Commission no later than May 31st of each year indicating whether 
any complaints regarding violations by the licensee or equal employment 
provisions of Federal, State, Territorial, or local law have been filed 
before anybody having competent jurisdiction.
    (1) The report should state the parties involved, the date filing, 
the courts or agencies before which the matters have been heard, the 
appropriate file number (if any), and the respective disposition or 
current status of any such complaints.
    (2) Any licensee who has filed such information with the EEOC may 
file a notification of such filing with the Commission in lieu of a 
report.
    (d) Complaints of violations of Equal Employment Programs. 
Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common carrier 
licensee are considered by the Commission in the following manner:
    (1) If a complaint raising an issue of discrimination is received 
against a licensee who is within the jurisdiction of the EEOC, it is 
submitted to that agency. The Commission maintains a liaison with that 
agency that keeps the Commission informed of the disposition of 
complaints filed against common carrier licensees.
    (2) Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common 
carrier licensee who does not fall under the jurisdiction of the EEOC 
but is covered by appropriate enforceable State law, to which penalties 
apply, may be submitted by the Commission to the respective State 
agency.

[[Page 321]]

    (3) Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common 
carrier licensee who does not fall under the jurisdiction of the EEOC or 
an appropriate State law, are accorded appropriate treatment by the 
Commission.
    (4) The Commission will consult with the EEOC on all matters 
relating to the evaluation and determination of compliance by the common 
carrier licensees with the principles of equal employment as set forth 
herein.
    (5) Complaints indicating a general pattern of disregard of equal 
employment practices which are received against a licensee that is 
required to file an employment report to the Commission under Sec. 
1.815(a) of this chapter are investigated by the Commission.
    (e) Commission records. A copy of every annual employment report, 
equal employment opportunity program statement, reports on complaints 
regarding violation of equal employment provisions of Federal, State, 
Territorial, or local law, and copies of all exhibits, letters, and

Sec. 90.169  Construction prior to grant of application.

    Applicants may construct facilities prior to grant of their 
applications, subject to the provisions of this section, but must not 
operate such facilities until the Commission grants an authorization. If 
the conditions stated in this section are not met, applicants must not 
begin to construct facilities.
    (a) When applicants may begin construction. An applicant may begin 
construction of a facility thirty-five (35) days after the date of the 
Public Notice listing the application for that facility as acceptable 
for filing.
    (b) Notification to stop. If the Commission for any reason 
determines that construction should not be started or should be stopped 
while an application is pending, and so notifies the applicant, orally 
(followed by written confirmation) or in writing, the applicant must not 
begin construction or, if construction has begun, must stop construction 
immediately.
    (c) Assumption of risk. Applicants that begin construction pursuant 
to this section before receiving an authorization do so at their own 
risk and have no recourse against the United States for any losses 
resulting from:
    (1) Applications that are not granted;
    (2) Errors or delays in issuing Public Notices;
    (3) Having to alter, relocate, or dismantle the facility; or
    (4) Incurring whatever costs may be necessary to bring the facility 
into compliance with applicable laws, or Commission rules and orders.
    (d) Conditions. Except as indicated, all pre-grant construction is 
subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The application is not mutually exclusive with any other 
application;
    (2) No petitions to deny the application have been filed;
    (3) The application does not include a request for a waiver of one 
or more Commission rules;
    (4) For any construction or alteration that would exceed the 
requirements of Sec. 17.7 of this chapter, the licensee has notified 
the appropriate Regional Office of the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA Form 7460-1), filed a request for antenna height clearance and 
obstruction marking and

[[Page 322]]

lighting specifications (FCC Form 854) with the Commission;
    (5) The applicant has indicated in the application that the proposed 
facility would not have a significant environmental effect, in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter; and,
    (6) Under applicable international agreements and rules in this 
part, individual coordination of the proposed channel assignment(s) with 
a foreign administration is not required.


<R04>
       Subpart H_Policies Governing the Assignment of Frequencies


<R05>
Sec. 90.171  Scope.

    This subpart contains detailed information concerning the policies 
under which the Commission assigns frequencies for the use of licensees 
under this part, frequency coordination procedures, and procedures under 
which licensees may cooperatively share radio facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 90.173  Policies governing the assignment of frequencies.

    (a) Except as indicated in paragraph (j) of this section, the 
frequencies which ordinarily may be assigned to stations in the services 
governed by this part are listed in subparts B, C and F of this part. 
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this part, frequencies 
assigned to land mobile stations are available on a shared basis only 
and will not be assigned for the exclusive use of any licensee.
    (b) All applicants and licensees shall cooperate in the selection 
and use of frequencies in order to reduce interference and make the most 
effective use of the authorized facilities. Licensees of stations 
suffering or causing harmful interference are expected to cooperate and 
resolve this problem by mutually satisfactory arrangements. If the 
licensees are unable to do so, the Commission may impose restrictions 
including specifying the transmitter power, antenna height, or area or 
hours of operation of the stations concerned. Further the use of any 
frequency at a given geographical location may be denied when, in the 
judgment of the Commission, its use in that location is not in the 
public interest; the use of any frequency may be restricted as to 
specified geographical areas, maximum power, or such other operating 
conditions, contained in this part or in the station authorization.
    (c) Frequencies allocated for Federal Government radio stations 
under Executive order of the President may be authorized for the use of 
stations in these services upon appropriate showing by the applicant 
that such assignment is necessary for inter-communication with 
government stations or required for coordination with activities of the 
Federal Government, and where the Commission finds, after consultation 
with the appropriate government agency or agencies, that such assignment 
is necessary.
    (d) The radio facilities authorized under this part are intended for 
use in connection with and as an adjunct to the primary governmental or 
business activities of the licensee.
    (e) Persons requesting authority to operate in the band 25-50 MHz 
should recognize that this band is shared with various services in other 
countries and that harmful interference may be caused by the propagation 
of signals in this band from distant stations. No protection from such 
harmful interference generally can be expected.
    (f) Applications for stations in the 150-174 MHz and 421-512 MHz 
bands for operation on frequencies 15 kHz or less removed from existing 
stations in the same geographic area will be granted based upon a 
recommendation from the applicable frequency coordinator as specified in 
Sec. Sec. 90.20(c)(2) and 90.35(b)(2).
    (g) In the states of Alaska and Hawaii, and in areas outside the 
continental limits of the United States and the adjacent waters, the 
frequencies above 150.8 MHz which are listed elsewhere in this part as 
available for assignment to base stations or mobile stations in the 
Industrial/Business Pool are also available for assignment to 
operational fixed stations in the Industrial/Business Pool on a 
secondary basis.
    (h) In the Public Safety Pool, base stations may be authorized to 
operate on a secondary basis on frequencies below 450 MHz which are 
available to mobile stations.

[[Page 323]]

    (i) In the 450-470 MHz band, the frequencies are ordinarily assigned 
in pairs, with the mobile station transmit frequency 5 MHz above the 
paired base station transmit frequency. In the 470-512 MHz band, the 
frequencies are ordinarily assigned in pairs with the mobile station 
transmit frequency 3 MHz above the paired base station transmit 
frequency. In the Industrial/Business Pool, in the 150 MHz band, the 
frequencies subject to Sec. 90.35(c)(6) may be assigned in pairs with 
the separation between base and mobile frequencies being 5.26 MHz. A 
mobile station may be assigned the frequency which would normally be 
assigned to a base station for single-frequency operation. However, this 
single-frequency operation may be subject to interference that would not 
occur to a two-frequency system.
    (j) Frequencies other than those listed in subparts B and C of this 
part may be assigned in the 150-174 MHz, 421-430 MHz, 450-470 MHz, and 
470-512 MHz bands, provided the following conditions are met:
    (1) Such applications must be accompanied by a showing of frequency 
coordination in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 90.175;
    (2) The frequencies must not be available in any other rule part of 
this chapter; and
    (3) The authorized bandwidth of any system operating in accordance 
with this paragraph must not overlap spectrum available in other rule 
parts of this chapter unless that spectrum is also allocated in part 90.
    (k) This paragraph is only applicable to entities with Finder's 
Preference requests pending before the Commission as of July 29, 1998. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, any eligible person 
shall be given a dispositive preference for a channel assignment on an 
exclusive basis in the 220-222 MHz, 470-512 MHz, and 800/900 MHz (except 
on frequencies designated exclusively for SMR service) bands by 
submitting information that leads to the recovery of channels in these 
bands. Recovery of such channels must result from information provided 
regarding the failure of existing licensees to comply with the 
provisions of Sec. 90.155, Sec. 90.157, Sec. 90.629, Sec. 90.631 (e) 
or (f), or Sec. 90.633 (c) or (d).
    (l) In the 150-174 MHz band, except where otherwise specifically 
provided, authorizations for frequencies that were available prior to 
August 18, 1995 will be granted with channel bandwidths of 25 kHz or 
less. Authorizations for all other frequencies in this band will be 
granted with channel bandwidths of 12.5 kHz or less (i.e., in the Public 
Safety Pool, frequencies subject to Sec. Sec. 90.20 (d)(27) and 
(d)(44), and in the Industrial/Business Pool, frequencies subject to 
Sec. Sec. 90.35 (c)(30) and (c)(33)).
    (m) In the 421-512 MHz band, except where otherwise specifically 
provided, authorizations for frequencies that were available prior to 
August 18, 1995 will be granted with channel bandwidths of 25 kHz or 
less. New authorizations for frequencies 12.5 kHz removed from these 
frequencies will be made for channel bandwidths of 12.5 kHz or less 
(i.e., in the Public Safety Pool, frequencies subject to Sec. 
90.20(d)(27) and in the Industrial/Business Pool, frequencies subject to 
Sec. 90.35(c)(30)). Authorizations for frequencies 6.25 kHz removed 
from these frequencies will be granted with channel bandwidths of 6.25 
kHz or less (i.e., in the Public Safety Pool, frequencies subject to 
Sec. 90.20(d)(44), and in the Industrial/Business Pool, frequencies 
subject to Sec. 90.35(c)(33)).
    (n) Any recovered channels in the 800 MHz SMR service will revert 
automatically to the holder of the EA license within which such channels 
are included. If there is no EA licensee for recovered channels, such 
channels will be retained by the Commission for future licensing.

Sec. 90.175  Frequency coordinator requirements.

    Except for applications listed in paragraph (j) of this section, 
each application for a new frequency assignment, for a change in 
existing facilities as listed in Sec. 90.135(a), or for operation at 
temporary locations in accordance with Sec. 90.137 must include a 
showing of frequency coordination as set forth further.
    (a) Frequency coordinators may request, and applicants are required 
to provide, all appropriate technical information, system requirements, 
and justification for requested station parameters when such information 
is necessary to identify and recommend the most appropriate frequency. 
Additionally, applicants bear the burden of proceeding and the burden of 
proof in requesting the Commission to overturn a coordinator's 
recommendation.
    (b) For frequencies between 25 and 470 MHz: (1) A statement is 
required from the applicable frequency coordinator as specified in 
Sec. Sec. 90.20(c)(2) and 90.35(b) recommending the most appropriate 
frequency. In addition, for frequencies above 150 MHz, if the 
interference contour of a proposed station would overlap the service 
contour of a station on a frequency formerly shared prior to radio 
service consolidation by licensees in the Manufacturers Radio Service, 
the Forest Products Radio Service, the Power Radio Service, the 
Petroleum Radio Service, the Motor Carrier Radio Service, the Railroad 
Radio Service, the Telephone Maintenance Radio Service or the Automobile 
Emergency Radio Service, the written concurrence of the coordinator for 
the industry-specific service, or the written concurrence of the 
licensee itself, must be obtained. Requests for concurrence must be 
responded to within 20 days of receipt of the request. The written 
request for concurrence shall advise the receiving party of the maximum 
20 day response period. The coordinator's recommendation may include 
comments on technical factors such as power, antenna height and gain, 
terrain and other factors which may serve to minimize potential 
interference. In addition:
    (2) On frequencies designated for coordination or concurrence by a 
specific frequency coordinator as specified in Sec. Sec. 90.20(c)(3) 
and 90.35(b), the applicable frequency coordinator shall provide a 
written supporting statement in instances in which coordination or 
concurrence is denied. The supporting statement shall contain sufficient 
detail to permit discernment of the technical basis for the denial of 
concurrence. Concurrence may be denied only when a grant of the 
underlying application would have a demonstrable, material, adverse 
effect on safety.
    (3) In instances in which a frequency coordinator determines that an 
applicant's requested frequency or the most appropriate frequency is one 
designated for coordination or concurrence by a specific frequency 
coordinator as specified in Sec. 90.20(c)(3) or Sec. 90.35(b), that 
frequency coordinator may forward the application directly to the 
appropriate frequency coordinator. A frequency coordinator may only 
forward an application as specified above if consent is received from 
the applicant.
    (c) For frequencies above 800 MHz: When frequencies are shared by 
more than one service, concurrence must be obtained from the other 
applicable certified coordinators.
    (d) For frequencies in the 450-470 MHz band: When used for secondary 
fixed operations, frequencies shall be assigned and coordinated pursuant 
to Sec. 90.261.
    (e) For frequencies between 470-512 MHz, 769-775/799-805 MHz, 806-
824/851-869 MHz and 896-901/935-940 MHz: A recommendation of the 
specific frequencies that are available for assignment in accordance 
with the loading standards and mileage separations applicable to the 
specific radio service, frequency pool, or category of user involved is 
required from an applicable frequency coordinator.
    (f) For frequencies in the 929-930 MHz band listed in paragraph (b) 
of Sec. 90.494: A statement is required from the coordinator 
recommending the most appropriate frequency.
    (g) For frequencies between 1427-1432 MHz: A statement is required 
from the coordinator recommending the most appropriate frequency, 
operating power and area of operation in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 90.259(b).

[[Page 325]]

    (h) Any recommendation submitted in accordance with paragraphs (a), 
(c), (d), or (e) of this section is advisory in character and is not an 
assurance that the Commission will grant a license for operation on that 
frequency. Therefore, applicants are strongly advised not to purchase 
radio equipment operating on specific frequencies until a valid 
authorization has been obtained from the Commission.
    (i) Applications for facilities near the Canadian border north of 
line A or east of line C in Alaska may require coordination with the 
Canadian government. See Sec. 1.928 of this chapter.
    (j) The following applications need not be accompanied by evidence 
of frequency coordination:
    (1) Applications for frequencies below 25 MHz.
    (2) Applications for a Federal Government frequency.
    (3) Applications for frequencies in the 72-76 MHz band except for 
mobile frequencies subject to Sec. 90.35(c)(77).
    (4) Applications for a frequency to be used for developmental 
purposes.
    (5) Applications in the Industrial/Business Pool requesting a 
frequency designated for itinerant operations.

ownership, control or corporate structure if there is no change in 
technical parameters.
    (10) Applications for mobile stations operating in the 470-512 MHz 
band, 799-805 MHz band, or above 800 MHz if the frequency pair is 
assigned to a single system on an exclusive basis in the proposed area 
of operation.
    (11) Applications for add-on base stations in multiple licensed 
systems operating in the 470-512 MHz, 769-775 MHz band, or above 800 MHz 
if the frequency pair is assigned to a single system on an exclusive 
basis.
    (12) Applications for control stations operating below 470 MHz, 769-
775/799-805 MHz, or above 800 MHz and meeting the requirements of Sec. 
90.119(b).

Sec. 90.179  Shared use of radio stations.

    Licensees of radio stations authorized under this rule part may 
share the use of their facilities. A station is shared when persons not 
licensed for the station control the station for their own purposes 
pursuant to the licensee's authorization. Shared use of a radio station 
may be either on a non-profit cost shared basis or on a for-profit 
private carrier basis. Shared use of an authorized station is subject to 
the following conditions and limitations:
    (a) Persons may share a radio station only on frequencies for which 
they would be eligible for a separate authorization.
    (b) The licensee of the shared radio station is responsible for 
assuring that the authorized facility is used only by persons and only 
for purposes consistent with the requirements of this rule part.
    (c) Participants in the sharing arrangement may obtain a license for 
their own mobile units (including control points and/or control stations 
for control of the shared facility), or they may use mobile stations, 
and control

[[Page 327]]

stations or control points authorized to the licensee.
    (d) If the licensee shares the land station on a non-profit, cost 
shared basis to the licensee, this shared use must be pursuant to a 
written agreement between the licensee and each participant which sets 
out (1) the method of operation, (2) the components of the system which

<R05>
Sec. 90.187  Trunking in the bands between 150 and 512 MHz.

    (a) Applicants for trunked systems operating on frequencies between 
150 and 512 MHz (except 220-222 MHz) must indicate on their applications 
(class of station code, instructions for FCC Form 601) that their system 
will be trunked. Licensees of stations that are not trunked, may trunk 
their systems only after modifying their license (see Sec. 1.927 of 
this chapter).
    (b) Trunked systems operating under this section must employ 
equipment that prevents transmission on a

[[Page 328]]

trunked frequency if a signal from another system is present on that 
frequency. The level of monitoring must be sufficient to avoid causing 
harmful interference to other systems. However, this monitoring 
requirement does not apply if the conditions in paragraph (b)(1) or 
(b)(2) of this section, are met:
    (1) Where applicants for or licensees operating in the 470-512 MHz 
band meet the loading requirements of Sec. 90.313 and have exclusive 
use of their frequencies in their service area.
    (2) On frequencies where an applicant or licensee does not have an 
exclusive service area provided that all frequency coordination 
requirements are complied with and written consent is obtained from 
affected licensees using either the procedure set forth in paragraphs 
(b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section (mileage separation) or the 
procedure set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section (protected 
contours).
    (i) Affected licensees for the purposes of this section are 
licensees of stations that have assigned frequencies (base and mobile) 
that are 15 kHz or less removed from proposed stations that will operate 
with a 25 kHz channel bandwidth; stations that have assigned frequencies 
(base and mobile) that are 7.5 kHz or less removed from proposed 
stations that will operate with a 12.5 kHz bandwidth; or stations that 
have assigned frequencies (base and mobile) 3.75 kHz or less removed 
from proposed stations that will operate with a 6.25 kHz bandwidth.
    (ii) Where such stations' service areas (37 dBu contour for stations 
in the 150-174 MHz band and 39 dBu contour for stations in the 421-512 
MHz bands; see Sec. 90.205) overlap a circle with radius 113 km (70 
mi.) from the proposed base station.
    (iii) In lieu of the mileage separation procedure set forth in 
paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section, applicants for 
trunked facilities may obtain consent only from stations that would be 
subjected to objectionable interference from the trunked facilities. 
Objectionable interference will be considered to exist when the 
interference contour (19 dBu for VHF stations, 21 dBu for UHF stations) 
of a proposed trunked station would intersect the service contour (37 
dBu for VHF stations, 39 dBu for UHF stations) of an existing station. 
The existing stations that must be considered in a contour overlap 
analysis are a function of the channel bandwidth of the proposed trunked 
station, as follows:
    (A) For trunked stations proposing 25 kHz channel bandwidth: 
Existing co-channel stations and existing stations that have an 
operating frequency 15 kHz or less from the proposed trunked station.
    (B) For trunked stations proposing 12.5 kHz channel bandwidth: 
Existing co-channel stations and existing stations that have an 
operating frequency 7.5 kHz or less from the proposed trunked station.
    (C) For trunked stations proposing 6.25 kHz channel bandwidth: 
Existing co-channel stations and existing stations that have an 
operating frequency 3.75 kHz or less from the proposed trunked station.
    (iv) The calculation of service and interference contours referenced 
in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section shall be done using generally 
accepted engineering practices and standards which, for purposes of this 
section, shall presumptively be the practices and standards agreed to by 
a consensus of all certified frequency coordinators.
    (v) The written consent from the licensees specified in paragraphs 
(b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(2)(iii)(A), (b)(2)(iii)(B) and 
(b)(2)(iii)C of this section shall specifically state all terms agreed 
to by the parties and shall be signed by the parties. The written 
consent shall be maintained by the operator of the trunked station and 
be made available to the Commission upon request. The submission of a 
coordinated trunked application to the Commission shall include a 
certification from the applicant that written consent has been obtained 
from all licensees specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) or 
(b)(2)(iii)(A), (b)(2)(iii)(B) and (b)(2)(iii)(C) of this section that 
the written consent documents encompass the complete understandings and 
agreements of the parties as to such consent; and that the terms and 
conditions thereof are consistent with the Commission's rules. Should a 
potential applicant disagree

[[Page 329]]

with a certified frequency coordinator's determination that 
objectionable interference exists with respect to a given channel or 
channels, that potential applicant may request the Commission to 
overturn the certified frequency coordinator's determination. In that 
event, the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the 
certified frequency coordinator's determination is incorrect shall rest 
with the potential applicant. If a licensee has consented to the use of 
trunking, but later decides against the use of trunking, that licensee 
may request that the licensee(s) of the trunked system(s) cease the use 
of trunking. Should the trunked station(s) decline the licensee's 
request, the licensee may request a replacement channel from the 
Commission. A new applicant whose interference contour overlaps the 
service contour of a trunked licensee will be assigned the same channel 
as the trunked licensee only if the trunked licensee consents in writing 
and a copy of the written consent is submitted to the certified 
frequency coordinator responsible for coordination of the application.
    (c) Trunking of systems licensed on paging-only channels or licensed 
in the Radiolocation Service (subpart F) is not permitted.
    (d) Potential applicants proposing trunked operation may file 
written notice with any certified frequency coordinator for the pool 
(Public Safety or Industrial/Business) in which the applicant proposes 
to operate. The notice shall specify the channels on which the potential 
trunked applicant proposes to operate and the proposed effective 
radiated power, antenna pattern, height above ground, height above 
average terrain and proposed channel bandwidth. On receipt of such a 
notice, the certified frequency coordinator shall notify all other 
certified frequency coordinators in the relevant pool within one 
business day. For a period of sixty days thereafter, no application will 
be accepted for coordination which specifies parameters that would 
result in objectionable interference to the channels specified in the 
notice. Potential applicants shall not file another notice for the same 
channels within 10 km (6.2 miles) of the same location unless six months 
shall have elapsed since the filing of the last such notice. Certified 
frequency coordinators shall return without action, any coordination 
request which violates the terms of this paragraph (d).
    (e) No more than 10 channels for trunked operation in the 
Industrial/Business Pool may be applied for in a single application. 
Subsequent applications, limited to an additional 10 channels or fewer, 
must be accompanied by a certification, submitted to the certified 
frequency coordinator coordinating the application, that all of the 
applicant's existing channels authorized for trunked operation have been 
constructed and placed in operation. Certified frequency coordinators 
are authorized to require documentation in support of the applicant's 
certification that existing channels have been constructed and placed in 
operation. Applicants in the Public Safety Pool may request more than 10 
channels at a single location provided that any application for more 
than 10 Public Safety Pool channels must be accompanied by a showing of 
sufficient need. The requirement for such a showing may be satisfied by 
submission of loading studies demonstrating that requested channels in 
excess of 10 will be loaded with 50 mobiles per channel within a five 
year period commencing with grant of the application.
    (f) If a licensee authorized for trunked operation discontinues 
trunked operation for a period of 30 consecutive days, the licensee, 
within 7 days of the expiration of said 30 day period, shall file a 
conforming application for modification of license with the Commission. 
Upon grant of that application, new applicants may file for the same 
channel or channels notwithstanding the interference contour of the new 
applicant's proposed channel or channels overlaps the service contour of 
the station that was previously engaged in trunked operation.

produce coverage in excess of that which the applicant requires.
    (2) Applications for stations where special circumstances exist that 
make it necessary to deviate from the ERP and antenna heights in Table 1 
will be submitted to the frequency coordinator accompanied by a 
technical analysis, based upon generally accepted engineering practices 
and standards, that demonstrates that the requested station parameters 
will not produce a signal strength in excess of 37 dBu at any point 
along the edge of the requested service area. The coordinator may then 
recommend any ERP appropriate to meet this condition.
    (3) An applicant for a station with a service area radius greater 
than 40 km (25 mi) must justify the requested service area radius, which 
will be authorized only in accordance with table 1, note 4. For base 
stations with service areas greater than 80 km, all operations 80 km or 
less from the base station will be on a primary basis and all operations 
outside of 80 km from the base station will be on a secondary basis and 
will be entitled to no protection from primary operations.

Sec. 90.209  Bandwidth limitations.

    (a) Each authorization issued to a station licensed under this part 
will show an emission designator representing the class of emission 
authorized. The designator will be prefixed by a specified necessary 
bandwidth. This number does not necessarily indicate the bandwidth 
occupied by the emission at any instant. In those cases where Sec. 
2.202 of this chapter does not provide a formula for the computation of 
necessary bandwidth, the occupied bandwidth, as defined in part 2 of 
this chapter, may be used in lieu of the necessary bandwidth.
    (b) The maximum authorized single channel bandwidth of emission 
corresponding to the type of emission specified in Sec. 90.207 is as 
follows:
    (1) For A1A or A1B emissions, the maximum authorized bandwidth is 
0.25 kHz. The maximum authorized bandwidth for type A3E emission is 8 
kHz.
    (2) For operations below 25 MHz utilizing J3E emission, the 
bandwidth occupied by the emission shall not exceed 3000 Hz. The 
assigned frequency will be

[[Page 337]]

specified in the authorization. The authorized carrier frequency will be 
1400 Hz lower in frequency than the assigned frequency. Only upper 
sideband emission may be used. In the case of regularly available double 
sideband radiotelephone channels, an assigned frequency for J3E 
emissions is available either 1600 Hz below or 1400 Hz above the double 
sideband radiotelephone assigned frequency.
    (3) For all other types of emissions, the maximum authorized 
bandwidth shall not be more than that normally authorized for voice 
operations.
    (4) Where a frequency is assigned exclusively to a single licensee, 
more than a single emission may be used within the authorized bandwidth. 
In such cases, the frequency stability requirements of Sec. 90.213 must 
be met for each emission.
    (5) Unless specified elsewhere, channel spacings and bandwidths that 
will be authorized in the following frequency bands are given in the 
following table.

Sec. 90.210  Emission masks.

    Except as indicated elsewhere in this part, transmitters used in the 
radio services governed by this part must comply with the emission masks 
outlined in this section. Unless otherwise stated, per paragraphs 
(d)(4), (e)(4), and (m) of this section, measurements of emission power 
can be expressed in either peak or average values provided that emission 
powers are expressed with the same parameters used to specify the 
unmodulated transmitter carrier power. For transmitters that do not 
produce a full power unmodulated carrier, reference to the unmodulated 
transmitter carrier power refers to the total power contained in the 
channel bandwidth. Unless indicated elsewhere in this part, the table in 
this section specifies the emission masks for equipment operating in the 
frequency bands governed under this part.

resolution bandwidth to 100 Hz with the measuring instrument in a peak 
hold mode. A sufficient number of sweeps must be measured to insure that 
the emission profile is developed. If video filtering is used, its 
bandwidth must not be less than the instrument resolution bandwidth. For 
emissions beyond 50 kHz from the edge of the authorized bandwidth, see

edge of the authorized sub-band by a displacement frequency 
(f<INF>d</INF> in kHz): at least 116 log ((f<INF>d</INF>+10)/6.1) dB or

    (7) The zero dB reference is measured relative to the highest 
average power of the fundamental emission measured across the designated 
channel bandwidth using a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent 
of the occupied bandwidth of the fundamental emission and a video 
bandwidth of 30 kHz. The power spectral density is the power measured

based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution 
bandwidth of at least one percent of the occupied bandwidth.
    (m) Emission Mask M. For high power transmitters (greater that 20

    (7) The zero dB reference is measured relative to the highest 
average power of the fundamental emission measured across the designated 
channel bandwidth using a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent 
of the occupied bandwidth of the fundamental emission and a video 
bandwidth of 30 kHz. The power spectral density is the power measured 
within the resolution bandwidth of the measurement device divided by the 
resolution bandwidth of the measurement device. Emission levels are also 
based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution 
bandwidth of at least one percent of the occupied bandwidth.

    Note to paragraph (m): Low power devices may as an option, comply 
with paragraph (m).

    (n) Other frequency bands. Transmitters designed for operation under 
this part on frequencies other than listed in this section must meet the 
emission mask requirements of Emission Mask B. Equipment operating under 
this part on frequencies allocated to but shared with the Federal 
Government, must meet the applicable Federal Government technical 
standards.
    (o) Instrumentation. The reference level for showing compliance with 
the emission mask shall be established, except as indicated in 
Sec. Sec. 90.210 (d), (e), and (k), using standard engineering 
practices for the modulation characteristic used by the equipment under 
test. When measuring emissions in the 150-174 MHz and 421-512 MHz bands 
the following procedures will apply. A sufficient number of sweeps must 
be measured to insure that the emission profile is developed. If video 
filtering is used, its bandwidth must not be less than the instrument 
resolution bandwidth. For frequencies more than 50 kHz removed from the 
edge of the authorized bandwidth a resolution of at least 100 kHz must 
be used for frequencies below 1000 MHz. Above 1000 MHz the resolution 
bandwidth of the instrumentation must be at least 1 MHz. If it can be 
shown that use of the above instrumentation settings do not accurately 
represent the true interference potential of the equipment under test, 
then an

alternate procedure may be used provided prior Commission approval is 
obtained.

    (2) When any change is made in the transmitter which may affect the 
carrier frequency or its stability.
    (b) The licensee of each station shall employ a suitable procedure 
to determine that each transmitter authorized to operate with an output 
power in excess of two watts does not exceed the maximum figure 
specified on the current station authorization. On authorizations 
stating only the input power to the final radiofrequency stage, the 
maximum permissible output power is 75 percent for frequencies below 25 
MHz and 60 percent of the input power for frequencies above 25 MHz. If a 
non-DC final radiofrequency stage is utilized, then the output power 
shall not exceed 75 percent of the input power. This determination shall 
be made, and the results thereof entered into the station records, in 
accordance with the following:
    (1) When the transmitter is initially installed;
    (2) When any change is made in the transmitter which may increase 
the transmitter power input.
    (c) The licensee of each station shall employ a suitable procedure 
to determine that the modulation of each transmitter, which is 
authorized to operate with an output power in excess of two watts, does 
not exceed the limits specified in this part. This determination shall 
be made and the following results entered in the station records, in 
accordance with the following:
    (1) When the transmitter is initially installed;

[[Page 345]]

    (2) When any change is made in the transmitter which may affect the 
modulation characteristics.
    (d) The determinations required by paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of 
this section may, at the opinion of the licensee, be made by a qualified 
engineering measurement service, in which case the required record 
entries shall show the name and address of the engineering measurement 
service as well as the name of the person making the measurements.
    (e) In the case of mobile transmitters, the determinations required 
by paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section may be made at a test or 
service bench: Provided, That the measurements are made under load 
conditions equivalent to actual operating conditions; and provided 
further, that after installation in the mobile unit the transmitter is 
given a routine check to determine that it is capable of being received 
satisfactorly by an appropriate receiver.

licensed on a business category channel above 800 MHz which have an 
output power not exceeding 120 milliwatts are exempt from the technical 
requirements set out in this subpart, but must instead comply with the 
following:
    (a) For equipment designed to operate with a 25 kHz channel 
bandwidth, the sum of the bandwidth occupied by the emitted signal plus 
the bandwidth required for frequency stability shall be adjusted so that 
any emission appearing on a frequency 40 kHz or more removed from the 
assigned frequency is attenuated at least 30 dB below the unmodulated 
carrier.
    (b) For equipment designed to operate with a 12.5 kHz channel 
bandwidth, the sum of the bandwidth occupied by the emitted signal plus 
the bandwidth required for frequency stability shall be adjusted so that 
any emission appearing on a frequency 25 kHz or more removed from the 
assigned frequency is attenuated at least 30 dB below the unmodulated 
carrier.
    (c) For equipment designed to operate with a 6.25 kHz channel 
bandwidth, the sum of the bandwidth occupied by the emitted signal plus 
the bandwidth required for frequency stability shall be adjusted so that 
any emission appearing on a frequency 12.5 kHz or more removed from the 
assigned frequency is attenuated at least 30 dB below the unmodulated 
carrier.
    (d) Transmitters may be operated in the continuous carrier transmit 
mode.
    (e) Transmitters used for wireless microphone operations and 
operating on frequencies allocated for Federal use must comply with the 
requirements of Sec. 90.265(b).

    Licensees authorized to operate radio systems in the frequency bands 
above 150 MHz may employ signal boosters at fixed locations in 
accordance with the following criteria:
    (a) The amplified signal is retransmitted only on the exact 
frequency(ies) of the originating base, fixed, mobile, or portable 
station(s). The booster will fill in only weak signal areas and cannot 
extend the system's normal signal coverage area.
    (b) Class A narrowband signal boosters must be equipped with 
automatic gain control circuitry which will limit the total effective 
radiated power (ERP) of the unit to a maximum of 5 watts under all 
conditions. Class B broadband signal boosters are limited to 5 watts ERP 
for each authorized frequency that the booster is designed to amplify.
    (c) Class A narrowband boosters must meet the out-of-band emission 
limits of Sec. 90.210 for each narrowband channel that the booster is 
designed to amplify. Class B broadband signal boosters must meet the 
emission limits of Sec. 90.210 for frequencies outside of the booster's 
designed passband.
    (d) Class B broadband signal boosters are permitted to be used only 
in confined or indoor areas such as buildings, tunnels, underground 
areas, etc., or in remote areas, i.e., areas where there is little or no 
risk of interference to other users.

[[Page 346]]

    (e) The licensee is given authority to operate signal boosters 
without separate authorization from the Commission. Certificated 
equipment must be employed and the licensee must ensure that all 
applicable rule requirements are met.
    (f) Licensees employing either Class A narrowband or Class B 
broadband signal boosters as defined in Sec. 90.7 are responsible for 
correcting any harmful interference that the equipment may cause to 
other systems. Normal co-channel transmissions will not be considered as 
harmful interference. Licensees will be required to resolve interference 
problems pursuant to Sec. 90.173(b).

    (2) All authorizations are subject to the condition that no harmful 
interference will be caused to television reception on Channels 4 and 5.
    (3) The applicant must agree to eliminate any harmful interference 
caused by his operation to TV reception on either Channel 4 or 5 that 
might develop by whatever means are necessary. Such action must be taken 
within 90 days of notification by the Commission. If such interference 
is not eliminated within the 90-day period, operation of the fixed 
station will be discontinued.
    (4) Vertical polarization must be used.
    (5) Whenever it is proposed to locate a 72-76 MHz fixed station less 
than 128 km (80 mi.) but more than 16 km (10 mi.) from the site of a TV 
transmitter operating on either channel 4 or 5, or from the post office 
of a community in which such channels are assigned but not in operation, 
the fixed station shall be authorized only if there are fewer than 100 
family dwelling units (as defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census), 
excluding units 112 or more km (70 mi.) distant from the TV antenna 
site, located within a circle centered at the location of the proposed 
fixed station. The radius shall be determined by use of the following 
chart entitled, ``Chart for Determining Radius From Fixed Station in 72-
76 MHz Band to Interference Contour Along Which 10 Percent of Service 
From Adjacent Channel

[[Page 356]]

Television Station Would Be Destroyed.'' Two charts are available, one 
for Channel 4, and one for Channel 5. The Commission may, however, in a 
particular case, authorize the location of a fixed station within a 
circle containing 100 or more family dwelling units upon a showing that:
    (i) The proposed site is the only suitable location.
    (ii) It is not feasible, technically or otherwise, to use other 
available frequencies.
    (iii) The applicant has a plan to control any interference that 
might develop to TV reception from his operations.
    (iv) The applicant is financially able and agrees to make such 
adjustments in the TV receivers affected as may be necessary to 
eliminate any interference caused by his operations.
    (v) All applications seeking authority to operate with a separation 
of less than 16 km (10 mi.) will be returned without action.
    (b) The following criteria governs the authorization and use of 
frequencies in the 72-76 MHz band by mobile stations in the Industrial/
Business Pool.
    (1) Mobile operation on frequencies in the 72-76 MHz band is subject 
to the condition that no interference is caused to the reception of 
television stations operating on Channel 4 or 5. Interference will be 
considered to occur whenever reception of a regularly used television 
signal is impaired by signals radiated by stations operating under these 
rules in the 72 to 76 MHz band regardless of the quality of such 
reception or the strength of the signal used. In order to minimize the 
hazard of such interference, it shall be the duty of the licensee to 
determine whether interference is being caused to television reception, 
wherever television receivers other than those under the control of the 
licensee, are located within 31 m. (100 ft.) of any point where the 
stations licensed under these rules may be operated. In any case, it 
shall be the responsibility of the licensee to correct, at its own 
expense, any such interference and if the interference cannot be 
eliminated by the application of suitable techniques, the operation of 
the offending transmitter shall be suspended. If the complainant refuses 
to permit the licensee to apply remedial techniques which demonstrably 
will eliminate the interference without impairment of the original 
reception, the licensee is absolved of further responsibility.
    (2) The maximum transmitter output power that will be authorized is 
1 watt; and each station authorized will be classified and licensed as a 
mobile station. Any units of such a station, however, may be used to 
provide the operational functions of a base or fixed station. The 
antennas of transmitters operating on these frequencies must be directly 
mounted or installed upon the transmitting unit: Except that when 
permanently installed aboard a vehicle, antenna and transmitter may be 
separated as required for convenience in mounting. Horizontal 
polarization will not be allowed; and the gain of antennas employed 
shall not exceed that of a halfwave dipole. The maximum bandwidth that 
will be authorized is 20 kHz. Tone control transmissions are permitted.
    (c) Radio remote control of models is permitted on frequencies 10 
kHz removed from these frequencies authorized for fixed and mobile 
operations in the 72-76 MHz band. Remote control operations are 
secondary to operation of fixed and mobile stations as provided for in 
this section.

    Frequencies below 25 MHz when shown in the radio pool frequency 
listings under this part will be assigned to base or mobile stations 
only upon a satisfactory showing that, from a safety of life standpoint, 
frequencies above 25 MHz will not meet the operational requirements of 
the applicant. These frequencies are available for assignment in many 
areas; however, in individual cases such assignment may be impracticable 
due to conflicting frequency use authorized to stations in other 
services by this and other countries. In such cases, a substitute 
frequency, if found available, may be assigned from the following bands: 
1705-1750 kHz, 2107-2170 kHz, 2194-2495 kHz, 2506-2850 kHz, 3155-3400 
kHz, or 4438-4650 kHz. Since such assignments are in certain instances 
subject to additional technical and operation limitations, it is 
necessary that each application also include precise information 
concerning transmitter output power, type and directional 
characteristics, if any, of the antenna, and the minimum necessary hours 
of operation. (This section is not applicable to the Radiolocation 
Service, subpart F of this part.)

[[Page 369]]

an authorized bandwidth of 11.25 kHz, may obtain primary status with 
respect to co-channel licensees by supplying their coordinates to the 
Commission. These licensees will continue to operate on a secondary 
basis with respect to adjacent channel licensees. Additionally, these 
licensees may continue to operate with an authorized bandwidth wider 
than 11.25 kHz on such low power frequencies, subject to the provisions 
of Sec. 90.209(b) of this chapter.
    (7) Unless specified elsewhere in this part, licensees as of August 
5, 1999, licensed for operations with an emission designator wider than 
11.25 kHz on frequencies that are subject to an authorized bandwidth of 
11.25 kHz, which are not low power frequencies, may obtain primary 
status with respect to co-channel licensees by modifying their license 
to low power frequencies, supplying their coordinates to the Commission, 
and otherwise complying with the conditions of paragraphs (b) through 
(g) of this section. These licensees will continue to operate on a 
secondary basis with respect to adjacent channel licensees. 
Additionally, these licensees may continue to operate with an authorized 
bandwidth wider than 11.25 kHz on such low power frequencies, subject to 
the provisions of Sec. 90.209(b) of this chapter.
    (8) Applicants proposing to operate with an authorized bandwidth 
wider than 11.25 kHz, on low power frequencies that are subject to an 
authorized bandwidth of 11.25 kHz, may be licensed on a secondary, non-
interference basis. Such applicants are subject to the conditions of 
paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section and the provisions of Sec. 
90.209(b) of this chapter.

Sec. 90.305  Location of stations.

    (a) The transmitter site(s) for base station(s), including mobile 
relay stations, shall be located not more than 80 km. (50 mi.) from the 
geographic center of the urbanized area listed in Sec. 90.303.
    (b) Mobile units shall be operated within 48 km. (30 mi.) of their 
associated base station or stations. Such units may not be operated 
aboard aircraft in flight except as provided for in Sec. 90.315(i).
    (c) Control stations must be located within the area of operation of 
the mobile units.
    (d) Base and control stations shall be located a minimum of 1.6 km. 
(1 mi.) from local television stations operating on UHF TV channels 
separated by 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 TV channels from the television 
channel in which the base station will operate.

Sec. 90.307  Protection criteria.

    The tables and figures listed in Sec. 90.309 shall be used to 
determine the effective radiated power (ERP) and antenna height of the 
proposed land mobile base station and the ERP for the associated control 
station (control station antenna height shall not exceed 31 meters (100 
feet) above average terrain (AAT)).
    (a) Base stations operating on the frequencies available for land 
mobile use in any urbanized area and having an antenna height (AAT) less 
than 152 meters (500 feet) shall afford protection to co-channel and 
adjacent channel television stations in accordance with the values set 
out in tables A and E of Sec. 90.309, except for channel 15 in New 
York, NY, and Cleveland, OH, and channel 16 in Detroit, MI, where 
protection will be in accordance with the values set forth in tables B 
and E in 47 CFR 90.309.
    (b) For base stations having antenna heights between 152 and 914 
meters (500-3000 feet) above average terrain, the effective radiated 
power must be reduced below 1 kilowatt in accordance with the values 
shown in the power reduction graph in Figure A in Sec. 90.309, except 
for channel 15 in New York, NY, and Cleveland, OH, and channel 16 in 
Detroit, MI, where the effective radiated power must be reduced in 
accordance with Figure B in Sec. 90.309. For heights of more than 152 
meters (500 feet) above average terrain, the distance to the radio path 
horizon will be calculated assuming smooth earth. If the distance so 
determined equals or exceeds the distance to the Grade B contour of a 
co-channel TV station (Grade B contour defined in Sec. 73.683(a) of 
this chapter), an authorization will not be granted unless it can be 
shown that actual terrain considerations are such as to provide the 
desired protection at the Grade B contour, or that the effective 
radiated power will be further reduced so that, assuming free space 
attenuation, the desired protection at the Grade B contour will be 
achieved.
    (c) Mobile units and control stations operating on the frequencies 
available for land mobile use in any given urbanized area shall afford 
protection to co-channel and adjacent channel television stations in 
accordance with the values set forth in table C in Sec. 90.309 and 
paragraph (d) of this section except for channel 15 in New York, NY, and 
Cleveland, OH, and channel 16 in Detroit, MI, where protection will be 
in accordance with the values set forth in table D in Sec. 90.309 and 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) The minimum distance between a land mobile base station which 
has associated mobile units and a protected adjacent channel television 
station is 145 km (90 miles).
    (e) The television stations to be protected (co-channel, adjacent 
channel, IM, and IF) in any given urbanized area, in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section, are 
identified in the Commission's publication ``TV stations to be 
considered in the preparation of Applications for Land Mobile Facilities 
in the Band 470-512 MHz.'' The publication is available at the offices 
of the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, DC or upon the 
request of interested persons.

Sec. 90.309  Tables and figures.

    (a) Directions for using the tables. (1) Using the method specified 
in Sec. 1.958 of this chapter, determine the distances between the 
proposed land mobile base station and the protected co-channel

[[Page 377]]

television station and between the proposed land mobile base station and 
the protected adjacent channel television station. If the exact mileage 
does not appear in table A for protected co-channel television stations 
(or table B for channel 15 in New York and Cleveland and channel 16 in 
Detroit) or table E for protected adjacent channel television stations, 
the next lower mileage separation figure is to be used.
    (2) Entering the proper table at the mileage figure found in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, find opposite, a selection of powers 
that may be used for antenna heights ranging from 15 m (50 ft) to 152.5 
m (500 ft) (AAT). If the exact antenna height proposed for the land 
mobile base station does not appear in the proper table, use the power 
figure beneath the next greater antenna height.
    (3) The lowest power found using the tables mentioned in paragraphs 
(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section is the maximum power that may be 
employed by the proposed land mobile base station.
    (4) In determining the average elevation of the terrain, the 
elevations between 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) and 16 kilometers (10 miles) 
from the antenna site are employed. Profile graphs shall be drawn for a 
minimum of eight radials beginning at the antenna site and extending 16 
kilometers (10 miles). The radials should be drawn starting with true 
north. At least one radial should be constructed in the direction of the 
nearest co-channel and adjacent channel UHF television stations. The 
profile graph for each radial shall be plotted by contour intervals of 
from 12.2 meters (40 feet) to 30.5 meters (100 feet) and, where the data 
permits, at least 50 points of elevation (generally uniformly spaced) 
should be used for each radial. For very rugged terrain, 61 meters (200 
feet) to 122 meters (400 foot) contour intervals may be used. Where the 
terrain is uniform or gently sloping, the smallest contour interval 
indicated on the topographic chart may be used. The average elevation of 
the 12.8 kilometer (8 mile) distance between 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) 
and 16 kilometers (10 miles) from the antenna site should be determined 
from the profile graph for each radial. This may be obtained by 
averaging a large number of equally spaced points, by using a 
planimeter, or by obtaining the median elevation (that exceeded by 50 
percent of the distance) in sectors and averaging those values. In the 
preparation of the profile graphs, the elevation or contour intervals 
may be taken from U.S. Geological Survey Topographic Maps, U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers Maps, or Tennessee Valley Authority Maps. Maps with a 
scale of 1:250,000 or larger (such as 1:24,000) shall be used. Digital 
Terrain Data Tapes, provided by the National Cartographic Institute, 
U.S. Geologic Survey, may be utilized in lieu of maps, but the number of 
data points must be equal to or exceed that specified above. If such 
maps are not published for the area in question, the next best 
topographic information should be used.
    (5) Applicants for base stations in the Miami, FL, urbanized area 
may, in lieu of calculating the height of average terrain, use 3 m (10 
ft) as the average terrain height.

    (b) Directions for Using the Figures. (1) Determine antenna height 
above average terrain. (According to Sec. 90.309(a)(4).)
    (2) Locate this value on the antenna height axis.
    (3) Determine the separation between the LM antenna site and the 
nearest protected co-channel TV station. (According to Sec. 73.611.)
    (4) Draw a vertical line to intersect the LM/TV separation curve at 
the distance determined in step 3 above. For distances not shown in the 
graph use linear interpolation.
    (5) From the intersection of the LM/TV separation curve draw a 
horizontal line to the power reduction scale.
    (6) The power reduction in dB determines the reduction below 1 kW 
that must be achieved.
    (7) See table F for dB/power equivalents.

Sec. 90.313  Frequency loading criteria.

    (a) Except as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
maximum channel loading on frequencies in the 470-512 MHz band is as 
follows:
    (1) 50 units for systems eligible in the Public Safety Pool (see 
Sec. 90.20(a)).
    (2) 90 units for systems eligible in the Industrial/Business Pool 
(see Sec. 90.35(a)).
    (b) If a licensee has exclusive use of a frequency, then the loading 
standards in paragraph (a) of this section, may be exceeded. If it is a 
shared channel, the loading standards can be exceeded upon submission of 
a signed statement by all those sharing the channel agreeing to the 
increase.
    (c) A unit is defined as a mobile transmitter-receiver. Loading 
standards will be applied in terms of the number of units actually in 
use or to be placed in use within 8 months following authorization. A 
licensee will be required to show that an assigned frequency pair is at 
full capacity before it may be assigned a second or additional frequency 
pair. Channel capacity may be reached either by the requirements of a 
single licensee or by several users sharing a channel. Until a channel 
is loaded to capacity it will be available for assignment to other users 
in the same area. A frequency pair may be reassigned at distances 64 km. 
(40 mi.), 32 km. (20 mi.) for Channel 15, Chicago; Channel 20, 
Philadelphia; and Channel 17, Washington, or more from the location of 
base stations authorized on that pair without reference to loading at 
the point of original installation. Following authorization, the 
licensee shall notify the Commission either during or at the close of 
the 8 month period of the number of units in operation. In the 
Industrial Radio Services, if the base station facility is to be used by 
more than a single licensee, the frequency assigned to it will not be 
reassigned for use by another facility within 64 km. (40 mi.) or 32 km. 
(20 mi.) where applicable for a period of 12 months, Provided, That the 
facility is constructed within 90 days from the date of the first grant, 
meets the loading standards to at least 50 percent within 9 months, and 
meets all loading standards within 12 months.

    Note: To determine the maximum permissible effective radiated power:
    (1) As specified in Sec. 73.611 determine the distance between the 
proposed station and the cochannel television station. If the exact 
distance does not appear in table 1 of this section, the next lower 
distance separation is to be used.

    (2) Opposite this distance figure ERPs are given that may be used 
for antenna heights of 30.5, 45 or 61 meters (100, 150 or 200 ft) ASL. 
If the exact antenna height is not shown, the ERP allowed will be that 
shown for the next higher antenna height.
    (e) Shore stations communicating point-to-point with offshore 
stations will be permitted at least the same ERP as the offshore 
station, but only in the direction of the offshore station. A 
directional antenna shall be used and the rearward radiated power from 
the antenna in a sector <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>22\1/2\[deg] from the line 
joining the shore antenna to the cochannel television station shall not 
exceed those shown in table 2 of this section.

    Note: As an example of the use of tables 1 and 2, assume an offshore 
station located 290 km (180 mi) from TV Channel 17 located in Bude, 
Miss. with an antenna height of 30.5 m (100 ft). Table 1 allows this 
station to operate with 250 W ERP. Now assume the shore station 
communicating with the offshore station is 48 km (30 mi) from the

forth in this subpart.

[64 FR 66410, Nov. 26, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 90.351  Location and Monitoring Service.

    These provisions authorize the licensing of systems in the Location 
and Monitoring Service (LMS). LMS systems utilize non-voice radio 
techniques to determine the location and status of mobile radio units. 
LMS licensees authorized to operate a system in the 902-928 MHz band may 
serve individuals, federal government agencies, and entities eligible 
for licensing in this part 90.
    (a) Each application to license an LMS system shall include the 
following supplemental information:
    (1) A detailed description of the manner in which the system will 
operate, including a map or diagram.
    (2) The necessary or occupied bandwidth of emission, whichever is 
greater.
    (3) The data transmission characteristics as follows:
    (i) The vehicle location update rates;
    (ii) Specific transmitter modulation techniques used;
    (iii) For codes and timing scheme: A table of bit sequences and 
their alphanumeric or indicator equivalents, and a statement of bit rise 
time, bit transmission rates, bit duration, and interval between bits;
    (iv) A statement of amplitude-versus-time of the interrogation and 
reply formats, and an example of a typical message transmission and any 
synchronizing pulses utilized.
    (4) A plan to show the implementation schedule during the initial 
license term.
    (b) LMS stations are exempted from the identification requirements 
of Sec. 90.425; however, the Commission may impose automatic station 
identification requirements when determined to be necessary for 
monitoring and enforcement purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 90.353  LMS operations in the 902-928 MHz band.

    LMS systems may be authorized within the 902-928 MHz band, subject 
to the conditions in this section. LMS licensees are required to 
maintain whatever records are necessary to demonstrate compliance with 
these provisions and must make these records available to the Commission 
upon request:
    (a) LMS operations will not cause interference to and must tolerate 
interference from industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) devices and 
radiolocation Government stations that operate in the 902-928 MHz band.
    (b) LMS systems are authorized to transmit status and instructional 
messages, either voice or non-voice, so long as they are related to the 
location or monitoring functions of the system.
    (c) LMS systems may utilize store and forward interconnection, where 
either transmissions from a vehicle or object being monitored are stored 
by the LMS provider for later transmission over the public switched 
network (PSN), or transmissions received by the LMS provider from the 
PSN are stored for later transmission to the vehicle or object being 
monitored. Real-time interconnection between vehicles or objects being 
monitored and the PSN will only be permitted to enable emergency 
communications related to a vehicle or a passenger in a vehicle. Such 
real-time, interconnected communications may only be sent to or received 
from a system dispatch point or entities eligible in the Public Safety 
or Special Emergency Radio Services. See subparts B and C of this part.
    (d) Multilateration LMS systems will be authorized on a primary 
basis within the bands 904-909.75 MHz and 921.75-927.25 MHz. 
Additionally, multilateration and non-multilateration systems will share 
the 919.75-921.75 MHz band on a co-equal basis. Licensing will be on the 
basis of Economic Areas (EAs) for multilateration systems, with one 
exclusive EA license being issued for each of these three sub-bands. 
Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, multilateration EA 
licensees may be authorized to operate on only one of the three 
multilateration bands within a given EA. Additionally, EA 
multilateration LMS licenses will be conditioned upon the licensee's 
ability to demonstrate through actual field tests that their systems do 
not cause

[[Page 387]]

unacceptable levels of interference to 47 CFR part 15 devices.
    (e) Multilateration EA-licensed systems and grandfathered automatic 
vehicle monitoring service (AVM) systems (see Sec. 90.363) are 
authorized on a shared basis and must cooperate in the selection and use 
of frequencies in accordance with Sec. 90.173(b).
    (f) Multilateration EA licensees may be authorized to operate on 
both the 919.75-921.75 MHz and 921.75-927.75 MHz bands within a given EA 
(see Sec. 90.209(b)(5)).
    (g) Multilateration LMS systems whose primary operations involve the 
provision of vehicle location services, may provide non-vehicular 
location services.
    (h) Non-multilateration stations are authorized to operate on a 
shared, non-exclusive basis in the 902-904 MHz and 909.75-921.75 MHz 
sub-bands. Non-multilateration systems and multilateration systems will 
share the 919.75-921.75 MHz band on a co-equal basis. Non-
multilateration LMS systems may not provide non-vehicular location 
services. The maximum antenna height above ground for non-
multilateration LMS systems is 15 meters.
    (i) Non-multilateration LMS licenses will be issued on a site-by-
site basis, except that municipalities or other governmental operatives 
may file jointly for a non-multilateration license covering a given U.S. 
Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis Economic Area (EA). 
Such an application must identify all planned sites. After receiving the 
license, the non-multilateration EA licensee must notify the Commission 
if sites are deleted or if new sites are added, before those sites may 
be put into operation.

Sec. 90.355  LMS operations below 512 MHz.

    Applications requiring not more than 25 kHz bandwidth per frequency 
in the 25-50 MHz, 150-170 MHz, and 450-512 MHz bands may use either 
base-mobile frequencies currently assigned the applicant, or be assigned 
base-mobile frequencies available in the service in which eligibility 
has been established, provided that:
    (a) For transmission between vehicles and base stations, each 
frequency in a single-frequency mode of operation will provide location 
data for approximately 200 vehicles, or both frequencies in a two-
frequency mode of operation will provide location data for approximately 
400 vehicles, except that for frequencies in the 450-512 MHz band that 
are assigned in pairs in accordance with the allocation plan for the 
band, the requirement is that location data be provided for 
approximately 200 vehicles for each frequency pair; and a showing is 
made that 50 percent of the vehicles will be in operation within the 
system by the end of the second year of the initial license term, and 70 
percent will be in operation within the system by the end of the initial 
license term; except that if these vehicle loading standards will not be 
met, frequencies will be assigned only on a secondary non-interference 
basis to any authorized radiotelephony operation.
    (b) The minimum separation between a proposed LMS station and the 
nearest co-channel base station of another licensee operating a voice 
system is 75 miles (120 km) for a single frequency mode of operation or 
35 miles (56 km) for a two-frequency mode of operation. Where the 
minimum mileage separation cannot be achieved, agreement to the use of 
F1D, F2D, G1D, G2D or P0N emission must be received from all existing 
co-channel licensees using voice emissions within the applicable mileage 
limits. If there is interference with voice operations and required 
agreement was not received, or operation was authorized on a secondary 
non-interference basis, the licensee of the LMS system is responsible 
for eliminating the interference.
    (c) Frequencies additional to any assigned under paragraph (a) of 
this section will not be assigned to the same licensee at any stations 
located within 64 km (40 miles) of any station in which the licensee 
holds an interest until each of such licensee's frequencies for LMS 
operation is shown to accommodate not less than 90 percent of the 
frequency loading requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section.

Sec. 90.373  Eligibility in the DSRCS.

    The following entities are eligible to hold an authorization to 
operate Roadside units in the DSRCS:
    (a) Any territory, possession, state, city, county, town or similar 
governmental entity.
    (b) Any entity meeting the eligibility requirements of Sec. Sec. 
90.33 or 90.35.

[69 FR 46443, Aug. 3, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 90.375  RSU license areas, communication zones and registrations

    (a) DSRCS Roadside Units (RSUs) in the 5850-5925 MHz band are 
licensed on the basis of non-exclusive geographic areas. Governmental 
applicants will be issued a geographic area license based on the geo-
political area encompassing the legal jurisdiction of the entity. All 
other applicants will be issued a geographic area license for their 
proposed area of operation based on county(s), state(s) or nationwide.
    (b) Applicants who are approved in accordance with FCC Form 601 will 
be granted non-exclusive licenses for all non-reserved DSRCS frequencies 
(see Sec. 90.377). Such licenses serve as a prerequisite of registering 
individual RSUs located within the licensed geographic area described in 
paragraph (a) of this section. Licensees must register each RSU in the 
Universal Licensing System (ULS) before operating such RSU. RSU 
registrations are subject, inter alia, to the requirements of Sec. 
1.923 of this chapter as applicable (antenna structure registration, 
environmental concerns, international coordination, and quiet zones). 
Additionally, RSUs at locations subject to NTIA coordination (see Sec. 
90.371(b) may not begin operation until NTIA -approval is received. 
Registrations are not effective until the Commission posts them on the 
ULS.
    (c) Licensees must operate each RSU in accordance with the 
Commission's Rules and the registration data posted on the ULS for such 
RSU. Licensees must register each RSU for the smallest communication 
zone needed (for the DSRC-based intelligent transportation systems 
application) using one of the following four communication zones:

  power to overcome cable losses to the antenna as long as the antenna
  input power does not exceed 28.8 dBm and the EIRP does not exceed 44.8
  dBm. However, specific channels and categories of uses have additional
  limitations under the ASTM-DSRC Standard.

\1\ An RSU may employ an antenna with a height exceeding 8 meters but not exceeding 15 meters provided the EIRP
  specified in the table above is reduced by a factor of 20 log(Ht/8) in dB where Ht is the height of the
  radiation center of the antenna in meters above the roadway bed surface. The EIRP is measured as the maximum
  EIRP toward the horizon or horizontal, whichever is greater, of the gain associated with the main or center of
  the transmission beam. The RSU antenna height shall not exceed 15 meters above the roadway bed surface.
\2\ Channel 172 is designated for public safety applications involving safety of life and property.
\3\ Channel Nos. 174/176 may be combined to create a twenty megahertz channel, designated Channel No. 175.
  Channels 180/182 may be combined to create a twenty-megahertz channel, designated Channel No. 181.
\4\ Channel 184 is designated for public safety applications involving safety of life and property. Only those
  entities meeting the requirements of Sec. 90.373(a) are eligible to hold an authorization to operate on this
  channel.

    (c) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, 
non-reserve DSRCS channels are available on a shared basis only for use 
in accordance with the Commission's rules. All licensees shall cooperate 
in the selection and use of channels in order to reduce interference. 
This includes monitoring for communications in progress and any other 
measures as may be necessary to minimize interference. Licensees of RSUs 
suffering or causing harmful interference within a communications zone 
are expected to cooperate and resolve this problem by mutually 
satisfactory arrangements. If the licensees are unable to do so, the 
Commission may impose restrictions including specifying the transmitter 
power, antenna height and direction, additional filtering, or area or 
hours of operation of the stations concerned. Further the use of any 
channel at a given geographical location may be denied when, in the 
judgment of the Commission, its use at that location is not in the 
public interest; use of any such channel may be restricted as to 
specified geographical areas, maximum power, or such other operating 
conditions, contained in this part or in the station authorization.
    (d) Safety/public safety priority. The following access priority 
governs all DSRCS operations:
    (1) Communications involving the safety of life have access priority 
over all other DSRCS communications;
    (2) Subject to a control channel priority system management strategy 
(see ASTM E2213-03 DSRC Standard at Sec. 4.1.1.2(4)), DSRCS 
communications involving public safety have access priority over all 
other DSRC communications not listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section. Roadside Units (RSUs) operated by state or local governmental 
entities are presumptively engaged in public safety priority 
communications.
    (e) Non-priority communications. DSRCS communications not listed in 
paragraph (d) of this section, are non-priority communications. If a 
dispute arises concerning non-priority communications, the licensee of 
the later-registered RSU must accommodate the operation of the early 
registered RSU, i.e., interference protection rights are date-sensitive, 
based on the date that the RSU is first registered (see Sec. 90.375) 
and the later-registered RSU must modify its operations to resolve the 
dispute in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (f) Except as otherwise provided in the ASTM-DSRC Standard (see 
Sec. 90.379) for the purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, 
objectionable interference will be considered to exist when the 
Commission receives a complaint and the difference in signal strength 
between the earlier-registered RSU and the later-registered RSU 
(anywhere within the earlier-registered RSU's communication zone) is 18 
dB or less (co-channel). Later-registered RSUs causing objectionable 
interference must correct the interference immediately unless written 
consent is obtained from the licensee of the earlier-registered RSU.

Sec. 90.419  Points of communication.

    Normally, operations licensed under this part are intended to 
provide intrastation mobile communications. For example, a base station 
is intended to communicate with its associated mobile stations and 
mobile stations are intended to communicate between associated mobile 
stations and associated base stations of the licensee. Accordingly, 
operations between base stations at fixed locations are permitted only 
in the following situations:
    (a) Base stations licensed under subpart T of this part and those in 
the Public Safety Pool that operate on frequencies below 450 MHz, may 
communicate on a secondary basis with other base stations, operational 
fixed stations, or fixed receivers authorized in these services or 
pools.
    (b) Base stations licensed on any frequency in the Industrial/
Business Pool and on base stations frequencies above 450 MHz in the 
Public Safety Pool may communicate on a secondary basis with other base 
stations, operational fixed stations, or fixed receivers authorized in 
these pools only when:
    (1) The messages to be transmitted are of immediate importance to 
mobile stations; or
    (2) Wireline communications facilities between such points are 
inoperative, economically impracticable, or unavailable from 
communications common carrier sources. Temporary unavailability due to a 
busy wireline circuit is not considered to be within the provisions of 
this paragraph.
    (c) Operational fixed stations may communicate with units of 
associated mobile stations only on a secondary basis.
    (d) Operational fixed stations licensed in the Industrial/Business 
Pool may communicate on a secondary basis with associated base stations 
licensed in these services when:
    (1) The messages to be transmitted are of immediate importance to

Sec. 90.421  Operation of mobile station units not under the control 
of the licensee.

    Mobile stations, as defined in Sec. 90.7, include vehicular-mounted 
and hand-held units. Such units may be operated by persons other than 
the licensee, as provided for below, when necessary for the licensee to 
meet its requirements in connection with the activities for which it is 
licensed. If the number of

[[Page 396]]

such units, together with units operated by the licensee, exceeds the 
number of mobile units authorized to the licensee, license modification 
is required. The licensee is responsible for taking necessary 
precautions to prevent unauthorized operation of such units not under 
its control.
    (a) Public Safety Pool. (1) Mobile units licensed in the Public 
Safety Pool may be installed in any vehicle which in an emergency would 
require cooperation and coordination with the licensee, and in any 
vehicle used in the performance, under contract, of official activities 
of the licensee. This provision does not permit the installation of 
radio units in non-emergency vehicles that are not performing 
governmental functions under contract but with which the licensee might 
wish to communicate.
    (2) Mobile units licensed under Sec. 90.20(a)(2)(iii) may be 
installed in a vehicle or be hand-carried for use by any person with 
whom cooperation or coordinations is required for medical services 
activities.
    (3) On the Interoperability Channels in the 700 MHz Public Safety 
Band (See Sec. 90.531(b)(1)), hand-held and vehicular transmitters may 
be operated by any licensee holding a license in the 700 MHz Public 
Safety Band or by any licensee holding a license for any other public 
safety frequency pursuant to part 90 of the Commission's rules. 
Therefore, individual licenses are not required for hand-held and 
vehicular transmitters in the 700 MHz Band.
    (b) Industrial/Business Pool. Mobile units licensed in the 
Industrial/Business Pool may be installed in vehicles of persons 
furnishing under contract to the licensee and for the duration of the 
contract, a facility or service directly related to the activities of 
the licensee.
    (c) In addition to the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, frequencies assigned to licensees in the Private Land 
Mobile Radio Services may be installed in the facilities of those who 
assist the licensee in emergencies and with whom the licensee must 
communicate in situations involving imminent safety to life or property.

Sec. 90.423  Operation on board aircraft.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this 
section, and except as may be provided in other sections of this part 
with respect to operation on specific frequencies, mobile stations first 
authorized after September 14, 1973, under this part may be operated 
aboard aircraft for air-to-mobile, air-to-base, air-to-air and air-to-
ship communications subject to the following:
    (1) Operations are limited to aircraft that are regularly flown at 
altitudes below 1.6 km (1 mi) above the earth's surface;
    (2) Transmitters are to operate with an output power not to exceed 
ten watts;
    (3) Operations are secondary to land-based systems;
    (4) Such other conditions, including additonal reductions of 
altitude and power limitations, as may be required to minimize the 
interference potential to land-based systems.
    (b) Exceptions to the altitude and power limitations set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section may be authorized upon a showing of 
unusual operational requirements which justify departure from those 
standards, provided that the interference potential to regular land-
based operations would not be increased.
    (c) Mobile operations aboard aircraft in the services governed by 
this part, under licenses in effect September 14, 1973, may be continued 
without regard to provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, as 
follows:
    (1) Operations may be continued only for the balance of the term of 
such licenses if aircraft involved are regularly flown at altitudes 
greater than 1.6 km (1 mi) above the earth's surface.
    (2) Operations may be continued for one additional renewal license 
term if the aircraft involved are regularly flown at altitudes below 1.6 
km (1 mi) above the earth's surface.
    (d) Operation of radiolocation mobile stations may be authorized 
without regard to limitations and conditions set forth in paragraphs 
(a), (b), and (c) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 90.425  Station identification.

    Stations licensed under this part shall transmit identification in 
accordance with the following provisions:
    (a) Identification procedure. Except as provided for in paragraphs 
(d) and (e) of this section, each station or system shall be identified 
by the transmission of the assigned call sign during each transmission 
or exchange of transmissions, or once each 15 minutes (30 minutes in the 
Public Safety Pool) during periods of continuous operation. The call 
sign shall be transmitted by voice in the English language or by 
International Morse Code in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section. If the station is employing either analog or digital voice 
scrambling, or non-voice emission, transmission of the required 
identification shall be in the unscrambled mode using A3E, F3E or G3E 
emission, or International Morse, with all encoding disabled. 
Permissible alternative identification procedures are as follows:
    (1) A mobile relay stations call sign may be used to identify the 
associated control and mobile stations, except in the Public Safety Pool 
where the stations operate on frequencies below 450 MHz. Alternatively, 
a base station (including a mobile relay station) which is controlled by 
radio may be identified by the transmission of the call sign of the 
station at which communications originate.
    (2) One or more fixed relay stations may be identified by the 
transmission of the call signs of the stations at which the 
communications originate.
    (3) When a mobile station transmits on a different frequency than 
its associated base station, the assigned call sign of either the mobile 
station or the base station may be transmitted. Further, a single mobile 
unit in the licensee's authorized geographic area of operation may 
transmit station identification on behalf of any other operating mobile 
units in the fleet.
    (4) Use of an identifier other than the assigned call sign. (i) In 
the Public Safety Pool, mobile units licensed to a governmental entity 
and which operate on frequencies above 30 MHz may use an identifier 
which contains, at a minimum, the name of the licensee if the licensee 
maintains at the station a list of the special identifiers to be used by 
the mobile units.
    (ii) In the Industrial/Business Pool, licensees may request the 
Commission's local Engineer-in-Charge to approve the use of special 
mobile unit identifiers in lieu of the assigned call sign. Such 
requests, however, will not be granted where it appears that harmful 
interference to international operations may be caused by stations below 
50 MHz, or by stations operating in areas within 80 km (50 miles) of an 
international boundary, or where it appears that the proposed method of 
identification will not adequately distinguish the mobile units of the 
applicant from the mobile units of other licensees in the area.
    (iii) In the Industrial/Business Pool, railroad licensees (as 
defined in Sec. 90.7) may identify stations by the name of the railroad 
and the train number, caboose number, engine number, or the name of the 
fixed wayside station. If none of these forms is practicable, any 
similar name or number may be designated by the railroad concerned for 
use by its employees in the identification of fixed points or mobile 
units, provided that a list of such identifiers is maintained by the 
railroad. An abbreviated name or the initials of the railroad may be 
used where such are in general usage. In those areas where it is shown 
that no difficulty would be encountered in identifying the transmission 
of a particular station (as, for example, where stations of one licensee 
are located in a yard isolated from other radio installations), approval 
may be given to a request from the licensee for permission to omit the 
station identification.
    (5) Use of identifiers in addition to assigned call signs. Nothing 
in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the transmission of 
station or unit identifiers which may be necessary or desirable for 
system operation, provided that they are transmitted in addition to the 
assigned station call sign or other permissible form of identification.

[[Page 398]]

    (b) Use of automatic Morse code identification equipment. 
Automatically activated equipment may be used to transmit station 
identification in International Morse Code pursuant to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The signal output of the automatic identification equipment 
shall be connected to the transmitter at the microphone input or any 
other manufacturer-provided signal input terminal and shall be adjusted 
to produce 40 percent <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent of the maximum 
permissible modulation or deviation level. This adjustment shall be 
performed when all other modulating signals are absent.
    (2) The Morse code transmission rate shall be maintained between 20 
and 25 words per minute.
    (3) The frequency of the keyed tone comprising the identification 
signal shall be 1200 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>800 Hz. A licensee may be 
required to change the frequency in order to prevent interference to the 
operations of another co-channel licensee.
    (4) Should activation of automatic Morse code identification 
equipment interrupt the communications of another co-channel licensee, 
the Commission may require the use of equipment which will delay 
automatic station identification until such co-channel communications 
are completed.
    (c) Special provisions for identification in the Radiolocation 
Service. (1) Stations in the Radiolocation Service are not required to 
identify except upon specific instruction from the Commission or as 
required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Stations in the Radiolocation Service operating on frequencies 
above 3400 kHz that employ spread spectrum techniques shall transmit a 
two letter manufacturer's designator, authorized by the Commission on 
the station authorization, at the beginning and ending of each 
transmission and once every 15 minutes during periods of continuing 
operation. The designator shall be transmitted in International Morse 
Code at a speed not exceeding 25 words per minute, and the spread 
spectrum mode of operation shall be maintained while the designator is 
being transmitted. The identifying signal shall be clearly receivable in 
the demodulated audio of a narrow-band FM receiver.
    (d) General exemptions. A station need not transmit identification 
if:
    (1) It is a mobile station operating on the transmitting frequency 
of the associated base station.
    (2) It is a mobile station in the Public Safety Pool using F1E or 
G1E emission.
    (3) It is transmitting for telemetering purposes or for the 
activation of devices which are employed solely as a means of attracting 
attention, or for remote control purposes, or which is retransmitting by 
self-actuating means, a radio signal received from another radio station 
or stations.
    (4) It is any type of radiopositioning or radar station authorized 
in a service other than the Radiolocation Service.
    (5) It is used solely for automatic vehicle monitoring or location.
    (6) It is a paging station authorized in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 90.20(a)(2)(v).
    (7) It is a mobile station employing non-voice emissions and the 
associated base station identifies on behalf of the mobile unit(s).
    (8) It is a base or mobile station in the 220-222 MHz band 
authorized to operate on a nationwide basis in accordance with subpart T 
of this part.
    (9) It is a wireless microphone station operating in accordance with 
the provisions of Sec. 90.265(b).
    (10) It is a Roadside Unit in a DSRCS system.
    (e) Special provisions for stations licensed under this part that 
are classified as CMRS providers under part 20 of this chapter.
    (1) Station identification will not be required for 929-930 MHz 
nationwide paging licensees or MTA or EA-based SMR licensees. All other 
CMRS stations will be required to comply with the station identification 
requirements of this paragraph.
    (2) CMRS stations subject to a station identification requirement 
will be permitted to use a single call sign for commonly owned 
facilities that are operated as part of a single system. The call sign 
must be transmitted each hour within five minutes of the hour, or upon 
completion of the first transmission after the hour.

[[Page 399]]

    (3) CMRS stations granted exclusive channels may transmit their call 
signs digitally. The station licensee must provide the Commission with 
information sufficient to decode the digital transmission to ascertain 
the transmitted call sign.

Sec. 90.461  Direct and remote control of transmitters.

    (a) In general. Radio transmitters may be operated and controlled 
directly (as when the operating position for the transmitter and the 
transmitter being operated are at the same location), or remotely (as 
when the transmitter being operated and the position from which it is 
being operated are at different locations).
    (b) Control of transmitters at remote locations. Radio transmitters 
at remote locations may be operated and controlled through the use of 
wire line or radio links; or through dial-up circuits, as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section. Such control links or circuits may be 
either those of the licensee or they may be provided by common carriers 
authorized by law to furnish such service.
    (c) Dial-up circuits. Dial-up circuits may be provided by wire line 
telephone companies under appropriate tariffs, and they may be used by 
licensees for purposes of transmitter control, provided:
    (1) The dial-up circuits serve only to link licensed transmitter 
control points and the transmitters being controlled.
    (2) The dial-up circuits are so designed that the transmitters being 
controlled cannot be operated from any fixed position other than the 
licensed control points for those transmitters.
    (3) Equipment used to provide the transmitter/dial-up-circuit 
interface is designed to preclude associated mobile units of the 
licensee from reaching any point(s) served by the wire line telephone 
facilities other than the control point(s) of the station(s) controlled.
    (4) Any direct electrical connection to the telephone network shall 
comply with applicable tariffs and with part 68 of the Commission's 
Rules (See Sec. 90.5(j)).
    (5) Interconnection, within the meaning of Sec. Sec. 90.7 and 
90.477 through 90.483, may not take place at a control point which 
connects to its associated transmitter(s) through dial-up circuits; nor 
may such dial-up transmitter control

<R05>
Sec. 90.463  Transmitter control points.

    (a) A control operator is required to be stationed at the operating 
position of a transmitter control point. A control operator is any 
person designated by the licensee to exercise supervision and control 
over the operation and use of the licensee's facilities. The control 
operator may be the licensee; or an employee of the licensee; or the 
agent of the licensee, appointed by the licensee to act as the control 
operator; or a third-party contractor, engaged by the licensee to serve 
as the control operator: Provided, however, In no case, through 
appointment or designation of any person to serve as control operator, 
may the licensee delegate any of the duties and responsibilities the 
licensee may have in his capacity as licensee.
    (b) Each station or licensed system of communication shall normally 
have a control point, or control points, at which the control operator 
or operators are stationed and at or from which the licensee may 
exercise supervision and control over the authorized facilities, as 
required by the provisions of Sec. 90.461. Provided, however, Control 
point requirements may vary from one system to another, depending upon 
the nature of the radio operation; the way and by whom the facilities 
are employed; and other factors, as set out in other rule sections under 
this subpart.
    (c) A transmitter control point may be located at a fixed position 
in a system of communication at or from which the control operator 
exercises supervision and control over the operation and use of the 
licensed facilities. Each fixed transmitter control point shall have 
equipment and facilities to permit the control operator:
    (1) To determine when the transmitter or transmitters controlled are 
either radiating ``RF'' energy, or when the transmitter circuits have 
been placed in a condition to produce such radiation. This may be 
accomplished either through the use of a carrier operated device which 
provides a visual indication when the transmitter(s) are radiating or a 
pilot lamp or meter which provides a visual indication when the 
transmitter circuits have been placed in a condition to produce 
radiation. Further, where a local transmitter is used to activate a 
remote transmitter or transmitters in the licensee's system of 
communication, a single pilot lamp or meter may be employed to indicate 
the activation of both the local and the remote transmitter(s).
    (2) To turn the carrier of the transmitter on and off at will, or to 
close the system down completely, when circumstances warrant such 
action.
    (d) The licensee's transmitting facilities may be operated from 
dispatch points, the fixed control point shall have equipment to permit 
the control operator to either disconnect the dispatch point circuits 
from the transmitter(s) or to render the transmitter(s) inoperative from 
any dispatch point being supervised.
    (e) Where the system is interconnected with public communication 
facilities, as provided at Sec. Sec. 90.477 through 90.483, and where 
those rules so require, the fixed control point shall be equipped to 
permit the control operator:
    (1) To monitor co-channel facilities of other licensees sharing an 
assigned channel or channels with the licensee in the licensee's area of 
operation; and,
    (2) To terminate any transmission(s) or communication(s) between 
points in the public communications system and the private 
communications system.
    (f) In urban areas, the location of fixed transmitter control points 
will be specified, ``same as transmitter,'' unless the control point is 
at a street address which is different from that of the transmitter(s) 
controlled. In rural areas, the location of fixed control points will be 
specified, ``same as transmitter,'' unless the control point is more 
than 152.5 m (500 ft) from the transmitter(s) controlled. In the latter 
case, the approximate location of the control point will be specified in 
distance and direction from the transmitter(s) controlled in terms of 
distance and geographical quadrant, respectively. It would be assumed 
that the location of a fixed control point is

[[Page 403]]

the same as the location of the transmitter(s) controlled, unless the 
applicant includes a request for a different location described in 
appropriate terms as indicated herein.
    (g) [Reserved]
    (h) Mobile transmitters shall be assumed to be under the immediate 
control of the mobile operator; provided, however, overall supervision 
and control of the operation and use of a communication system may be 
the responsibility of a fixed control point operator. In general, mobile 
transmitters shall be equipped to permit the operator to determine when 
they are radiating ``RF'' energy or when the transmitter circuits have 
been placed in a condition to produce such radiation. This may be 
accomplished either through the use of a carrier operated device or of a 
pilot lamp or meter which will provide a visual indication when the 
transmitter is radiating or has been placed in a condition to produce 
radiation provided, however, that hand-carried or pack-carried 
transmitters and transmitters installed on motorcycles need not be so 
equipped.

Sec. 90.465  Control of systems of communication.

    (a) Depending on design considerations, control of a system of 
communication may be exercised in varying ways. In single frequency 
simplex, base/mobile operations, control may be exercised by the control 
operator at the fixed control point. In mobile relay systems, where 
there is an associated control point or control station, control may be 
exercised by the operator at the control point or control station. In 
mobile-only systems, control may be exercised by the mobile operator. In 
communication systems involving multiple base stations or fixed relays 
control of the system may result from a combination of factors and 
considerations, including control by a fixed control point operator at 
some point within the system of communication or control by the mobile 
station operator of the licensee.
    (b) In internal systems, as defined in Sec. 90.7, control may be 
maintained by conforming the system to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 
90.471 through 90.475.
    (c) In interconnected systems, as defined in Sec. 90.7, control may 
be maintained by conforming operation and system design to that 
permitted in Sec. Sec. 90.477 through 90.483.

<R05>
Sec. 90.467  Dispatch points.

    Dispatch points meeting the requirements of this section need not be 
specifically authorized; provided, however, that the licensee of any 
radio station operated from a dispatch point or points shall assume full 
responsibility for the use and operation of the authorized facilities in 
compliance with all applicable provisions of law or rule and shall 
comply with the policy:
    (a) A dispatch point may be linked to the transmitter(s) being 
operated by private or leased wire line of fixed radio circuits, 
provided the requirements of Sec. 90.463 are met.
    (b) No telephone position in the public, switched, telephone network 
will be treated as a dispatch point within the meaning or intent of this 
section.
    (c) Operation of transmitting facilities from dispatch points is 
permitted only when the control operator at a fixed control point in the 
system is on duty and at no other time.


<R05>
Sec. 90.469  Unattended operation.

    (a) Subject to the provisions of Sec. Sec. 90.243, 90.245, and 
90.247, mobile relay, fixed relay, and mobile repeater stations are 
authorized for unattended operation; and the transmitter control point 
requirements set out at Sec. Sec. 90.463 through 90.465 shall not 
apply.
    (b) Self-activated transmitters may be authorized for unattended 
operation where they are activated by either electrical or mechanical 
devices, provided the licensee adopts reasonable means to guard against 
malfunctions and harmful interference to other users.

                  Internal Transmitter Control Systems


<R05>
Sec. 90.471  Points of operation in internal transmitter control systems.

    The transmitting facilities of the licensee may be operated from 
fixed positions located on premises controlled by the licensee. The 
fixed position may be part of a private telephone exchange or it may be 
any position in a closed or limited access communications facility 
intended to be used by employees of the licensee for internal 
communications and transmitter control purposes. Operating positions in 
internal transmitter control systems are not synonymous with dispatch 
points (See Sec. 90.467) nor with telephone positions which are part of 
the public, switched telephone network; and the scheme of regulation is 
to be considered and treated as being different. See Sec. Sec. 90.485 
through 90.489.

<R05>
Sec. 90.473  Operation of internal transmitter control systems through
licensed fixed control points.

    An internal transmitter control system may be operated under the 
control and supervision of a control operator stationed at a fixed 
control point in the system. In such a case, the control point must be 
equipped to permit the control operator to monitor all traffic to and 
from fixed positions and mobile stations or paging units of the 
licensee; and the system shall be so designed to permit the control 
operator to either disconnect any operating position in the internal 
system from the transmitter control circuit or to close the system down 
entirely at will.

[44 FR 67125, Nov. 23, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 90.475  Operation of internal transmitter control systems in
specially equipped systems.

    (a) An internal transmitter control system need not be designed to 
meet the requirements of Sec. 90.473 if it meets the following 
requirements:
    (1) All operating positions must be located on premises controlled 
by the licensee.
    (2) An internal transmitter control system may be used in 
conjunction with other approved methods of transmitter control and 
interconnection so long as the internal transmitter control system, 
itself, is neither accessed from telephone positions in the public 
switched telephone network (PSTN), nor uses dial-up circuits in the 
PSTN. Licensees with complex communications systems involving fixed 
systems whose base stations are controlled by such systems may 
automatically access these base stations through the microwave or 
operational fixed systems from positions in the PSTN, so long as the 
base stations and mobile units meet the requirements of Sec. 90.483 and 
if a separate circuit is provided for each mode of transmitter operation 
(i.e., conventional, dial-up or Internet).
    (3) The system must be designed so that upon completion of a 
transmission, the base station transmitter(s) will close down 
automatically within 3 seconds.
    (4) To guard against malfunctions, the system must also be designed 
so that the base station(s) will be deactivated by an automatic timing 
device when a modulated signal is not transmitted for a period of three 
(3) consecutive minutes.
    (5) The system must include automatic monitoring equipment, 
installed at the base station transmitter site(s), which will prevent 
the activation of the system when signals of other co-channel stations 
are present.

Sec. 90.476  Interconnection of fixed stations and certain mobile
stations.

    (a) Fixed stations and mobile stations used to provide the functions 
of fixed stations pursuant to the provisions of Sec. Sec. 90.35(c)(11), 
90.35(c)(42), and 90.267 are not subject to the interconnection 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 90.477 and 90.483 and may be interconnected 
with the facilities of common carriers.
    (b) Mobile stations used to provide the functions of base and mobile 
relay stations pursuant to the provisions of Sec. Sec. 90.35(c)(11), 
90.35(c)(42), and 90.267 are not subject to the provisions of Sec. 
90.477(d)(3) and may be interconnected with the facilities of common 
carriers

[[Page 405]]

subject to the provisions of Sec. Sec. 90.477(d)(1), 90.477(d)(2), 
90.477(e), and 90.483.
    (c) The provisions of this section do not apply to commercial mobile 
radio service providers, as defined in part 20 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 90.477  Interconnected systems.

    (a) Applicants for new land stations to be interconnected with the 
public switched telephone network must indicate on their applications 
(class of station code) that their stations will be interconnected. 
Licensees of land stations that are not interconnected may interconnect 
their stations with the public switched telephone network only after 
modifying their license. See Sec. 1.929 of this chapter. In all cases a 
detailed description of how interconnection is accomplished must be 
maintained by licensees as part of their station records. See Sec. 
90.433 of this part.
    (b) In the frequency ranges 806-824 MHz, 851-869 MHz, 896-901 MHz, 
and 935-940 MHz, interconnection with the public switched telephone 
network is authorized under the following conditions:
    (1) Interconnected operation is on a secondary basis to dispatch 
operation. This restriction will not apply to trunked systems or on any 
channel assigned exclusively to one licensee.
    (2) Interconnection may be accomplished at any location through a 
separate or shared interconnection device. When land stations subject to 
this part are multiple licensed or shared by authorized users, 
arrangements for telephone service must be made with a duly authorized 
carrier by users, licensees, or their authorized agents on a non-profit 
cost sharing basis. When telephone service costs are shared, at least 
one licensee participating in the cost sharing arrangement must maintain 
cost sharing records and the costs must be distributed at least once a 
year. Licensees, users, or their authorized agents may also make joint 
use arrangements with a duly authorized carrier and arrange that each 
licensee or user pay the carrier directly for the licensee's or user's 
share of the joint use of the shared telephone service. A report of the 
cost distribution must be placed in the licensee's station records and 
made available to participants in the sharing and the Commission upon 
request. In all cases, arrangements with the duly authorized carrier 
must disclose the number of licensees and users and the nature of the 
use.
    (c) Interconnection of facilities in the Radiolocation Service 
(subpart F) will not be permitted.
    (d) In the frequency ranges below 800 MHz, interconnection with the 
public switched telephone network is authorized under the following 
conditions:
    (1) Interconnected operation is on a secondary basis to dispatch 
operation. This restriction will not apply to trunked systems or on any 
channel assigned exclusively to one licensee.
    (2) Interconnection may be accomplished at any location through a 
separate or shared interconnection device. When land stations subject to 
this part are multiple licensed or shared by authorized users, 
arrangements for telephone service must be made with a duly authorized 
carrier by users, licensees, or their authorized agents on a non-profit 
cost sharing basis. When telephone service costs are shared, at least 
one licensee participating in the cost sharing arrangement must maintain 
cost sharing records and the costs must be distributed at least once a 
year. Licensees, users, or their authorized agents may also make joint 
use arrangements with a duly authorized carrier and arrange that each 
licensee or user pay the carrier directly for the licensee's or user's 
share of the joint use of the shared telephone service. A report of the 
cost distribution must be placed in the licensee's station records and 
made available to participants in the sharing and the Commission upon 
request. In all cases, arrangements with the duly authorized carrier 
must disclose the number of licensees and users and the nature of the 
use.
    (3) For licensees in the Industrial/Business Pool and those 
licensees who establish eligibility pursuant to Sec. 90.20(a)(2) of 
this part, except for Sec. Sec. 90.20(a)(2)(i) and 90.20(a)(2)(ii) of 
this part and medical emergency systems in the 450-470 MHz band, 
interconnection will be permitted only where the base

[[Page 406]]

station site or sites proposed stations are located 120 km (75 mi.) or 
more from the designated centers of the urbanized areas listed below. If 
these licensees seek to connect within 120 km (75 mi.) of the 25 cities, 
they must obtain the consent of all co-channel licensees located both 
within 120 km (75 mi.) of the center of the city; and within 120 km (75 
mi.) of the interconnected base station transmitter. The consensual 
agreements among the co-channel licensees must specifically state the 
terms agreed upon and a statement must be submitted to the Commission 
indicating that all co-channel licensees have consented to the use of 
interconnection. If a licensee has agreed to the use of interconnection 
on the channel, but later decides against the use of interconnection, 
the licensee may request that the co-channel licensees reconsider the 
use of interconnection. If the licensee is unable to reach an agreement 
with co-channel licensees, the licensee may request that the Commission 
consider the matter and assign it to another channel. If a new licensee 
is assigned to a frequency where all the co-channel licensees have 
agreed to the use of interconnection and the new licensee does not 
agree, the new licensee may request that the co-channel licensees 
reconsider the use of interconnection. If the new licensee cannot reach 
an agreement with co-channel licensees it may request that the 
Commission reassign it to another channel.

Sec. 90.483  Permissible methods and requirements of interconnecting
private and public systems of communications.

    Interconnection may be accomplished by commercial mobile service 
providers licensed under this part by any technically feasible means. 
Interconnection may be accomplished by private mobile service providers 
either manually or automatically under the supervision and control of a 
transmitter control operator at a fixed position in the authorized 
system of communications or it may be accomplished under the supervision 
and control of mobile operators, and is subject to the following 
provisions:
    (a) Where a system is interconnected manually at a fixed control 
point, the control point operator must maintain the capability to turn 
the carrier of the transmitter off or to de-activate the system 
completely when circumstances warrant such action.
    (b) When the system is interconnected automatically it may be 
supervised at the control point or in mobile units.
    (1) For control point supervision, the following is required:

[[Page 407]]

    (i) The control point operator must maintain the capability to turn 
the carrier of the transmitter off or to de-activate the system 
completely when circumstances warrant such action.
    (ii) When a frequency is shared by more than one system, automatic 
monitoring equipment must be installed at the base station to prevent 
activation of the transmitter when signals of co-channel stations are 
present and activation would interfere with communications in progress. 
Licensees may operate without the monitoring equipment if they have 
obtained the consent of all co-channel licensees located within a 120 
kilometer (75 mile) radius of the interconnected base station 
transmitter. A statement must be submitted to the Commission indicating 
that all co-channel licensees have consented to operate without the 
monitoring equipment. If a licensee has agreed that the use of 
monitoring equipment is not necessary, but later decides that the 
monitoring equipment is necessary, the licensee may request that the co-
channel licensees reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the 
licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, the 
licensee may request that the Commission consider the matter and assign 
it to another channel. If a new licensee is assigned to a frequency 
where all the co-channel licensees have agreed that the use of 
monitoring equipment is not necessary, and the new licensee does not 
agree, the new licensee may request the co-channel licensees to 
reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the new licensee cannot 
reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, it should request a new 
channel from the Commission. Systems on frequencies above 800 MHz are 
exempt from this requirement.
    (2) For mobile unit supervision, the following is required:
    (i) When a frequency is shared by more than one system, automatic 
monitoring equipment must be installed at the base station to prevent 
activation of the transmitter when signals of co-channel stations are 
present and activation would interfere with communications in progress. 
Licensees may operate without this equipment if they have obtained the 
consent of all co-channel licensees located within a 120 kilometer (75 
mile) radius of the interconnected base station transmitter. A statement 
must be submitted to the Commission indicating that all co-channel 
licensees have consented to operate without the monitoring equipment. If 
a licensee has agreed that the use of monitoring equipment is not 
necessary, but later decides that the monitoring equipment is necessary, 
the licensee may request that the co-channel licensees reconsider the 
use of monitoring equipment. If the licensee cannot reach an agreement 
with co-channel licensees, the licensee may request that the Commission 
consider the matter and assign it to another channel. If a new licensee 
is assigned to a frequency where all the co-channel licensees have 
agreed that the use of monitoring equipment is not necessary, and the 
new licensee does not agree, the new licensee may request the co-channel 
licensees to reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the new 
licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, it should 
request a new channel from the Commission. Systems on frequencies above 
800 MHz are exempt from this requirement.
    (ii) Initial access points within the public switched telephone 
network must be limited to transmission of a 3-second tone, after which 
time the transmitter shall close down. No additional signals may be 
transmitted until acknowledgement from a mobile station of the licensee 
is received. Licensees are exempt from this requirement if they have 
obtained the consent of all co-channel licensees located within a 120 
kilometer (75 mile) radius of the interconnected base station 
transmitter. However, licensees may choose to set their own time 
limitations. A statement must be submitted to the Commission indicating 
that all co-channel licensees have consented to operate without the 
monitoring equipment. If a licensee has agreed that the use of 
monitoring equipment is not necessary, but later decides that the 
monitoring equipment is necessary, the licensee may request that the co-
channel licensees reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the 
licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, the 
licensee may request

[[Page 408]]

that the Commission consider the matter and assign it to another 
channel. If a new licensee is assigned to a frequency where all the co-
channel licensees have agreed that the use of monitoring equipment is 
not necessary, and the new licensee does not agree, the new licensee may 
request the co-channel licensees to reconsider the use of monitoring 
equipment. If the new licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel 
licensees, it should request a new channel from the Commission. Systems 
on frequencies above 800 MHz are exempt from this requirement.
    (c) In single frequency systems, equipment must be installed at the 
base station which will limit any single transmission from within the 
public switched telephone network to 30 seconds duration and which in 
turn will activate the base station receiver to monitor the frequency 
for a period of not less than three (3) seconds. The mobile station must 
be capable of terminating the communications during the three (3) 
seconds. Licensees are exempt from this requirement if they have 
obtained the consent of all co-channel licensees located within a 120 km 
(75 mile) radius of the interconnected base station transmitter. 
However, licensees may choose to set their own time limitations. A 
statement must be submitted to the Commission indicating that all co-
channel licensees have consented to operate without the monitoring 
equipment. If a licensee has agreed that the use of monitoring equipment 
is not necessary, but later decides that the monitoring equipment is 
necessary, the licensee may request that the co-channel licensees 
reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the licensee cannot reach 
an agreement with co-channel licensees, the licensee may request that 
the Commission consider the matter and assign it another channel. If a 
new licensee is assigned to a frequency where all the co-channel 
licensees have agreed that the use of monitoring equipment. If the new 
licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, it should 
request a new channel from the Commission.
    (d) A timer must be installed at the base station transmitter which 
limits communications to three (3) minutes. After three (3) minutes, the 
system must close down, with all circuits between the base station and 
the public switch telephone network disconnected. This provision does 
not apply to systems which establish eligibility pursuant to Sec. Sec. 
90.20(a)(1)(i), 90.20(a)(1)(ii), and 90.20(a)(2), except Sec. Sec. 
90.20(a)(2)(i) and 90.20(a)(2)(ii), or who are Power, Petroleum, or 
Railroad licensees (as defined in Sec. 90.7), or to systems above 800 
MHz. All systems must be equipped with a timer that closes down the 
transmitter within three minutes of the last transmission. Licensees may 
operate without these requirements if they have obtained the consent of 
all co-channel licensees located within a 120 km (75 mile) radius of the 
interconnected base station transmitter. However, licensees may choose 
to set their own time limitations. A statement must be submitted to the 
Commission indicating that all co-channel licensees have consented to 
operate without the monitoring equipment. If a licensee has agreed that 
the use of monitoring equipment is not necessary, but later decides that 
the monitoring equipment is necessary, the licensee may request that the 
co-channel licensees reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the 
licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, the 
licensee may request that the Commission consider the matter and assign 
it to another channel. If a new licensee is assigned to a frequency 
where all the co-channel licensees have agreed that the use of 
monitoring equipment is not necessary, and the new licensee does not 
agree, the new licensee may request the co-channel licensees to 
reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the new licensee cannot 
reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, it should request a new 
channel from the Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 90.490  One-way paging operations in the private services.

    (a) Subject to specific prohibition or restriction by rule 
provisions governing the radio service in which a licensee's radio 
system is authorized, paging operations are permitted:
    (1) Where the signals and messages are transmitted by a control 
operator of the licensee stationed at a licensed control point in the 
licensee's system of communication.
    (2) Where the signals and messages are transmitted from an operating 
position within an internal system of communication which meets the 
tests of Sec. Sec. 90.471 through 90.475.
    (3) Where the signals and messages are transmitted from a dispatch 
point within the licensee's system of communication, as defined as Sec. 
90.7.
    (b) Systems employing dial-up circuits (Sec. 90.461(c)) may be used 
in one-way paging operations, but only where the paging signals are 
transmitted as provided at paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (c) Paging may be initiated directly from telephone positions in the 
public switched telephone network. When land stations are multiple 
licensed or otherwise shared by authorized users, arrangements for the 
telephone service must be made with a duly authorized carrier by users, 
licensees, or their authorized agents on a non-profit, cost-shared 
basis. When telephone service costs are shared, at least one licensee 
participating in the cost sharing arrangements must maintain cost 
sharing records and the costs must be distributed at least once a year. 
Licensees, users, or their authorized agents may also make joint use 
arrangements with a duly authorized carrier and arrange that each 
licensee or user pay the carrier directly for the licensee's or user's 
share of the joint use of the shared telephone service. A report of the 
cost distribution must be placed in the licensee's station records and 
made available to participants in the sharing arrangement and the 
Commission upon request. In all cases, arrangements with the duly 
authorized carrier must disclose the number of licensees and users and 
the nature of the use.

the state certifies on or before each applicable benchmark date that it 
is:
    (1) providing or prepared to provide ``substantial service'' to one-
third of their population or territory by January 1, 2012, i.e., within 
five years of the date that incumbent broadcasters are required to 
relocate to other portions of the spectrum;
    (2) providing or prepared to provide ``substantial service'' to two-
thirds of their population or territory by January 1, 2017, i.e., within 
ten years of the date that incumbent broadcasters are required to 
relocate to other portions of the spectrum.
    (c) The Commission will deem a state ``prepared to provide 
substantial service'' if the licensee certifies that a radio system has 
been approved and funded for implementation by the deadline date. 
``Substantial service'' refers to the construction and operation of 700 
MHz facilities by public safety entities providing service which is 
sound, favorable , and substantially above a level of mediocre service 
which just might minimally warrant renewal.
    (d) If a state licensee fails to meet any condition of the grant the 
state license is modified automatically to the frequencies and 
geographic areas where the state certifies that it is providing 
substantial service.
    (e) Any recovered state license spectrum will revert to General Use. 
However, spectrum licensed to a state under a state license remains 
unavailable for reassignment to other applicants until the Commission's 
database reflects the parameters of the modified state license.

Sec. 90.543  Emission limitations.

    Transmitters designed to operate in 769-775 MHz and 799-805 MHz 
frequency bands must meet the emission limitations in paragraphs (a) 
through (d) of this section. Transmitters operating in 763-768 MHz and 
793-798 MHz bands must meet the emission limitations in (e) of this 
section.
    (a) The adjacent channel power (ACP) requirements for transmitters 
designed for various channel sizes are shown in

the following tables. Mobile station requirements apply to handheld, car 
mounted and control station units. The tables specify a value for the 
ACP as a function of the displacement from the channel center frequency 
and measurement bandwidth. In the following tables, ``(s)'' indicates a 
swept measurement may be used.

integral antenna, a suitable power coupling device shall be used to 
couple the RF signal to the measurement instrument. The coupling device 
shall substantially maintain the proper transmitter load impedance. The 
ACP measurements may be made with a spectrum analyzer capable of making 
direct ACP measurements. ``Measurement bandwidth'', as used for non-
swept measurements, implies an instrument that measures the power in 
many narrow bandwidths equal to the nominal resolution bandwidth and 
integrates these powers to determine the total power in the specified 
measurement bandwidth.
    (1) Setting reference level. Set transmitter to maximum output 
power. Using a spectrum analyzer capable of ACP measurements, set the 
measurement bandwidth to the channel size. For example, for a 6.25 kHz 
transmitter set the measurement bandwidth to 6.25 kHz. Set the frequency 
offset of the measurement bandwidth to zero and adjust the center 
frequency of the instrument to the assigned center frequency to measure 
the average power level of the transmitter. Record this power level in 
dBm as the ``reference power level.''
    (2) Non-swept power measurement. Using a spectrum analyzer capable 
of ACP measurements, set the mesurement bandwidth and frequency offset 
from the assigned center frequency as shown in the tables in Sec. 
90.543 (a) above. Any value of resolution bandwidth may be used as long 
as it does not exceed 2 percent of the specified measurement bandwidth. 
Measure the power level in dBm. These measurements should be made at 
maximum power. Calculate ACP by substracting the reference power level 
measured in (b)(1) from the measurements made in this step. The absolute 
value of the calculated ACP must be greater than or equal to the 
absolute value of the ACP given in the table for each condition above.
    (3) Swept power measurement. Set a spectrum analyzer to 30 kHz 
resolution bandwidth, 1 MHz video bandwidth and average, sample, or RMS 
detection. Set the reference level of the spectrum analyzer to the RMS 
value of the transmitter power. Sweep above and below the carrier 
frequency to the limits defined in the tables. Calculate ACP by 
substracting the reference power level measured in (b)(1) from the 
measurements made in this step. The absolute value of the calculated ACP 
must be greater than or equal to the absolute value of the ACP given in 
the table for each condition above.
    (c) Out-of-band emission limit. On any frequency outside of the 
frequency ranges covered by the ACP tables in this section, the power of 
any emission must be reduced below the mean output power (P) by at least 
43 + 10log (P) dB measured in a 100 kHz bandwidth for frequencies less 
than 1 GHz, and in a 1 MHz bandwidth for frequencies greater than 1 GHz.
    (d) Authorized bandwidth. Provided that the ACP requirements of this 
section are met, applicants may request any authorized bandwidth that 
does not exceed the channel size.
    (e) For operations in the 763-768 MHz and the 793-798 MHz bands, the 
power of any emission outside the licensee's frequency band(s) of 
operation shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) within the 
licensed band(s) of operation, measured in watts, in accordance with the 
following:
    (1) On all frequencies between 769-775 MHz and 799-805 MHz, by a 
factor not less than 76 + 10 log (P) dB in a 6.25 kHz band segment, for 
base and fixed stations.
    (2) On all frequencies between 769-775 MHz and 799-805 MHz, by a 
factor not less than 65 + 10 log (P) dB in a 6.25 kHz band segment, for 
mobile and portable stations.
    (3) Compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of 
this section is based on the use of measurement instrumentation such 
that the reading taken with any resolution bandwidth setting should be 
adjusted to indicate spectral energy in a 6.25 kHz segment.
    (f) For operations in the 763-775 MHz and 793-805 MHz bands, all 
emissions including harmonics in the band 1559-1610 MHz shall be limited 
to -70 dBW/MHz equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) for 
wideband signals, and -80 dBW EIRP for discrete emissions of

[[Page 422]]

less than 700 Hz bandwidth. For the purpose of equipment authorization, 
a transmitter shall be tested with an antenna that is representative of 
the type that will be used with the equipment in normal operation.
    (g) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require 
greater attenuation than specified in this section.

Sec. 90.545  TV/DTV interference protection criteria.

    Public safety base, control, and mobile transmitters in the 769-775 
MHz and 799-805 MHz frequency bands must be operated only in accordance 
with the rules in this section, to reduce the potential for interference 
to public reception of the signals of existing TV and DTV broadcast 
stations transmitting on TV Channels 62, 63, 64, 65, 67, 68 or 69.
    (a) D/U ratios. Licensees of public safety stations must choose site 
locations that are a sufficient distance from co-channel and adjacent 
channel TV and DTV stations, and/or must use reduced transmitting power 
or transmitting antenna height such that the following minimum desired 
signal to undesired signal ratios (D/U ratios) are met:
    (1) The minimum D/U ratio for co-channel stations is 40 dB at the 
hypothetical Grade B contour (64 dB[micro]V/m) (88.5 kilometers or 55.0 
miles) of the TV station or 17 dB at the equivalent Grade B contour (41 
dB[micro]V/m) (88.5 kilometers or 55.0 miles) of the DTV station.
    (2) The minimum D/U ratio for adjacent channel stations is 0 dB at 
the hypothetical Grade B contour (64 dB[micro]V/m) (88.5 kilometers or 
55.0 miles) of the TV station or -23 dB at the equivalent Grade B 
contour (41 dB[micro]V/m) (88.5 kilometers or 55.0 miles) of the DTV 
station.
    (b) Maximum ERP and HAAT. The maximum effective radiated power (ERP) 
and the antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) of the proposed land 
mobile base station, the associated control station, and the mobile 
transmitters shall be determined using the methods described in this 
section.
    (1) Each base station is limited to a maximum ERP of 1000 watts.
    (2) Each control station is limited to a maximum ERP of 200 watts 
and a maximum HAAT of 61 m. (200 ft).
    (3) Each mobile station is limited to a maximum ERP of 30 watts and 
a maximum antenna height of 6.1 m. (20 ft.).
    (4) Each portable (handheld) transmitter is limited to a maximum ERP 
of 3 watts.
    (5) All transmitters are subject to the power reductions given in 
Figure B of Sec. 90.309 of this chapter, for antenna heights higher 
than 152 meters (500 ft).
    (c) Methods. The methods used to calculate TV contours and antenna 
heights above average terrain are given in Sec. Sec. 73.683 and 73.684 
of this chapter. Tables to determine the necessary minimum distance from 
the public safety station to the TV/DTV station, assuming that the TV/
DTV station has a hypothetical or equivalent Grade B contour of 88.5 
kilometers (55.0 miles), are located in Sec. 90.309 and labeled as 
Tables B, D, and E. Values between those given in the tables may be 
determined by linear interpolation. The locations of existing and 
proposed TV/DTV stations during the transition period are given in part 
73 of this chapter and in the final proceedings of MM Docket No. 87-268.

    The transition period is scheduled to end on December 31, 2006. 
After that time, unless otherwise directed by the Commission, public 
safety stations will no longer be required to protect reception of co-
channel or adjacent channel TV/DTV stations.
    (1) Licensees of stations operating within the ERP and HAAT limits 
of paragraph (b) must select one of three methods to meet the TV/DTV 
protection requirements, subject to Commission approval:
    (i) utilize the geographic separation specified in the tables 
referenced below;
    (ii) Submit an engineering study justifying the proposed separations 
based on the parameters of the land mobile station and the parameters, 
including authorized and/or applied for facilities, of the TV/DTV 
station(s) it is trying to protect; or,
    (iii) obtain written concurrence from the applicable TV/DTV 
station(s). If this method is chosen, a copy of the agreement must be 
submitted with the application.
    (2) The following is the method for geographic separations.
    (i) Base stations having an antenna height (HAAT) less than 152 m. 
(500 ft.) shall afford protection to co-channel and adjacent channel TV/
DTV stations in accordance with the values specified in Table B (co-
channel frequencies based on 40 dB protection) and Table E (adjacent 
channel frequencies based on 0 dB protection) in Sec. 90.309 of this 
part. For base stations having an antenna height (HAAT) between 152-914 
meters (500-3,000 ft.) the effective radiated power must be reduced 
below 1 kilowatt in accordance with the values shown in the power 
reduction graph in Figure B in Sec. 90.309 of this part. For heights of 
more than 152 m. (500 ft.) above average terrain, the distance to the 
radio path horizon will be calculated assuming smooth earth. If the 
distance so determined equals or exceeds the distance to the 
hypothetical or equivalent Grade B contour of a co-channel TV/DTV 
station (i.e., it exceeds the distance from the appropriate Table in 
Sec. 90.309 to the relevant TV/DTV station) an authorization will not 
be granted unless it can be shown in an engineering study (method 2) 
that actual terrain considerations are such as to provide the desired 
protection at the actual Grade B contour (64 dB[micro]V/m for TV and 41 
dB[micro]V/m for DTV stations), or that the effective radiated power 
will be further reduced so that, assuming free space attenuation, the 
desired protection at the actual Grade B contour (64 dB[micro]V/m for TV 
and 41 dB[micro]V/m coverage contour for DTV stations) will be achieved. 
Directions for calculating powers, heights, and reduction curves are 
listed in Sec. 90.309 for land mobile stations. Directions for 
calculating coverage contours are listed in Sec. Sec. 73.683-685 for TV 
stations and in Sec. 73.625 for DTV stations.
    (ii) Control and mobile stations (including portables) are limited 
in height and power and therefore shall afford protection to co-channel 
and adjacent channel TV/DTV stations in accordance with the values 
specified in Table D (co-channel frequencies based on 40 dB protection) 
in Sec. 90.309 of this part and a minimum distance of 8 kilometers (5 
miles) from all adjacent channel TV/DTV station hypothetical or 
equivalent Grade B contours (adjacent channel frequencies based on 0 dB 
protection for TV stations and--23 dB for DTV stations). Since control 
and mobile stations may affect different TV/DTV stations than the 
associated base station, particular care must be taken by applicants to 
ensure that all the appropriate TV/DTV stations are considered (e.g., a 
base station may be operating on TV Channel 64 and the mobiles on TV 
Channel 69, in which case TV Channels 63, 64, 65, 68, and 69 must be 
protected). Since mobiles and portables are able to move and communicate 
with each other, licensees or coordinators must determine the areas 
where the mobiles can and cannot roam in order to protect the TV/DTV

[[Page 424]]

stations, and advise the mobile operators of these areas and their 
restrictions.
    (iii) In order to protect certain TV/DTV stations and to ensure 
protection from these stations which may have extremely large contours 
due to unusual height situations, an additional distance factor must be 
used by all public safety base, control and mobile stations. For all co-
channel and adjacent channel TV/DTV stations which have an HAAT between 
350 and 600 meters, public safety stations must add the following 
DISTANCE FACTOR to the value obtained from the referenced Tables in 
Sec. 90.309 and to the distance for control and mobile stations on 
adjacent TV/DTV channels (96.5 km).

    DISTANCE FACTOR = (TV/DTV HAAT-350) / 14 in kilometers, where HAAT 
is the TV or DTV station antenna height above average terrain obtained 
from its authorized or proposed facilities, whichever is greater.

    (iv) For all co-channel and adjacent channel TV/DTV stations which 
have an antenna height above average terrain greater than 600 meters, 
public safety stations must add 18 kilometers as the DISTANCE FACTOR to 
the value obtained from the referenced Tables in Sec. 90.309 and to the 
distance for control and mobile stations on adjacent TV/DTV channels 
(96.5 km).

    Note to Sec. 90.545: The 88.5 km (55.0 mi) Grade B service contour 
(64 dB[micro]V/m) is based on a hypothetical TV station operating at an 
effective radiated power of one megawatt, a transmitting antenna height 
above average terrain of 610 meters (2000 feet) and the Commission's R-
6602 F(50,50) curves. See Sec. 73.699 of this chapter. Maximum 
facilities for TV stations operating in the UHF band are 5 megawatts 
effective radiated power at an antenna HAAT of 610 meters (2,000 feet). 
See Sec. 73.614 of this chapter. The equivalent contour for DTV 
stations is based on a 41 dB[micro]V/m signal strength and the distance 
to the F(50,90) curve. See Sec. 73.625 of this chapter.

Sec. 90.555  Information exchange.

    (a) Prior notification. Public safety licensees authorized to 
operate in the 763-775 MHz and 793-805 MHz bands may notify any licensee 
authorized to operate in the 746-757, 758-763, 776-787, or 788-793 MHz 
bands that they wish to receive prior notification of the activation or 
modification of the licensee's base or fixed stations in their area. 
Thereafter, the 746-757, 758-763, 776-787, or 788-793 MHz band licensee 
must provide the following information to the public safety licensee at 
least 10 business days before a new base or fixed station is activated 
or an existing base or fixed station is modified:
    (1) Location;
    (2) Effective radiated power;
    (3) Antenna height; and
    (4) Channels available for use.
    (b) Purpose of prior notification. The prior coordination of base or 
fixed stations is for informational purposes only. Public safety 
licensees are not afforded the right to accept or reject the activation 
of a proposed base or fixed station or to unilaterally require changes 
in its operating parameters. The principal purposes of notification are 
to:
    (1) Allow a public safety licensee to advise the 746-757, 758-763, 
776-787, or 788-793 MHz band licensee whether it believes a proposed 
base or fixed station will generate unacceptable interference;
    (2) Permit 746-757, 758-763, 776-787, and 788-793 MHz band licensees 
to make voluntary changes in base or fixed station parameters when a 
public safety licensee alerts them to possible interference; and,
    (3) Rapidly identify the source if interference is encountered when 
the base or fixed station is activated.
    (c) Public Safety Information Exchange. (1) Upon request by a 746-
757, 758-763, 776-787, or 788-793 MHz band licensee, public safety 
licensees authorized to operate radio systems in the 763-775 and 793-805 
MHz bands shall provide the operating parameters of their radio system 
to the 746-757, 758-763, 776-787, or 788-793 MHz band licensee.
    (2) Public safety licensees who perform the information exchange 
described in this section must notify the appropriate 746-757, 758-763, 
776-787, or 788-793 MHz band licensees prior to any technical changes to 
their radio system.

Sec. 90.609  Special limitations on amendment of applications for 
assignment or transfer of authorizations for radio systems above 
800 MHz.

    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) A license to operate a conventional or trunked radio system may 
not be assigned or transferred prior to the completion of construction 
of the facility. However, the Commission may give its consent to the 
assignment or transfer of control of such a license prior to the 
completion of construction where:
    (1) The assignment or transfer does not involve a substantial change 
in ownership or control of the authorized radio facilities; or,
    (2) The assignment or transfer is involuntary due to the licensee's 
insolvency, bankruptcy, incapacity, or death.
    (c) Licensees of constructed systems in any category are permitted 
to make partial assignments of an authorized grant to an applicant 
proposing to create a new system or to an existing licensee that has 
loaded its system to 70 mobiles per channel and is expanding that 
system. An applicant authorized to expand an existing system or to 
create a new system with frequencies from any category obtained through 
partial assignment will receive the assignor's existing license 
expiration date and loading deadline for the frequencies that are 
assigned. A licensee that makes a partial assignment of a station's 
frequencies will not be authorized to obtain additional frequencies for 
that station for a period of one year from the date of the partial 
assignment.
    (d) A constructed system originally licensed in the General Category 
that is authorized to operate in the conventional mode may be combined 
with an existing SMR system above 800 MHz authorized to operate in the 
trunked mode by assignment of an authorized grant of the General 
Category station to the SMR station.

maximum power flux density (pfd) of the station's transmitted signal at 
any point at or beyond the border does not exceed -107 dB (W/m\2\). The 
spreading loss must be calculated using the free space formula taking 
into account any antenna discrimination in the direction of the border. 
Authorizations for stations using channels allotted to Mexico on a 
primary basis will be secondary to Mexican operations and conditioned to 
require that licensees take immediate action to eliminate any harmful 
interference resulting from the station's transmitted signal exceeding -
107 dB (W/m\2\).
    (c) Use of 800 MHz Band in Canada Border Region. All operations in 
the 806-824/851-869 MHz band within 140 km (87 miles) of the U.S./Canada 
border (``U.S./Canada border area'') shall be in accordance with 
international agreements between the U.S. and Canada.
    (1) The U.S./Canada border area is divided into the following 
geographical regions (``Canada Border Regions''). U.S. primary channels 
are shown in the table by region. The remaining channels are primary to 
Canada (``Canada Primary channels'').

    (2) Stations authorized on U.S. primary channels in all Canada 
Border Regions, except Region 5, will be subject to the Effective 
Radiated Power (ERP) and Effective Antenna Height (EAH) limitations 
listed in Table C2. The Effective Antenna Height is calculated by 
subtracting the Assumed Average Terrain Elevation (AATE) listed in Table 
C3 from the antenna height above mean sea level.

    Authorizations for stations using these channels will be secondary 
to Canadian operations and conditioned to require that licensees take 
immediate action to eliminate any harmful interference resulting from 
the station's transmitted signal exceeding the values specified in 
tables 29 or 30 at or beyond the U.S./Canada border.

Sec. 90.621  Selection and assignment of frequencies.

    (a) Applicants for frequencies in the Public Safety and Business/
Industrial/Land Transportation Categories must specify on the 
application the frequencies on which the proposed system will operate 
pursuant to a recommendation by the applicable frequency coordinator. 
Applicants for frequencies in the SMR Category must request specific 
frequencies by including in their applications the frequencies 
requested.
    (1) For trunked systems, the assignment of frequencies will be made 
in accordance with applicable loading criteria and in accordance with 
the following:
    (i) Channels will be chosen and assigned in accordance with Sec. 
90.615, Sec. 90.617, or Sec. 90.619.
    (ii) A mobile station is authorized to transmit on any frequency 
assigned to its associated base station.
    (iii) There are no limitations on the number of frequencies that may 
be trunked. Authorizations for non-SMR stations may be granted for up to 
20 trunked frequency pairs at a time in accordance with the frequencies 
listed in Sec. Sec. 90.615, 90.617, and 90.619.
    (2) For conventional systems the assignment of frequencies will be 
made in accordance with applicable loading criteria. Accordingly, 
depending upon the number of mobile units to be served, an applicant may 
either be required to share a channel, or, if an applicant shows a 
sufficient number of mobile units to warrant the assignment of one or 
more channels for its exclusive use, it may be licensed to use such 
channel or channels on an unshared basis in the area of operation 
specified in its application.
    (i) Channels will be chosen and assigned in accordance with Sec. 
90.615, Sec. 90.617, or Sec. 90.619.
    (ii) A mobile station is authorized to transmit on any frequency 
assigned to its associated base station.
    (b) Stations authorized on frequencies listed in this subpart, 
except for those stations authorized pursuant to paragraph (g) of this 
section and EA-based and MTA-based SMR systems, will be assigned 
frequencies solely on the basis of fixed distance separation criteria. 
The separation between co-channel systems will be a minimum of 113 km 
(70 mi) with one exception. For incumbent licensees in Channel Blocks F1 
through V, that have received the consent of all affected parties or a 
certified frequency coordinator to utilize

[[Page 452]]

an 18 dB[micro]V/m signal strength interference contour (see Sec. 
90.693), the separation between co-channel systems will be a minimum of 
173 km (107 mi). The following exceptions to these separations shall 
apply:
    (1) Except as indicated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, no 
station in Channel Blocks A through V shall be less than 169 km (105 mi) 
distant from a co-channel station that has been granted channel 
exclusivity and authorized 1 kW ERP on any of the following mountaintop 
sites: Santiago Peak, Sierra Peak, Mount Lukens, Mount Wilson 
(California). Except as indicated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, 
no incumbent licensee in Channel Blocks F1 through V that has received 
the consent of all affected parties or a certified frequency coordinator 
to utilize an 18 dB[micro]V/m signal strength interference contour shall 
be less than 229 km (142 mi) distant from a co-channel station that has 
been granted channel exclusivity and authorized 1 kW ERP on any of the 
following mountaintop sites: Santiago Peak, Sierra Peak, Mount Lukens, 
Mount Wilson (California).
    (2) The separation between co-channel stations that have been 
granted exclusivity and that are located at high sites in California 
north of 35[deg] N Latitude and west of 118[deg] W Longitude shall be 
determined as follows:
    (i) Required co-channel separations between common antenna sites are 
given by table 1. A channel group assigned to a station on a site listed 
in the vertical column may not be re-assigned to a station on a site 
listed in the horizontal column if there is an ``X'' in the box created 
by the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines. The geographic 
coordinates listed in the table represent an average for each particular 
site; all locations within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the coordinates will be 
considered to be at that site.
    (ii) Required co-channel separations involving antenna sites not 
listed in table 1 shall be determined by Commission staff on a case by 
case basis. The interference potential of proposed assignments will be 
evaluated considering parameters such as antenna height, effective 
radiated power, terrain irregularities, and market conditions.

    (3) Except as indicated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, 
stations in Channel Blocks A through V that have been granted channel 
exclusivity and are located in the State of Washington at the locations 
listed in the table below shall be separated from co-channel stations by 
a minimum of 169 km (105 mi). Except as indicated in paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section, incumbent licensees in Channel Blocks F1 through V that 
have received the consent of all affected parties or a certified 
frequency coordinator to utilize an 18 dB[micro]V/m signal strength 
interference contour, have been granted channel exclusivity and are 
located in the State of Washington at the locations listed in the table 
below shall be separated from co-channel stations by a minimum of 229 km 
(142 mi). Locations within one mile of the geographical coordinates 
listed in the table below will be considered to be at that site.

    (4) Upon an applicant's specific request to the Commission or a 
frequency coordinator, co-channel stations may be separated by less than 
113 km (70 mi) by meeting certain transmitter ERP and antenna height 
criteria. The following table indicates separations assignable to such 
co-channel stations for various transmitter power and antenna height 
combinations. The minimum separation permitted is 88 km (55 mi). 
Applicants will provide the Commission with a statement that the 
application is submitted for consideration under the table, a list of 
all co-channel stations within 113 km (70 mi), and the DHAATs and ERPs 
for these stations and the applicant's proposed station. Applicants 
seeking to be licensed for stations located at distances less than those 
prescribed in the table are required to secure a waiver and must submit 
with the application, in addition to the above, an interference 
analysis, based upon any of the generally-accepted terrain-based 
propagation models, that shows that co-channel stations would receive 
the same or greater interference protection than provided in the table. 
Requests for separations less than 88 km (55 mi) must also include an 
analysis of interference potential from mobile transmitters to existing 
co-channel base station receivers. Applicants seeking a waiver must 
submit with their application a certificate of service indicating that 
concurrent with the submission of the application to the Commission or a 
coordinator, all co-channel licensees within the applicable area were 
served with a copy of the application and all attachments thereto. 
Licensees thus served may file an opposition to the application within 
30 days from the date the application is filed with the Commission.
    (i) The directional height of the antenna above average terrain 
(DHAAT) is calculated from the average of the antenna heights above 
average terrain from 3 to 16 km (2 to 10 mi) from the proposed site 
along a radial extending in the direction of the existing station and 
the radials 15 degrees to either side of that radial.
    (ii) Except for the sites listed in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and 
(b)(3) of this section, additional co-channel distance separation must 
be afforded to an existing station from an applicant wishing to locate a 
station less than 113 km (70 mi) from a co-channel station, where either 
the applicant's or the existing station is located at sites with DHAATs 
of 458 m (1500 ft) and above. The separation between short-spaced co-
channel stations shall be determined as follows:
    (A) Calculate the DHAAT in each direction between every existing co-
channel station with 113 km (70 mi) and the proposed station.
    (B) In the table, locate the approximate ERP and DHAAT values for 
the proposed and existing stations.
    (C) When DHAAT values are greater than 458 m (1500 ft), use the 
required separation for 305 m (1000 ft) and add 1.6 km (1 mi) for every 
30.5 km (100 ft), or increment thereof, of DHAAT above 458 m (1500 ft) 
to the distance indicated in the table. If both the proposed existing 
stations have DHAATs of 458 m (1500 ft) or more, the additional distance 
is separately determined for each station and the combined distance is 
added to the distance obtained from the table. Protection to existing 
stations will be afforded only up to 113 km (70 mi).

\1\ Separations for stations on Santiago Peak, Sierra Peak, Mount
  Lukens, and Mount Wilson (CA) and the locations in the State of
  Washington listed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section are 56 km (35
  mi) greater than those listed in the table above. In the event of
  conflict between this table and the table of additional California
  high elevation sites shown in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the
  latter will apply.
\2\ Distances shown are derived from the R-6602 curves and are based
  upon a non-overlap of the 22 dBu (F50,10) interference contour of the
  proposed station with the 40 dBu (F50,50) contour of the existing
  station(s). No consideration is given to the 40 dBu service contour of
  the proposed station and the 22 dBu contour of the existing
  station(s). The minimum separation of stations will be 88 km (55 mi).
\3\ All existing stations are assumed to operate with 1000 watts ERP.
  When the ERP and/or DHAAT of a proposed station or the DHAAT of an
  existing station is not indicated in the table, the next higher
  value(s) must be used.

    (5) The separation between co-channel systems may be less than the 
separations defined above if an applicant submits with its application 
letters of concurrence indicating that the applicant and each co-channel 
licensee within the specified separation agree to accept any 
interference resulting from the reduced separation between their 
systems. Each letter from a co-channel licensee must certify that the 
system of the concurring licensee is constructed and fully operational. 
The applicant must also submit with its application a certificate of 
service indicating that all concurring co-channel licensees have been 
served with an actual copy of the application.
    (6) A station located closer than the distances provided in this 
section to a co-channel station that was authorized as short-spaced 
under paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall be permitted to modify its 
facilities as long as the station does not extend its 22 dBu contour 
beyond its maximum 22 dBu contour (i.e., the 22 dBu contour calculated 
using the station's maximum power and antenna height at its original 
location) in the direction of the short-spaced station.
    (7) Offset frequencies in the 811-821/856-866 MHz band for use only 
within U.S./Mexico border area, as designated in Sec. 90.619(a), shall 
be considered co-channel with non-offset frequencies in this band as 
designated in Sec. 90.613. New applications for frequencies in this 
band for stations adjacent to the U.S./Mexico border area must comply 
with the co-channel separation provisions of this section.
    (c) Conventional systems authorized on frequencies in the Public 
Safety (except for those systems that have participated in a formal 
regional planning process as described in Sec. 90.16) and Business/
Industrial/Land Transportation categories which have not met the loading 
levels necessary for channel exclusivity will not be afforded co-channel 
protection.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Frequencies in the 809-817/854-862 MHz bands listed as available 
for eligibles in the Public Safety and Business/Industrial/Land 
Transportation Categories are available for inter-category sharing under 
the following conditions:
    (1) Channels in the Public Safety and Business/Industrial/Land 
Transportation categories will be available to eligible applicants in 
those categories only if there are no frequencies in their own category 
and no public safety systems are authorized on those channels under 
consideration to be shared.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(5) of this section, licensees of 
channels in the Business/Industrial/Land Transportation category may 
request a modification of the license, see Sec. 1.947 of this

[[Page 456]]

chapter, to authorize use of the channels for commercial operation. The 
licensee may also, at the same time or thereafter, seek authorization to 
transfer or assign the license, see Sec. 1.948 of this chapter, to any 
person eligible for licensing in the General or SMR categories. 
Applications submitted pursuant to this paragraph must be filed in 
accordance with the rules governing other applications for commercial 
channels, and will be processed in accordance with those rules. Grant of 
requests submitted pursuant to this paragraph is subject to the 
following conditions:
    (i) A licensee that modifies its license to authorize commercial 
operations will not be authorized to obtain additional 800 MHz Business/
Industrial/Land Transportation category channels for sites located 
within 113 km (70 mi.) of the station for which the license was 
modified, for a period of one year from the date the license is 
modified. This provision applies to the licensee, its controlling 
interests and their affiliates, as defined in Sec. 1.2110 of this 
chapter.
    (ii) With respect to licenses the initial application for which was 
filed on or after November 9, 2000, requests submitted pursuant to 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section may not be filed until five years after 
the date of the initial license grant. In the case of a license that is 
modified on or after November 9, 2000 to add 800 MHz Business/
Industrial/Land Transportation frequencies or to add or relocate base 
stations that expand the licensee's interference contour, requests 
submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section for these 
frequencies or base stations may not be filed until five years after 
such modification.
    (iii) Requests submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section must include a certification that written notice of the 
modification application has been provided to all Public Safety 
licensees, see Sec. 90.20(a), with base stations within 113 km (70 mi.) 
of the site of the channel(s) for which authorization for commercial use 
is sought that operate within 25 kHz of the center of those channel(s). 
If, pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, modification and 
assignment or transfer applications are filed at different times, the 
written notice required by this paragraph must be provided each time.
    (iv) The applicant must certify that it will take reasonable 
precautions to avoid causing harmful interference to Public Safety 
licensees, see Sec. 90.20(a), and to take such action as may be 
necessary to eliminate interference to such licensees caused by its 
operations. (When an assignment or transfer application is filed 
pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, this representation is 
required only of the assignee or transferee.) Licensees of stations 
suffering or causing harmful interference are expected to cooperate and 
resolve this problem by mutually satisfactory arrangements. If the 
licensees are unable to do so, the Commission may impose restrictions 
including specifying the transmitter power, antenna height, or area or 
hours of operation.
    (3) Licensees granted authorizations pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section may at any time request modification of the license to 
authorize use of the channels consistent with the rules governing the 
category to which they are allocated, provided that the licensee meets 
the applicable eligibility requirements.
    (4) [Reserved]
    (5) The frequency coordinator must certify that frequencies are not 
available in the applicant's own category, and coordination is required 
from the applicable out-of-category coordinator.
    (6) The out-of-category licensee must operate by the rules 
applicable to the category to which the frequency is allocated.
    (f) Licensees of channels in the Business/Industrial/Land 
Transportation Categories in the 896-901/935-940 MHz bands may request a 
modification of the license, see Sec. 1.947 of this chapter, to 
authorize use of the channels for commercial operation. The licensee may 
also, at the same time, or thereafter, seek authorization to transfer or 
assign the license, see Sec. 1.948 of this chapter, to any person 
eligible for licensing in the General or SMR categories. Applications 
submitted pursuant to this paragraph must be filed in accordance with 
the rules governing other applications for commercial channels, and will

[[Page 457]]

be processed in accordance with those rules.
    (g) Applications for Public Safety systems (both trunked and 
conventional) in the 806-809/851-854 MHz bands will be assigned and 
protected based on the criteria established in the appropriate regional 
plan. See Sec. 90.16 and the Report and Order in General Docket 87-112.

Sec. 90.623  Limitations on the number of frequencies assignable 
for conventional systems.

    (a) The maximum number of frequency pairs that may be assigned to a 
licensee for operation in the conventional mode in a given area is five 
(5).
    (b) Where an applicant proposes to operate a conventional radio 
system to provide facilities for the use of a single person or entity 
eligible under subparts B or C of this part, the applicant may be 
assigned only the number of frequency pairs justified on the basis of 
the requirement of the proposed single user of the system.
    (c) No non-SMR licensee will be authorized an additional frequency 
pair for a conventional system within 64 kilometers (40 miles) of an 
existing conventional system, except where:
    (1) The additional frequency pair will be used to provide radio 
facilities to a single entity and the additional frequency pair is 
justified on the basis of the requirements of the proposed single user; 
or,
    (2) The licensee's existing frequency pair(s) is loaded to 
prescribed levels.
    (d) No licensee will be authorized frequencies for a conventional 
system if that licensee is operating an unloaded trunked system or has 
an application pending for a trunked system to serve multiple 
subscribers within 64 km (40

[[Page 458]]

miles) of the requested conventional system.

Sec. 90.625  Other criteria to be applied in assigning channels for 
use in conventional systems of communication.

    (a) Where an applicant certifies on its application that a channel 
will be loaded to 70 mobile stations, that channel will be made 
available to that applicant for its exclusive use in the area in which 
it proposes to operate. If the showing made justifies the assignment of 
more than one channel to the applicant, additional frequencies will be 
authorized.
    (b) Where an applicant proposes to furnish service to eligibles 
under subparts B or C of this part on a commercial basis using a 
conventional system of communication, the applicant will be considered 
on the same basis as that of an applicant for private or shared 
communication facilities.
    (c) No person authorized to operate any radio facility under the 
provisions of this subpart shall have a right to protest proposals on 
grounds other than violation of or inconsistency with the provisions of 
this subpart. All grants are made subject to this condition and to the 
other conditions and standards set out in this subpart.

    (a) The maximum number of frequency pairs that may be assigned at 
any one time for the operation of a trunked radio system is twenty, 
except as specified in Sec. 90.621(a)(1)(iv).
    (b) No non-SMR licensee will be authorized an additional trunked 
system within 64 kilometers (40 miles) of an existing trunked system, 
except where:
    (1) The additional trunked system will be used to provide radio 
facilities for a single entity, where the additional system is justified 
on the basis of the requirements of the proposed single user; or,
    (2) The licensee's existing trunked system is loaded to at least 70 
mobile and control stations per channel.

Sec. 90.629  Extended implementation period.

    Applicants requesting frequencies for either trunked or conventional 
operations may be authorized a period of up to five (5) years for 
constructing and placing a system in operation in accordance with the 
following:
    (a) The applicant must justify an extended implementation period. 
The justification must describe the proposed system, state the amount of 
time necessary to construct and place the system in operation, identify 
the number of base stations to be constructed and placed in operation 
during each year of the extended construction period, and show that:
    (1) The proposed system will require longer than twelve (12) months 
to construct and place in operation because of its purpose, size, or 
complexity; or
    (2) The proposed system is to be part of a coordinated or integrated 
wide-area system which will require more than twelve (12) months to 
plan, approve, fund, purchase, construct, and place in operation; or
    (3) The applicant is required by law to follow a multi-year cycle 
for planning, approval, funding, and purchasing the proposed system.
    (b) Where an applicant is required by law to follow a multi-year 
cycle for planning, approval, funding and purchasing a proposed system, 
the applicant must indicate whether funding approval has been obtained 
and if not, when such funding approval is expected.
    (c) Authorizations under this section are conditioned upon the 
licensee constructing and placing its system in operation within the 
authorized implementation period and in accordance with an approved 
implementation plan of up to five years. Licensees must notify the 
Commission annually, using

[[Page 459]]

FCC Form 601, that they are in compliance with their yearly station 
construction commitments, but may request amendment to these commitments 
at the time they file their annual certification. If the Commission 
approves the requested amendments to a licensee's implementation 
commitments, the licensee's extended implementation authority will 
remain in effect. If, however, the Commission concludes, at this or any 
other time, that a licensee has failed to meet its commitments, the 
Commission will terminate authority for the extended implementation 
period. When the Commission terminates an extended implementation 
authority, the affected licensee will be given six months from the date 
of termination to complete system construction. At the end of any 
licensee's extended implementation period, authorizations for all 
stations not constructed and placed in operation will be cancelled. 
Trunked systems granted an extended implementation period must comply 
with the channel loading requirements of section 90.631(b). Conventional 
channels not loaded to 70 mobile units may be subject to shared use by 
the addition of other licensees.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) As of March 18, 1996, Specialized Mobile Radio systems are not 
eligible for extended implementation periods under this section. 
Additionally, all 800 MHz SMR licensees that are operating under 
extended implementation authority as of March 18, 1996 must, by May 16, 
1996, demonstrate that continuing to allow them to have an extended 
period of time to construct their facilities is warranted and furthers 
the public interest. If a licensee's extended implementation authority 
showing is approved by the Bureau, such licensee will be afforded an 
extended implementation of two years or the remainder of its current 
extended implementation period, whichever is shorter. Upon the 
termination of this period, the authorizations for those facilities that 
remain unconstructed will terminate automatically. If a licensee with a 
current extended implementation period fails to submit the showing 
mentioned above within the designated timeframe or submits an 
insufficient or incomplete showing, such licensee will have six months 
from the last day on which it could timely file such a showing or from 
the disapproval of its request to construct the remaining facilities 
covered under its implementation plan to construct any unconstructed 
facilities for which it is authorized. The authorizations for those 
facilities remaining unconstructed after this six-month period will 
terminate automatically.
    (f) Pursuant to Sec. 90.155(b), the provisions of this section 
shall apply to local government entities applying for any frequency in 
the Public Safety Pool.

Sec. 90.631  Trunked systems loading, construction and authorization
requirements.

    (a) Non-SMR trunked systems will be authorized on the basis of a 
loading criteria of one hundred (100) mobile stations per channel. For 
purposes of determining compliance with trunked system loading 
requirements under this subpart, the term ``mobile station'' includes 
vehicular and portable mobile units and control stations.
    (b) Each applicant for a non-SMR trunked system must certify that a 
minimum of seventy (70) mobiles for each channel authorized will be 
placed into operation within five (5) years of the initial license 
grant.
    (c) Except for SMR applicants and as provided in paragraph (d) of 
this section, an applicant seeking to expand a trunked system by 
requesting additional channels from the Commission, or through 
intercategory sharing, or through an assignment, must have a loading 
level of seventy (70) mobiles per channel on the existing system that is 
the subject of the expansion request.
    (d) In rural areas, a licensee of a trunked system may request to 
increase its system capacity by five more channels than it has 
constructed without meeting the loading requirements specified in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. A rural area is defined for

[[Page 460]]

purposes of this section as being beyond a 100-mile radius of the 
designated centers of the following urbanized areas: New York, NY; Los 
Angeles, CA; Chicago, IL; Philadelphia, PA: San Francisco, CA; Detroit, 
MI; Boston, MA; Houston, TX; Washington, DC; Dallas-Fort Worth, TX; 
Miami, FL; Cleveland, OH; St. Louis, MO; Atlanta, GA; Pittsburgh, PA; 
Baltimore, MD; Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN; Seattle, WA; San Diego, CA; and 
Tampa-St. Petersburg, FL. The coordinates for the centers of these areas 
are those referenced in Sec. 90.635, except that the coordinates 
(referenced to North American Datum 1983 (NAD83)) for Tampa-St. 
Petersburg are latitude 28[deg]00[min]1.1[sec] N, longitude 
82[deg]26[min]59.3[sec] W.
    (e) Except as provided in Sec. 90.629, licensees of trunked 
facilities must complete construction within one year.
    (f) If a station is not placed in permanent operation, in accordance 
with the technical parameters of the station authorization, within one 
year, except as provided in Sec. 90.629, its license cancels 
automatically. For purposes of this section, a base station is not 
considered to be placed in operation unless at least two associated 
mobile stations, or one control station and one mobile station, are also 
placed in operation. An SMR licensee with facilities that have 
discontinued operations for 90 continuous days is presumed to have 
permanently discontinued operations, unless the licensee notifies the 
Commission otherwise, using FCC Form 601, prior to the end of the 90 day 
period and provides a date on which operation will resume, which date 
must not be in excess of 30 additional days.
    (g) Wide area systems may be authorized to persons eligible for 
licensing under subparts B or C of this part upon an appropriate showing 
of need. Remote or satellite stations of wide area systems in the Public 
Safety, Special Emergency, Telephone Maintenance, and Power Radio 
Services may be authorized on a primary basis if such stations are the 
first to be authorized in their area of operation on the frequency or 
group of frequencies. Remote or satellite stations of wide area systems 
in all other services will be authorized only on a secondary, non-
interference basis to cochannel licensees. To determine system loading, 
the total number of mobile units and control stations operating in the 
wide-area system shall be counted with respect to the total number of 
base station frequencies assigned to the system.
    (h) Regional, statewide, or ribbon configuration systems may be 
authorized to persons eligible for licensing under subparts B or C of 
this part upon an appropriate showing of need. In a ribbon, regional or 
statewide system, a mobile station will be counted for channel loading 
purposes only for the base station facility in the geographic area in 
which it primarily operates. If this cannot be determined, it will be 
counted fractionally over the number of base station facilities with 
which it communicates regularly.

Sec. 90.633  Conventional systems loading requirements.

    (a) Non-SMR conventional systems of communication will be authorized 
on the basis of a minimum loading criteria of seventy (70) mobile 
stations for each channel authorized.
    (b) A channel will not be assigned to additional licensees when it 
is loaded to 70 mobile stations. Where a licensee does not load a 
channel to 70 mobiles the channel will be available for assignment to 
other licensees. All authorizations for conventional systems are issued 
subject to this potential channel sharing condition.
    (c) Except as provided in Sec. 90.629 of this part, licensees of 
conventional systems must place their authorized stations in operation 
not later than one year after the date of grant of the system license.
    (d) If a station is not placed in operation within one year, except 
as provided in Section 90.629 of this part, the license cancels 
automatically. For purposes of this section, a base station is not 
considered to be in operation unless at least one associated mobile 
station is also in operation.

[[Page 461]]

    (e) A non-SMR licensee may apply for additional frequency pairs if 
its authorized conventional channel(s) is loaded to seventy (70) 
mobiles. Applications may be considered for additional channels in areas 
where spectrum is still available and not applied for, even if the 
already authorized channel(s) is not loaded to 70 mobile units, upon an 
appropriate demonstration of need.
    (f) Wide area systems may be authorized to persons eligible for 
licensing under subparts B or C of this part upon an appropriate showing 
of need. For loading purposes, if the total number of mobile stations 
justifies the total number of authorized based frequencies in a given 
area, the system will be construed to be loaded.
    (g) Regional, statewide, or ribbon configuration systems may be 
authorized to persons eligible for licensing under subparts B or C of 
this part upon an appropriate showing of need. In a ribbon, regional or 
statewide system, a mobile station will be counted for channel loading 
purposes only for the base station facility in the geographic area in 
which it primarily operates. If this cannot be determined, it will be 
counted fractionally over the number of base station facilities with 
which it communicates regularly.

Sec. 90.637  Restrictions on operational fixed stations.

    (a) Except for control stations, operational fixed operations will 
not be authorized in the 806-824 MHz, 851-869 MHz, 896-901 MHz, or 935-
940 MHz bands. This does not preclude secondary fixed tone signaling and 
alarm operations authorized in Sec. 90.235 or in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (b) Control stations associated with one or more mobile relay 
stations will be authorized only on the assigned frequency of the 
associated mobile station. Use of a mobile service frequency by a 
control station of a mobile relay system is subject to the condition 
that harmful interference shall not be caused to stations of licensees 
authorized to use the frequency for mobile service communications.
    (c) Trunked and conventional systems that have exclusive-use status 
in their respective geographic areas may conduct fixed ancillary 
signaling and data transmissions subject to the following requirements:
    (1) All operations must be on a secondary, non-interference basis to 
the primary mobile operation of any other licensee.
    (2) The output power at the remote site must not exceed 30 watts.

[[Page 462]]

    (3) Any fixed transmitters will not count toward meeting the mobile 
loading requirements nor be considered in whole or in part as a 
justification for authorizing additional frequencies in the licensee's 
mobile system.
    (4) Automatic means must be provided to deactivate the remote 
transmitter in the event the carrier remains on for a period in excess 
of three minutes.
    (5) Operational fixed stations authorized pursuant to the provisions 
of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are exempt from the 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 90.425 and 90.429.
    (d) Conventional systems that do not have exclusive-use status in 
their respective geographic areas may conduct fixed ancillary signaling 
and data transmissions only in accordance with all the provisions of 
Sec. 90.235.

Sec. 90.645  Permissible operations.

    Conventional and trunked radio systems may be used:
    (a) Only for purposes expressly allowed under this part.
    (b) Only persons who are eligible for facilities, either under this 
subpart or in the radio service included under subparts B or C of this 
part.
    (c) Except for licensees classified as CMRS providers under part 20 
of this chapter, only for the transmission of messages or signals 
permitted in the services is which the participants are eligible.
    (d) For digital or analog transmissions.
    (e) An SMRS licensee or a licensee who has been authorized a 
channel(s) on an exclusive basis, may use the system for the 
transmission of any base/mobile message, page or signal permitted in the 
service in which the participants are eligible.
    (f) Where the channel(s) is assigned to an SMRS licensee or 
exclusively to a single licensee, or where all users of a system agree, 
more than a single emission may be utilized within the authorized 
bandwidth. In such cases, the frequency stability requirements of Sec. 
90.213 shall not apply, but out-of-band emission limits of Sec. 90.209 
shall be met.
    (g) Up to five (5) contiguous 809-816/854-861 band channels as 
listed in Sec. Sec. 90.615, 90.617, and 90.619 may be authorized after 
justification for systems requiring more than the normal single channel 
bandwidth. If necessary, licensees may trade channels amongst themselves 
in order to obtain contiguous frequencies. Notification of such proposed 
exchanges shall be made to the appropriate frequency coordinator(s) and 
to the Commission by filing an application for license modification.
    (h) Up to 10 contiguous 896-901/935-940 MHz band channels as listed 
in Sec. 90.617 may be combined for systems requiring more than the 
normal single channel bandwidth. If necessary, licensees may trade 
channels amongst themselves in order to obtain contiguous frequencies. 
Notification of such proposed exchanges shall be made to the appropriate 
frequency coordinator(s) and to the Commission by filing an application 
for license modification.
    (i) Paging operations may be utilized on multiple licensed 
facilities (community repeaters) only when all licensees of the facility 
agree to such use.

<R05>
Sec. 90.647  Station identification.

    (a) Conventional systems of communication shall be identified in 
accordance with existing regulations governing such matters.
    (b) Trunked systems of communication, except as noted in paragraph 
(c) of this section, shall be identified through the use of an automatic 
device which transmits the call sign of the base station facility at 30 
minute intervals. Such station identification shall be made on the 
lowest frequency in the base station trunk group assigned the licensee. 
Should this frequency be in use at the time station identification is 
required, such identification may be made at the termination of the 
communication in progress on this frequency. Identification may be made 
by voice or International Morse Code.

[[Page 463]]

When the call sign is transmitted in International Morse Code, it must 
be at a rate of between 15 to 20 words per minute and by means of tone 
modulation of the transmitter, the tone frequency being between 800 and 
1000 hertz.
    (c) Stations operating in either the 806-824/851-869 MHz or 896-901/
935-940 MHz bands that are licensed on an exclusive basis, and normally 
employ digital signals for the transmission of data, text, control 
codes, or digitized voice may also be identified by digital transmission 
of the call sign. A licensee that identifies its station in this manner 
must provide the Commission, upon its request, information sufficient to 
decode the digital transmission and ascertain the call sign transmitted.
    (d) Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in this paragraph, 
systems operated by geographic area CMRS licensees are subject only to 
the station identification requirements of Sec. 90.425(e).

Sec. 90.656  Responsibilities of base station licensees of Specialized
Mobile Radio systems.

    (a) The licensees of base stations that provide Specialized Mobile 
Radio service on a commercial basis of the use of individuals, Federal 
government agencies, or persons eligible for licensing under either 
subparts B or C of this part will be responsible for exercising 
effective operational control over all mobile and control stations that 
communicate with the base station. The base station licensee will be 
responsible for assuring that its system is operated in compliance with 
all applicable rules and regulations.
    (b) Customers that operate mobile units on a particular Specialized 
Mobile Radio system will be licensed to that system. A customer that 
operates temporarily on more than one system will be deemed, when 
communicating with the other system, to be temporarily licensed to the 
other system and for that temporary period, the licensee of the other 
system will assume the same licensee responsibility for the customer's 
mobile station(s) as if the customer's stations were licensed to that 
other system.

Policies Governing the Licensing and Use of MTA-Based SMR Systems in the 
                        896-901/935-940 MHz Band


<R05>
Sec. 90.661  MTA-based SMR service areas.

    MTA licenses for SMR spectrum blocks in the 896-901/935-940 MHz band 
listed in table 4B of Sec. 90.617(d) are available in 51 Major Trading 
Areas (MTAs) as defined in Sec. 90.7. Within these MTAs, licenses will 
be authorized in ten channel blocks as specified in table 4B of Sec. 
90.617(d) through the competitive bidding procedures described in 
subpart U of this part.

[60 FR 21991, May 4, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 90.663  MTA-based SMR system operations.

    (a) MTA-based licensees authorized in the 896-901/935-940 MHz band 
pursuant to Sec. 90.661 may construct and operate base stations using 
any frequency identified in their spectrum block anywhere within their 
authorized MTA, provided that:
    (1) The MTA licensee affords protection, in accordance with Sec. 
90.621(b), to all sites for which applications were filed on or prior to 
August 9, 1994.
    (2) The MTA licensee complies with any rules and international 
agreements that restrict use of frequencies identified in their spectrum 
block, including the provisions of Sec. 90.619 relating to U.S./
Canadian and U.S./Mexican border areas.
    (3) The MTA licensee limits its field strength at any location on 
the border of the MTA service area in accordance with Sec. 90.671 and 
masks its emissions in accordance with Sec. 90.669.
    (b) In the event that the authorization for a previously authorized 
co-channel station within the MTA licensee's authorized spectrum block 
is terminated or revoked, the MTA licensee's co-channel obligations to 
such station will cease upon deletion of the facility from the 
Commission's licensing record. The MTA licensee then will be able to 
construct and operate base stations using such frequency.

[60 FR 21991, May 4, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 90.665  Authorization, construction and implementation of 
MTA licenses.

    (a) MTA licenses in the 896-901/935-940 MHz band will be issued for 
a term not to exceed ten years.
    (b) MTA licensees in the 896-901/935-940 MHz band will be permitted 
five years to construct their stations. This five-year period will 
commence with the issuance of the MTA-wide authorization and will apply 
to all of the licensee's stations within the MTA spectrum block, 
including any stations that may have been subject to an earlier 
construction deadline arising from a pre-existing authorization.
    (c) Each MTA licensee in the 896-901/935-940 MHz band must, three 
years from the date of license grant, construct and place into operation 
a sufficient number of base stations to provide coverage to at least 
one-third of the population of the MTA; further, each MTA licensee must 
provide coverage to at least two-thirds of the population of the MTA 
five years from the date of license grant. Alternatively, an MTA 
licensee must demonstrate, through a showing to the Commission five 
years from the date of license grant, that it is providing substantial 
service. An MTA licensee must, three years from license grant, either 
show that the \1/3\ population coverage standard has been satisfied, or 
provide written notification that it has elected to show substantial 
service to the MTA five years from license grant. In addition, as part 
of the election to provide a substantial service showing, each MTA 
licensee must, three years from license grant, indicate how it expects 
to demonstrate substantial service at five years. The MTA licensee must 
meet the population coverage benchmarks regardless of the extent to 
which incumbent licensees are present within the MTA block.
    (d) MTA licensees who fail to meet the coverage requirements imposed 
at either the third or fifth years of their license term, or to make a 
convincing showing of substantial service, will forfeit the portion of 
the MTA license

[[Page 465]]

that exceeds licensed facilities constructed and operating on the date 
of the MTA license grant.

Sec. 90.667  Grandfathering provisions for incumbent licensees.

    (a) These provisions apply to all 900 MHz SMR licensees who obtained 
licenses or filed applications for secondary sites on or before August 
9, 1994 (``incumbent licensees''), as well as to all 900 MHz SMR 
licensees who obtained authorizations pursuant to Sec. 90.173(k). An 
incumbent licensee's service area shall be defined by its originally-
licensed 40 dBu field strength contour. Incumbent licensees are 
permitted to add new or modify transmit sites in this existing service 
area without prior notification to the Commission so long as their 
original 40 dBu field strength contour is not expanded.
    (b) Incumbent licensees operating at multiple sites may, after grant 
of MTA licenses has been completed, exchange multiple site licenses for 
a single license, authorizing operations throughout the contiguous and 
overlapping 40 dBu field strength contours of the multiple sites. 
Incumbents exercising this license exchange option must submit specific 
information for each of their external base sites after the close of the 
900 MHz SMR auction.
    (c) Applications in the 900 MHz SMR service for secondary sites 
filed after August 9, 1994 shall be authorized on a secondary, non-
interference basis to MTA licensee operations. No secondary sites shall 
be granted on this basis in an MTA once the MTA licensee has been 
selected.

<R05>
Sec. 90.669  Emission limits.

    (a) On any frequency in an MTA licensee's spectrum block that is 
adjacent to a non-MTA frequency, the power of any emission shall be 
attenuated below the transmitter power (P) by at least 43 plus 10 
log<INF>10</INF>(P) decibels or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser 
attenuation.

    Note: The measurements of emission power can be expressed in peak or 
average values, provided they are expressed in the same parameters as 
the transmitter power.

    (b) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require 
greater attenuation than specified in this section.

[60 FR 21992, May 4, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 90.671  Field strength limits.

    The predicted or measured field strength at any location on the 
border of the MTA service area for MTA licensees shall not exceed 40 
dBuV/m unless all bordering MTA licensees agree to a higher field 
strength. MTA licensees are also required to coordinate their frequency 
usage with so-channel adjacent MTA licensees and all other affected 
parties. To the extent that a single entity obtains licenses for 
adjacent MTAs on the same channel block, it will not be required to 
coordinate its operations in this manner. In the event that this 
standard conflicts with the MTA licensee's obligation to provide co-
channel protection to incumbent licensees under Sec. 90.621(b), the 
requirements of Sec. 90.621(b) shall prevail.

Land Transportation Pool.

    (a) Definition. Except as provided in 47 CFR 90.617(k), unacceptable 
interference to non-cellular licensees in the 800 MHz band from 800 MHz 
cellular systems or part 22 of this chapter, Cellular Radiotelephone 
systems and within the 900 MHz Business/Industrial Land Transportation 
(B/ILT) Pool will be deemed to occur when the below conditions are met:
    (1) A transceiver at a site at which interference is encountered:
    (i) Is in good repair and operating condition, and is receiving:
    (A) A median desired signal strength of -104 dBm or higher if 
operating in

[[Page 466]]

the 800 MHz band, or a median desired signal strength of -88 dBm if 
operating in the 900 MHz B/ILT Pool, as measured at the R.F. input of 
the receiver of a mobile unit; or
    (B) A median desired signal strength of -101 dBm or higher if 
operating in the 800 MHz band, or a median desired signal strength of -
85 dBm if operating in the 900 MHz B/ILT Pool, as measured at the R.F. 
input of the receiver of a portable i.e., hand-held unit; and either
    (ii) Is a voice transceiver:
    (A) With manufacturer published performance specifications for the 
receiver section of the transceiver equal to, or exceeding, the minimum 
standards set out in paragraph (b) of this section, and;
    (B) Receiving an undesired signal or signals which cause the 
measured Carrier to Noise plus Interference (C/(I+N)) ratio of the 
receiver section of said transceiver to be less than 20 dB if operating 
in the 800 MHz band, or less than 17 dB if operating in the 900 MHz B/
ILT Pool, or;
    (iii) Is a non-voice transceiver receiving an undesired signal or 
signals which cause the measured bit error rate (BER) (or some 
comparable specification) of the receiver section of said transceiver to 
be more than the value reasonably designated by the manufacturer.
    (2) Provided, however, that if the receiver section of the mobile or 
portable voice transceiver does not conform to the standards set out in 
paragraph (b) of this section, then that transceiver shall be deemed 
subject to unacceptable interference only at sites where the median 
desired signal satisfies the applicable threshold measured signal power 
in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) of this section after an upward adjustment to 
account for the difference in receiver section performance. The upward 
adjustment shall be equal to the increase in the desired signal required 
to restore the receiver section of the subject transceiver to the 20 dB 
C/(I+N) ratio of paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. The adjusted 
threshold levels shall then define the minimum measured signal power(s) 
in lieu of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) of this section at which the licensee 
using such non-compliant transceiver is entitled to interference 
protection.
    (b) Minimum Receiver Requirements. Voice transceivers capable of 
operating in the 806-824 MHz portion of the 800 MHz band, or in the 900 
MHz Business/Industrial Land Transportation Pool, shall have the 
following minimum performance specifications in order for the system in 
which such transceivers are used to claim entitlement to full protection 
against unacceptable interference. (See paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section.)
    (1) Voice units intended for mobile use: 75 dB intermodulation 
rejection ratio; 75 dB adjacent channel rejection ratio; -116 dBm 
reference sensitivity.
    (2) Voice units intended for portable use: 70 dB intermodulation 
rejection ratio; 70 dB adjacent channel rejection ratio; -116 dBm 
reference sensitivity.
    (3) Voice units intended for mobile or portable use in the 900 MHz 
Business/Industrial Land Transportation Pool: 60 dB intermodulation 
rejection ratio; 60 dB adjacent channel rejection ratio; -116 dBm 
reference sensitivity.

Sec. 90.673  Obligation to abate unacceptable interference.

    (a) Strict Responsibility. Any licensee who, knowingly or 
unknowingly, directly or indirectly, causes or contributes to causing 
unacceptable interference to a non-cellular licensee in the 800 MHz 
band, as defined in this chapter, shall be strictly accountable to abate 
the interference, with full cooperation and utmost diligence, in the 
shortest time practicable. Interfering licensees shall consider all 
feasible interference abatement measures, including, but not limited to, 
the remedies specified in the interference resolution procedures set 
forth in this chapter. This strict responsibility obligation applies to 
all forms of interference, including out-of-band emissions and 
intermodulation.
    (b) Joint and Several Responsibility. If two or more licensees 
knowingly or unknowingly, directly or indirectly, cause or contribute to 
causing unacceptable interference to a non-cellular licensee in the 800 
MHz band, as defined in this chapter, such licensees shall be jointly 
and severally responsible for

[[Page 467]]

abating interference, with full cooperation and utmost diligence, in the 
shortest practicable time. This joint and several responsibility rule 
requires interfering licensees to consider all feasible interference 
abatement measures, including, but not limited to, the remedies 
specified in the interference resolution procedures set forth in this 
chapter. This joint and several responsibility rule applies to all forms 
of interference, including out-of-band emissions and intermodulation.
    (1) This joint and several responsibility rule requires interfering 
licensees to consider all feasible interference abatement measures, 
including, but not limited to, the remedies specified in the 
interference resolution procedures set forth in Sec. 90.674(c). This 
joint and several responsibility rule applies to all forms of 
interference, including out-of-band emissions and intermodulation.
    (2) Any licensee that can show that its signal does not directly or 
indirectly, cause or contribute to causing unacceptable interference to 
a non-cellular licensee in the 800 MHz band, as defined in this chapter, 
shall not be held responsible for resolving unacceptable interference. 
Notwithstanding, any licensee that receives an interference complaint 
from a public safety/CII licensee shall respond to such complaint 
consistent with the interference resolution procedures set forth in this 
chapter.

[69 FR 67849, Nov. 22, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 90.674  Interference resolution procedures before, during and
after band reconfiguration.

    (a) Initial Notification. Any non-cellular licensee operating in the 
806-824/851-869 MHz band who reasonably believes it is receiving 
unacceptable interference, as described in Sec. 90.672, shall provide 
an initial notification of the interference incident. This initial 
notification of an interference incident shall be sent to all part 22 of 
this chapter Cellular Radiotelephone licensees and ESMR licensees who 
operate cellular base stations (``cell sites'') within 1,524 meters 
(5,000 feet) of the interference incident.
    (1) The initial notification of interference shall include the 
following information on interference:
    (i) The specific geographical location where the interference 
occurs, and the time or times at which the interference occurred or is 
occurring;
    (ii) A description of its scope and severity, including its source, 
if known;
    (iii) The relevant Commission licensing information of the party 
suffering the interference; and
    (iv) A single point of contact for the party suffering the 
interference.
    (2) ESMR licensees, in conjunction with part 22 Cellular 
Radiotelephone licensees, shall establish an electronic means of 
receiving the initial notification described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section. The electronic system must be designed so that all appropriate 
800 MHz ESMR and part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensees can be 
contacted about the interference incident with a single notification. 
The electronic system for receipt of initial notification of 
interference complaints must be operating no later than February 22, 
2005.
    (3) ESMR licensees must respond to the initial notification 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, as soon as possible and 
no later than 24 hours of receipt of notification from a public safety/
CII licensee. This response time may be extended to 48 hours after 
receipt from other non-cellular licensees provided affected 
communications on these systems are not safety related.
    (b) Interference analysis. ESMR licensees--who receive an initial 
notification described in paragraph (a) of this section--shall perform a 
timely analysis of the interference to identify the possible source. 
Immediate on-site visits may be conducted when necessary to complete 
timely analysis. Interference analysis must be completed and corrective 
action initiated within 48 hours of the initial complaint from a public 
safety/CII licensee. This response time may be extended to 96 hours 
after the initial complaint from other non-cellular licensees provided 
affected communications on these systems are not safety related. 
Corrective action may be delayed if the affected licensee agrees in 
writing (which may be, but is not required to be, recorded via e-mail

[[Page 468]]

or other electronic means) to a longer period.
    (c) Mitigation Steps. (1) All 800 MHz cellular system licensees and 
part 22 of this chapter Cellular Radiotelephone licensees who are 
responsible for causing unacceptable interference shall take all 
affirmative measures to resolve such interference. 800 MHz cellular 
system licensees found to contribute to harmful interference, as defined 
in Sec. 90.672, shall resolve such interference in the shortest time 
practicable. 800 MHz cellular system licensees and part 22 of this 
chapter Cellular Radiotelephone licensees must provide all necessary 
test apparatus and technical personnel skilled in the operation of such 
equipment as may be necessary to determine the most appropriate means of 
timely eliminating the interference. However, the means whereby 
interference is abated or the cell parameters that may need to be 
adjusted is left to the discretion of involved 800 MHz cellular system 
licensees and/or part 22 of this chapter Cellular Radiotelephone 
licensees, whose affirmative measures may include, but not be limited 
to, the following techniques:
    (i) Increasing the desired power of the public safety signal;
    (ii) Decreasing the power of the ESMR and/or part 22 Cellular 
Radiotelephone signal;
    (iii) Modifying the ESMR and/or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone 
systems antenna height;
    (iv) Modifying the ESMR and/or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone 
system antenna characteristics;
    (v) Incorporating filters into ESMR and/or part 22 Cellular 
Radiotelephone system transmission equipment;
    (vi) Permanently changing ESMR and/or part 22 Cellular 
Radiotelephone system frequencies; and
    (vii) Supplying interference-resistant receivers to the affected 
public safety licensee(s). If this technique is used, in all 
circumstances, the ESMR and/or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensees 
shall be responsible for all costs thereof.
    (2) Whenever short-term interference abatement measures prove 
inadequate, the affected licensee shall, consistent with but not 
compromising safety, make all necessary concessions to accepting 
interference until a longer-term remedy can be implemented.
    (3) Discontinuing operations when clear and imminent danger exists. 
When a public safety licensee determines that a continuing presence of 
interference constitutes a clear and imminent danger to life or 
property, the licensee causing the interference must discontinue the 
associated operation immediately, until a remedy can be identified and 
applied. The determination that a continuing presence exists that 
constitutes a clear and imminent danger to life or property, must be 
made by written statement that:
    (i) Is in the form of a declaration, notarized affidavit, or 
statement under penalty or perjury, from an officer or executive of the 
affected public safety licensee;
    (ii) Thoroughly describes the basis of the claim of clear and 
imminent danger;
    (iii) Was formulated on the basis of either personal knowledge or 
belief after due diligence;
    (iv) Is not proffered by a contractor or other third party; and
    (v) Has been approved by the Chief of the Public Safety and Homeland 
Security Bureau or other designated Commission official. Prior to the 
authorized official making a determination that a clear and imminent 
danger exists, the associated written statement must be served by hand-
delivery or receipted fax on the applicable offending licensee, with a 
copy transmitted by the fastest available means to the Washington, DC 
office of the Commission's Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau.

<R05>
Sec. 90.675  Information exchange.

    (a) Prior coordination. Public safety/CII licensees may notify an 
ESMR or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensee that they wish to 
receive prior notification of the activation or modification of ESMR or 
part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone cell sites in their area. Thereafter, 
the ESMR or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensee must provide the 
following information to the public safety/CII licensee at least 10

[[Page 469]]

business days before a new cell site is activated or an existing cell 
site is modified:
    (1) Location;
    (2) Effective radiated power;
    (3) Antenna height;
    (4) Channels available for use.
    (b) Purpose of prior coordination. The coordination of cell sites is 
for informational purposes only: public safety/CII licensees are not 
afforded the right to accept or reject the activation of a proposed cell 
or to unilaterally require changes in its operating parameters. The 
principal purposes of notification are to:
    (1) Allow a public safety/CII licensee to advise the ESMR or part 22 
Cellular Radiotelephone licensee whether it believes a proposed cell 
will generate unacceptable interference;
    (2) Permit ESMR or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensees to make 
voluntary changes in cell parameters when a public safety licensee 
alerts them to possible interference; and
    (3) Rapidly identify the source if interference is encountered when 
the cell is activated.
    (c) Public safety information exchange. (1) Upon request by an ESMR 
or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensee, public safety/CII licensees 
who operate radio systems in the 806-824/851-869 MHz shall provide the 
operating parameters of their radio system to the ESMR or part 22 
Cellular Radiotelephone licensee.
    (2) Public safety licensees who perform the information exchange as 
described in this section must notify the appropriate ESMR and part 22 
Cellular Radiotelephone licensees prior to any technical changes to 
their radio system.

    Effective Date Note: At 69 FR 67849, Nov. 22, 2004, Sec. 90.675 was 
added. This section contains information collection and recordkeeping 
requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given 
by the Office of Management and Budget.

Sec. 90.676  Transition administrator for reconfiguration of the 
806-824/851-869 MHz band in order to separate cellular systems from 
non-cellular systems.

    The Transition Administrator will be an independent party with no 
financial interest in any 800 MHz licensee; and will be selected by a 
committee representative of 800 MHz licensees. The Transition 
Administrator will serve both a ministerial role and a function similar 
to a special master in a judicial proceeding.
    (a) The duties of the Transition Administrator will include, but not 
be limited to:
    (1) Obtaining estimates from licensees regarding the cost of 
reconfiguring their systems and ensuring that estimates contain a firm 
work schedule. The Transition Administrator will retain copies of all 
estimates and make them available to the Commission on request.
    (2) Mediating disputes regarding cost estimates for reconfiguring a 
system.
    (3) Issuing the Draw Certificate to authorize and instruct the 
Letter of Credit Trustee to draw down on the Letter of Credit to pay 
relocation costs in connection with reconfiguring a licensee's system.
    (4) Establishing a relocation schedule on a NPSPAC region-by-region 
basis, prioritizing the regions on the basis of population. However, 
should a given region be encountering unusually severe amounts of 
unacceptable interference, that region may be moved up in priority. Any 
party disputing such a change in priority may refer the matter to the 
Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, who hereby is 
delegated the authority to resolve such disputes. The Transition 
Administrator may direct that adjoining regions be reconfigured 
simultaneously when conditions so require.
    (5) The Transition Administrator will coordinate relocation of a 
NPSPAC Region's NPSPAC channels with the relevant Regional Planning 
Committee(s) prior to commencing band reconfiguration in a NPSPAC 
Region.
    (b) Once band reconfiguration commences in a given NPSPAC Region, 
the Transition Administrator will;
    (1) Monitor the retuning schedule and resolve any schedule delays or 
refer same to the Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, for 
resolution;

[[Page 470]]

    (2) Coordinate with adjoining NPSPAC Regions to ensure that 
interference is not being caused to their existing facilities from 
relocated stations;
    (3) Provide quarterly progress reports to the Commission in such 
detail as the Commission may require and include, with such reports, 
certifications by Nextel and the relevant licensees that relocation has 
been completed and that both parties agree on the amount received from 
the letter of credit proceeds in connection with relocation of the 
licensees' facilities. The report shall include description of any 
disputes that have arisen and the manner in which they were resolved. 
These quarterly reports need not be audited. The Transition 
Administrator may select the dates for filing the quarterly progress 
reports;
    (4) Provide the Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, 
with an annual audited statement of relocation funds expended to date, 
including salaries and expenses of Transition Administrator. The 
Transition Administrator may select the date for filing the annual 
audited statement;
    (5) Facilitate resolution of disputes by mediation; or referral of 
the parties to alternative dispute resolution services as described in 
Sec. 90.677(d).
    (6) Notify the Commission when band reconfiguration is complete in 
each 800 MHz NPSPAC Region and identify which vacant channels are 
exclusively available to eligible applicants in the Public Safety or 
Critical Infrastructure Industry Categories as set forth in Sec. sect; 
90.615(a), (b) and 90.617(g), (h).
    (c) The Transition Administrator may not serve as the repository of 
funds used in band reconfiguration, excepting such sums as Nextel may 
pay for the Transition Administrator's services. Moreover, the 
Transition Administrator will not be certified by the Commission as a 
frequency coordinator.

Sec. 90.677  Reconfiguration of the 806-824/851-869 MHz band in order
to separate cellular systems from non-cellular systems.

    In order to facilitate reconfiguration of the 806-824/851-869 MHz 
band (``800 MHz band'') to separate high-density cellular systems from 
non-cellular systems, Nextel Communications, Inc. (Nextel) may relocate 
incumbents within the 800 MHz band by providing ``comparable 
facilities.'' For the limited purpose of band reconfiguration, the 
provisions of Sec. 90.157 shall not apply and inter-category sharing 
will be permitted under all circumstances. Such relocation is subject to 
the following provisions:
    (a) Within thirty days of Commission approval of the Transition 
Administrator, the Transition Administrator described in Sec. 90.676 
will provide the Commission with a schedule detailing when band 
reconfiguration shall commence for each NPSPAC Region. The plan should 
also detail--by NPSPAC Region--which relocation option each non-Nextel 
ESMR licensees has chosen. The Chief, Public Safety and Homeland 
Security Bureau will finalize and approve such a plan. The schedule 
shall provide for completion of band reconfiguration in no more than 
thirty-six months following release of a public notice announcing the 
start date of reconfiguration in the first NPSPAC region. Relocation 
will commence according to the schedule set by the Transition 
Administrator but all systems must have commenced reconfiguration within 
thirty months of release of a public notice announcing the start date of 
reconfiguration in the first NPSPAC region.
    (b) Voluntary negotiations. Thirty days before the start date for 
each NPSPAC region other than Region 47 and Region 48, the Chief, Public 
Safety and Homeland Security Bureau will issue a public notice 
initiating a three-month voluntary negotiation period. During this 
voluntary negotiation period, Nextel and all incumbents may negotiate 
any mutually agreeable relocation agreement. Sprint Nextel and 
relocating incumbents may agree to conduct face-to-face negotiations or 
either party may elect to communicate

[[Page 471]]

with the other party through the Transition Administrator.
    (c) Mandatory negotiations. If no agreement is reached by the end of 
the voluntary period, a three-month mandatory negotiation period will 
begin during which both Sprint Nextel and the incumbents must negotiate 
in ``good faith.'' In Region 47, a 90-day mandatory negotiation period 
will begin 60 days after the effective date of the Third Report and 
Order and Third Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in WT Docket 02-
55. In Region 48, a 90-day mandatory negotiation period will begin on 
March 21, 2011. Sprint Nextel and relocating incumbents may agree to 
conduct face-to-face negotiations or either party may elect to 
communicate with the other party through the Transition Administrator. 
All parties are charged with the obligation of utmost ``good faith'' in 
the negotiation process. Among the factors relevant to a ``good-faith'' 
determination are:
    (1) Whether the party responsible for paying the cost of band 
reconfiguration has made a bona fide offer to relocate the incumbent to 
comparable facilities;
    (2) The steps the parties have taken to determine the actual cost of 
relocation to comparable facilities; and
    (3) Whether either party has unreasonably withheld information, 
essential to the accurate estimation of relocation costs and procedures, 
requested by the other party. The Transition Administrator may schedule 
mandatory settlement negotiations and mediation sessions and the parties 
must conform to such schedules.
    (d) Transition Administrator. (1) The Transition Administrator, or 
other mediator, shall attempt to resolve disputes referred to it before 
the conclusion of the mandatory negotiation period as described in Sec. 
90.677(c) within thirty working days after the Transition Administrator 
has received a submission by one party and a response from the other 
party. Any party thereafter may seek expedited non-binding arbitration 
which must be completed within thirty days of the Transition 
Administrator's, or other mediator's recommended decision or advice. 
Should issues still remain unresolved after mediation or arbitration 
they shall be referred to the Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security 
Bureau within ten days of the Transition Administrator's or other 
mediator's advice, or if arbitration has occurred, within ten days of 
the completion of arbitration. When referring an unresolved matter to 
the Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, the Transition 
Administrator shall forward the entire record on any disputed issues, 
including such dispositions thereof that the Transition Administrator 
has considered. Upon receipt of such record and advice, the Commission 
will decide the disputed issues based on the record submitted. The 
authority to make such decisions is delegated to the Chief, Public 
Safety and Homeland Security Bureau who may decide the disputed issue or 
designate it for an evidentiary hearing before an Administrative Law 
Judge. If the Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau decides 
an issue, any party to the dispute wishing to appeal the decision may do 
so by filing with the Commission, within ten days of the effective date 
of the initial decision, a Petition for de novo review; whereupon the 
matter will be set for an evidentiary hearing before an Administrative 
Law Judge. Any disputes submitted to the Transition Administrator after 
the conclusion of the mandatory negotiation period as described in Sec. 
90.677(c) shall be resolved as described in Sec. 90.677(d)(2).
    (2) If no agreement is reached during either the voluntary or 
mandatory negotiating periods, all disputed issues shall be referred to 
the Transition Administrator, or other mediator, who shall attempt to 
resolve them. If disputed issues remain thirty working days after the 
end of the mandatory negotiation period, the Transition Administrator 
shall forward the record to the Chief, Public Safety and Homeland 
Security Bureau, together with advice on how the matter(s) may be 
resolved. The Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau is 
hereby delegated the authority to rule on disputed issues, de novo. If 
the Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau decides an issue, 
any party to the dispute wishing to appeal the decision

[[Page 472]]

may do so by filing with the Commission, within ten days of the 
effective date of the initial decision, a Petition for de novo review; 
whereupon the matter will be set for an evidentiary hearing before an 
Administrative Law Judge.
    (e) Waiver requests. Incumbents who wish not to relocate according 
to the schedule may petition the Commission for a waiver of the 
relocation obligation. Such a waiver would only be granted on a strict 
non-interference basis.
    (f) Comparable facilities. The replacement system provided to an 
incumbent must be at least equivalent to the existing 800 MHz system 
with respect to the four factors described in Sec. 90.699(d) part.
    (g) Information exchange. Absent agreement between parties, the 
Transition Administrator will be responsible for determining the 
information that relocating incumbents must supply in support of a 
relocation agreement.
    (h) The relevant Regional Planning Committee shall be informed of 
any proposed changes to any NPSPAC channel.

after August 10, 1996.
    (b) EA licensees in the 809-824/854-869 MHz band must, within three 
years of the grant of their initial license, construct and place into 
operation a sufficient number of base stations to provide coverage to at 
least one-third of the population of its EA-based service area. Further, 
each EA licensee must provide coverage to at least two-thirds of the 
population of the EA-based service area within five years of the grant 
of their initial license. EA-based licensees may, in the alternative, 
provide substantial service to their markets within five years of the 
grant of their initial license. Substantial service shall be defined as: 
``Service which is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of 
mediocre service.''
    (c) Channel use requirement. In addition to the population coverage 
requirements described in this section, we will require EA licensees in 
Channel blocks A, B and C in the 816-821/861-866 MHz band to construct 
50 percent of the total channels included in their spectrum block in at 
least one location in their respective EA-based service area within 
three years of initial license grant and to retain such channel usage 
for the remainder of the construction period.
    (d) An EA licensee's failure to meet the population coverage 
requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, will result in 
forfeiture of the entire EA license. Forfeiture of the EA license, 
however, would not result in the loss of any constructed facilities 
authorized to the licensee prior to the date of the commencement of the 
auction for the EA licenses.
    (e) EA licensees operating on channels listed in Sec. 90.614(b) and 
(c) must implement an Enhanced Specialized Mobile Radio (ESMR) system--
as defined in Sec. 90.7--on their EA license and any associated site-
based licenses prior to the expiration date of the EA license. EA 
licensees operating on these channels shall follow the construction 
notification procedures set forth in Sec. 1.946(d) of this chapter. 
Failure to implement an ESMR system on their EA and site-based licenses 
before the expiration date of the EA license will result in termination 
of the EA license and any associated site-based licenses pursuant to 
Sec. 1.946(c) of this chapter.

Sec. 90.687  Special provisions regarding assignments and transfers
of authorizations for incumbent SMR licensees in the 
               809-824/854-869 MHz band.

    An SMR license initially authorized on any of the channels listed in 
Tables 4 and 5 of Sec. 90.617 may transfer or assign its channel(s) to 
another entity subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.948 of this chapter 
and Sec. 90.609(b). If the proposed transferee or assignee is the EA 
licensee for the spectrum block to which the channel is allocated, such 
transfer or assignment presumptively will be deemed to be in the public 
interest. However, such presumption will be rebuttable.

Sec. 90.689  Field strength limits.

    (a) For purposes of implementing Sec. Sec. 90.689 through 90.699, 
predicted 36 and 40 dB[micro]V/m contours shall be calculated using 
Figure 10 of Sec. 73.699 of this chapter with a correction factor of -9 
dB, and predicted 18 and 22 dB[micro]V/m contours shall be calculated 
using Figure 10a of Sec. 73.699 of this chapter with a correction 
factor of -9 dB.
    (b) The predicted or measured field strength at any location on the 
border of the EA-based service area for EA licensees must not exceed 40 
dBuV/m unless all bordering EA licensees agree to a higher field 
strength. In the event that this standard conflicts with the EA 
licensee's obligation to provide co-channel protection to incumbent 
licensees pursuant to Sec. 90.621(b), the requirements of Sec. 
90.621(b) shall prevail.

Sec. 90.691  Emission mask requirements for EA-based systems.

    (a) Out-of-band emission requirement shall apply only to the 
``outer'' channels included in an EA license and to

[[Page 474]]

spectrum adjacent to interior channels used by incumbent licensees. The 
emission limits are as follows:
    (1) For any frequency removed from the EA licensee's frequency block 
by up to and including 37.5 kHz, the power of any emission shall be 
attenuated below the transmitter power (P) in watts by at least 116 
Log<INF>10</INF>(f/6.1) decibels or 50 + 10 Log<INF>10</INF>(P) decibels 
or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation, where f is the 
frequency removed from the center of the outer channel in the block in 
kilohertz and where f is greater than 12.5 kHz.
    (2) For any frequency removed from the EA licensee's frequency block 
greater than 37.5 kHz, the power of any emission shall be attenuated 
below the transmitter power (P) in watts by at least 43 + 
10Log<INF>10</INF>(P) decibels or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser 
attenuation, where f is the frequency removed from the center of the 
outer channel in the block in kilohertz and where f is greater than 37.5 
kHz.
    (b) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require 
greater attenuation than specified in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 90.693  Grandfathering provisions for incumbent licensees.

    (a) General provisions. These provisions apply to ``incumbent 
licensees,'' all 800 MHz licensees authorized in the 809-821/854-866 MHz 
band who obtained licenses or filed applications on or before December 
15, 1995.
    (b) Spectrum blocks A through V. An incumbent licensee's service 
area shall be defined by its originally licensed 40 dB[mu]V/m field 
strength contour and its interference contour shall be defined as its 
originally-licensed 22 dB[mu]V/m field strength contour. The 
``originally-licensed'' contour shall be calculated using the maximum 
ERP and the actual height of the antenna above average terrain (HAAT) 
along each radial. Incumbent licensees are permitted to add, remove or 
modify transmitter sites within their original 22 dB[mu]V/m field 
strength contour without prior notification to the Commission so long as 
their original 22 dB[mu]V/m field strength contour is not expanded. 
Incumbent licensee protection extends only to its 40 dB[mu]V/m signal 
strength contour. Pursuant to the minor modification notification 
procedures set forth in 1.947(b), the incumbent licensee must notify the 
Commission within 30 days of any change in technical parameters for 
stations that are authorized under a waiver of 90.621(b)(4), or that are 
authorized under 90.621(b)(5).
    (c) Special provisions for spectrum blocks F1 through V. Incumbent 
licensees that have received the consent of all affected parties or a 
certified frequency coordinator to utilize an 18 dB[mu]V/m signal 
strength interference contour shall have their service area defined by 
their originally-licensed 36 dB[mu]V/m field strength contour and their 
interference contour shall be defined as their originally-licensed 18 
dB[mu]V/m field strength contour. The ``originally-licensed'' contour 
shall be calculated using the maximum ERP and the actual HAAT along each 
radial. Incumbent licensees seeking to utilize an 18 dB[mu]V/m signal 
strength interference contour shall first seek to obtain the consent of 
affected co-channel incumbents. When the consent of a co-channel 
licensee is withheld, an incumbent licensee may submit to any certified 
frequency coordinator an engineering study showing that interference 
will not occur, together with proof that the incumbent licensee has 
sought consent. Incumbent licensees are permitted to add, remove or 
modify transmitter sites within their original 18 dB[mu]V/m field 
strength contour without prior notification to the Commission so long as 
their original 18 dB[mu]V/m field strength contour is not expanded. 
Incumbent licensee protection extends only to its 36 dB[mu]V/m signal 
strength contour. Pursuant to the minor modification notification 
procedures set forth in 1.947(b), the incumbent licensee must notify the 
Commission within 30 days of any change in technical parameters for 
stations that are authorized under a waiver of 90.621(b)(4), or that are 
authorized under 90.621(b)(5).
    (d) Consolidated license--(1) Spectrum blocks A through V. Incumbent 
licensees operating at multiple sites may, after grant of EA licenses 
has been completed, exchange multiple site licenses

[[Page 475]]

for a single license, authorizing operations throughout the contiguous 
and overlapping 40 dB[micro]V/m field strength contours of the multiple 
sites. Incumbents exercising this license exchange option must submit 
specific information on Form 601 for each of their external base sites 
after the close of the 800 MHz SMR auction. The incumbent's geographic 
license area is defined by the contiguous and overlapping 22 dB[micro]V/
m contours of its constructed and operational external base stations and 
interior sites that are constructed within the construction period 
applicable to the incumbent. Once the geographic license is issued, 
facilities that are added within an incumbent's existing footprint and 
that are not subject to prior approval by the Commission will not be 
subject to construction requirements.
    (2) Special Provisions for Spectrum Blocks F1 through V. Incumbent 
licensees that have received the consent of all affected parties or a 
certified frequency coordinator to utilize an 18 dB[micro]V/m signal 
strength interference contour operating at multiple sites may, after 
grant of EA licenses has been completed, exchange multiple site licenses 
for a single license. This single site license will authorize operations 
throughout the contiguous and overlapping 36 dB[micro]V/m field strength 
contours of the multiple sites. Incumbents exercising this license 
exchange option must submit specific information on Form 601 for each of 
their external base sites after the close of the 800 SMR auction. The 
incumbent's geographic license area is defined by the contiguous and 
overlapping 18 dB[micro]V/m contours of its constructed and operational 
external base stations and interior sites that are constructed within 
the construction period applicable to the incumbent. Once the geographic 
license is issued, facilities that are added within an incumbent's 
existing footprint and that are not subject to prior approval by the 
Commission will not be subject to construction requirements.

Sec. 90.699  Transition of the upper 200 channels in the 800 MHz band
to EA licensing.

    In order to facilitate provision of service throughout an EA, an EA 
licensee may relocate incumbent licensees in its EA by providing 
``comparable facilities'' on other frequencies in the 800 MHz band. Such 
relocation is subject to the following provisions:
    (a)-(c) [Reserved]
    (d) Comparable facilities. The replacement system provided to an 
incumbent during an involuntary relocation must be at least equivalent 
to the existing 800 MHz system with respect to the following four 
factors:
    (1) System. System is defined functionally from the end user's point 
of view (i.e., a system is comprised of base station facilities that 
operate on an integrated basis to provide service to a common end user, 
and all mobile units associated with those base stations). A system may 
include multiple-licensed facilities that share a common switch or are 
otherwise operated as a unitary system, provided that the end user has 
the ability to access all such facilities. A system may cover more than 
one EA if its existing geographic coverage extends beyond the EA 
borders.
    (2) Capacity. To meet the comparable facilities requirement, an EA 
licensee must relocate the incumbent to facilities that provide 
equivalent channel capacity. We define channel capacity as the same 
number of channels with the same bandwidth that is currently available 
to the end user. For example, if an incumbent's system consists of five 
50 kHz (two 25 kHz paired frequencies) channels, the replacement system 
must also have five 50 kHz channels. If a different channel 
configuration is used, it must have the same overall capacity as the 
original configuration. Comparable channel capacity requires equivalent 
signaling capability, baud rate, and access time. In addition, the 
geographic coverage of the channels must be coextensive with that of the 
original system.
    (3) Quality of service. Comparable facilities must provide the same 
quality of service as the facilities being replaced. Quality of service 
is defined to mean that the end user enjoys the same level of 
interference protection

[[Page 476]]

on the new system as on the old system. In addition, where voice service 
is provided, the voice quality on the new system must be equal to the 
current system. Finally, reliability of service is considered to be 
integral to defining quality of service. Reliability is the degree to 
which information is transferred accurately within the system. 
Reliability is a function of equipment failures (e.g., transmitters, 
feed lines, antennas, receivers, battery back-up power, etc.) and the 
availability of the frequency channel due to propagation characteristics 
(e.g., frequency, terrain, atmospheric conditions, radio-frequency 
noise, etc.) For digital data systems, this will be measured by the 
percent of time the bit error rate exceeds the desired value. For analog 
or digital voice transmissions, this will be measured by the percent of 
time that audio signal quality meets an established threshold. If analog 
voice system is replaced with a digital voice system the resulting 
frequency response, harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise ratio, and 
reliability will be considered.
    (4) Operating costs. Operating costs are those costs that affect the 
delivery of services to the end user. If the EA licensee provides 
facilities that entail higher operating cost than the incumbent's 
previous system, and the cost increase is a direct result of the 
relocation, the EA licensee must compensate the incumbent for the 
difference. Costs associated with the relocation process can fall into 
several categories. First, the incumbent must be compensated for any 
increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilitates 
(e.g., additional rental payments, increased utility fees). Second, 
increased maintenance costs must be taken into consideration when 
determining whether operating costs are comparable. For example, 
maintenance costs associated with analog systems may be higher than the 
costs of digital equipment because manufacturers are producing mostly 
digital equipment and analog replacement parts can be difficult to find. 
An EA licensee's obligation to pay increased operating costs will end 
five years after relocation has occurred.

first-served basis. When multiple applications are filed on the same day 
for these frequencies in the same geographic area, and insufficient 
frequencies are available to grant all applications (i.e., if all 
applications were granted, violation of the station separation 
provisions of Sec. 90.723(k) of this part would result),

[[Page 478]]

these applications will be considered mutually exclusive.
    (1) All applications will first be considered to determine whether 
they are substantially complete and acceptable for filing. If so, they 
will be assigned a file number and put in pending status. If not, they 
will be dismissed.
    (2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all applications 
in pending status will be processed in the order in which they are 
received, determined by the date on which the application was received 
by the Commission in its Gettysburg, Pennsylvania office (or the address 
set forth at Sec. 1.1102 of this chapter for applications requiring the 
fees established by part 1, subpart G of this chapter).
    (3) Each application that is accepted for filing will then be 
reviewed to determine whether it can be granted. Frequencies will be 
assigned by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 90.723.
    (4) An application which is dismissed will lose its place in the 
processing line.
    (b) All applications for Channels 161 through 165 that comply with 
the applicable rules of this part shall be granted. Licensees operating 
on such channels shall cooperate in the selection and use of frequencies 
and resolve any instances of interference in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 90.173.
    (c) Phase II applications for authorization on all non-Government 
channels other than Channels 161 through 170 and 181 through 185 shall 
be processed in accordance with the provisions of subpart W of this

    (3) An applicant must include a ten-year schedule detailing plans 
for construction of the proposed system.
    (4) An applicant must include an itemized estimate of the cost of 
constructing 40 percent of the system and operating the system during 
the first four years of the license term.
    (5) An applicant must include proof that the applicant has 
sufficient financial resources to construct 40 percent of the system and 
operate the proposed land mobile system for the first four years of the 
license term; i.e., that the applicant has net current assets sufficient 
to cover estimated costs or a firm financial commitment sufficient to 
cover estimated costs.
    (c) An applicant relying on personal or internal resources for the 
showing required in paragraph (b) of this section must submit 
independently audited financial statements certified within one year of 
the date of the application showing net current assets sufficient to 
meet estimated construction and operating costs. An applicant must also 
submit an unaudited balance sheet, current within 60 days of the date of 
submission, that clearly shows the continued availability of sufficient 
net current assets to construct and operate the proposed system, and a 
certification by the applicant or an officer of the applicant 
organization attesting to the validity of the balance sheet.
    (d) An applicant submitting evidence of a firm financial commitment 
for the showing required in paragraph (b) of this section must obtain 
the commitment from a bona fide commercially acceptable source, e.g., a

or savings and loan institution, other recognized financial institution, 
the financial arm of a capital equipment supplier, or an investment 
banking house, the lender must also demonstrate that it has funds 
available to cover the total commitments it has made. The lender's 
commitment shall contain a statement that the lender:
    (1) Has examined the financial condition of the applicant including 
an audited financial statement, and has determined that the applicant is 
creditworthy;
    (2) Has examined the financial viability of the proposed system for 
which the applicant intends to use the commitment; and
    (3) Is willing, if the applicant is seeking a Phase I, commercial 
nationwide license, to provide a sum to the applicant sufficient to 
cover the realistic and prudent estimated costs of construction of 40 
percent of the system and operation of the system for the first four 
years of the license term.
    (e) A Phase II applicant for authorization in a geographic area for 
Channels 166 through 170 in the public safety/mutual aid category may 
not have any interest in another pending application in the same 
geographic area for Channels 166 through 170 in the public safety/mutual 
aid category, and a Phase II applicant for authorization in a geographic 
area for channels in the emergency medical category may not have any 
interest in another pending application in the same geographic area for 
channels in the emergency medical category.

on a primary basis by all non-Government Phase II licensees, fixed 
operations on a primary basis by all non-Government Phase II licensees 
and all Government licensees, one-way or two-way paging or fixed 
operations on a primary basis by all non-Government Phase I licensees, 
except that before a non-Government Phase I licensee may operate one-way 
or two-way paging or fixed systems on a primary basis instead of or in 
addition to its land mobile operations, it must meet the following 
requirements:
    (A) A nationwide Phase I licensee must;
    (1) Meet its two-year benchmark for the construction of its land 
mobile system base stations as prescribed in Sec. 90.725(a); and
    (2) Provide a new 10-year schedule, as required in Sec. 
90.713(b)(3), for the construction of the fixed and/or paging system it 
intends to construct instead of, or in addition to, its nationwide land 
mobile system; and
    (3) Certify that the financial showings and all other certifications 
provided in demonstrating its ability to construct and operate its 
nationwide land mobile system, as required in Sec. Sec. 90.713 (b), (c) 
and (d), remain applicable to the nationwide system it intends to 
construct consisting of fixed and/or paging operations on a primary 
basis instead of, or in addition to, its land mobile operations; or
    (4) In lieu of providing the requirements of paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii)(A)(3) of this section, provide the financial showings and all

mutual aid channels.
    (c) For operations requiring less than a 4 kHz bandwidth, more than 
a single emission may be utilized within the authorized bandwidth. In 
such cases, the frequency stability requirements of Sec. 90.213 do not 
apply, but the out-of-band emission limits of Sec. 90.210(f) must be 
met.
    (d) Licensees, except for licensees authorized on Channels 161 
through 170 and 181 through 185, may combine any number of their 
authorized, contiguous channels (including channels derived from 
multiple authorizations) to form channels wider than 5 kHz.

[[Page 487]]

    (e) In combining authorized, contiguous channels (including channels 
derived from multiple authorizations) to form channels wider than 5 kHz, 
the emission limits in Sec. 90.210(f) must be met only at the outermost 
edges of the contiguous channels. Transmitters shall be tested to 
confirm compliance with this requirement with the transmission located 
as close to the band edges as permitted by the design of the 
transmitter. The frequency stability requirements in Sec. 90.213 shall 
apply only to the outermost of the contiguous channels authorized to the 
licensee. However, the frequency stability employed for transmissions 
operating inside the outermost contiguous channels must be such that the 
emission limits in Sec. 90.210(f) are met over the temperature and 
voltage variations prescribed in Sec. 2.995 of this chapter.
    (f) A Phase I non-nationwide licensee operating a paging base 
station, or a fixed station transmitting on frequencies in the 220-221 
MHz band, may only operate such stations at the coordinates of the 
licensee's authorized land mobile base station.
    (g) The transmissions of a Phase I non-nationwide licensee's paging 
base station, or fixed station transmitting on frequencies in the 220-

(h), and (k), and 90.729, and such a station must operate at the 
effective radiated power and antenna height-above-average-terrain 
prescribed in the licensee's land mobile base station authorization.
    (h) Licensees using 220-222 MHz spectrum for geophysical telemetry 
operations are authorized to operate fixed stations on a secondary, non-
interference basis to licensees operating in the 220-222 MHz band on a 
primary basis under the conditions that such licensees:
    (1) Provide notification of their operations to co-channel non-
nationwide Phase I licensees with an authorized base station, or fixed 
station transmitting on frequencies in the 220-221 MHz band, located 
within 45 km of the secondary licensee's station, to co-channel, Phase 
II EA or Regional licensee authorized to operate in the EA or REAG in 
which the secondary licensee's station is located, and to co-channel 
Phase I or Phase II nationwide licensees;
    (2) Operate only at temporary locations in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1.931 of this chapter;
    (3) Not transmit at a power level greater than one watt ERP;
    (4) Not transmit from an antenna higher than 2 meters (6.6 feet) 
above ground; and
    (5) Not operate on Channels 111 through 120, 161 through 170, or 181 
through 185.
    (i) All licensees constructing and operating base stations or fixed 
stations on frequencies in the 220-222 MHz band must:
    (1) Comply with any rules and international agreements that restrict 
use of their authorized frequencies, including the provisions of Sec.

Sec. 90.735  Station identification.

    (a) Except for nationwide systems authorized in the 220-222 MHz 
band, station identification is required pursuant to Sec. 90.425 of 
this part.
    (b) Trunked systems shall employ an automatic device to transmit the 
call sign of the base station at 30 minute intervals. The identification 
shall be made on the lowest frequency in the base station trunked group 
assigned to the licensee. If this frequency is in use at the time 
identification is required, the identification may be made at the 
termination of the communication in progress on this frequency.
    (c) Station identification may be by voice or International Morse 
Code. If the call sign is transmitted in International Morse Code, it 
must be at a rate of between 15 to 20 words per minute, and by means of 
tone modulation of the transmitter, with the tone

[[Page 488]]

frequency being between 800 and 1000 hertz.
    (d) Digital transmissions may also be identified by digital 
transmission of the station call sign. A licensee that identifies its 
station in this manner must provide the Commission, upon its request, 
information (such as digital codes and algorithms) sufficient to 
decipher the data transmission to ascertain the call sign transmitted.

Sec. 90.741  Urban areas for Phase I nationwide systems.

    Licensees of Phase I nationwide systems must construct base 
stations, or fixed stations transmitting on frequencies in the 220-221 
MHz band, in a minimum of 28 of the urban areas listed in the following 
Table within ten years of initial license grant. A base station, or 
fixed station, is considered to be within one of the listed urban areas 
if it is within 60 kilometers (37.3 miles) of the specified coordinates 
(coordinates are referenced to North American Datum 1983 (NAD83)).

Sec. 90.743  Renewal expectancy.

    (a) All licensees seeking renewal of their authorizations at the end 
of their

[[Page 490]]

license term must file a renewal application in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1.949 of this chapter. Licensees must demonstrate, 
in their application, that:
    (1) They have provided ``substantial'' service during their past 
license term. ``Substantial'' service is defined in this rule as service 
that is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre 
service that just might minimally warrant renewal; and
    (2) They have substantially complied with applicable FCC rules, 
policies, and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
    (b) In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, a 
renewal applicant must submit a showing explaining why it should receive 
a renewal expectancy. At a minimum, this showing must include:
    (1) A description of its current service in terms of geographic 
coverage and population served;
    (2) For an EA, Regional, or nationwide licensee, an explanation of 
its record of expansion, including a timetable of the construction of 
new stations to meet changes in demand for service;
    (3) A description of its investments in its system;
    (4) Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated 
the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and
    (5) A list of any pending proceedings that relate to any matter 
described in this paragraph.
    (c) Phase I non-nationwide licensees have license terms of 10 years, 
and therefore must meet these requirements 10 years from the date of 
initial authorization in order to receive a renewal expectancy. Phase I 
nationwide licensees and all Phase II licensees have license terms of 10 
years, and therefore must meet these requirements 10 years from the date 
of initial authorization in order to receive a renewal expectancy.

Sec. 90.745  Phase I licensee service areas.

    (a) A Phase I licensee's service area shall be defined by the 
predicted 38 dBu service contour of its authorized base station or fixed 
station transmitting on frequencies in the 220-221 MHz band at its 
initially authorized location or at the location authorized in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 90.751, 90.753, 90.755 and 90.757 if the 
licensee has sought modification of its license to relocate its 
initially authorized base station. The Phase I licensee's predicted 38 
dBu service contour is calculated using the F(50,50) field strength 
chart for Channels 7-13 in Sec. 73.699 (Fig. 10) of this chapter, with 
a 9 dB correction factor for antenna height differential, and is based 
on the authorized effective radiated power (ERP) and antenna height-
above-average-terrain of the licensee's base station or fixed station. 
Phase I licensees are permitted to add, remove, or modify transmitter 
sites within their existing service area without prior notification to 
the Commission so long as their predicted 38 dBu service contour is not 
expanded. The incumbent licensee must, however, notify the Commission 
within 30 days of the completion of any changes in technical parameters 
or additional stations constructed through a minor modification of its 
license. Such notification must be made by submitting the appropriate 
FCC form and must include the appropriate filing fee, if any. These 
minor modification applications are not subject to public notice and 
petition to deny requirements or mutually exclusive applications.
    (b) Phase I licensees holding authorizations for service areas that 
are contiguous and overlapping may exchange these authorizations for a 
single license, authorizing operations throughout the contiguous and 
overlapping service areas. Phase I licensees exercising this license 
exchange option must submit specific information for each of their 
external base station sites.

Sec. 90.753  Conditions of license modification.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), and (c) of this section, a 
Phase I non nationwide licensee may modify its authorization to relocate 
its authorized base station up to one-half the distance over 120 km 
toward any co-channel licensee's initially authorized base station, to a 
maximum distance of 8 km.
    (b) A Phase I non-nationwide licensee with an authorized base 
station located outside a Designated Filing Area (DFA) (see Public 
Notice, DA 86-173, 52 FR 1302 (January 12, 1987)) may modify its 
authorization to relocate its authorized base station up to one-half the 
distance over 120 km toward any co-channel licensee's initially 
authorized base station, to a maximum distance of 25 km, so long as the 
base station is relocated no more than 8 km inside of any DFA (i.e., no 
more than 8 km from the nearest DFA boundary line).
    (c) A Phase I non-nationwide licensee that has been granted Special 
Temporary Authority (STA) to operate at an alternative base station 
location may modify its authorization to seek permanent authorization at 
that location, regardless of whether locating the station at the STA 
site is in strict conformance with the provisions of paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section, if the licensee certifies that such a modification 
is in conformance with Sec. Sec. 90.723 and 90.729 and:
    (1) It has constructed its base station and has placed it in 
operation, or commenced service, at the STA site on or before January 
26, 1996; or
    (2) It has taken delivery of its base station transceiver on or 
before January 26, 1996.
    (d) The application for a Phase I non-nationwide licensee proposing 
a base station modification resulting in less than 120 km separation 
from a co-channel licensee's initially authorized base station will be 
accepted by the Commission only with the consent of that co-channel 
licensee, as evidenced in a statement submitted concurrently with the 
licensee's application submission on FCC Form 601.
    (e) The application of a Phase I non-nationwide licensee proposing a 
base station modification resulting in at least a 120 km separation from 
each co-channel licensee's initially authorized base station but more 
than one-half the distance over 120 km toward any co-channel licensee's 
initially authorized base station will be accepted by the Commission 
only with the consent of that co-channel licensee, as evidenced in a 
statement submitted concurrently with the licensee's submission on FCC 
Form 601.

Sec. 90.757  Construction requirements.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a Phase I 
non-nationwide licensee that is granted modification of its 
authorization to relocate its base station must construct its base 
station and place it in operation, or commence service, on all 
authorized channels on or before August 15, 1996, or within 12 months of 
initial grant date, whichever is later. The authorization of a licensee 
that does not construct its base station and place it in operation, or 
commence service, by this date, cancels automatically and must be 
returned to the Commission.
    (b) A Phase I non-nationwide licensee with a base station authorized 
at a location north of Line A must construct its base station and place 
it in operation, or commence service, on all authorized channels within 
12 months of initial grant date, or within 12 months of the date of the 
release of the terms of an agreement between the United States and 
Canadian governments on the sharing of 220-222 MHz spectrum between the

Sec. 90.763  EA, Regional and nationwide system operations.

    (a) A nationwide licensee authorized pursuant to Sec. 90.717(a) may 
construct and operate any number of land mobile or paging base stations, 
or fixed stations, anywhere in the Nation, and transmit on any of its 
authorized channels, provided that the licensee complies with the 
requirements of Sec. 90.733(i).
    (b) An EA or Regional licensee authorized pursuant to Sec. 90.761 
may construct and operate any number of land mobile or paging base 
stations, or fixed stations, anywhere within its authorized EA or REAG, 
and transmit on any of its authorized channels, provided that:
    (1) The licensee affords protection to all authorized co-channel 
Phase I non-nationwide base stations as follows:
    (i) The EA or Regional licensee must locate its land mobile or 
paging base stations, or fixed stations transmitting on base station 
transmit frequencies, at least 120 km from the land mobile or paging 
base stations, or fixed stations transmitting on base station transmit 
frequencies, of co-channel Phase I licensees, except that separations of 
less than 120 km shall be considered on a case-by-case basis upon 
submission by the EA or Regional licensee of:
    (A) A technical analysis demonstrating at least 10 dB protection to 
the predicted 38 dBu service contour of the co-channel Phase I licensee, 
i.e., demonstrating that the predicted 28 dBu interfering contour of the 
EA or Regional licensee's base station or fixed station does not overlap 
the predicted 38 dBu service contour of the co-channel Phase I 
licensee's base station or fixed station; or
    (B) A written letter from the co-channel Phase I licensee consenting 
to a separation of less than 120 km, or to less than 10 dB protection to 
the predicted 38 dBu service contour of the licensee's base station or 
fixed station.
    (ii) The Phase I licensee's predicted 38 dBu service contour 
referred to in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is calculated using 
the F(50,50) field strength chart for Channels 7-13 in Sec. 73.699 
(Fig. 10) of this chapter, with a 9 dB correction factor for antenna 
height differential, and is based on the licensee's authorized effective 
radiated power and antenna height-above-average-terrain. The EA or 
Regional licensee's predicted 28 dBu interfering contour referred to in 
paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is calculated using the F(50,10) 
field strength chart for Channels 7-13 in Sec. 73.699 (Fig. 10a) of 
this chapter, with a 9 dB correction factor for antenna height 
differential.
    (2) The licensee complies with the requirements of Sec. 90.733(i).
    (3) The licensee limits the field strength of its base stations, or 
fixed stations operating on base station transmit frequencies, in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 90.771.
    (4) Upon request by a licensee or the Commission, an EA or regional 
licensee shall furnish the technical parameters, location and 
coordinates of the completion of the addition, removal, relocation or 
modification of any of its facilities within the EA or region. The EA or 
regional licensee must provide such information within ten (10) days of 
receiving written notification.
    (c) In the event that the authorization for a co-channel Phase I 
base station, or fixed station transmitting on base station transmit 
frequencies, within an EA or Regional licensee's border is terminated or 
revoked, the EA or Regional licensee's channel obligations to such 
stations will cease

[[Page 493]]

upon deletion of the facility from the Commission's official licensing 
records, and the EA or Regional licensee then will be able to construct 
and operate without regard to the previous authorization.

requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, as applicable, will 
result in automatic cancellation of its entire EA or Regional license. 
In such instances, EA or Regional licenses will not be converted to 
individual, site-by-site authorizations for already constructed 
stations.
    (d) EA and Regional licensees will not be permitted to count the 
resale of the services of other providers in their EA or REAG, e.g., 
incumbent, Phase I licensees, to meet the construction requirement of 
paragraph (a) of this section, as applicable.
    (e) EA and Regional licensees will not be required to construct and 
place in operation, or commence service on, all of their authorized 
channels at all of their base stations or fixed stations.

<R05>
Sec. 90.812  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 90.813  Partitioned licenses and disaggregated spectrum.

    (a) Eligibility. Parties seeking approval for partitioning and 
disaggregation shall request an authorization for partial assignment of 
a license pursuant to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter.

[[Page 495]]

    (b) Technical standards--(1) Partitioning. In the case of 
partitioning, requests for authorization for partial assignment of a 
license must include, as attachments, a description of the partitioned 
service area and a calculation of the population of the partitioned 
service area and the licensed geographic service area. The partitioned 
service area shall be defined by coordinate points at every 3 degrees 
along the partitioned service area unless an FCC recognized service area 
is utilized (i.e., Major Trading Area, Basic Trading Area, Metropolitan 
Service Area, Rural Service Area or Economic Area) or county lines are 
followed. The geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, 
minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude and 
must be based upon the 1927 North American Datum (NAD27). Applicants may 
supply geographical coordinates based on 1983 North American Datum 
(NAD83) in addition to those required (NAD27). In the case where an FCC 
recognized service area or county lines are utilized, applicants need 
only list the specific area(s) (through use of FCC designations or 
county names) that constitute the partitioned area.
    (2) Disaggregation. Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.
    (3) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. The Commission will 
consider requests for partial assignment of licenses that propose 
combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.
    (c) Installment payments--(1) Apportioning the balance on 
installment payment plans. When a winning bidder elects to pay for its 
license through an installment payment plan pursuant to Sec. 90.812, 
and partitions its licensed area or disaggregates spectrum to another 
party, the outstanding balance owed by the licensee on its installment 
payment plan (including accrued and unpaid interest) shall be 
apportioned between the licensee and partitionee or disaggregatee. Both 
parties will be responsible for paying their proportionate share of the 
outstanding balance to the U.S. Treasury. In the case of partitioning, 
the balance shall be apportioned based upon the ratio of the population 
of the partitioned area to the population of the entire original license 
area calculated based upon the most recent census data. In the case of 
disaggregation, the balance shall be apportioned based upon the ratio of 
the amount of spectrum disaggregated to the amount of spectrum allocated 
to the licensed area.
    (2) Parties not qualified for installment payment plans. (i) The 
partitionee or disaggregatee shall, as a condition of the approval of 
the partial assignment application, pay its entire pro rata amount 
within 30 days of Public Notice conditionally granting the partial 
assignment application. Failure to meet this condition will result in a 
rescission of the grant of the partial assignment application.
    (ii) The licensee shall be permitted to continue to pay its pro rata 
share of the outstanding balance and shall receive new financing 
documents (promissory note, security agreement) with a revised payment 
obligation, based on the remaining amount of time on the original 
installment payment schedule. These financing documents will replace the 
licensee's existing financing documents which shall be marked 
``superseded'' and returned to the licensee upon receipt of the new 
financing documents. The original interest rate, established pursuant to 
Sec. 1.2110(g)(3)(i) of this chapter at the time of the grant of the 
initial license in the market, shall continue to be applied to the 
licensee's portion of the remaining government obligation. The 
Commission will require, as a further condition to approval of the 
partial assignment application, that the licensee execute and return to 
the U.S. Treasury the new financing documents within 30 days of the 
Public Notice conditionally granting the partial assignment application. 
Failure to meet this condition will result in the automatic cancellation 
of the grant of the partial assignment application.
    (iii) A default on the licensee's payment obligation will only 
affect the licensee's portion of the market.
    (3) Parties qualified for installment payment plans. (i) Where both 
parties to a partitioning or disaggregation agreement qualify for 
installment payments, the partitionee or disaggregatee will be

[[Page 496]]

permitted to make installment payments on its portion of the remaining 
government obligation, as calculated according to paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section.
    (ii) Each party will be required, as a condition to approval of the 
partial assignment application, to execute separate financing documents 
(promissory note, security agreement) agreeing to pay their pro rata 
portion of the balance due (including accrued and unpaid interest) based 
upon the installment payment terms for which they qualify under the 
rules. The financing documents must be returned to the U.S. Treasury 
within thirty (30) days of the Public Notice conditionally granting the 
partial assignment application. Failure by either party to meet this 
condition will result in the automatic cancellation of the grant of the 
partial assignment application. The interest rate, established pursuant 
to Sec. 1.2110(g)(3)(i) of this chapter at the time of the grant of the 
initial license in the market, shall continue to be applied to both 
parties' portion of the balance due. Each party will receive a license 
for their portion of the partitioned market or disaggregated spectrum.
    (iii) A default on an obligation will only affect that portion of 
the market area held by the defaulting party.
    (iv) Partitionees and disaggregatees that qualify for installment 
payment plans may elect to pay some of their pro rata portion of the 
balance due in a lump sum payment to the U.S. Treasury and to pay the 
remaining portion of the balance due pursuant to an installment payment 
plan.
    (d) License term. The license term for a partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. 90.665(a).
    (e) Construction requirements--(1) Requirements for partitioning. 
Parties seeking authority to partition must meet one of the following 
construction requirements:
    (i) The partitionee may certify that it will satisfy the applicable 
construction requirements set forth in Sec. 90.665 for the partitioned 
license area; or
    (ii) The original licensee may certify that it has or will meet the 
construction requirements set forth in Sec. 90.665 for the entire 
market. In that case, the partitionee must only meet the requirements 
for renewal of its license for the partitioned license area.
    (iii) Applications requesting partial assignments of license for 
partitioning must include a certification by each geographic area 800 
MHz SMR licenses in the lower 230 channels will be awarded to small 
entities, as that term is defined by the SBA.
    (iv) Partitionees must submit supporting documents showing 
compliance with the respective construction requirements within the 
appropriate time frames set forth in Sec. 90.665.
    (v) Failure by any partitionee to meet its respective performance 
requirements will result in the automatic cancellation of the 
partitioned or disaggregated license without further Commission action.
    (2) Requirements for disaggregation. Parties seeking authority to 
disaggregate must submit with their partial assignment application a 
certification signed by both parties stating which of the parties will 
be responsible for meeting the construction requirements for the market 
as set forth in Sec. 90.665. Parties may agree to share responsibility 
for meeting the construction requirements. Parties that accept 
responsibility for meeting the construction requirements and later fail 
to do so will be subject to license forfeiture without further 
Commission action.

Sec. 90.815  Records maintenance and definitions.

    (a) Records maintenance. All winning bidders qualifying as small 
businesses, shall maintain at their principal place of business an 
updated file of ownership, revenue and asset information, including any 
documents necessary to establish eligibility as a small business, 
pursuant to Sec. 90.814, and/or a consortium of small businesses. 
Licensees (and their successors in interest) shall maintain such files 
for the term of the license.
    (b) Definitions. The term small business used in this section is

<R05>
Sec. 90.816  Criteria for comparative 900 MHz SMR renewal 
proceedings.

    (a) Ultimate issue. The ultimate issue in comparative renewal 
proceedings will be to determine, in light of the evidence adduced in 
the proceeding, what disposition of the applications would best serve 
the public interest, convenience and necessity.
    (b) Renewal expectancies. The most important comparative factor to 
be considered in a comparative 900 MHz SMR renewal proceeding is a major 
preference, commonly referred to as a ``renewal expectancy''.
    (1) The 900 MHz SMR renewal applicant involved in a comparative 
renewal proceeding will receive a renewal expectancy, if its past record 
for the relevant license period demonstrates that:
    (i) The renewal applicant has provided ``substantial'' service 
during its past license term. ``Substantial'' service is defined as 
service which is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of 
mediocre service which just might minimally warrant renewal; and
    (ii) The renewal applicant has substantially complied with 
applicable FCC rules, policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended.
    (2) In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, a 900 
MHz renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding must 
submit a showing explaining why it should receive a renewal expectancy. 
At a minimum, this showing must include:
    (i) A description of its current service in terms of geographic 
coverage and population served;
    (ii) An explanation of its record of expansion, including a 
timetable of the construction of new base sites to meet changes in 
demand for SMR service;
    (iii) A description of its investments in its 900 MHz SMR system; 
and
    (iv) Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated 
the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and a list of any 
pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (3) In making its showing of entitlement to a renewal expectancy, a 
renewal applicant may claim credit for any system modification 
applications that were pending on the date it filed its renewal 
application. Such credit will not be allowed if the modification 
application is dismissed or denied.

Subpart Y_Regulations Governing Licensing and Use of Frequencies in the 
                           4940	4990 MHz Band

    Source: 68 FR 38639, June 30, 2003, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1201  Scope.

    This subpart sets out the regulations governing use of the 4940-4990 
MHz (4.9 GHz) band. It includes eligibility requirements, and specific 
operational and technical standards for stations licensed in this band. 
The rules in this subpart are to be read in conjunction with the 
applicable requirements contained elsewhere in this part; however, in 
case of conflict, the provisions of this subpart shall govern with 
respect to licensing and operation in this band.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1203  Eligibility.

    (a) Entities providing public safety services as defined under 
section 90.523 are eligible to hold a Commission license for systems 
operating in the 4940-4990 MHz band. All of the requirements and 
conditions set forth in that section also govern authorizations in the 
4940-4990 MHz band.
    (b) 4.9 GHz band licensees may enter into sharing agreements or 
other arrangements for use of the spectrum with entities that do not 
meet these eligibility requirements. However, all applications in the 
band are limited to operations in support of public safety.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1205  Permissible operations.

    (a) Unattended and continuous operation is permitted.
    (b) Voice, data and video operations are permitted.
    (c) Aeronautical mobile operations are prohibited.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1207  Licensing.

    (a) A 4940-4990 MHz band license gives the licensee authority to 
operate on any authorized channel in this band within its licensed area 
of operation. See Sec. 90.1213. A 4940-4990 MHz band license will be 
issued for the geographic area encompassing the legal jurisdiction of 
the licensee or, in case of a nongovernmental organization, the legal 
jurisdiction of the state or local governmental entity supporting the 
nongovernmental organization.
    (b) Subject to Sec. 90.1209, a 4940-4990 MHz band license gives the 
licensee authority to construct and operate any number of base stations 
anywhere within the area authorized by the license, except as follows:
    (1) A station is required to be individually licensed if:
    (i) International agreements require coordination;
    (ii) Submission of an environmental assessment is required under 
Sec. 1.1307 of this chapter; or
    (iii) The station would affect areas identified in Sec. 1.924 of 
this chapter.
    (2) Any antenna structure that requires notification to the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) must be registered with the Commission 
prior to construction under Sec. 17.4 of this chapter.
    (c) A 4940-4990 MHz band license gives the licensee authority to 
operate base and mobile units (including portable and handheld units) 
and operate temporary (1 year or less) fixed stations anywhere within 
the area authorized by the license. Such licensees may operate base and 
mobile units and/or temporary fixed stations outside their authorized 
area to assist public safety operations with the permission of the 
jurisdiction in which the radio station is to be operated. Base and 
temporary fixed stations are subject to the requirements of paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (d) Permanent fixed point-to-point and point-to-multipoint stations 
in the 4940-4990 MHz band must be licensed individually on a site-by-
site basis. Such fixed stations that connect 4940-4990 MHz band base and 
mobile stations that are used to deliver broadband service, as well as 
other public safety networks using spectrum designated for broadband 
use, are accorded primary status. Primary status is also accorded to 
stand-alone permanent fixed 4940-4990 MHz band links that are used to 
deliver broadband service. Primary permanent fixed point-to-point and 
point-to-multipoint stations must use directional antennas with gains 
greater than 9 dBi up to 26 dBi. Permanent fixed point-to-point stations 
that do

[[Page 504]]

not meet the criteria for primary status will be authorized only on a 
secondary, non-interference basis to base, mobile, temporary fixed, and 
primary permanent fixed operations.

FR 23803, May 21, 2009]


<R05>
Sec. 90.1209  Policies governing the use of the 4940-4990 MHz band.

    (a) Channels in this band are available on a shared basis only and 
will not be assigned for the exclusive use of any licensee.
    (b) All licensees shall cooperate in the selection and use of 
channels in order to reduce interference and make the most effective use 
of the authorized facilities. Licensees of stations suffering or causing 
harmful interference are expected to cooperate and resolve this problem 
by mutually satisfactory arrangements. If licensees are unable to do so, 
the Commission may impose restrictions including specifying the 
transmitter power, antenna height, or area or hours of operation of the 
stations concerned. Further, the Commission may prohibit the use of any 
4.9 GHz channel under a system license at a given geographical location 
when, in the judgment of the Commission, its use in that location is not 
in the public interest.
    (c) Licensees will make every practical effort to protect radio 
astronomy operations as specified in Sec. 2.106, footnote US311 of this 
chapter.
    (d) There is no time limit for which base and temporary fixed 
stations authorized under a 4940-4990 MHz band license must be placed in 
operation. Fixed point-to-point stations which are licensed on a site-
by-site basis must be placed in operation within 18 months of the grant 
date or the authorization for that station cancels automatically.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1211  Regional plan.

    (a) To facilitate the shared use of the 4.9 GHz band, each region 
may submit a plan on guidelines to be used for sharing the spectrum 
within the region. Any such plan must be submitted to the Commission 
within 12 months of the effective date of the rules.
    (b) Such plans must incorporate the following common elements:
    (1) Identification of the document as a plan for sharing the 4.9 GHz 
band with the region specified along with the names, business addresses, 
business telephone numbers and organizational affiliations of the 
chairperson(s) and all members of the planning committee.
    (2) A summary of the major elements of the plan and an explanation 
of how all eligible entities within the region were given an opportunity 
to participate in the planning process and to have their positions heard 
and considered fairly.
    (3) An explanation of how the plan was coordinated with adjacent 
regions.
    (4) A description of the coordination procedures for both temporary 
fixed and mobile operations, including but not limited to, mechanisms 
for incident management protocols, interference avoidance and 
interoperability.
    (c) Regional plans may be modified by submitting a written request, 
signed by the regional planning committee, to the Chief, Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau. The request must contain the full text of the 
modification, and a certification that all eligible entities had a 
chance to participate in discussions concerning the modification and 
that any changes have been coordinated with adjacent regions.

Sec. 90.1215  Power limits.

    The transmitting power of stations operating in the 4940-4990 MHz 
band must not exceed the maximum limits in this section.
    (a)(1) The maximum conducted output power should not exceed:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) High power devices are also limited to a peak power spectral 
density of 21 dBm per one MHz. High power devices using channel 
bandwidths other than those listed above are permitted; however, they 
are limited to peak power spectral density of 21 dBm/MHz. If 
transmitting antennas of directional gain greater than 9 dBi are used, 
both the maximum conducted output power and the peak power spectral 
density should be reduced by the amount in decibels that the directional 
gain of the antenna exceeds 9 dBi. However, high power point-to-point 
and point-to-multipoint operations (both fixed and temporary-fixed rapid 
deployment) may employ transmitting antennas with directional gain up to 
26 dBi without any corresponding reduction in the maximum conducted 
output power or spectral density. Corresponding reduction in the maximum 
conducted output power and peak power spectral density should be the 
amount in decibels that the directional gain of the antenna exceeds 26 
dBi.
    (b) Low power devices are also limited to a peak power spectral 
density of 8 dBm per one MHz. Low power devices using channel bandwidths 
other than those listed above are permitted; however, they are limited 
to a peak power spectral density of 8 dBm/MHz. If transmitting antennas 
of directional gain greater than 9 dBi are used, both the maximum 
conducted output power and the peak power spectral density should be 
reduced by the amount in decibels that the directional gain of the 
antenna exceeds 9 dBi.
    (c) The maximum conducted output power is measured as a conducted 
emission over any interval of continuous transmission using 
instrumentation calibrated in terms of an RMS-equivalent voltage. If the 
device cannot be connected directly, alternative techniques acceptable 
to the Commission may be used. The measurement results shall be properly 
adjusted for any instrument limitations, such as detector response 
times, limited resolution bandwidth capability when compared to the 
emission bandwidth, sensitivity, etc., so as to obtain a true maximum 
conducted output power measurement conforming to the definitions in this 
paragraph for the emission in question.
    (d) The peak power spectral density is measured as conducted 
emission by direct connection of a calibrated test instrument to the 
equipment under test. If the device cannot be connected directly, 
alternative techniques acceptable to the Commission may be used. 
Measurements are made over a bandwidth of one MHz or the 26 dB emission 
bandwidth of the device, whichever is less. A resolution bandwidth less 
than the measurement bandwidth can be used, provided that the measured 
power is integrated to show total power over the measurement bandwidth. 
If the resolution bandwidth is

[[Page 507]]

approximately equal to the measurement bandwidth, and much less than the 
emission bandwidth of the equipment under test, the measured results 
shall be corrected to account for any difference between the resolution 
bandwidth of the test instrument and its actual noise bandwidth.
    (e) The ratio of the peak excursion of the modulation envelope 
(measured using a peak hold function) to the maximum conducted output 
power shall not exceed 13 dB across any 1 MHz bandwidth or the emission 
bandwidth whichever is less.

     Subpart Z_Wireless Broadband Services in the 3650	3700 MHz Band

    Source: 70 FR 24726, May 11, 2005, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1301  Scope.

    This subpart sets out the regulations governing wireless operations 
in the 3650-3700 MHz band. It includes licensing requirements, and 
specific operational and technical standards for wireless operations in 
this band. The rules in this subpart are to be read in conjunction with 
the applicable requirements contained elsewhere in the Commission's 
rules; however, in case of conflict, the provisions of this subpart 
shall govern with respect to licensing and operation in this band.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1303  Eligibility.

    Any entity, other than those precluded by section 310 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 310, is eligible to 
hold a license under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1305  Permissible operations.

    Use of the 3650-3700 MHz band must be consistent with the 
allocations for this band as set forth in part 2 of the Commission's 
Rules. All stations operating in this band must employ a contention-
based protocol (as defined in Sec. 90.7).


<R05>
Sec. 90.1307  Licensing.

    The 3650-3700 MHz band is licensed on the basis of non-exclusive 
nationwide licenses. Non-exclusive nationwide licenses will serve as a 
prerequisite for registering individual fixed and base stations. A 
licensee cannot operate a fixed or base station before registering it 
under its license and licensees must delete registrations for unused 
fixed and base stations.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1309  Regulatory status.

    Licensees are permitted to provide services on a non-common carrier 
and/or on a common carrier basis. A licensee may render any kind of 
communications service consistent with the regulatory status in its 
license and with the Commission's rules applicable to that service.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1311  License term.

    The license term is ten years, beginning on the date of the initial 
authorization (non-exclusive nationwide license) grant. Registering 
fixed and base stations will not change the overall renewal period of 
the license.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1312  Assignment and transfer.

    Licensees may assign or transfer their non-exclusive nationwide 
licenses, and any fixed or base stations registered under those licenses 
will remain associated with those licenses.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1319  Policies governing the use of the 3650-3700 MHz band.

    (a) Channels in this band are available on a shared basis only and 
will not

[[Page 508]]

be assigned for the exclusive use of any licensee.
    (b) Any base, fixed, or mobile station operating in the band must 
employ a contention-based protocol.
    (c) Equipment incorporating an unrestricted contention-based 
protocol (i.e. one capable of avoiding co-frequency interference with 
devices using all other types of contention-based protocols) may operate 
throughout the 50 megahertz of this frequency band. Equipment 
incorporating a restricted contention-based protocol (i.e. one that does 
not qualify as unrestricted) may operate in, and shall only tune over, 
the lower 25 megahertz of this frequency band.
    (d) All applicants and licensees shall cooperate in the selection 
and use of frequencies in the 3650-3700 MHz band in order to minimize 
the potential for interference and make the most effective use of the 
authorized facilities. A database identifying the locations of 
registered stations will be available at http://wireless.fcc.gov/uls. 
Licensees should examine this database before seeking station 
authorization, and make every effort to ensure that their fixed and base 
stations operate at a location, and with technical parameters, that will 
minimize the potential to cause and receive interference. Licensees of 
stations suffering or causing harmful interference are expected to 
cooperate and resolve this problem by mutually satisfactory 
arrangements.

[72 FR 40722, July 25, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 90.1321  Power and antenna limits.

    (a) Base and fixed stations are limited to 25 watts/25 MHz 
equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP). In any event, the peak 
EIRP power density shall not exceed 1 Watt in any one-megahertz slice of 
spectrum.
    (b) In addition to the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section, 
transmitters operating in the 3650-3700 MHz band that emit multiple 
directional beams, simultaneously or sequentially, for the purpose of 
directing signals to individual receivers or to groups of receivers 
provided the emissions comply with the following:
    (1) Different information must be transmitted to each receiver.
    (2) If the transmitter employs an antenna system that emits multiple 
directional beams but does not emit multiple directional beams 
simultaneously, the total output power conducted to the array or arrays 
that comprise the device, i.e., the sum of the power supplied to all 
antennas, antenna elements, staves, etc. and summed across all carriers 
or frequency channels, shall not exceed the limit specified in paragraph 
(a) of this section, as applicable. The directional antenna gain shall 
be computed as follows:
    (i) The directional gain, in dBi, shall be calculated as the sum of 
10 log (number of array elements or staves) plus the directional gain, 
in dBi, of the individual element or stave having the highest gain.
    (ii) A lower value for the directional gain than that calculated in 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section will be accepted if sufficient 
evidence is presented, e.g., due to shading of the array or coherence 
loss in the beam-forming.
    (3) If a transmitter employs an antenna that operates simultaneously 
on multiple directional beams using the same or different frequency 
channels and if transmitted beams overlap, the power shall be reduced to 
ensure that the aggregate power from the overlapping beams does not 
exceed the limit specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In 
addition, the aggregate power transmitted simultaneously on all beams 
shall not exceed the limit specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
by more than 8 dB.
    (4) Transmitters that emit a single directional beam shall operate 
under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Mobile and portable stations are limited to 1 watt/25 MHz EIRP. 
In any event, the peak EIRP density shall not exceed 40 milliwatts in 
any one-megahertz slice of spectrum.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1323  Emission limits.

    (a) The power of any emission outside a licensee's frequency band(s) 
of operation shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) within 
the licensed band(s) of operation, measured in watts, by at least 43 + 
10 log (P) dB. Compliance with this provision is based

[[Page 509]]

on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution 
bandwidth of 1 MHz or less, but at least one percent of the emission 
bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter, provided the 
measured energy is integrated over a 1 MHz bandwidth.
    (b) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require 
greater attenuation than specified in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1331  Restrictions on the operation of base and fixed stations.

    (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, base 
and fixed stations may not be located within 150 km of any grandfathered 
satellite earth station operating in the 3650-3700 MHz band. The 
coordinates of these stations are available at http://www.fcc.gov/ib/sd/

<R05>
Sec. 90.1407  Spectrum use in the network.

    (a) Spectrum use. The Shared Wireless Broadband Network will operate 
using spectrum associated with the Upper 700 MHz D Block license in the 
758-763 MHz and 788-793 MHz bands and the Public Safety Broadband 
License in the adjacent 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands.
    (b) Access to spectrum in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands. The 
Public Safety Broadband Licensee which holds the Public Safety Broadband 
License, pursuant to part 90 rules, must lease the spectrum rights 
associated with this license, pursuant to a spectrum manager leasing 
arrangement set forth in part 1 subpart X, to the Upper 700 MHz D Block 
licensee and the Operating Company for the entire remaining term of the 
Public Safety Broadband License to effectuate the 700 MHz Public/Private 
Partnership. The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee and the Operating 
Company, are the only entities that are eligible to lease the spectrum 
usage rights associated with the Public Safety Broadband License to 
operate on the 763-768 and 793-798 MHz bands. If the Upper 700 MHz D 
Block license is cancelled, this spectrum leasing arrangement will 
automatically terminate.
    (c) Commercial operations in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands. 
Commercial operations in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands through 
the spectrum manager leasing arrangement shall not cause harmful 
interference to primary users (i.e., public safety users) and cannot 
claim protection from harmful interference from the primary public 
safety operations in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands. The network 
providing commercial operations in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands 
through the spectrum manager leasing arrangement must be designed to 
automatically assign priority to public safety users, to the exclusion 
and/or immediate preemption of any commercial use on a dynamic, real-
time priority basis, and to guarantee that public safety users suffer no 
harmful interference or interruption or degradation of service due to 
commercial operations in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands.
    (d) Public Safety Broadband Network Operators must use at least 3GPP 
TS 23.401, V8.8.0 (2009-12), ``3rd Generation Partnership Project; 
Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects; General 
Packet Radio Service (GPRS) enhancements for Evolved Universal 
Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) access (Release 8),''

[72 FR 48863, Aug. 24, 2007, as amended at 74 FR 8879, Feb. 27, 2009]


<R05>
Sec. 90.1415  Establishment, execution, and application of the 
network sharing agreement.

    The following requirements and processes relate to the 
establishment, execution, and application of the NSA:
    (a) Approval of NSA as pre-condition for granting the Upper 700 MHz 
D Block License. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee must negotiate an 
NSA and such other agreements as the Commission may require or allow 
with the winning bidder for the Upper 700 MHz D Block license. The NSA 
and related agreements or documents must be approved by the Commission 
and then executed by the relevant parties. Parties to the NSA must also 
include the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee, the Network Assets Holder, 
and the Operating Company, as these entities are defined in Sec. 90.7.
    (b) Requirement of negotiation. Negotiation of an NSA between the 
winning bidder for the Upper 700 MHz D Block license and the Public 
Safety Broadband Licensee must commence by the date the winning bidder 
files its long form application or the date on which the Commission 
designates the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, whichever is later, and 
must conclude within six months of that date. Parties to this 
negotiation are required to negotiate in good faith. Two members of the 
Commission staff, one from the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and 
one from the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, shall be 
present at all stages of the negotiation as neutral observers.
    (c) Reporting requirements. Beginning three months from the 
triggering of the six-month negotiation period, the Public Safety 
Broadband Licensee and the winning bidder for the Upper 700 MHz D Block 
license must jointly provide detailed reports, on a monthly basis and 
subject to a request for confidential treatment, on the progress of the 
negotiations throughout the remainder of the negotiations. These reports 
must include descriptions of all

[[Page 514]]

material issues that the parties have yet to resolve.
    (d) Submission of final agreement. As soon as the parties have 
reached an agreement on all the terms of the NSA, related agreements or 
documents, and such other agreements as the Commission may require or 
allow but not later than five business days after the six-month period 
for negotiation has expired, they must submit the NSA together with all 
agreements and related documents referenced in the NSA, for review and 
approval by the full Commission. The Commission will act on the NSA 
within 60 days of receipt. The Commission may approve the NSA in its 
entirety, approve with modifications, or require the parties to address 
additional terms or re-draft existing terms within a specified 
timeframe. After the NSA is approved, the parties must execute the NSA 
and such other agreements as the Commission may require or allow and 
submit executed copies to the Commission within 10 business days of 
approval.
    (e) Submission of disputed issues. If the parties have not reached 
agreement on all terms of the NSA and related agreements by the end of 
the six-month period, they must notify the Commission not later than 
five business days after the expiration of the six-month period of the 
terms on which they have agreed, the nature of the remaining issues, 
each party's position on each issue, whether additional negotiation is 
likely to produce an agreement, and, if so, a proposed deadline for 
reaching agreement on the NSA. Authority is delegated jointly to the 
Chiefs of the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and the Public Safety 
and Homeland Security Bureau to resolve any remaining disputes.
    (f) Resolution of disputes. Actions to resolve disputes may include, 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Granting additional time for negotiation;
    (2) Issuing a decision on the disputed issues and requiring the 
submission of a draft agreement consistent with the decision;
    (3) Directing the parties to further brief the remaining issues in 
full for immediate Commission decision; and/or
    (4) Immediate denial of the long-form application filed by the 
winning bidder for the Upper 700 MHz D Block license.
    (g) Default by winning bidder for Upper 700 MHz D Block license. If 
the winning bidder for the Upper 700 MHz D Block fails to comply with 
negotiation or dispute resolution requirements or fails to execute a 
Commission-approved NSA, its long form application will be denied. If 
the long form application of the winning bidder of the Upper 700 MHz D 
Block license is denied for any reason, including as a consequence of an 
action taken pursuant to paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, it will 
be deemed to have defaulted under Sec. 1.2109(c) of this chapter and 
will be liable for the default payment specified in Sec. 1.2104(g) of 
this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1420  Failure to comply with the NSA or the Commission's 
rules.

    (a) Failure to comply with the Commission's rules or the terms of 
the NSA may warrant cancelling the Public Safety Broadband License. The 
potential remedies also include, but are not limited to, assigning the 
license to another entity, directing the Public Safety Broadband 
Licensee to transfer the assignable right to purchase the assets at fair 
market value, ordering specific performance, or ordering removal and 
replacement of individual officers, directors or member organizations of 
the Public Safety Broadband Licensee.
    (b) If the Commission cancels or terminates the Upper 700 MHz D 
Block license, a fair market valuation of the shared wireless broadband 
network assets shall be performed immediately, pursuant to the fair 
market valuation methodology set forth in the NSA. In the event that the 
Upper 700 MHz D Block license is awarded to a new entity, the Public 
Safety Broadband Licensee's option to purchase the network and all 
network assets if and whenever the Upper 700 MHz D Block license is 
cancelled or terminated and its right of first refusal to purchase the 
network assets if and whenever such assets are otherwise to be sold 
shall be assigned to the new Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee and the new 
Network Assets Holder.

<R05>
Sec. 90.1425  Resolution of disputes after grant of the upper
700 MHz D block license.

    (a) The Public Safety Broadband Licensee, the Operating Company, the 
Network Assets Holder, and the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee may at any 
time bring a complaint to the Commission based on a claim that another 
party to the NSA has deviated from the terms of the NSA, or a petition 
for a declaratory ruling to resolve the proper interpretation of an NSA 
term or provision. The Commission also may at any time, on its own 
motion, determine to address any material breach or interpret any NSA 
term or provision.
    (b) The Commission shall have primary responsibility and 
jurisdiction for adjudicating disputes that arise following execution of 
the NSA. The Commission may, however, require the parties to first seek 
a settlement to the dispute or authorize the parties to resolve the 
dispute through litigation or other means. Breach of license terms, the 
NSA, or the Commission's rules may result in cancellation of the Public 
Safety Broadband License, the Upper 700 MHz D Block license, or both.
    (c) The Chiefs of the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau and 
the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau are delegated joint 
responsibility for adjudicating disputes.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1430  Local public safety build-out and operation.

    (a) The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee and the Operating Company 
through its lease arrangements shall, except in the two limited 
circumstances set forth herein, have the exclusive right to build and 
operate the Shared Wireless Broadband Network.
    (b) Rights to early build-out in areas with a build-out commitment. 
In an area where the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee has committed, in 
the NSA, to build out by a certain date, a public safety entity may, 
with the pre-approval of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and 
subject to the requirements set forth herein, construct a broadband 
network in that area at its own expense so long as the network is 
capable of operating on the Shared Wireless Broadband Network and meets 
all the requirements and specifications of the network required under 
the NSA.
    (1) Options for early build-out in areas with a build-out 
commitment. In order to obtain authorization to construct a broadband 
network as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the requesting 
public safety entity must agree to one of the following:
    (i) To, on its own, or through the Public Safety Broadband Licensee 
acting on its behalf, construct the network at its own expense, and upon 
completion of construction, transfer the network to the Upper 700 MHz D 
Block licensee, which shall then integrate that network into the Shared 
Wireless Broadband Network constructed pursuant to the NSA; or
    (ii) To, in agreement with the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee, 
provide all funds necessary for the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee to 
complete the early construction of the network, including any and all 
additional resource and personnel costs, allowing the Upper 700 MHz D 
Block licensee at all times to own, operate, and manage the network as 
an integrated part of the Shared Wireless Broadband Network.
    (2) Negotiation of amendment to NSA. Under either early build out 
option set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Public Safety 
Broadband Licensee, the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee, and the public 
safety entity must, prior to any construction, negotiate an amendment to 
the NSA regarding this part of the network, specifying ownership rights, 
fees, and other terms, which may be distinct from the analogous terms 
governing the Shared Wireless Broadband Network, and such amendment must 
be approved by the Commission.
    (i) Such amendment must provide the terms under which the Upper 700 
MHz D Block licensee shall receive full ownership rights and shall 
compensate the public safety entity (or the Public Safety Broadband 
Licensee, where appropriate) for the construction of the network; and 
shall, absent agreement to the contrary, provide for such transfer and 
compensation to occur prior to the scheduled build out date for such 
network in the NSA.

[[Page 516]]

    (ii) Any right to compensation from the Upper 700 MHz D Block 
licensee related to such early build-out shall be limited to the cost 
that would have been incurred had the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee 
constructed the network itself in accordance with the original terms and 
specifications of the NSA, as reasonably determined by the parties and 
negotiated as part of the required NSA amendment required in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section. Such costs shall not include costs attributable 
solely to advancing the date of construction or otherwise expediting the 
construction process.
    (3) Operations. The public safety entity may not commence operations 
on the network until ownership of the network has been transferred to 
the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee. Further, no operations shall be 
allowed except those authorized and conducted pursuant to the authority 
of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee.
    (4) Attribution of early build-out to national benchmarks. Upon 
completion of construction, transfer of ownership to the Upper 700 MHz D 
Block licensee, and compensation as required herein, if applicable, the 
Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee may include the network constructed 
pursuant to the early build-out provisions herein for purposes of 
determining whether it has met its national build-out benchmarks and the 
build-out requirements of the NSA.
    (5) Rights to build out and operate in areas without a build-out 
commitment. In areas for which the NSA does not require the Upper 700 
MHz D Block licensee to build out the Shared Wireless Broadband Network, 
a public safety entity may build out and operate a separate, exclusive 
network in the 700 MHz public safety broadband spectrum at any time, 
provided the public safety entity has received the written approval of 
the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and operates its independent 
network pursuant to a spectrum leasing arrangement into which the public 
safety entity has entered with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee.
    (i) Such leasing arrangement shall not require the approval or 
consent of the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee; however, the Public 
Safety Broadband Licensee must provide the Upper 700 MHz D Block 
licensee with notice of the public safety entity's intent to construct 
in that area within 30 days of receipt of a request from a public safety 
entity seeking to exercise this option, and shall inform the Upper 700 
MHz D Block licensee of the public safety entity's anticipated build-out 
date(s).
    (ii) Should the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee, within 30 calendar 
days from receipt of notice of the public safety entity's intent to 
construct in that area, certify in writing to the Public Safety 
Broadband Licensee that it will build out the shared network in the area 
within a reasonable time of the anticipated build-out date(s), as 
determined by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, the Public Safety 
Broadband Licensee shall not allow the public safety entity to build and 
operate its own separate exclusive network in that area, provided that 
the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee and the Public Safety Broadband 
Licensee execute an amendment to the NSA indicating the Upper 700 MHz D 
Block licensee's commitment to build the network in that area. Such 
commitment shall become enforceable against the Upper 700 MHz D Block 
licensee as part of its overall build-out requirements.
    (iii) If the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee does not exercise its 
option to commit to build out the network in the requested area within 
30 calendar days of receipt of notice of the public safety entity's 
intent to construct in such area, the Public Safety Broadband Licensee 
and the public safety entity may proceed with a spectrum leasing 
arrangement, which must be filed with and approved by the Commission 
prior to the public safety entity commencing any operations. The 
spectrum leasing arrangement must take the form of a spectrum manager 
leasing arrangement under the rules specified in Sec. 1.9020 of this 
chapter, and incorporate the following conditions:
    (A) The network must provide broadband operations;
    (B) The network must be fully interoperable with the Shared Wireless 
Broadband Network;
    (C) The network must be available for use by any public safety 
entity in the area;

[[Page 517]]

    (D) The network must satisfy any other terms or conditions required 
by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee; and
    (E) The public safety entity must construct and place into operation 
its network within one year of the effective date of the spectrum 
manager leasing arrangement. If the public safety entity fails to place 
the network into operation within one year, the Public Safety Broadband 
Licensee shall terminate the spectrum leasing arrangement pursuant to 
Sec. 1.9020(h)(3) of this chapter. The public safety entity may also 
seek extended implementation authority from the Commission pursuant to 
the requirements of Sec. 90.629.
    (6) Except as set forth herein, the separate network is not required 
to meet the other specifications of the Shared Wireless Broadband 
Network. Absent agreement of the public safety entity, the Public Safety 
Broadband Licensee, and the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee, the separate 
network may not operate using any spectrum associated with the Upper 700 
MHz D Block license.
    (7) The Public Safety Broadband Licensee must file with the 
Commission any spectrum manager leasing arrangement as specified in 
Sec. 1.9020(e) of this chapter; such filing shall identify the public 
safety entity leasing the spectrum, the particular areas of spectrum 
leased as part of this build-out option, and the specific network 
infrastructure and equipment deployed on such leased spectrum.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1432  Conditions for waiver to allow limited and temporary 
wideband operations in the 700 MHz public safety spectrum.

    (a) Wideband operations in the 700 MHz Public Safety spectrum. 
Wideband operations are prohibited in the public safety allocation of 
the 700 MHz band public safety spectrum except where the Commission has 
granted a waiver pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1.3 and 1.925 of this chapter 
and subject to the additional conditions and requirements specified in 
this section. Grants of waiver are restricted to the deployment of a 
wideband system in the consolidated narrowband portion or the internal 
public safety guard band portion of the public safety broadband 
spectrum. Where spectrum in the narrowband segment or internal guard 
band segment is unavailable for wideband operations, public safety 
entities may request a waiver to operate in the upper 1.25 megahertz of 
the public safety broadband spectrum.
    (b) Any public safety entity seeking to conduct wideband operations 
within the public safety allocation must file a request for waiver that 
is accompanied by an application for authorization and includes the 
following information:
    (1) A letter from the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, confirming 
that the proposed wideband deployment is not inconsistent with the 
broadband deployment plan for the affected or adjacent service areas; 
and
    (2) A description of the conditions or transition requirements, if 
any, agreed to between the applicant and the Public Safety Broadband 
Licensee.
    (c) Additional requirement for wideband operations in the narrowband 
segment and Internal Guard Band. If an applicant seeks permission to 
deploy wideband systems in the narrowband segment, its waiver request 
must also include a letter from the appropriate regional planning 
committee or state licensee confirming that the proposed wideband 
deployment will not disrupt any regional or state planning efforts that 
are underway.
    (d) Additional requirements and conditions for wideband operations 
in the broadband segment. Permission to conduct wideband operations in 
the broadband segment will be granted only where spectrum in the 
narrowband segment or the internal guard band is unavailable for 
wideband operations. In no event will permission be granted to conduct 
wideband operations in geographic areas scheduled for broadband 
deployment within the first three years of the build-out plan for the 
Shared Wireless Broadband Network.
    (1) An applicant seeking permission to deploy wideband systems in 
the broadband segment must have first issued a request for proposal 
(RFP) that permitted interested parties to submit broadband proposals 
that are technically consistent with the Shared Wireless Broadband 
Network.

[[Page 518]]

    (2) A request for waiver that seeks permission to deploy wideband 
systems in the broadband segment must include the following information:
    (i) A substantially supported, detailed technical showing 
demonstrating that insufficient spectrum in the narrowband segment or 
the internal guard band is available to support the desired wideband 
operations;
    (ii) A showing that rejected responses to the required broadband 
network RFP were more costly, provided less coverage as measured by 
throughput at the network edge, or were otherwise inferior to the 
accepted wideband proposal; and
    (iii) A detailed plan for integration of such wideband system into 
the Shared Wireless Broadband Network. This plan must specify how and by 
what date the wideband applicant will integrate its proposed wideband 
system into Shared Wireless Broadband Network and must include a 
certification that the public safety entity will not seek reimbursement 
for any costs involved in converting the wideband system to Shared 
Wireless Broadband Network upon completion of that network in the 
applicant's geographic area.
    (3) Authority to conduct wideband operations in the broadband 
segment of the public safety spectrum will be subject to the following 
conditions:
    (i) All devices operating on the wideband system must be designed to 
interoperate with Shared Wireless Broadband Network;
    (ii) All waivers will expire automatically upon the Upper 700 MHz D 
Block licensee's initiation of service in the service area covered by 
such waiver.
    (e) Secondary status of wideband operations. All wideband operations 
permitted under this section shall be secondary to the authorized 
narrowband or broadband applications, as applicable.
    (f) License terms for wideband operations. Any secondary license to 
conduct wideband operations in the public safety spectrum shall have a 
term of no more than five years.
    (g) Renewal of wideband authorization. Any request for renewal of an 
initial authorization to conduct wideband operations shall be filed not 
less than 180 days prior to expiration of the license. All renewal 
requests must include a showing that continued operation of the wideband 
system is in the public interest and must be accompanied by a letter 
from the Public Safety Broadband Licensee confirming that continuing 
wideband operations are not inconsistent with the broadband deployment 
plan for the affected or adjacent service areas. The license term for 
any renewal of a license granted under the waiver provisions herein 
shall not exceed three years. No more than one license renewal will be 
granted.
    (h) Grandfathered wideband STA operations. Upon request, the Public 
Safety and Homeland Security Bureau may grant a public safety entity 
that has constructed, deployed, and was operating a wideband system as 
of July 31, 2007 pursuant to STA to extend the STA grant for periods of 
no more than 180 days until, but not later than, six months following 
the selection of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1435  Prohibition on discontinuance of public safety operations.

    The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee, the Operating Company, and the 
Network Assets Holder are prohibited from discontinuing or degrading the 
broadband network service provided to the Public Safety Broadband 
Licensee or to public safety entities unless either at the request of 
the entity or entities in question or it has first obtained the approval 
of the Commission. The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee shall notify the 
affected public safety entity or entities and the Public Safety 
Broadband Licensee at least 30 days prior to any unrequested 
discontinuance or degradation of network service.


<R05>
Sec. 90.1440  Reporting obligations.

    (a) The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee and the Public Safety 
Broadband Licensee shall jointly file quarterly reports with the 
Commission. These reports shall include audited financial statements, 
how the specific requirements of public safety are being met, detailed 
information on the areas where broadband service has been deployed, 
which public safety entities are using the broadband network in each 
area of operation, what types of

[[Page 519]]

applications are in use in each area of operation, and the number of 
declared emergencies in each area of operation.
    (b) The Public Safety Broadband Licensee and the Upper 700 MHz D 
Block licensee have joint responsibility to register the base station 
locations with the Commission, providing basic technical information, 
including geographic location.

Sec. 95.194  (FRS Rule 4) FRS units.

    (a) You may only use an FCC certified FRS unit. (You can identify an 
FCC certified FRS unit by the label placed on it by the manufacturer.)
    (b) You must not make, or have made, any internal modification to an 
FRS unit. Any internal modification cancels the FCC certification and 
voids your authority to operate the unit in the FRS.
    (c) You may not attach any antenna, power amplifier, or other 
apparatus to an FRS unit that has not been FCC certified as part of that 
FRS unit. There are no exceptions to this rule and attaching any such 
apparatus to a FRS unit cancels the FCC certification and voids 
everyone's authority to operate the unit in the FRS.
    (d) FRS units are prohibited from transmitting data in store-and-
forward packet operation mode.

from interference caused by the operation of industrial, scientific of 
medical devices. Such stations also operate on a shared basis with other 
stations in the Personal Radio Services.
    (g) Stations in the 72-76 MHz range are subject to the condition 
that inteference will not be caused to the remote control of industrial 
equipment operating on the same or adjacent frequencies or to the 
reception of television transmissions on Channels 4 and 5. These 
frequencies are not afforded any protection from interference due to the 
operation of fixed and mobile stations in other services assigned to the 
same or adjacent frequencies.

<R05>
Sec. 95.208  (R/C Rule 8) How high may I put my antenna?

    (a) Antenna means the radiating system (for transmitting, receiving 
or both) and the structure holding it up (tower, pole or mast). It also 
means everything else attached to the radiating system and the 
structure.
    (b) If your antenna is mounted on a hand-held portable unit, none of 
the following limitations apply.
    (c) If your antenna is installed at a fixed location, it (whether 
receiving, transmitting or both) must comply with either one of the 
following:
    (1) The highest point must not be more than 6.10 meters (20 feet) 
higher than the highest point of the building or tree on which it is 
mounted; or
    (2) The highest point must not be more than 18.3 meters (60 feet) 
above the ground.
    (d) If your R/C station is located near an airport, and if you 
antenna structure is more than 6.1 meters (20 feet) high, your may have 
to obey additional restrictions. The highest point of your antenna must 
not exceed one meter above the airport elevation for every hundred 
meters of distance from the nearest point of the nearest airport runway. 
Differences in ground elevation between your antenna and the airport 
runway may complicate this formula. If your R/C station is near an 
airport, you may contact the nearest FCC field office for a worksheet to 
help you figure the maximum allowable height of your antenna. Consult 
part 17 of the FCC's Rules for more information.

    Warning: Installation and removal of R/C station antennas near 
powerlines is dangerous. For your safety, follow the installation 
directions included with your antenna.

<R05>
Sec. 95.209  (R/C Rule 9) What equipment may I use at my R/C station?

    (a) Your R/C station may transmit only with:
    (1) An FCC certificated R/C transmitter (certificated means the FCC 
has determined that certain radio equipment is capable of meeting 
recommended standards for operation); or
    (2) A non-certificated R/C transmitter on Channels 26.995-27.255 MHz 
if it complies with the technical standards (see part 95, subpart E).
    (3) Use of a transmitter outside of the band 26.955-27.255 MHz which 
is not certificated voids your authority to operate the station. Use of 
a transmitter in the band 26.995-27.255 MHz which does not comply with 
the technical standards voids your authority to operate the station.
    (b) You may examine a list of certificated transmitters at any FCC 
field office.
    (c) Your R/C station may transmit with a transmitter assembled from 
a kit.
    (d) You must not make, or have made, any internal modification to a 
certificated transmitter. (See R/C Rule

[[Page 533]]

22.) Any internal modification to a certificated transmitter cancels the 
certification, and use of such a transmitter voids your authority to 
operate the station.

                          Channel                              (carrier
                                                                power)
                                                               (watts)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
27.255 MHz.................................................          25
26.995-27.195 MHz..........................................           4
72-76 MHz..................................................        0.75
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Use of a transmitter which has power output in excess of that 
authorized voids your authority to operate the station.


<R05>
Sec. 95.211  (R/C Rule 11) What communications may be transmitted?

    (a) You may only use your R/C station to transmit one-way 
communications. (One-way communications are transmissions which are not 
intended to establish communications with another station.)
    (b) You may only use your R/C station for the following purposes:
    (1) The operator turns on and/or off a device at a remote location 
(Refer to Diagram 1); or
    (2) A sensor at a remote location turns on and/off an indicating 
device for the operator. (Refer to Diagram 2). Only Channels 26.995 to 
27.255 MHz (see R/C Rule 7, Sec. 95.207(a)(1)) may be used for this 
purpose. (A remote location means a place distant from the operator.)

57 FR 40343, Sept. 3, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 95.212  (R/C Rule 12) What communications are prohibited?

    You must not use an R/C station--
    (a) In connection with any activity which is against federal, state 
or local law;
    (b) To transmit any message other than for operation of devices at 
remote locations (no voice, telegraphy, etc.);
    (c) To intentionally interfere with another station's transmissions;
    (d) To operate another R/C transmitter by remote control (See R/C 
Rule 17, Sec. 95.217); or
    (e) To transmit two-way communications.
    (f) To transmit data. Tone or other signal encoding, however, is not 
considered to be data when only used either for the purpose of 
identifying the specific device among multiple devices that the operator 
intends to turn on/off, or the specific sensor among multiple sensors 
intended to turn on/off indicating device for the operator.

Sec. 95.213  (R/C Rule 13) May I be paid to use my R/C station?

    (a) You may not accept direct or indirect payment for transmitting 
with an R/C station.
    (b) You may use an R/C station to help you provide a service, and be 
paid for that service, as long as you are paid only for the service and 
not for the actual use of the R/C station.


<R05>
Sec. 95.214  (R/C Rule 14) Who is responsible for R/C communications I make?

    You are responsible for all communications which are made by you 
from an R/C station.


<R05>
Sec. 95.215  (R/C Rule 15) Do I have to limit the length of my communications?

    (a) You must limit your R/C communications to the minimum practical 
time.
    (b) The only time your R/C communications may be a continuous signal 
for more than 3 minutes is when operation of the device requires at 
least one or more changes during each minute of the communications.
    (c) Your R/C station may transmit a continuous signal without 
modulation only if:
    (1) You are using it to operate a model aircraft device; and
    (2) The presence or absence of the signal operates the device.
    (d) If you show that you need a continuous signal to insure the 
immediate safety of life of property, the FCC may make an exception to 
the limitations in this rule.


<R05>
Sec. 95.216  (R/C Rule 16) Do I identify my R/C communications?

    You need not identify your R/C communications.


<R05>
Sec. 95.217  (R/C Rule 17) May I operate my R/C station transmitter
by remote control?

    (a) You may not operate an R/C transmitter by radio remote control. 
(See R/C Rule 12, Sec. 95.212.)
    (b) You may operate an R/C transmitter by wireline remote control if 
you obtain specific approval in writing from the FCC. To obtain FCC 
approval, you must show why you need to operate your station by wireline 
remote control. If you receive FCC approval, you must keep the approval 
as part of your station records. See R/C Rule 24, Sec. 95.224.
    (c) Remote control means operation of an R/C transmitter from any 
place other than the location of the R/C transmitter. Direct mechanical 
control or direct electrical control by wire from some point on the same 
premises, craft or vehicles as the R/C transmitter is not considered 
remote control.

Sec. 95.408  (CB Rule 8) How high may I put my antenna?

    (a) Antenna means the radiating system (for transmitting, receiving 
or both) and the structure holding it up (tower, pole or mast). It also 
means everything else attached to the radiating system and the 
structure.
    (b) If your antenna is mounted on a hand-held portable unit, none of 
the following limitations apply.
    (c) If your antenna is installed at a fixed location, it (whether 
receiving, transmitting or both) must comply with either one of the 
following:
    (1) The highest point must not be more than 6.10 meters (20 feet) 
higher than the highest point of the building or tree on which it is 
mounted; or
    (2) The highest point must not be more than 18.3 meters (60 feet) 
above the ground.
    (d) If your CB station is located near an airport, and if you 
antenna structure is more than 6.1 meters (20 feet) high, you may have 
to obey additional restrictions. The highest point of your antenna must 
not exceed one meter above the airport elevation for every hundred 
meters of distance from the nearest point of the nearest airport runway. 
Differences in ground elevation between your antenna and the airport 
runway may complicate this formula. If your CB station is near an 
airport, you may contact the nearest FCC field office for a worksheet to 
help you figure the maximum allowable height of your antenna. Consult 
part 17 of the FCC's Rules for more information.

    Warning: Installation and removal of CB station antennas near 
powerlines is dangerous. For your safety, follow the installation 
directions included with your antenna.

<R05>
Sec. 95.409  (CB Rule 9) What equipment may I use at my CB station?

    (a) You must use an FCC certificated CB transmitter at your CB 
station. You can identify an FCC certificated transmitter by the 
certification label placed on it by the manufacturer. You may examine a 
list of certificated equipment at any FCC Field Office or at FCC 
Headquarters. Use of a transmitter which is not FCC certificated voids 
your authority to operate the station.
    (b) You must not make, or have made, any internal modification to a 
certificated CB transmitter. (See CB Rule 25, Sec. 95.425). Any 
internal modification to a certificated CB transmitter cancels the 
certification, and use of such a transmitter voids your authority to 
operate the station.

    (b) If you need more information about the power rule, see the 
technical rules in subpart E of part 95.
    (c) Use of a transmitter which has carrier or peak envelope power in 
excess of that authorized voids your authority to operate the station.


<R05>
Sec. 95.411  (CB Rule 11) May I use power amplifiers?

    (a) You may not attach the following items (power amplifiers) to 
your certificated CB transmitter in any way:
    (1) External radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (sometimes called 
linears or linear amplifiers); or
    (2) Any other devices which, when used with a radio transmitter as a 
signal source, are capable of amplifying the signal.
    (b) There are no exceptions to this rule and use of a power 
amplifier voids your authority to operate the station.
    (c) The FCC will presume you have used a linear or other external RF 
power amplifier if--
    (1) It is in your possession or on your premises; and
    (2) There is other evidence that you have operated your CB station 
with more power than allowed by CB Rule 10, Sec. 95.410.
    (d) Paragraph (c) of this section does not apply if you hold a 
license in another radio service which allows you to operate an external 
RF power amplifier.

the signal is used to make contact or to continue communications. 
(Examples of circuits using these signals are tone operated squelch and 
selective calling circuits.) If the signal is an audible tone, it must 
last no longer than 15 seconds at one time. If the signal is a 
subaudible tone, it may be transmitted continuously only as long as you 
are talking.
    (c) You may use your CB station to transmit one-way communications 
(messages which are not intended to establish communications between two 
or more particular CB stations) only for emergency communications, 
traveler assistance, brief tests (radio checks) or voice paging.

Sec. 95.627  MedRadio transmitters in the 401-406 MHz band.

    The following provisions apply only to MedRadio transmitters 
operating in the 401-406 MHz band.
    (a) Frequency monitoring. Except as provided in (b) of this section, 
all MedRadio programmer/control transmitters operating in the 401-406 
MHz band must operate under the control of a monitoring system that 
incorporates a mechanism for monitoring the channel or channels that the 
MedRadio system devices intend to occupy. The monitoring system antenna 
shall be the antenna normally used by the programmer/control transmitter 
for a communications session. Before the

[[Page 547]]

monitoring system of a MedRadio programmer/control transmitter initiates 
a MedRadio communications session, the following access criteria must be 
met:
    (1) The monitoring system bandwidth measured at its 20 dB down 
points must be equal to or greater than the emission bandwidth of the 
intended transmission.
    (2) Within 5 seconds prior to initiating a communications session, 
circuitry associated with a MedRadio programmer/control transmitter must 
monitor the channel or channels the system devices intend to occupy for 
a minimum of 10 milliseconds per channel.
    (3) Based on use of an isotropic monitoring system antenna, the 
monitoring threshold power level must not be more than 10logB(Hz) -150 
(dBm/Hz) + G(dBi), where B is the emission bandwidth of the MedRadio 
communications session transmitter having the widest emission and G is 
the MedRadio programmer/control transmitter monitoring system antenna 
gain relative to an isotropic antenna. For purposes of showing 
compliance with the above provision, the above calculated threshold 
power level must be increased or decreased by an amount equal to the 
monitoring system antenna gain above or below the gain of an isotropic 
antenna, respectively.
    (4) If no signal in a MedRadio channel above the monitoring 
threshold power level is detected, the MedRadio programmer/control 
transmitter may initiate a MedRadio-communications session involving 
transmissions to and from a medical implant or medical body-worn device 
on that channel. The MedRadio communications session may continue as 
long as any silent period between consecutive data transmission bursts 
does not exceed 5 seconds. If a channel meeting the criteria in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section is unavailable, MedRadio transmitters 
that are capable of operating on multiple channels may transmit on the 
alternate channel accessible by the device with the lowest monitored 
ambient power level. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, MedRadio transmitters that operate on a single channel and thus 
do not have the capability of operating on alternate channels may not 
transmit unless no signal on the single channel of operation exceeds the 
monitoring threshold power level.
    (5) When a channel is selected prior to a MedRadio communications 
session, it is permissible to select an alternate channel for use if 
communications are interrupted, provided that the alternate channel 
selected is the next best choice using the above criteria. The alternate 
channel may be accessed in the event a communications session is 
interrupted by interference. The following criteria must be met:
    (i) Before transmitting on the alternate channel, the channel must 
be monitored for a period of at least 10 milliseconds.
    (ii) The detected power level during this 10 millisecond or greater

Sec. 95.633  Emission bandwidth.

    (a) The authorized bandwidth (maximum permissible bandwidth of a 
transmission) for emission type H1D, J1D, R1D, H3E, J3E or R3E is 4 kHz. 
The authorized bandwidth for emission type A1D or A3E is 8 kHz. The 
authorized bandwidth for emission type F1D, G1D, F3E or G3E is 20 kHz.
    (b) The authorized bandwidth for any emission type transmitted by an 
R/C transmitter is 8 kHz.
    (c) The authorized bandwidth for emission type F3E or F2D 
transmitted by a FRS unit is 12.5 kHz.
    (d) For transmitters in the LPRS:
    (1) The authorized bandwidth for narrowband frequencies is 4 kHz and 
the channel bandwidth is 5 kHz
    (2) The channel bandwidth for standard band frequencies is 25 kHz.
    (3) The channel bandwidth for extra band frequencies is 50 kHz.
    (4) AMTS stations may use the 216.750-217.000 MHz band as a single 
250 kHz channel so long as the signal is attenuated as specified in 
Sec. 95.635(c).
    (e) For transmitters in the MedRadio Service:
    (1) For stations operating in 402-405 MHz, the maximum authorized 
emission bandwidth is 300 kHz. For stations operating in 401-401.85 MHz

For stations operating in 401.85-402 MHz, the maximum authorized 
emission bandwidth is 150 kHz. For stations operating in 413-419 MHz, 
426-432 MHz, 438-444 MHz, or 451-457 MHz, the maximum authorized 
emission bandwidth is 6 megahertz.
    (2) Lesser emission bandwidths may be employed, provided that the 
unwanted emissions are attenuated as provided in Sec. 95.635. See 
Sec. Sec. 95.627(g), Sec. 95.628(h), and 95.639(f) regarding maximum 
transmitter power and measurement procedures.
    (3) Emission bandwidth will be determined by measuring the width of 
the signal between points, one below the carrier center frequency and 
one above the carrier center frequency, that are 20 dB down relative to 
the maximum level of the modulated carrier. Compliance with the emission 
bandwidth limit is based on the use of measurement instrumentation 
employing a

[[Page 556]]

peak detector function with an instrument resolution bandwidth 
approximately equal to 1.0 percent of the emission bandwidth of the 
device under measurement.
    (f) The authorized bandwidth for any emission type transmitted by a 
MURS transmitter is specified as follows:
    (1) Emissions on frequencies 151.820 MHz, 151.880 MHz, and 151.940 
MHz are limited to 11.25 kHz.

attenuation of at least 50 dB greater than the attenuation at 1 kHz.
    (c) When emission type A3E is transmitted, the modulation must be 
greater than 85% but must not exceed 100%. Simultaneous amplitude 
modulation and frequency or phase modulation of a transmitter are not 
permitted.
    (d) When emission type A3E is transmitted by a CB transmitter having 
a TP of greater than 2.5 W, the CB transmitter must automatically 
prevent the modulation from exceeding 100%.

Sec. 95.823  Geographic partitioning and spectrum disaggregation.

    (a) Eligibility. Parties seeking Commission approval of geographic 
partitioning or spectrum disaggregation of 218-219 MHz Service system 
licenses shall request an authorization for partial assignment of 
license pursuant to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter.
    (b) Technical standards--(1) Partitioning. In the case of 
partitioning, requests for authorization of partial assignment of a 
license must include, as attachments, a description of the partitioned 
service area and a calculation of the population of the partitioned 
service area and the licensed geographic service area. The partitioned 
service area shall be defined by coordinate points at every 3 seconds 
along the partitioned service area unless an FCC-recognized service area 
(i.e. Economic Areas) is utilized or county lines are followed. The 
geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and 
seconds, to the nearest second of latitude and longitude, and must be 
based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83). In the case where an 
FCC-recognized service area or county lines are utilized, applicants 
need only list the specific area(s) (through use of FCC designations or 
county names) that constitute the partitioned area.
    (2) Disaggregation. Spectrum maybe disaggregated in any amount.
    (3) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. The Commission will 
consider requests for partial assignments of licenses that propose 
combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.
    (c) Provisions applicable to designated entities--(1) Parties not 
qualified for installment payment plans. (i) When a winning bidder 
(partitionor or disaggregator) that elected to pay for its license 
through an installment payment plan partitions its license or 
disaggregates spectrum to another party (partitionee or disaggregatee) 
that would not qualify for an installment payment plan, or elects not to 
pay for its share of the license through installment payments, the 
outstanding principal balance owed by the partitionor or disaggregator 
shall be apportioned according to Sec. 1.2111(e)(3) of this chapter. 
The partitionor or disaggregator is responsible for accrued and unpaid 
interest through and including the consummation date.
    (ii) The partitionee or disaggregatee shall, as a condition of the 
approval of the partial assignment application, pay its entire pro rata 
amount of the outstanding principal balance on or before the 
consummation date. Failure to meet this condition will result in 
cancellation of the grant of the partial assignment application.
    (iii) The partitionor or disaggregator shall be permitted to 
continue to pay its pro rata share of the outstanding balance and, if 
applicable, shall receive loan documents evidencing the partitioning and 
disaggregation. The original interest rate, established pursuant to 
Sec. 1.2110(g)(3)(i) of this chapter at the time of the grant of the 
initial license in the market, shall continue to be applied to the 
partitionor's or disaggregator's portion of the remaining government 
obligation.
    (iv) A default on the partitionor's or disaggregator's payment 
obligation will affect only the partitionor's or disaggregator's portion 
of the market.
    (2) Parties qualified for installment payment plans.
    (i) Where both parties to a partitioning or disaggregation agreement 
qualify for installment payments, the partitionee or disaggregatee will 
be permitted to make installment payments on its portion of the 
remaining government obligation.

[[Page 568]]

    (ii) Each party may be required, as a condition to approval of the 
partial assignment application, to execute loan documents agreeing to 
pay its pro rata portion of the outstanding principal balance due, as 
apportioned according to Sec. 1.2111(e)(3) of this chapter, based upon 
the installment payment terms for which it qualifies under the rules. 
Failure by either party to meet this condition will result in the 
automatic cancellation of the grant of the partial assignment 
application. The interest rate, established pursuant to Sec. 
1.2110(f)(3)(i) of this chapter at the time of the grant of the initial 
license in the market, shall continue to be applied to both parties' 
portion of the balance due. Each party will receive a license for its 
portion of the partitioned market.
    (iii) A default on an obligation will affect only that portion of 
the market area held by the defaulting party.
    (d) Construction requirements--(1) Partitioning. Partial assignors 
and assignees for license partitioning have two options to meet 
construction requirements. Under the first option, the partitionor and 
partitionee would each certify that they will independently satisfy the 
applicable construction requirements set forth in Sec. 95.833 of this 
part for their respective partitioned areas. If either licensee failed 
to meet its requirement in Sec. 95.833 of this part, only the non-
performing licensee's renewal application would be subject to dismissal. 
Under the second option, the partitionor certifies that it has met or 
will meet the requirement in Sec. 95.833 of this part for the entire 
market. If the partitionor fails to meet the requirement in Sec. 95.833 
of this part, however, only its renewal application would be subject to 
forfeiture at renewal.
    (2) Disaggregation. Partial assignors and assignees for license 
disaggregation have two options to meet construction requirements. Under 
the first option, the disaggregator and disaggregatee would certify that 
they each will share responsibility for meeting the applicable 
construction requirements set forth in Sec. 95.833 of this part for the 
geographic service area. If parties choose this option and either party 
fails to do so, both licenses would be subject to forfeiture at renewal. 
The second option would allow the parties to agree that either the 
disaggregator or the disaggregatee would be responsible for meeting the 
requirement in Sec. 95.833 of this part for the geographic service 
area. If parties choose this option, and the party responsible for 
meeting the construction requirement fails to do so, only the license of 
the non-performing party would be subject to forfeiture at renewal.
    (3) All applications requesting partial assignments of license for 
partitioning or disaggregation must include the above-referenced 
certification as to which of the construction options is selected.
    (4) Responsible parties must submit supporting documents showing 
compliance with the respective construction requirements within the 
appropriate construction benchmarks set forth in Sec. 95.833 of this 
part.

Sec. 95.1223  Registration and frequency coordination in the 
2360-2390 MHz Band.

    (a) Registration. A health care facility must register all MBAN 
devices it proposes to operate in the 2360-2390 MHz band with a 
frequency coordinator designated under Sec. 95.1225 of this chapter. 
Operation of these devices in the 2360-2390 MHz band is prohibited prior 
to the MBAN coordinator notifying the health care facility that 
registration and coordination (to the extent coordination is required 
under paragraph (c) of this section), is complete. The registration must 
include the following information:
    (1) Specific frequencies or frequency range(s) within the 2360-2390 
MHz band to be used, and the capabilities of the MBAN equipment to use 
the 2390-2400 MHz band;
    (2) Effective isotropic radiated power;
    (3) Number of control transmitters in use at the health care 
facility as of the date of registration including manufacturer name(s) 
and model numbers and FCC identification number;
    (4) Legal name of the health care facility;
    (5) Location of control transmitters (e.g., geographic coordinates, 
street address, building);
    (6) Point of contact for the health care facility (e.g., name, 
title, office, phone number, fax number, email address); and
    (7) In the event an MBAN has to cease operating in all or a portion 
of the 2360-2390 MHz band due to interference under Sec. 95.1211 or 
changes in coordination under paragraph (c) of this section, a point of 
contact (including contractors) for the health care facility that is 
responsible for ensuring that this change is effected whenever it is 
required (e.g., name, title, office, phone number, fax number, email 
address). The health care facility also must state whether, in such 
cases, its MBAN operation is capable of defaulting to the 2390-2400 MHz 
band and that it is responsible for ceasing MBAN operations in the 2360-
2390 MHz band or defaulting traffic to other hospital systems.
    (b) Notification. A health care facility shall notify the frequency 
coordinator whenever an MBAN control transmitter in the 2360-2390 MHz 
band is permanently taken out of service, unless it is replaced with 
transmitter(s) using the same technical characteristics as

[[Page 581]]

those reported on the health care facility's registration. A health care 
facility shall keep the information contained in each registration 
current, shall notify the frequency coordinator of any material change 
to the MBAN's location or operating parameters, and is prohibited from 
operating the MBAN in the 2360-2390 MHz band under changed operating 
parameters until the frequency coordinator determines whether such 
changes require coordination with the AMT coordinator designated under 
Sec. 87.305 of this chapter and, if so, the coordination required under 
paragraph (c) of this section has been completed.
    (c) Coordination procedures. The frequency coordinator will 
determine if an MBAN is within the line of sight of an AMT receive 
facility in the 2360-2390 MHz band and notify the health care facility 
when it may begin MBAN operations under the applicable procedures in 
(c)(1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) If the MBAN is beyond the line of sight of an AMT receive 
facility, it may operate without prior coordination with the AMT 
coordinator, provided that the MBAN coordinator provides the AMT 
coordinator with the MBAN registration information and the AMT 
coordinator concurs that the MBAN is beyond the line of sight prior to 
the MBAN beginning operations in the band.
    (2) If the MBAN is within line of sight of an AMT receive facility, 
the MBAN frequency coordinator shall achieve a mutually satisfactory 
coordination agreement with the AMT frequency coordinator prior to the 
MBAN beginning operations in the band. Such coordination agreement shall 
provide protection to AMT receive stations consistent with International 
Telecommunication Union (ITU) Recommendation ITU-R M.1459, ``Protection 
criteria for telemetry systems in the aeronautical mobile service and 
mitigation techniques to facilitate sharing with geostationary 
broadcasting-satellite and mobile-satellite services in the frequency 
bands 1 452-1 525 and 2 310-2 360 MHz,'' May 2000, as adjusted using 
generally accepted engineering practices and standards that are mutually 
agreeable to both coordinators to take into account the local conditions 
and operating characteristics of the applicable AMT and MBAN facilities, 
and shall specify when the device shall limit its transmissions to 
segments of the 2360-2390 MHz band or shall cease operation in the band. 
This ITU document is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 
U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51 and approved by the Director of Federal 
Register. Copies of the recommendation may be obtained from ITU, Place 
des Nations, 1211 Geneva 20, Switzerland, or online at http://

material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/
federal--register/code--of--federal--regulations/ibr--locations.html. 
``Generally accepted engineering practices and standards'' include, but 
are not limited to, engineering analyses and measurement data as well as 
limiting MBAN operations in the band by time or frequency.
    (3) If an AMT operator plans to operate a receive site not 
previously analyzed by the MBAN coordinator to determine line of sight 
to an MBAN facility, the AMT operator shall consider using locations 
that are beyond the line of sight of a registered health care facility. 
If the AMT operator determines that non-line of sight locations are not 
practical for its purposes, the AMT coordinator shall notify the MBAN 
coordinator upon no less than 7 days' notice that the registered health 
care facility must cease MBAN operations in the 2360-2390 MHz band 
unless the parties can achieve a mutually satisfactory coordination 
agreement under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, non-reserve 
DSRCS channels are available on a shared basis only for use in 
accordance with the Commission's rules. All licensees shall cooperate in 
the selection and use of channels in order to reduce interference. This 
includes monitoring for communications in progress and any other 
measures as may be necessary to minimize interference. Licensees 
suffering or causing harmful interference within a communications zone 
are expected to cooperate and resolve this problem by mutually 
satisfactory arrangements. If the licensees are unable to do so, the 
Commission may impose restrictions, including specifying the transmitter 
power, antenna height and direction, additional filtering, or area or 
hours of operation of the stations concerned. Further, the use of any 
channel at a given geographical location may be denied when, in the 
judgment of the Commission, its use at that location is not in the 
public interest; the use of any channel may be restricted as to 
specified geographical areas, maximum power, or such other operating 
conditions, contained in this part or in the station authorization.
    (c) Safety/public safety priority. The following access priority 
governs all DSRCS operations:
    (1) Communications involving the safety of life have access priority 
over all other DSRCS communications;
    (2) Subject to a control channel priority system management strategy 
(see ASTM E2213-03 DSRC Standard at Sec. 4.1.1.2(4)), DSRCS 
communications involving public safety have access priority over all 
other DSRC communications not listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section. On-Board Units (OBUs) operated by state or local governmental

    (2) If the routine environmental evaluation indicates that the RF 
electromagnetic fields could exceed the limits contained in Sec. 1.1310 
of this chapter in accessible areas, the licensee must take action to 
prevent human exposure to such RF electromagnetic fields. Further 
information on evaluating compliance with these limits can be found in 
the FCC's OET Bulletin Number 65, ``Evaluating Compliance with FCC 
Guidelines for Human Exposure to Radiofrequency Electromagnetic 
Fields.''

grant. No new license grant will be issued for a Novice or Advanced 
Class operator/primary station.
    (b) Each application for a new amateur service license grant must be 
filed with the FCC as follows:
    (1) Each candidate for an amateur radio operator license which 
requires the applicant to pass one or more examination elements must 
present the administering VEs with all information required by the rules 
prior to the examination. The VEs may collect all necessary information 
in any manner of their choosing, including creating their own forms.
    (2) For a new club or military recreation station license grant, 
each applicant must present all information required by the rules to an 
amateur radio organization having tax-exempt status under section 
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that provides voluntary, 
uncompensated and unreimbursed services in providing club and military 
recreation station call signs (``Club Station Call Sign Administrator'') 
who must submit the information to the FCC in an electronic batch file. 
The Club Station Call Sign Administrator may collect the information 
required by these rules in any manner of their choosing, including 
creating their own forms. The Club Station Call Sign Administrator must 
retain the applicants information for at least 15 months and make it 
available to the FCC upon request. The FCC will issue public 
announcements listing the qualified organizations that have completed a 
pilot autogrant batch filing project and are authorized to serve as a 
Club Station Call Sign Administrator.
    (c) No person shall obtain or attempt to obtain, or assist another 
person to obtain or attempt to obtain, an amateur service license grant 
by fraudulent means.
    (d) One unique call sign will be shown on the license grant of each 
new primary, club and military recreation station. The call sign will be

Sec. 97.19  Application for a vanity call sign.

    (a) The person named in an operator/primary station license grant or 
in a club station license grant is eligible to

[[Page 594]]

make application for modification of the license grant, or the renewal 
thereof, to show a call sign selected by the vanity call sign system. 
Effective February 14, 2011, the person named in a club station license 
grant that shows on the license a call sign that was selected by a 
trustee is not eligible for an additional vanity call sign. (The person 
named in a club station license grant that shows on the license a call 
sign that was selected by a trustee is eligible for a vanity call sign 
for his or her operator/primary station license grant on the same basis 
as any other person who holds an operator/primary station license 
grant.) Military recreation stations are not eligible for a vanity call 
sign.
    (b) Each application for a modification of an operator/primary or 
club station license grant, or the renewal thereof, to show a call sign 
selected by the vanity call sign system must be filed in accordance with 
Sec. 1.913 of this chapter.
    (c) Unassigned call signs are available to the vanity call sign 
system with the following exceptions:
    (1) A call sign shown on an expired license grant is not available 
to the vanity call sign system for 2 years following the expiration of 
the license.
    (2) A call sign shown on a surrendered or canceled license grant 
(except for a license grant that is canceled pursuant to Sec. 97.31) is 
not available to the vanity call sign system for 2 years following the 
date such action is taken. (The availability of a call sign shown on a 
license canceled pursuant to Sec. 97.31 is governed by paragraph (c)(3) 
of this section.)
    (i) This 2-year period does not apply to any license grant pursuant 
to paragraph (c)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section that is 
surrendered, canceled, revoked, voided, or set aside because the grantee 
acknowledged or the Commission determined that the grantee was not 
eligible for the exception. In such a case, the call sign is not 
available to the vanity call sign system for 30 days following the date 
such action is taken, or for the period for which the call sign would 
not have been available to the vanity call sign system pursuant to 
paragraphs (c)(2) or (3) of this section but for the intervening grant 
to the ineligible applicant, whichever is later.
    (ii) An applicant to whose operator/primary station license grant, 
or club station license grant for which the applicant is the trustee, 
the call sign was previously assigned is exempt from the 2-year period 
set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (3) A call sign shown on a license canceled pursuant to Sec. 97.31 
of this part is not available to the vanity call sign system for 2 years 
following the person's death, or for 2 years following the expiration of 
the license grant, whichever is sooner. If, however, a license is 
canceled more than 2 years after the licensee's death (or within 30 days 
before the second anniversary of the licensee's death), the call sign is 
not available to the vanity call sign system for 30 days following the 
date such action is taken. The following applicants are exempt from this 
2-year period:
    (i) An applicant to whose operator/primary station license grant, or 
club station license grant for which the applicant is the trustee, the 
call sign was previously assigned; or
    (ii) An applicant who is the spouse, child, grandchild, stepchild, 
parent, grandparent, stepparent, brother, sister, stepbrother, 
stepsister, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or in-law of the person now 
deceased or of any other deceased former holder of the call sign, 
provided that the vanity call sign requested by the applicant is from 
the group of call signs corresponding to the same or lower class of 
operator license held by the applicant as designated in the sequential 
call sign system; or
    (iii) An applicant who is a club station license trustee acting with 
a written statement of consent signed by either the licensee ante mortem 
but who is now deceased, or by at least one relative as listed in 
paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, of the person now deceased or of 
any other deceased former holder of the call sign, provided that the 
deceased former holder was a member of the club during his or her life.
    (d) The vanity call sign requested by an applicant must be selected 
from the group of call signs corresponding to the same or lower class of 
operator license held by the applicant as designated in the sequential 
call sign system.

[[Page 595]]

    (1) The applicant must request that the call sign shown on the 
license grant be vacated and provide a list of up to 25 call signs in 
order of preference. In the event that the Commission receives more than 
one application requesting a vanity call sign from an applicant on the 
same receipt day, the Commission will process only the first such 
application entered into the Universal Licensing System. Subsequent 
vanity call sign applications from that applicant with the same receipt 
date will not be accepted.
    (2) The first assignable call sign from the applicant's list will be 
shown on the license grant. When none of those call signs are 
assignable, the call sign vacated by the applicant will be shown on the 
license grant.
    (3) Vanity call signs will be selected from those call signs 
assignable at the time the application is processed by the FCC.
    (4) A call sign designated under the sequential call sign system for 
Alaska, Hawaii, Caribbean Insular Areas, and Pacific Insular areas will 
be assigned only to a primary or club station whose licensee's mailing 
address is in the corresponding state, commonwealth, or island. This 
limitation does not apply to an applicant for the call sign as the 
spouse, child, grandchild, stepchild, parent, grandparent, stepparent, 
brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or 
in-law, of the former holder now deceased.

Sec. 97.21  Application for a modified or renewed license grant.

    (a) A person holding a valid amateur station license grant:
    (1) Must apply to the FCC for a modification of the license grant as 
necessary to show the correct mailing address, licensee name, club name, 
license trustee name, or license custodian name in accordance with Sec. 
1.913 of this chapter. For a club or military recreation station license 
grant, the application must be presented in document form to a Club 
Station Call Sign Administrator who must submit the information thereon 
to the FCC in an electronic batch file. The Club Station Call Sign 
Administrator must retain the collected information for at least 15 
months and make it available to the FCC upon request. A Club Station 
Call Sign Administrator shall not file with the Commission any 
application to modify a club station license grant that was submitted by 
a person other than the trustee as shown on the license grant, except an 
application to change the club station license trustee. An application 
to modify a club station license grant to change the license trustee 
name must be submitted to a Club Station Call Sign Administrator and 
must be signed by an officer of the club.
    (2) May apply to the FCC for a modification of the operator/primary 
station license grant to show a higher operator class. Applicants must 
present the administering VEs with all information required by the rules 
prior to the examination. The VEs may collect all necessary information 
in any manner of their choosing, including creating their own forms.
    (3) May apply to the FCC for renewal of the license grant for 
another term in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.913 and 1.949 of this 
chapter. Application for renewal of a Technician Plus Class operator/
primary station license will be processed as an application for renewal 
of a Technician Class operator/primary station license.
    (i) For a station license grant showing a call sign obtained through 
the vanity call sign system, the application must be filed in accordance 
with Sec. 97.19 of this part in order to have the vanity call sign 
reassigned to the station.
    (ii) For a primary station license grant showing a call sign 
obtained through the sequential call sign system, and for a primary 
station license grant showing a call sign obtained through the vanity 
call sign system but whose grantee does not want to have the vanity call 
sign reassigned to the station, the application must be filed with the 
FCC in accordance with Sec. 1.913 of this chapter. When the application 
has been received by the FCC on or before the license expiration date,

[[Page 596]]

the license operating authority is continued until the final disposition 
of the application.
    (iii) For a club station or military recreation station license 
grant showing a call sign obtained through the sequential call sign 
system, and for a club station license grant showing a call sign 
obtained through the vanity call sign system but whose grantee does not 
want to have the vanity call sign reassigned to the station, the 
application must be presented in document form to a Club Station Call 
Sign Administrator who must submit the information thereon to the FCC in 
an electronic batch file. The replacement call sign will be selected by 
the sequential call sign system. The Club Station Call Sign 
Administrator must retain the collected information for at least 15 
months and make it available to the FCC upon request.
    (b) A person whose amateur station license grant has expired may 
apply to the FCC for renewal of the license grant for another term 
during a 2 year filing grace period. The application must be received at 
the address specified above prior to the end of the grace period. Unless 
and until the license grant is renewed, no privileges in this part are 
conferred.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, a call 
sign obtained under the sequential or vanity call sign system will be 
reassigned to the station upon renewal or modification of a station 
license.

Sec. 97.23  Mailing address.

    Each license grant must show the grantee's correct name and mailing 
address. The mailing address must be in an area where the amateur 
service is regulated by the FCC and where the grantee can receive mail 
delivery by the United States Postal Service. Revocation of the station 
license or suspension of the operator license may result when

Sec. 97.27  FCC modification of station license grant.

    (a) The FCC may modify a station license grant, either for a limited 
time or for the duration of the term thereof, if it determines:
    (1) That such action will promote the public interest, convenience, 
and necessity; or
    (2) That such action will promote fuller compliance with the 
provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or of any 
treaty ratified by the United States.
    (b) When the FCC makes such a determination, it will issue an order 
of modification. The order will not become final until the licensee is 
notified in writing of the proposed action and the grounds and reasons 
therefor. The licensee will be given reasonable opportunity of no less 
than 30 days to protest the modification; except that, where safety of 
life or property is involved, a shorter period of notice may be 
provided. Any protest by a licensee of an FCC order of modification will 
be handled in accordance with the provisions of 47 U.S.C. 316.

    (2) The operating terms and conditions of the amateur service 
license granted by the alien's government;
    (3) The applicable rules of this part, but not to exceed the control 
operator privileges of an FCC-granted Amateur Extra Class operator 
license; and
    (c) At any time the FCC may, in its discretion, modify, suspend or 
cancel the reciprocal operating authority granted to any person by this 
section.

Sec. 97.115  Third party communications.

    (a) An amateur station may transmit messages for a third party to:
    (1) Any station within the jurisdiction of the United States.

[[Page 600]]

    (2) Any station within the jurisdiction of any foreign government 
when transmitting emergency or disaster relief communications and any 
station within the jurisdiction of any foreign government whose 
administration has made arrangements with the United States to allow 
amateur stations to be used for transmitting international 
communications on behalf of third parties. No station shall transmit 
messages for a third party to any station within the jurisdiction of any 
foreign government whose administration has not made such an 
arrangement. This prohibition does not apply to a message for any third 
party who is eligible to be a control operator of the station.
    (b) The third party may participate in stating the message where:
    (1) The control operator is present at the control point and is 
continuously monitoring and supervising the third party's participation; 
and
    (2) The third party is not a prior amateur service licensee whose 
license was revoked or not renewed after hearing and re-licensing has 
not taken place; suspended for less than the balance of the license term 
and the suspension is still in effect; suspended for the balance of the 
license term and re-licensing has not taken place; or surrendered for 
cancellation following notice of revocation, suspension or monetary 
forfeiture proceedings. The third party may not be the subject of a 
cease and desist order which relates to amateur service operation and 
which is still in effect.
    (c) No station may transmit third party communications while being 
automatically controlled except a station transmitting a RTTY or data 
emission.
    (d) At the end of an exchange of international third party 
communications, the station must also transmit in the station 
identification procedure the call sign of the station with which a third 
party message was exchanged.

<R05>
Sec. 97.119  Station identification.

    (a) Each amateur station, except a space station or telecommand 
station, must transmit its assigned call sign on its transmitting 
channel at the end of each communication, and at least every 10 minutes 
during a communication, for the purpose of clearly making the source of 
the transmissions from the station known to those receiving the 
transmissions. No station may transmit unidentified communications or 
signals, or transmit as the station call sign, any call sign not 
authorized to the station.
    (b) The call sign must be transmitted with an emission authorized 
for the transmitting channel in one of the following ways:
    (1) By a CW emission. When keyed by an automatic device used only 
for identification, the speed must not exceed 20 words per minute;
    (2) By a phone emission in the English language. Use of a phonetic 
alphabet as an aid for correct station identification is encouraged;
    (3) By a RTTY emission using a specified digital code when all or 
part of the communications are transmitted by a RTTY or data emission;
    (4) By an image emission conforming to the applicable transmission 
standards, either color or monochrome, of Sec. 73.682(a) of the FCC 
Rules when all or part of the communications are transmitted in the same 
image emission
    (c) One or more indicators may be included with the call sign. Each 
indicator must be separated from the call sign by the slant mark (/) or 
by any suitable word that denotes the slant mark. If an indicator is 
self-assigned, it must be included before, after, or both before and 
after, the call sign. No self-assigned indicator may conflict with any 
other indicator specified by the FCC Rules or with any prefix assigned 
to another country.
    (d) When transmitting in conjunction with an event of special 
significance, a station may substitute for its assigned call sign a 
special event call sign as shown for that station for that period

[[Page 601]]

of time on the common data base coordinated, maintained and disseminated 
by the special event call sign data base coordinators. Additionally, the 
station must transmit its assigned call sign at least once per hour 
during such transmissions.
    (e) When the operator license class held by the control operator 
exceeds that of the station licensee, an indicator consisting of the 
call sign assigned to the control operator's station must be included 
after the call sign.
    (f) When the control operator is a person who is exercising the 
rights and privileges authorized by Sec. 97.9(b) of this part, an 
indicator must be included after the call sign as follows:
    (1) For a control operator who has requested a license modification 
from Novice Class to Technical Class: KT;
    (2) For a control operator who has requested a license modification 
from Novice or Technician to General Class: AG;
    (3) For a control operator who has requested a license modification 
from Novice, Technician, General, or Advanced Class to Amateur Extra 
Class: AE.
    (g) When the station is transmitting under the authority of Sec. 
97.107 of this part, an indicator consisting of the appropriate letter-
numeral designating the station location must be included before the 
call sign that was issued to the station by the country granting the 
license. For an amateur service license granted by the Government of 
Canada, however, the indicator must be included after the call sign. At 
least once during each intercommunication, the identification 
announcement must include the geographical location as nearly as 
possible by city and state, commonwealth or possession.

2400-2450 MHz, 3.40-3.41 GHz, 5.83-5.85 GHz, 10.45-10.50 GHz, and 24.00-
24.05 GHz segments.
    (d) A space station may automatically retransmit the radio signals 
of Earth stations and other space stations.
    (e) A space station may transmit one-way communications.
    (f) Space telemetry transmissions may consist of specially coded 
messages intended to facilitate communications or related to the 
function of the spacecraft.
    (g) The license grantee of each space station must make the 
following written notifications to the International Bureau, FCC, 
Washington, DC 20554.
    (1) A pre-space notification within 30 days after the date of launch 
vehicle determination, but no later than 90 days before integration of 
the space station into the launch vehicle. The notification must be in 
accordance with the provisions of Articles 9 and 11 of the International 
Telecommunication Union (ITU) Radio Regulations and must specify the 
information required by Appendix 4 and Resolution No. 642 of the ITU 
Radio Regulations. The notification must also include a description of 
the design and operational strategies that the space station will use to 
mitigate orbital debris, including the following information:
    (i) A statement that the space station licensee has assessed and 
limited the amount of debris released in a planned manner during normal 
operations, and has assessed and limited the probability of the space 
station becoming a source of debris by collisions with small debris or 
meteoroids that could cause loss of control and prevent post-mission 
disposal;
    (ii) A statement that the space station licensee has assessed and 
limited the probability of accidental explosions during and after 
completion of mission operations. This statement must include a 
demonstration that debris generation will not result from the conversion 
of energy sources on board the spacecraft into energy that fragments the 
spacecraft. Energy sources include

[[Page 604]]

chemical, pressure, and kinetic energy. This demonstration should 
address whether stored energy will be removed at the spacecraft's end of 
life, by depleting residual fuel and leaving all fuel line valves open, 
venting any pressurized system, leaving all batteries in a permanent 
discharge state, and removing any remaining source of stored energy, or 
through other equivalent procedures specifically disclosed in the 
application;
    (iii) A statement that the space station licensee has assessed and 
limited the probability of the space station becoming a source of debris 
by collisions with large debris or other operational space stations. 
Where a space station will be launched into a low-Earth orbit that is 
identical, or very similar, to an orbit used by other space stations, 
the statement must include an analysis of the potential risk of 
collision and a description of what measures the space station operator 
plans to take to avoid in-orbit collisions. If the space station 
licensee is relying on coordination with another system, the statement 
must indicate what steps have been taken to contact, and ascertain the 
likelihood of successful coordination of physical operations with, the 
other system. The statement must disclose the accuracy--if any--with 
which orbital parameters of non-geostationary satellite orbit space 
stations will be maintained, including apogee, perigee, inclination, and 
the right ascension of the ascending node(s). In the event that a system 
is not able to maintain orbital tolerances, i.e., it lacks a propulsion 
system for orbital maintenance, that fact should be included in the 
debris mitigation disclosure. Such systems must also indicate the 
anticipated evolution over time of the orbit of the proposed satellite 
or satellites. Where a space station requests the assignment of a 
geostationary-Earth orbit location, it must assess whether there are any 
known satellites located at, or reasonably expected to be located at, 
the requested orbital location, or assigned in the vicinity of that 
location, such that the station keeping volumes of the respective 
satellites might overlap. If so, the statement must include a statement 
as to the identities of those parties and the measures that will be 
taken to prevent collisions;
    (iv) A statement detailing the post-mission disposal plans for the 
space station at end of life, including the quantity of fuel--if any--
that will be reserved for post-mission disposal maneuvers. For 
geostationary-Earth orbit space stations, the statement must disclose 
the altitude selected for a post-mission disposal orbit and the 
calculations that are used in deriving the disposal altitude. The 
statement must also include a casualty risk assessment if planned post-
mission disposal involves atmospheric re-entry of the space station. In 
general, an assessment should include an estimate as to whether portions 
of the spacecraft will survive re-entry and reach the surface of the 
Earth, as well as an estimate of the resulting probability of human 
casualty.
    (v) If any material item described in this notification changes 
before launch, a replacement pre-space notification shall be filed with 
the International Bureau no later than 90 days before integration of the 
space station into the launch vehicle.
    (2) An in-space station notification is required no later than 7 
days following initiation of space station transmissions. This 
notification must update the information contained in the pre-space 
notification.
    (3) A post-space station notification is required no later than 3 
months after termination of the space station transmissions. When 
termination of transmissions is ordered by the FCC, the notification is 
required no later than 24 hours after termination of transmissions.

system, subject to the privileges of the class of operator license held.
    (b) For stations participating in a message forwarding system, the 
control operator of the station originating a message is primarily 
accountable for any violation of the rules in this part contained in the 
message.

[[Page 606]]

    (c) Except as noted in (d) of this section, for stations 
participating in a message forwarding system, the control operators of 
forwarding stations that retransmit inadvertently communications that 
violate the rules in this part are not accountable for the violative 
communications. They are, however, responsible for discontinuing such 
communications once they become aware of their presence.
    (d) For stations participating in a message forwarding system, the 
control operator of the first forwarding station must:
    (1) Authenticate the identity of the station from which it accepts 
communications on behalf of the system; or
    (2) Accept accountability for any violation of the rules in this 
part contained in messages it retransmits to the system.

Sec. 97.221  Automatically controlled digital station.

    (a) This rule section does not apply to an auxiliary station, a 
beacon station, a repeater station, an earth station, a space station, 
or a space telecommand station.
    (b) A station may be automatically controlled while transmitting a 
RTTY or data emission on the 6 m or shorter wavelength bands, and on the 
28.120-28.189 MHz, 24.925-24.930 MHz, 21.090-21.100 MHz, 18.105-18.110 
MHz, 14.0950-14.0995 MHz, 14.1005-14.112 MHz, 10.140-10.150 MHz, 7.100-
7.105 MHz, or 3.585-3.600 MHz segments.
    (c) Except for channels specified in Sec. 97.303(h), a station may 
be automatically controlled while transmitting a RTTY or data emission 
on any other frequency authorized for such emission types provided that:
    (1) The station is responding to interrogation by a station under 
local or remote control; and
    (2) No transmission from the automatically controlled station 
occupies a bandwidth of more than 500 Hz.

Sec. 97.303  Frequency sharing requirements.

    The following paragraphs summarize the frequency sharing 
requirements that apply to amateur stations transmitting in the 
frequency bands specified in Sec. 97.301 of this part. Each frequency 
band allocated to the amateur service is designated as either a 
secondary service or a primary service. A station in a secondary service 
must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference 
from, stations in a primary service.
    (a) Where, in adjacent ITU Regions or sub-Regions, a band of 
frequencies is allocated to different services of the same category 
(i.e., primary or secondary services), the basic principle is the 
equality of right to operate. Accordingly, stations of each service in 
one Region or sub-Region must operate so as not to cause harmful 
interference to any service of the same or higher category in the other 
Regions or sub-Regions.
    (b) Amateur stations transmitting in the 70 cm band, the 33 cm band, 
the 23 cm band, the 9 cm band, the 5 cm band, the 3 cm band, or the 
24.05-24.25 GHz segment must not cause harmful interference to, and must 
accept interference from, stations authorized by the United States 
Government in the radiolocation service.
    (c) Amateur stations transmitting in the 1900-2000 kHz segment, the 
76-77.5 GHz segment, the 78-81 GHz segment, the 136-141 GHz segment, or 
the 241-248 GHz segment must not cause harmful interference to, and must 
accept interference from, stations authorized by the United States 
Government, the FCC, or other nations in the radiolocation service.
    (d) Amateur stations transmitting in the 430-450 MHz segment, the 23 
cm band, the 3.3-3.4 GHz segment, the 5.65-5.85 GHz segment, the 13 cm 
band, or the 24.05-24.25 GHz segment, must not cause harmful 
interference to, and must accept interference from, stations authorized 
by other nations in the radiolocation service.

[[Page 609]]

    (e) Amateur stations receiving in the 33 cm band, the 2400-2450 MHz 
segment, the 5.725-5.875 GHz segment, the 1.2 cm band, the 2.5 mm band, 
or the 244-246 GHz segment must accept interference from industrial, 
scientific, and medical (ISM) equipment.
    (f) Amateur stations transmitting in the following segments must not 
cause harmful interference to radio astronomy stations: 3.332-3.339 GHz, 
3.3458-3.3525 GHz, 76-77.5 GHz, 78-81 GHz, 136-141 GHz, 241-248 GHz, 
275-323 GHz, 327-371 GHz, 388-424 GHz, 426-442 GHz, 453-510 GHz, 623-711 
GHz, 795-909 GHz, or 926-945 GHz. In addition, amateur stations 
transmitting in the following segments must not cause harmful 
interference to stations in the Earth exploration-satellite service 
(passive) or the space research service (passive): 275-277 GHz, 294-306

Sec. 97.307  Emission standards.

    (a) No amateur station transmission shall occupy more bandwidth than 
necessary for the information rate and emission type being transmitted, 
in accordance with good amateur practice.
    (b) Emissions resulting from modulation must be confined to the band 
or segment available to the control operator. Emissions outside the 
necessary bandwidth must not cause splatter or keyclick interference to 
operations on adjacent frequencies.
    (c) All spurious emissions from a station transmitter must be 
reduced to the greatest extent practicable. If any spurious emission, 
including chassis or power line radiation, causes harmful interference 
to the reception of another radio station, the licensee of the 
interfering amateur station is required to take steps to eliminate the 
interference, in accordance with good engineering practice.
    (d) For transmitters installed after January 1, 2003, the mean power 
of any spurious emission from a station transmitter or external RF power 
amplifier transmitting on a frequency below 30 MHz must be at least 43 
dB below the mean power of the fundamental emission. For transmitters 
installed on or before January 1, 2003, the mean power of any spurious 
emission from a station transmitter or external RF power amplifier 
transmitting on a frequency below 30 MHz must not exceed 50 mW and must 
be at least 40 dB below the mean power of the fundamental emission. For 
a transmitter of mean power less than 5 W installed on or before January 
1, 2003, the attenuation must be at least 30 dB. A transmitter built 
before April 15, 1977, or first marketed before January 1, 1978, is 
exempt from this requirement.
    (e) The mean power of any spurious emission from a station 
transmitter or external RF power amplifier transmitting on a frequency 
between 30-225 MHz must be at least 60 dB below the mean power of the 
fundamental. For a transmitter having a mean power of 25 W or less, the 
mean power of any spurious emission supplied to the antenna transmission 
line must not exceed 25 [micro]W and must be at least 40 dB below the 
mean power of the fundamental emission, but need not be reduced below 
the power of 10 [micro]W. A transmitter built before April 15, 1977, or 
first marketed before January 1, 1978, is exempt from this requirement.
    (f) The following standards and limitations apply to transmissions 
on the frequencies specified in Sec. 97.305(c) of this part.

than 1 at the highest modulation frequency.
    (2) No non-phone emission shall exceed the bandwidth of a 
communications quality phone emission of the same modulation type. The 
total bandwidth of an independent sideband emission (having B as the 
first symbol), or a multiplexed image and phone emission, shall not 
exceed that of a communications quality A3E emission.
    (3) Only a RTTY or data emission using a specified digital code 
listed in Sec. 97.309(a) of this part may be transmitted. The symbol 
rate must not exceed 300 bauds, or for frequency-shift keying, the 
frequency shift between mark and space must not exceed 1 kHz.

listed in Sec. 97.309(a) of this part may be transmitted. The symbol 
rate must not exceed 1200 bauds, or for frequency-shift keying, the 
frequency shift between mark and space must not exceed 1 kHz.
    (5) A RTTY, data or multiplexed emission using a specified digital 
code listed in Sec. 97.309(a) of this part may be transmitted. The 
symbol rate must not exceed 19.6 kilobauds. A RTTY, data or multiplexed 
emission using an unspecified digital code under the limitations listed 
in Sec. 97.309(b) of this part also may be transmitted. The authorized 
bandwidth is 20 kHz.
    (6) A RTTY, data or multiplexed emission using a specified digital 
code listed in Sec. 97.309(a) of this part may be transmitted. The 
symbol rate must not exceed 56 kilobauds. A RTTY, data or multiplexed 
emission using an unspecified digital code under the limitations listed 
in Sec. 97.309(b) of this part also may be transmitted. The authorized 
bandwidth is 100 kHz.

code listed in Sec. 97.309(a) of this part or an unspecified digital 
code under the limitations listed in Sec. 97.309(b) of this part may be 
transmitted.
    (8) A RTTY or data emission having designators with A, B, C, D, E, 
F, G, H, J or R as the first symbol; 1, 2, 7 or 9 as the second symbol; 
and D or W as the third symbol is also authorized.
    (9) A station having a control operator holding a Novice or 
Technician Class operator license may only transmit a CW emission using 
the international Morse code.
    (10) A station having a control operator holding a Novice Class 
operator license or a Technician Class operator license and who has 
received credit for proficiency in telegraphy in accordance with the 
international requirements may only transmit a CW emission using the 
international Morse code or phone emissions J3E and R3E.
    (11) Phone and image emissions may be transmitted only by stations 
located in ITU Regions 1 and 3, and by stations located within ITU 
Region 2 that are west of 130[deg] West longitude or south of 20[deg] 
North latitude.
    (12) Emission F8E may be transmitted.
    (13) A data emission using an unspecified digital code under the 
limitations listed in Sec. 97.309(b) also may be transmitted. The 
authorized bandwidth is 100 kHz.
    (14) In the 60 m band:

multipoint-to-multipoint radio system in the 24.25-24.45 GHz band and in 
the 25.05-25.25 GHz band consisting of a fixed main (nodal) station and 
a number of fixed user terminals. This service may encompass any digital 
fixed service.
    Antenna power gain. The ratio of the maximum radiation intensity to 
that of an isotropic (omnidirectional) radiator in the far field of its 
main (forward direction) lobe.
    Antenna power input. The radio frequency peak or RMS power, as the 
case may be, supplied to the antenna from the antenna transmission line 
and its associated impedance matching network.
    Antenna structure. The antenna, its supporting structure and 
anything attached to it.
    Assigned frequency. The center of the frequency band assigned to a 
station.
    Assigned frequency bandwidth. The frequency band within which the 
emission of a station is authorized; the width of the band equals the 
necessary bandwidth plus twice the absolute value of the frequency 
tolerance.
    Authorized bandwidth. The maximum bandwidth authorized to be used by 
a station as specified in the station license. (See Sec. 2.202 of this 
chapter)
    Authorized frequency. The frequency, or frequency range, assigned to 
a station by the Commission and specified in the instrument of 
authorization.
    Authorized power. The maximum power a station is permitted to use. 
This power is specified by the Commission in the station's 
authorization.
    Automatic Transmitter Power Control (ATPC). ATPC is a feature of a 
digital microwave radio system that adjusts the transmitter output 
power. ATPC allows the transmitter to operate at less than maximum power 
for most of the time. In a radio employing ATPC, the transmit power is 
reduced during normal operation conditions. When the receiver detects a 
reduction in signal level, a control signal is sent to the far end 
transmitter, instructing it to increase the power output to compensate 
for the signal reduction. The power output is limited to the licensed 
(maximum) transmit power. Guidelines for use of ATPC are set forth in 
the TIA Telecommunications Systems Bulletin TSB 10, ``Interference 
Criteria for Microwave Systems (TSB 10).''
    Bandwidth occupied by an emission. The band of frequencies 
comprising 99 percent of the total radiated power extended to include 
any discrete frequency on which the power is at least 0.25 percent of 
the total radiated power.
    Bit rate. The rate of transmission of information in binary (two 
state) form in bits per unit time.
    Carrier. In a frequency stabilized system, the sinusoidal component 
of a modulated wave whose frequency is independent of the modulating 
wave; or the output of a transmitter when the modulating wave is made 
zero; or a wave generated at a point in the transmitting system and 
subsequently modulated by the signal; or a wave generated locally at the 
receiving terminal which when combined with the side bands in a suitable 
detector, produces the modulating wave.
    Carrier frequency. The output of a transmitter when the modulating 
wave is made zero.
    Central office. A landline termination center used for switching and 
interconnection of public message communication circuits.
    Common carrier fixed point-to-point microwave service. A common

    Control station. A fixed station, the transmissions of which are 
used to control automatically the emissions or operations of a radio 
station, or a remote base station transmitter.
    Coordination area. The area associated with a station outside of 
which another station sharing the same or adjacent frequency band 
neither causes nor is subject to interfering emissions greater than a 
permissible level.
    Coordination contour. The line enclosing the coordination area.
    Coordination distance. The distance on a given azimuth from a 
station beyond which another station neither causes nor is subject to 
interfering emissions greater than a permissible level.

communications media to interconnect digital termination systems to 
comprise a network.
    Digital Electronic Message User Station. Any one of the fixed 
microwave radio stations located at users' premises, lying within the 
coverage area of a Digital Electronic Message Nodal Station, and 
providing two-way digital communications with the Digital Electronic 
Message Nodal Station.
    Digital modulation. The process by which some characteristic 
(frequency, phase, amplitude or combinations thereof) of a carrier 
frequency is varied in accordance with a digital signal, e.g., one 
consisting of coded pulses or states.
    Drop point. A term used in the point-to-point microwave radio 
service to designate a terminal point where service is rendered to a 
subscriber.

                       Processing of Applications


<R05>
Sec. 101.45  Mutually exclusive applications.

    (a) The Commission will consider applications to be mutually 
exclusive if their conflicts are such that the grant of one application 
would effectively preclude by reason of harmful electrical interference, 
or other practical reason, the grant of one or more of the other 
applications. The Commission will presume ``harmful electrical 
interference'' exists when the levels of Sec. 101.105 are exceeded, or 
when there is a material impairment to service rendered to the public 
despite full cooperation in good faith by all applicants or parties to 
achieve reasonable technical adjustments which would avoid electrical 
conflict.
    (b) A common carrier application, except in the Local Multipoint 
Distribution Service and in the 24 GHz Service, will be entitled to 
comparative consideration with one or more conflicting applications only 
if:
    (1) The application is mutually exclusive with the other 
application; and
    (2) The application is received by the Commission in a condition 
acceptable for filing by whichever ``cut-off'' date is earlier:
    (i) Sixty (60) days after the date of the public notice listing the 
first of the

[[Page 634]]

conflicting applications as accepted for filing; or
    (ii) One (1) business day preceding the day on which the Commission 
takes final action on the previously filed application (should the 
Commission act upon such application in the interval between thirty (30) 
and sixty (60) days after the date of its public notice).
    (c) Whenever three or more applications are mutually exclusive, but 
not uniformly so, the earliest filed application established the date 
prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, regardless of whether or 
not subsequently filed applications are directly mutually exclusive with 
the first filed application. (For example, applications A, B, and C are 
filed in that order. A and B are directly mutually exclusive, B and C 
are directly mutually exclusive. In order to be considered comparatively 
with B, C must be filed within the ``cut-off'' period established by A 
even though C is not directly mutually exclusive with A.)
    (d) Private operational fixed point-to-point microwave applications 
for authorization under this part will be entitled to comparative 
consideration with one or more conflicting applications in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 1.227(b)(4) of this chapter.
    (e) An application otherwise mutually exclusive with one or more 
previously filed applications, but filed after the appropriate date 
prescribed in paragraphs (b) or (d) of this section, will be returned 
without prejudice and will be eligible for refiling only after final 
action is taken by the Commission with respect to the previously filed 
application (or applications).
    (f) For purposes of this section, any application (whether mutually 
exclusive or not) will be considered to be a newly filed application if 
it is amended by a major amendment (as defined by Sec. 1.929 of this 
chapter), except under any of the following circumstances:
    (1) The application has been designated for comparative hearing, or 
for comparative evaluation (pursuant to Sec. 101.51 of this part), and 
the Commission or the presiding officer accepts the amendment pursuant 
to Sec. 1.927 of this chapter;
    (2) The amendment resolves frequency conflicts with authorized 
stations or other pending applications which would otherwise require 
resolution by hearing or by comparative evaluation pursuant to Sec. 
101.51 provided that the amendment does not create new or additional 
frequency conflicts;
    (3) The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control 
found by the Commission to be in the public interest, and for which a 
requested exemption from the ``cut-off'' requirements of this section is 
granted;
    (4) The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control 
which results from an agreement under Sec. 1.935 of this chapter 
whereby two or more applicants entitled to comparative consideration of 
their applications join in one (or more) of the existing applications 
and request dismissal of their other application (or applications) to 
avoid the delay and cost of comparative consideration;
    (5) The amendment corrects typographical, transcription, or similar 
clerical errors which are clearly demonstrated to be mistakes by 
reference to other parts of the application, and whose discovery does 
not create new or increased frequency conflicts; or
    (6) The amendment does not create new or increased frequency 
conflicts, and is demonstrably necessitated by events which the 
applicant could not have reasonably foreseen at the time of filing, such 
as, for example:
    (i) The loss of a transmitter or receiver site by condemnation, 
natural causes, or loss of lease or option;
    (ii) Obstruction of a proposed transmission path caused by the 
erection of a new building or other structure; or
    (iii) The discontinuance or substantial technological obsolescence 
of specified equipment, whenever the application has been pending before 
the Commission for two or more years from the date of its filing.
    (g) Applicants for the 932.5-935/941.5-944 MHz bands shall select a 
frequency pair. Applicants for these bands may select an unpaired 
frequency only upon a showing that spectrum efficiency will not be 
impaired and that unpaired spectrum is not available in other bands. 
During the initial filing window, frequency coordination is not 
required, except that an application for a frequency in the 942-944 MHz 
band must

[[Page 635]]

be coordinated to ensure that it does not affect an existing broadcast 
auxiliary service licensee. After the initial filing window, an 
applicant must submit evidence that frequency coordination has been 
performed with all licensees affected by the application. All frequency 
coordination must be performed in accordance with Sec. 101.103. In the 
event of mutually exclusive applications occurring during the initial 
filing window for the 932.5-935/941.5-944 MHz bands, applicants shall be 
given the opportunity to resolve these situations by applying for an 
alternative frequency pair, if one is available. To the extent that 
there are no other available frequencies or to the extent that mutually 
exclusive applications remain after this process is concluded, lotteries 
shall be conducted for each frequency pair among all remaining mutually 
exclusive applications, assuming appropriate coordination with existing 
broadcast auxiliary stations can be concluded, where necessary. In the 
event of mutually exclusive applications being received for these bands 
on the same day after the initial filing window has closed and a 
subsequent filing window opened, lotteries shall be conducted for each 
frequency pair among all mutually exclusive applications.

Sec. 101.51  Comparative evaluation of mutually exclusive applications.

    (a) In order to expedite action on mutually exclusive applications 
in services under this rules part where neither competitive bidding nor 
the random selection processes apply, the applicants may request the 
Commission to consider their applications without a formal hearing in 
accordance with the summary procedure outlined in paragraph (b) in this 
section if:
    (1) The applications are entitled to comparative consideration 
pursuant to Sec. 101.45;
    (2) The applications have not been designated for formal evidentiary 
hearing; and
    (3) The Commission determines, initially or at any time during the 
procedure outline in paragraph (b) of this section, that such procedure 
is appropriate, and that, from the information submitted and 
consideration of such other matters as may be officially noticed, there 
are no substantial and material questions of fact, presented (Other than 
those relating to the comparative merits of the applications) which 
would preclude a grant under Sec. 1.915 of this chapter.
    (b) Provided that the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section 
are satisfied, applicants may request the Commission to act upon their 
mutually exclusive applications without a formal hearing pursuant to the 
summary procedure outlined below:
    (1) To initiate the procedure, each applicant will submit to the 
Commission a written statement containing:
    (i) A waiver of the applicant's right to a formal hearing;
    (ii) A request and agreement that, in order to avoid the delay and 
expense of a comparative formal hearing, the Commission should exercise 
its judgment to select from among the mutually exclusive applications 
that proposal (or proposals) which would best serve the public interest; 
and
    (iii) The signature of a principal (and the principal's attorney if 
represented).
    (2) After receipt of the written requests of all of the applicants 
the Commission (if it deems this procedure appropriate) will issue a 
notice designating the comparative criteria upon which the applications 
are to be evaluated and will request each applicant to submit, within a 
specified period of time, additional information concerning the 
applicant's proposal relative to the comparative criteria.
    (3) Within thirty (30) days following the due date for filing this 
information, the Commission will accept concise and factual argument on 
the competing proposals from the rival applicants, potential customers, 
and other knowledgeable parties in interest.
    (4) Within fifteen (15) days following the due date for the filing 
of comments, the Commission will accept concise and factual replies from 
the rival applicants.

[[Page 636]]

    (5) From time to time during the course of this procedure the 
Commission may request additional information from the applicants and 
hold informal conferences at which all competing applicants will have 
the right to be represented.
    (6) Upon evaluation of the applications, the information submitted, 
and such other matters as may be officially noticed the Commission will 
issue a decision granting one (or more) of the proposals which it 
concludes would best serve the public interest, convenience and 
necessity. The decision will report briefly and concisely the reasons 
for the Commission's selection and will deny the other application(s). 
This decision will be considered final.

      License Transfers, Modifications, Conditions and Forfeitures


<R05>
Sec. 101.55  Considerations involving transfer or assignment applications.

    (a) Except as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section, 
licenses not authorized pursuant to competitive bidding procedures may 
not be assigned or transferred prior to the completion of construction 
of the facility.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) At its discretion, the Commission may require the submission of 
an affirmative, factual showing (supported by affidavits of a person or 
persons with personal knowledge thereof) to demonstrate that the 
proposed assignor or transferor has not acquired an authorization or 
operated a station for the principal purpose of profitable sale rather 
than public service. This showing may include, for example, a 
demonstration that the proposed assignment or transfer is due to changed 
circumstances (described in detail) affecting the licensee subsequent to 
the acquisition of the license, or that the proposed transfer of radio 
facilities is incidental to a sale of other facilities or merger of 
interests.
    (d) If a proposed transfer of radio facilities is incidental to a 
sale or other facilities or merger of interests, the showing specified 
under paragraph (c) of this section shall be submitted and include an 
additional exhibit that:
    (1) Discloses complete details as to the sale of facilities or 
merger of interests;
    (2) Segregates clearly by an itemized accounting, the amount of 
consideration involved in the sale of facilities or merger of interests; 
and
    (3) Demonstrates that the amount of consideration assignable to the 
facilities or business interests involved represents their fair market 
value at the time of the transaction.

Sec. 101.56  Partitioned service areas (PSAs) and disaggregated spectrum.

    (a)(1) The holder of an EA authorization to provide service pursuant 
to the competitive bidding process and any incumbent licensee of 
rectangular service areas in the 38.6-40.0 GHz band may enter into 
agreements with eligible parties to partition any portion of its service 
area as defined by the partitioner and partitionee. Alternatively, 
licensees may enter into agreements or contracts to disaggregate any 
portion of spectrum, provided acquired spectrum is disaggregated 
according to frequency pairs.
    (2)(i) Contracts must be filed with the Commission within 30 days of 
the date that such agreements are reached.
    (ii) The contracts must include descriptions of the areas being 
partitioned or spectrum disaggregated. The partitioned service area 
shall be defined by coordinate points at every 3 seconds along the 
partitioned service area unless an FCC recognized service area is 
utilized (i.e., Metropolitan Service Area or Rural Service Area) or 
county lines are followed. If geographic coordinate points are used, 
they must be specified in degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest 
second of latitude and longitude and must be based upon the 1983 North 
American Datum (NAD83). In the case where an FCC recognized service area 
or county lines are utilized, applicants need only list the specific 
area(s) (through use of FCC designations or county names) that 
constitute the partitioned area.

[[Page 637]]

    (b) The eligibility requirements applicable to EA authorization 
holders also apply to those individuals and entities seeking partitioned 
or disaggregated spectrum authorizations.
    (c) Subsequent to issuance of the authorization for a partitioned 
service area, the partitioned area will be treated as a separate 
protected service area.
    (d)(1) When any area within an EA becomes a partitioned service 
area, the remaining counties and geopolitical subdivision within that EA 
will be subsequently treated and classified as a partitioned service 
area.
    (2) At the time an EA is partitioned, the Commission shall cancel 
the EA authorization initially issued and issue a partitioned service 
area authorization to the former EA authorization holder.
    (e) At the time a BTA is partitioned, the Commission shall cancel 
the BTA authorization initially issued and issue a partitioned service 
area authorization to the former BTA authorization holder.
    (f) The duties and responsibilities imposed upon EA authorization 
holders in this part, apply to those licensees obtaining authorizations 
by partitioning or spectrum disaggregation.
    (g) The build-out requirements for the partitioned service area or 
disaggregated spectrum shall be the same as applied to the EA 
authorization holder.
    (h) The license term for the partitioned service area or 
disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the period that would 
apply to the EA authorization holder.
    (i) Licensees, including those using bidding credits in a 
competitive bidding procedure, shall have the authority to partition 
service areas or disaggregate spectrum.

in the Local Multipoint Distribution Service and 24 GHz Service

    In the Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) licensees may 
add, remove, or relocate facilities within the area authorized by the 
license without prior authorization. Upon request by an incumbent 
licensee or the Commission, an LMDS licensee shall furnish the technical 
parameters, location and coordinates of the completion of the addition, 
removal, relocation or modification of any of its facilities within the 
BTA. The LMDS licensee must provide such information within ten (10) 
days of receiving a written request. This section also applies to 24 GHz

    (a) Each Station, except in Multichannel Video Distribution and Data 
Service, Local Multipoint Distribution Services, 24 GHz Service, and the 
38.6-40.0 GHz band, authorized under this part must be in operation 
within 18 months from the initial date of grant.
    (b) For the 70 GHz, 80 GHz, and 90 GHz bands, the 12-month 
construction period will commence on the date of each registration of 
each individual link; adding links will not change the overall renewal 
period of the license.
    (c) Failure to timely begin operation means the authorization 
cancels automatically.
    (d) The frequencies associated with all point-to-multipoint 
authorizations which have cancelled automatically or otherwise been 
recovered by the Commission will again be made available for 
reassignment on a date and under terms set forth by Public Notice. See 
Sec. 101.1331(d) for treatment of MAS incumbent site-by-site licenses 
recovered in EAs.
    (e) Requests for extension of time may be granted upon a showing of 
good cause pursuant to Sec. 1.946(e) of this chapter.
    (f) Construction of any authorized facility or frequency must be 
completed

by the date specified in the license as pursuant to Sec. 1.946 of this 
chapter.
    (g) MVPD licensees which have both analog and digital emissions 
designators specified on the license and which already have, or may 
transition from analog to digital operations, or a combination of both, 
meet their completion of construction requirements and do not 
automatically surrender their license provided they are using either set 
of emissions. If the licensee has completed the transition to digital, 
the license can remove the unused analog emission designators the next 
time a modification or renewal application is filed.

(MSS). The rules in this section provide for a transition period during 
which ET licensees may relocate existing FMS licensees using these 
frequencies to other media or other fixed channels, including those in 
other microwave bands.
    (a) ET licensees may negotiate with FMS licensees authorized to use 
frequencies in the 1850-1990 MHz, 2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz 
bands, for the purpose of agreeing to terms under which the FMS 
licensees would:
    (1) Relocate their operations to other fixed microwave bands or 
other media; or alternatively
    (2) Accept a sharing arrangement with the ET licensee that may 
result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the FMS 
operations.

(MSS) operators (including MSS operators providing Ancillary Terrestrial 
Component (ATC) service) and AWS licensees in the 2110-2150 MHz and 
2160-2200 MHz bands will be subject to mandatory negotiations only.
    (b) Once mandatory negotiations have begun, an FMS licensee may not 
refuse to negotiate and all parties are required to negotiate in good 
faith. Good faith requires each party to provide information to the 
other that is reasonably necessary to facilitate the relocation process. 
In evaluating claims that a party has not negotiated in good faith, the 
FCC will consider, inter alia, the following factors:
    (1) Whether the ET licensee has made a bona fide offer to relocate 
the FMS licensee to comparable facilities in accordance with Section 
101.75(b);
    (2) If the FMS licensee has demanded a premium, the type of premium 
requested (e.g., whether the premium is directly related to relocation, 
such as system-wide relocations and analog-to-digital conversions, 
versus other types of premiums), and whether the value of the premium as 
compared to the cost of providing comparable facilities is 
disproportionate (i.e., whether there is a lack of proportion or 
relation between the two);
    (3) What steps the parties have taken to determine the actual cost 
of relocation to comparable facilities;
    (4) Whether either party has withheld information requested by the 
other party that is necessary to estimate relocation costs or to 
facilitate the relocation process.
    (c) Any party alleging a violation of our good faith requirement 
must attach an independent estimate of the relocation costs in question 
to any documentation filed with the Commission in support of its claim. 
An independent cost estimate must include a specification for the 
comparable facility and a statement of the costs associated with 
providing that facility to the incumbent licensee.
    (d) Provisions for Relocation of Fixed Microwave Licensees in the 
2110-2150 and 2160-2200 MHz bands. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 
101.69(e) pertaining to FMS relocations by MSS/ATC operators, a separate 
mandatory negotiation period will commence for each FMS licensee when an 
ET licensee informs that FMS licensee in writing of its desire to 
negotiate. Mandatory negotiations will be conducted with the goal of 
providing the FMS licensee with comparable facilities defined as 
facilities possessing the following characteristics:

[[Page 640]]

    (1) Throughput. Communications throughput is the amount of 
information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. If 
analog facilities are being replaced with analog, comparable facilities 
provide an equivalent number of 4 kHz voice channels. If digital 
facilities are being replaced with digital, comparable facilities 
provide equivalent data loading bits per second (bps).
    (2) Reliability. System reliability is the degree to which 
information is transferred accurately within a system. Comparable 
facilities provide reliability equal to the overall reliability of the 
FMS system. For digital systems, reliability is measured by the percent 
of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value, and for analog 
or digital voice transmission, it is measured by the percent of time 
that audio signal quality meets an established threshold. If an analog 
system is replaced with a digital system, only the resulting frequency 
response, harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise and its reliability will 
be considered in determining comparable reliability.
    (3) Operating Costs. Operating costs are the cost to operate and 
maintain the FMS system. ET licensees would compensate FMS licensees for 
any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities 
(e.g., additional rental payments, and increased utility fees) for five 
years after relocation. ET licensees could satisfy this obligation by 
making a lump-sum payment based on present value using current interest 
rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the FMS licensee would be 
equivalent to the 2 GHz system in order for the replacement system to be 
comparable.

Sec. 101.75  Involuntary relocation procedures.

    (a) If no agreement is reached during the mandatory negotiation 
period, an ET licensee may initiate involuntary relocation procedures 
under the Commission's rules. ET licensees are obligated to pay to 
relocated only the specific microwave links to which their systems pose 
an interference problem. Under involuntary relocation, the FMS licensee 
is required to relocate, provided that the ET licensee:
    (1) Guarantees payment of relocation costs, including all 
engineering, equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any legitimate and 
prudent transaction expenses incurred by the FMS licensee that are 
directly attributable to an involuntary relocation, subject to a cap of 
two percent of the hard costs involved. Hard costs are defined as the 
actual costs associated with providing a replacement system, such as 
equipment and engineering expenses. ET licensees are not required to pay 
FMS licensees for internal resources devoted to the relocation process. 
ET licensees are not required to pay for transaction costs incurred by 
FMS licensees during the voluntary or mandatory periods once the 
involuntary period is initiated, or for fees that cannot be legitimately 
tied to the provision of comparable facilities;
    (2) Completes all activities necessary for implementing the 
replacement facilities, including engineering and cost analysis of the 
relocation procedure and, if radio facilities are used, identifying and 
obtaining, on the incumbents' behalf, new microwave frequencies and 
frequency coordination; and
    (3) Builds the replacement system and tests it for comparability 
with the existing 2 GHz system.
    (b) Comparable facilities. The replacement system provided to an 
incumbent during an involuntary relocation must be at least equivalent 
to the existing FMS system with respect to the following three factors:
    (1) Throughput. Communications throughput is the amount of 
information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. If 
analog facilities are being replaced with analog, the ET licensee is 
required to provide the FMS licensee with an equivalent number of 4 kHz 
voice channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital, 
the ET licensee must provide the FMS licensee with equivalent data 
loading bits per second (bps). ET licensees must provide FMS licensees 
with enough throughput to satisfy the

[[Page 641]]

FMS licensee's system use at the time of relocation, not match the total 
capacity of the FMS system.
    (2) Reliability. System reliability is the degree to which 
information is transferred accurately within a system. ET licensees must 
provide FMS licensees with reliability equal to the overall reliability 
of their system. For digital data systems, reliability is measured by 
the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value, 
and for analog or digital voice transmissions, it is measured by the 
percent of time that audio signal quality meets an established 
threshold. If an analog voice system is replaced with a digital voice 
system, only the resulting frequency response, harmonic distortion, 
signal-to-noise ratio and its reliability will be considered in 
determining comparable reliability.
    (3) Operating costs. Operating costs are the cost to operate and 
maintain the FMS system. ET licensees must compensate FMS licensees for 
any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities 
(e.g., additional rental payments, increased utility fees) for five 
years after relocation. ET licensees may satisfy this obligation by 
making a lump-sum payment based on present value using current interest 
rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the FMS licensee must be 
equivalent to the 2 GHz system in order for the replacement system to be 
considered comparable.
    (c) The FMS licensee is not required to relocate until the 
alternative facilities are available to it for a reasonable time to make 
adjustments, determine comparability, and ensure a seamless handoff.
    (d) Twelve-month trial period. If, within one year after the 
relocation to new facilities, the FMS licensee demonstrates that the new 
facilities are not comparable to the former facilities, the ET licensee 
must remedy the defects or pay to relocate the microwave licensee to one 
of the following: its former or equivalent 2 GHz channels, another 
comparable frequency band, a land-line system, or any other facility 
that satisfies the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section. This trial period commences on the date that the FMS licensee 
begins full operation of the replacement link. If the FMS licensee has 
retained its 2 GHz authorization during the trial period, it must return 
the license to the Commission at the end of the twelve months. FMS 
licensees relocated from the 2110-2150 and 2160-2200 MHz bands may not 
be returned to their former 2 GHz channels. All other remedies specified 
in paragraph (d) are available to FMS licensees relocated from the 2110-
2150 MHz and 2160-2200 MHz bands, and may be invoked whenever the FMS 
licensee demonstrates that its replacement facility is not comparable, 
subject to no time limit.

Sec. 101.77  Public safety licensees in the 1850-1990 MHz, 
2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz bands.

    (a) In order for public safety licensees to qualify for a three year 
mandatory negotiation period as defined in Sec. 101.69(d)(2), the 
department head responsible for system oversight must certify to the ET 
licensee requesting relocation that:
    (1) The agency is a Police licensee, a Fire Licensee, or an 
Emergency Medical Licensee as defined in Sec. 90.7 of this chapter, or 
meets the eligibility requirements of Sec. 90.20(a)(2) of this chapter, 
except for Sec. 90.20(a)(2)(ii) of this chapter, or that it is a 
licensee of other part 101 facilities licensed on a primary basis under 
the eligibility requirements of part 90, subpart B of this chapter; and
    (2) The majority of communications carried on the facilities at 
issue involve safety of life and property.
    (b) A public safety licensee must provide certification within 
thirty (30) days of a request from a ET licensee, or the ET licensee may 
presume that special treatment is inapplicable. If a public safety 
licensee falsely certifies to an ET licensee that it qualifies for the 
extended time periods, this licensee

[[Page 642]]

will be in violation of the Commission's rules and will subject to 
appropriate penalties, as well as immediately subject to the non-public 
safety time periods.

Sec. 101.79  Sunset provisions for licensees in the 1850-1990 MHz,
2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz bands.

    (a) FMS licensees will maintain primary status in the 1850-1990 MHz, 
2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz bands unless and until an ET licensee 
(including MSS/ATC operator) requires use of the spectrum. ET licensees 
are not required to pay relocation costs after the relocation rules 
sunset. Once the relocation rules sunset, an ET licensee may require the 
incumbent to cease operations, provided that the ET licensee intends to 
turn on a system within interference range of the incumbent, as 
determined by TIA TSB 10-F (for terrestrial-to-terrestrial situations) 
or TIA TSB 86 (for MSS satellite-to-terrestrial situations) or any 
standard successor. ET licensee notification to the affected FMS 
licensee must be in writing and must provide the incumbent with no less 
than six months to vacate the spectrum. After the six-month notice 
period has expired, the FMS licensee must turn its license back into the 
Commission, unless the parties have entered into an agreement which 
allows the FMS licensee to continue to operate on a mutually agreed upon 
basis. The date that the relocation rules sunset is determined as 
follows:
    (1) For the 2110-2150 MHz and 2160-2175 MHz and 2175-2180 MHz bands, 
ten years after the first ET license is issued in the respective band; 
and
    (2) For the 2180-2200 MHz band, December 8, 2013 (i.e., ten years 
after the mandatory negotiation period begins for MSS/ATC operators in 
the service).
    (b) If the parties cannot agree on a schedule or an alternative 
arrangement, requests for extension will be accepted and reviewed on a 
case-by-case basis. The Commission will grant such extensions only if 
the incumbent can demonstrate that:
    (1) It cannot relocate within the six-month period (e.g., because no 
alternative spectrum or other reasonable option is available), and;
    (2) The public interest would be harmed if the incumbent is forced 
to terminate operations (e.g., if public safety communications services 
would be disrupted).

Sec. 101.81  Future licensing in the 1850-1990 MHz, 2110-2150 MHz, 
and 2160-2200 MHz bands.

    After April 25, 1996, all major modifications and extensions to 
existing FMS systems in the 1850-1990 MHz, 2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 
MHz bands will be authorized on a secondary basis to ET systems. All 
other modifications will render the modified FMS license secondary to ET 
operations, unless the incumbent affirmatively justifies primary status 
and the incumbent FMS licensee establishes that the modification would 
not add to the relocation costs of ET licensees. Incumbent FMS licensees 
will maintain primary status for the following technical changes:
    (a) Decreases in power;
    (b) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in antenna height;
    (c) Minor location changes (up to two seconds);
    (d) Any data correction which does not involve a change in the 
location of an existing facility;
    (e) Reductions in authorized bandwidth;
    (f) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in structure height;
    (g) Changes (increases or decreases) in ground elevation that do not 
affect centerline height;
    (h) Minor equipment changes.

Sec. 101.82  Reimbursement and relocation expenses in the 
2110-2150 MHz and 2160-2200 MHz bands.

    (a) Reimbursement and relocation expenses for the 2110-2130 MHz and 
2160-2180 MHz bands are addressed in Sec. Sec. 27.1160-27.1174.

[[Page 643]]

    (b) Cost-sharing obligations between AWS and MSS (space-to-Earth 
downlink). Whenever an ET licensee (AWS or Mobile Satellite Service for 
space-to-Earth downlink in the 2130-2150 or 2180-2200 MHz bands) 
relocates an incumbent paired microwave link with one path in the 2130-
2150 MHz band and the paired path in the 2180-2200 MHz band, the 
relocator is entitled to reimbursement of 50 percent of its relocation 
costs (see paragraph (e)) of this section from any other AWS licensee or 
MSS space-to-Earth downlink operator which would have been required to 
relocate the same fixed microwave link as set forth in paragraphs (c) 
and (d) of this section.
    (c) Cost-sharing obligations for MSS (space-to-Earth downlinks). For 
an MSS space-to-Earth downlink, the cost-sharing obligation is based on 
the interference criteria for relocation, i.e., TIA TSB 86 or any 
standard successor, relative to the relocated microwave link. 
Subsequently entering MSS space-to-Earth downlink operators must 
reimburse AWS or MSS space-to-Earth relocators (see paragraph (e)) of 
this section before the later entrant may begin operations in these 
bands, unless the later entrant can demonstrate that it would not have 
interfered with the microwave link in question.
    (d) Cost-sharing obligations among terrestrial stations. For 
terrestrial stations (AWS and MSS Ancillary Terrestrial Component 
(ATC)), cost-sharing obligations are governed by Sec. Sec. 27.1160 
through 27.1174 of this chapter; provided, however, that MSS operators 
(including MSS/ATC operators) are not obligated to reimburse voluntarily 
relocating FMS incumbents in the 2180-2200 MHz band. (AWS reimbursement 
and cost-sharing obligations relative to voluntarily relocating FMS 
incumbents are governed by Sec. 27.1166 of this chapter).
    (e) The total costs of which 50 percent is to be reimbursed will not 
exceed $250,000 per paired fixed microwave link relocated, with an 
additional $150,000 permitted if a new or modified tower is required.

Sec. 101.85  Transition of the 18.3-19.3 GHz band from the 
terrestrial fixed services to the fixed-satellite service (FSS).

    Fixed services (FS) frequencies in the 18.3-19.3 GHz bands listed in 
Sec. Sec. 21.901(e), 74.502(c), 74.602(g), and 78.18(a)(4) and Sec. 
101.147(a) and (r) of this chapter have been allocated for use by the 
fixed-satellite service (FSS). The rules in this section provide for a 
transition period during which FSS licensees may relocate existing FS 
licensees using these frequencies to other frequency bands, media or 
facilities.
    (a) FSS licensees may negotiate with FS licensees authorized to use 
frequencies in the 18.3-19.30 GHz bands for the purpose of agreeing to 
terms under which the FS licensees would:
    (1) Relocate their operations to other frequency bands, media or 
facilities; or alternatively
    (2) Accept a sharing arrangement with the FSS licensee that may 
result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the FSS 
operations.
    (b)(1) FS operations in the 18.3-18.58 GHz band that remain co-
primary under the provisions of Sec. Sec. 21.901(e), 74.502(c), 
74.602(d), 78.18(a)(4) and 101.147(r) of this chapter will continue to 
be co-primary with the FSS users of this spectrum until November 19, 
2012 or until the relocation of the fixed service operations, whichever 
occurs sooner.
    (2) FS operations in the 18.58-19.3 GHz band that remain co-primary 
under the

[[Page 644]]

provisions of Sec. Sec. 21.901(e), 74.502(c), 74.602(d), 78.18(a)(4) 
and 101.147(r) of this chapter will continue to be co-primary with the 
FSS users of this spectrum until June 8, 2010 or until the relocation of 
the fixed service operations, whichever occurs sooner, except for 
operations in the band 19.26-19.3 GHz and low power systems operating 
pursuant to Sec. 101.47(r)(10), which shall operate on a co-primary 
basis until October 31, 2011.
    (3) If no agreement is reached during the negotiations pursuant to 
Sec. 101.85(a), an FSS licensee may initiate relocation procedures. 
Under the relocation procedures, the incumbent is required to relocate, 
provided that the FSS licensee meets the conditions of Sec. 101.91.
    (c) Negotiation periods are defined as follows:
    (1) Non-public safety incumbents will have a two-year negotiation 
period.
    (2) Public safety incumbents will have a three-year negotiation 
period.

Sec. 101.89  Negotiations.

    (a) The negotiation is triggered by the fixed-satellite service 
(FSS) licensee, who must contact the fixed services (FS) licensee and 
request that negotiations begin.
    (b) Once negotiations have begun, an FS licensee may not refuse to 
negotiate and all parties are required to negotiate in good faith. Good 
faith requires each party to provide information to the other that is 
reasonably necessary to facilitate the relocation process. In evaluating 
claims that a party has not negotiated in good faith, the FCC will 
consider, inter alia, the following factors:
    (1) Whether the FSS licensee has made a bona fide offer to relocate 
the FS licensee to comparable facilities in accordance with Sec. 
101.91(b);
    (2) If the FS licensee has demanded a premium, the type of premium 
requested (e.g., whether the premium is directly related to relocation, 
such as system-wide relocations and analog-to-digital conversions, 
versus other types of premiums), and whether the value of the premium as 
compared to the cost of providing comparable facilities is 
disproportionate (i.e., whether there is a lack of proportion or 
relation between the two);
    (3) What steps the parties have taken to determine the actual cost 
of relocation to comparable facilities;
    (4) Whether either party has withheld information requested by the 
other party that is necessary to estimate relocation costs or to 
facilitate the relocation process.
    (c) Any party alleging a violation of our good faith requirement 
must attach an independent estimate of the relocation costs in question 
to any documentation filed with the Commission in support of its claim. 
An independent cost estimate must include a specification for the 
comparable facility and a statement of the costs associated with 
providing that facility to the incumbent licensee.
    (d) Negotiations will commence when the FSS licensee informs the FS 
licensee in writing of its desire to negotiate. Negotiations will be 
conducted with the goal of providing the FS licensee with comparable 
facilities, defined as facilities possessing the following 
characteristics:
    (1) Throughput. Communications throughput is the amount of 
information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. If 
analog facilities are being replaced with analog, the FSS licensee is 
required to provide the FS licensee with an equivalent number of 4 kHz 
voice channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital, 
the FSS licensee must provide the FS licensee with equivalent data 
loading bits per second (bps). FSS licensees must provide FS licensees 
with enough throughput to satisfy the FS licensee's system use at the 
time of relocation, not match the total capacity of the FS system.
    (2) Reliability. System reliability is the degree to which 
information is transferred accurately within a system. FSS licensees 
must provide FS licensees with reliability equal to the overall 
reliability of their system. For digital data systems, reliability is 
measured by the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a 
desired value, and for analog or digital voice transmissions, it is 
measured by the

[[Page 645]]

percent of time that audio signal quality meets an established 
threshold. If an analog voice system is replaced with a digital voice 
system, only the resulting frequency response, harmonic distortion, 
signal-to-noise ratio and its reliability will be considered in 
determining comparable reliability.
    (3) Operating costs. Operating costs are the cost to operate and 
maintain the FS system. FSS licensees must compensate FS licensees for 
any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities 
(e.g., additional rental payments, increased utility fees) for five 
years after relocation. FSS licensees may satisfy this obligation by 
making a lump-sum payment based on present value using current interest 
rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the FS licensee must be 
equivalent to the 18 GHz system in order for the replacement system to 
be considered comparable.


<R05>
Sec. 101.91  Involuntary relocation procedures.

    (a) If no agreement is reached during the negotiations period, an 
FSS licensee may initiate relocation procedures under the Commission's 
rules. FSS licensees are obligated to pay to relocate only the specific 
microwave links from which their systems may receive interference. Under 
these procedures, the FS licensee is required to relocate, provided that 
the FSS licensee:
    (1) Guarantees payment of relocation costs, including all 
engineering, equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any legitimate and 
prudent transaction expenses incurred by the FS licensee that are 
directly attributable to the relocation, subject to a cap of two percent 
of the hard costs involved. Hard costs are defined as the actual costs 
associated with providing a replacement system, such as equipment and 
engineering expenses. FSS licensees are not required to pay FS licensees 
for internal resources devoted to the relocation process. FSS licensees 
are not required to pay for transaction costs incurred by FS licensees 
during the negotiations once the negotiation is initiated, or for fees 
that cannot be legitimately tied to the provision of comparable 
facilities;
    (2) Completes all activities necessary for implementing the 
replacement facilities, including engineering and cost analysis of the 
relocation procedure and, if radio facilities are used, identifying and 
obtaining, on the incumbents' behalf, new microwave frequencies and 
frequency coordination; and
    (3) Builds the replacement system and tests it for comparability 
with the existing 18 GHz system.
    (b) Comparable facilities. The replacement system provided to an 
incumbent during a relocation must be at least equivalent to the 
existing FS system with respect to the following three factors:
    (1) Throughput. Communications throughput is the amount of 
information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. If 
analog facilities are being replaced with analog, the FSS licensee is 
required to provide the FS licensee with an equivalent number of 4 kHz 
voice channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital, 
the FSS licensee must provide the FS licensee with equivalent data 
loading bits per second (bps). FSS licensees must provide FS licensees 
with enough throughput to satisfy the FS licensee's system use at the

    (2) Reliability. System reliability is the degree to which 
information is transferred accurately within a system. FSS licensees 
must provide FS licensees with reliability equal to the overall 
reliability of their system. For digital data systems, reliability is 
measured by the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a

established threshold. If an analog voice system is replaced with a 
digital voice system, only the resulting frequency response, harmonic 
distortion, signal-to-noise ratio and its reliability will be considered 
in determining comparable reliability.
    (3) Operating costs. Operating costs are the cost to operate and 
maintain the FS system. FSS licensees must compensate FS licensees for 
any increased recurring costs associated with

[[Page 646]]

the replacement facilities (e.g., additional rental payments, increased 
utility fees) for five years after relocation. FSS licensees may satisfy 
this obligation by making a lump-sum payment based on present value 
using current interest rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the 
FS licensee must be equivalent to the 18 GHz system in order for the 
replacement system to be considered comparable.
    (c) The FS licensee is not required to relocate until the 
alternative facilities are available to it for a reasonable time to make 
adjustments, determine comparability, and ensure a seamless handoff. The 
FS licensee may take up to 12 months to make such adjustments and 
perform such testing.
    (d) If the FS licensee demonstrates to the Commission that the new 
facilities are not comparable to the former facilities, the Commission 
may require the FSS licensee to further modify or replace the FS 
licensee's equipment.

Sec. 101.95  Sunset provisions for licensees in the 18.30-19.30
GHz band.

    (a) FSS licensees are not required to pay relocation costs after the 
relocation rules sunset (see Sec. Sec. 74.502(c), 74.602(g), and 
78.18(a)(4) of this chapter, and 101.147 (a) and (r)). Once the 
relocation rules sunset, an FSS licensee may require the incumbent to 
cease operations, provided that the FSS licensee intends to turn on a 
system within interference range of the incumbent, as determined by TIA 
Bulletin 10-F or any standard successor. FSS licensee notification to 
the affected FS licensee must be in writing and must provide the 
incumbent with no less than six months to vacate the spectrum. After the 
six-month notice period has expired, the FS licensee must turn its 
license back into the Commission, unless the parties have entered into 
an agreement which allows the FS licensee to continue to operate on a 
mutually agreed upon basis.
    (b) If the parties cannot agree on a schedule or an alternative 
arrangement, requests for extension will be accepted and reviewed on a 
case-by-case basis. The Commission will grant such extensions only if 
the incumbent can demonstrate that:
    (1) It cannot relocate within the six-month period (e.g., because no 
alternative spectrum or other reasonable option is available); and
    (2) The public interest would be harmed if the incumbent is forced 
to terminate operations (e.g., if public safety communications services 
would be disrupted).


<R05>
Sec. 101.97  Future licensing in the 18.30-19.30 GHz band.

    (a) All major modifications and extensions to existing FS systems in 
the 18.3-18.58 band after November 19, 2002, or in the 18.58-19.30 band 
after June 8, 2000 (with the exception of certain low power operations 
authorized under Sec. 101.147(r)(10)) will be authorized on a secondary 
basis to FSS systems. All other modifications will render the modified 
FS license secondary to FSS operations, unless the incumbent 
affirmatively justifies primary status and the incumbent FS licensee 
establishes that the modification would not add to the relocation costs 
for FSS licensees. Incumbent FS licensees will maintain primary status 
for the following technical changes:
    (1) Decreases in power;
    (2) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in antenna height;
    (3) Minor location changes (up to two seconds);
    (4) Any data correction which does not involve a change in the 
location of an existing facility;
    (5) Reductions in authorized bandwidth;
    (6) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in structure height;
    (7) Changes (increases or decreases) in ground elevation that do not 
affect centerline height;
    (8) Minor equipment changes.
    (9) Changes in ownership or control.
    (b) The provisions of Sec. 101.83 are applicable, notwithstanding 
any other provisions of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 101.103  Frequency coordination procedures.

    (a) Assignment of frequencies will be made only in such a manner as 
to facilitate the rendition of communication service on an interference-
free basis in each service area. Unless otherwise indicated, each 
frequency available for use by stations in these services will be 
assigned exclusively to a single applicant in any service area. All 
applicants for, and licensees of, stations in these services must 
cooperate in the selection and use of the frequencies assigned in order 
to minimize interference and thereby obtain the most effective use of 
the authorized facilities. In the event harmful interference occurs or 
appears likely to occur between two or more radio systems and such 
interference cannot be resolved between the licensees thereof, the 
Commission may specify a time sharing arrangement for the stations 
involved or may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, require the 
licensees to make such changes in operating techniques or equipment as 
it may deem necessary to avoid such interference.
    (b)(1) Operations in the bands 31,000-31,075 MHz and 31,225-31,300 
MHz licensed prior to March 11, 1997, were licensed on an unprotected 
basis and are subject to harmful interference from similarly licensed 
operations in that band.
    (i) Operations licensed in the Local Mulitpoint Distribution Service 
and those operations licensed prior to March 11, 1997, except in the 
Local Television Transmission Service, operating in these bands are 
equally protected against harmful interference from each other.
    (ii) In the case of operations licensed prior to March 11, 1997, 
except in the Local Television Transmission Service, that are licensed 
on a point-to-radius basis, LMDS licensees shall be subject to the 
protection requirement established in this section in the case of 
existing links operated by such licensees, and in the case of links 
added by such licensees in the future in accordance with the terms of 
their point-to-radius licenses.
    (iii) An LMDS licensee may not initiate operations within the point-
to-radius area licensed to an operator (other than an operator in the 
Local Television Transmission Service) prior to March 11, 1997, even if 
such operator has not initiated operations to the fullest extent of the 
license. An LMDS licensee, however, may initiate operations at the 
border of such operator's license area without prior coordination if the 
LMDS licensee's operations would not cause harmful interference to the 
other operator's existing operations.
    (iv) An operator (other than an operator in the Local Television 
Transmission Service) licensed on a point-to-radius basis prior to March 
11, 1997, may add additional stations within its license area. Such 
operator shall coordinate with any affected LMDS licensee if its new 
operations might cause harmful interference to the existing operations 
of such LMDS licensee.
    (v) Operations licensed prior to March 11, 1997, on a point-to-point 
basis may not be extended or otherwise modified through the addition of 
point-to-point links. Such operations shall be limited to the use of 
frequency pairs licensed as of March 11, 1997. Operations licensed in 
the Local Television Transmission Service as of March 11, 1997, may 
continue to operate, but such operators may not expand existing 
operations nor initiate new operations.
    (2) Operations in the 31,075-31,225 MHz band licensed prior to March 
11, 1997, shall receive no protection against harmful interference from 
authorized operations in the Local Multipoint Distribution Service in 
that band.
    (3) Non-LMDS operations in the entire 31,000-31,300 MHz band 
licensed after March 11, 1997, based on applications refiled no later 
than June 26, 1998 are unprotected with respect to each other and 
subject to harmful interference from each other.
    (i) Such operations and any operations licensed prior to March 11, 
1997, in the band are unprotected with respect to each other and subject 
to harmful interference from each other.
    (ii) Such operations are licensed on a secondary basis to LMDS 
operations licensed in the band, may not cause interference to LMDS 
operations, and are

[[Page 649]]

not protected from interference from LMDS operations.
    (iii) Such operations licensed on a point-to-point basis may not be 
extended or otherwise modified through the addition of point-to-point 
links. Such operations licensed on a point-to-radius basis may add 
additional stations within the licensed area.
    (c) Frequency diversity transmission will not be authorized in these 
services in the absence of a factual showing that the required 
communications cannot practically be achieved by other means. Where 
frequency diversity is deemed to be justified on a protection channel 
basis, it will be limited to one protection channel for the bands 3,700-
4,200, 5925-6425, and 6525-6875 MHz, and a ratio of one protection 
channel for three working channels for the bands 10,550-10,680 and 
10,700-11,700 MHz. In the bands 3,700-4,200, 5,925-6,425, and 6525-6875 
MHz, no frequency diversity protection channel will be authorized unless 
there is a minimum of three working channels, except that where a 
substantial showing is made that a total of three working channels will 
be required within three years, a protection channel may be authorized 
simultaneously with the first working channel. A protection channel 
authorized under such exception will be subject to termination if 
applications for the third working channel are not filed within three 
years of the grant date of the applications for the first working 
channel. Where equipment employing digital modulation techniques with 
cross-polarized operation on the same frequency is used, the protection 
channel authorized under the above conditions may be considered to 
consist of both polarizations of the protection frequency where such is 
shown to be necessary.
    (d) Frequency coordination. For each frequency authorized under this 
part, the following frequency usage coordination procedures will apply:
    (1) General requirements. Proposed frequency usage must be prior 
coordinated with existing licensees, permittees and applicants in the 
area, and other applicants with previously filed applications, whose 
facilities could affect or be affected by the new proposal in terms of 
frequency interference on active channels, applied-for channels, or 
channels coordinated for future growth. Coordination must be completed 
prior to filing an application for regular authorization, or a major 
amendment to a pending application, or any major modification to a 
license. In coordinating frequency usage with stations in the fixed 
satellite service, applicants must also comply with the requirements of 
Sec. 101.21(f). In engineering a system or modification thereto, the 
applicant must, by appropriate studies and analyses, select sites, 
transmitters, antennas and frequencies that will avoid interference in 
excess of permissible levels to other users. All applicants and 
licensees must cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to resolve 
technical problems and conflicts that may inhibit the most effective and 
efficient use of the radio spectrum; however, the party being 
coordinated with is not obligated to suggest changes or re-engineer a 
proposal in cases involving conflicts. Applicants should make every 
reasonable effort to avoid blocking the growth of systems as prior 
coordinated. The applicant must identify in the application all entities 
with which the technical proposal was coordinated. In the event that 
technical problems are not resolved, an explanation must be submitted 
with the application. Where technical problems are resolved by an 
agreement or operating arrangement between the parties that would 
require special procedures be taken to reduce the likelihood of 
interference in excess of permissible levels (such as the use of 
artificial site shielding) or would result in a reduction of quality or 
capacity of either system, the details thereof may be contained in the 
application.
    (2) Coordination procedure guidelines are as follows:
    (i) Coordination involves two separate elements: notification and 
response. Both or either may be oral or in written form. To be 
acceptable for filing, all applications and major technical amendments 
must certify that coordination, including response, has been completed. 
The names of the licensees, permittees and applicants with which 
coordination was accomplished must be specified. If such notice and/or 
response is oral, the party

[[Page 650]]

providing such notice or response must supply written documentation of 
the communication upon request;
    (ii) Notification must include relevant technical details of the 
proposal. At minimum, this should include, as applicable, the following:
    Applicant's name and address.
    Transmitting station name.
    Transmitting station coordinates.
    Frequencies and polarizations to be added, changed or deleted.
    Transmitting equipment type, its stability, actual output power, 
emission designator, and type of modulation(s) (loading). Notification 
shall indicate if modulations lower than the values listed in the table 
to Sec. 101.141(a)(3) of the Commission's rules will be used.
    Transmitting antenna type(s), model, gain and, if required, a 
radiation pattern provided or certified by the manufacturer.
    Transmitting antenna center line height(s) above ground level and 
ground elevation above mean sea level.
    Receiving station name.
    Receiving station coordinates.
    Receiving antenna type(s), model, gain, and, if required, a 
radiation pattern provided or certified by the manufacturer.
    Receiving antenna center line height(s) above ground level and 
ground elevation above mean sea level.
    Path azimuth and distance.
    Estimated transmitter transmission line loss expressed in dB.
    Estimated receiver transmission line loss expressed in dB.
    For a system utilizing ATPC, maximum transmit power, coordinated 
transmit power, and nominal transmit power.

    Note: The position location of antenna sites shall be determined to 
an accuracy of no less than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 second in the 
horizontal dimensions (latitude and longitude) and <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>1 meter in the vertical dimension (ground elevation) 
with respect to the National Spatial Reference System.

    (iii) For transmitters employing digital modulation techniques, the 
notification should clearly identify the type of modulation. Upon 
request, additional details of the operating characteristics of the 
equipment must also be furnished;
    (iv) Response to notification should be made as quickly as possible, 
even if no technical problems are anticipated. Any response to 
notification indicating potential interference must specify the 
technical details and must be provided to the applicant, in writing, 
within the 30-day notification period. Every reasonable effort should be 
made by all applicants, permittees and licensees to eliminate all 
problems and conflicts. If no response to notification is received 
within 30 days, the applicant will be deemed to have made reasonable 
efforts to coordinate and may file its application without a response;
    (v) The 30-day notification period is calculated from the date of 
receipt by the applicant, permittee, or licensee being notified. If 
notification is by mail, this date may be ascertained by:
    (A) The return receipt on certified mail;
    (B) The enclosure of a card to be dated and returned by the 
recipient; or
    (C) A conservative estimate of the time required for the mail to 
reach its destination. In the last case, the estimated date when the 30-
day period would expire should be stated in the notification.
    (vi) An expedited prior coordination period (less than 30 days) may 
be requested when deemed necessary by a notifying party. The 
coordination notice should be identified as ``expedited'' and the 
requested response date should be clearly indicated. However, 
circumstances preventing a timely response from the receiving party 
should be accommodated accordingly. It is the responsibility of the 
notifying party to receive written concurrence (or verbal, with written 
to follow) from affected parties or their coordination representatives.
    (vii) All technical problems that come to light during coordination 
must be resolved unless a statement is included with the application to 
the effect that the applicant is unable or unwilling to resolve the 
conflict and briefly the reason therefor;
    (viii) Where a number of technical changes become necessary for a 
system during the course of coordination, an attempt should be made to 
minimize the number of separate notifications for these changes. Where 
the changes

[[Page 651]]

are incorporated into a completely revised notice, the items that were 
changed from the previous notice should be identified. When changes are 
not numerous or complex, the party receiving the changed notification 
should make an effort to respond in less than 30 days. When the 
notifying party believes a shorter response time is reasonable and 
appropriate, it may be helpful for that party to so indicate in the 
notice and perhaps suggest a response date;
    (ix) If, after coordination is successfully completed, it is 
determined that a subsequent change could have no impact on some parties 
receiving the original notification, these parties must be notified of 
the change and of the coordinator's opinion that no response is 
required;
    (x) Applicants, permittees and licensees should supply to all other 
applicants, permittees and licensees within their areas of operations, 
the name, address and telephone number of their coordination 
representatives. Upon request from coordinating applicants, permittees 
and licensees, data and information concerning existing or proposed 
facilities and future growth plans in the area of interest should be 
furnished unless such request is unreasonable or would impose a 
significant burden in compilation;
    (xi) Parties should keep other parties with whom they are 
coordinating advised of changes in plans for facilities previously 
coordinated. If applications have not been filed 6 months after 
coordination was initiated, parties may assume that such frequency use 
is no longer desired unless a second notification has been received 
within 10 days of the end of the 6 month period. Renewal notifications 
are to be sent to all originally notified parties, even if coordination 
has not been successfully completed with those parties; and
    (xii) Any frequency reserved by a licensee for future use in the 
bands subject to this part must be released for use by another licensee, 
permittee or applicant upon a showing by the latter that it requires an 
additional frequency and cannot coordinate one that is not reserved for 
future use.
    (e) Where frequency conflicts arise between co-pending applications 
in the Private Operational Fixed Point-to-Point Microwave, Common 
Carrier Fixed Point-to-Point Microwave and Local Television Transmission 
Services, it is the obligation of the later filing applicant to amend 
his application to remove the conflict, unless it can make a showing 
that the conflict cannot be reasonably eliminated. Where a frequency 
conflict is not resolved and no showing is submitted as to why the 
conflict cannot be resolved, the Commission may grant the first filed 
application and dismiss the later filed application(s) after giving the 
later filing applicant(s) 30 days to respond to the proposed action.
    (f)(1) Coordination and information sharing between MVDDS and NGSO 
FSS licensees in the 12.2 GHz to 12.7 GHz band. Prior to the 
construction or addition of an MVDDS transmitting antenna in this 
frequency band, the MVDDS licensee shall provide notice of intent to 
construct the proposed antenna site to NGSO FSS licensees operating in 
the 12.2-12.7 GHz frequency band and maintain an Internet web site of 
all existing transmitting sites and transmitting antennas that are 
scheduled for operation within one year including the ``in service'' 
dates. In addition to the location of a proposed new transmitting 
antenna, MVDDS licensees shall provide to the NGSO FSS licensees a 
technical description of the operating characteristics of the proposed 
transmission facility. At a minimum, the following information must be 
included in each notification:
    (i) Name of MVDDS licensee;
    (ii) Geographic location (including NAD83 coordinates) of proposed 
MVDDS transmitting antenna;
    (iii) Maximum EIRP per 24 MHz;
    (iv) Height above average terrain of the transmitting antenna;
    (v) Type of antenna to be utilized;
    (vi) Main beam azimuth and altitude orientation for the proposed 
transmitting antenna;
    (vii) Theoretically modeled antenna radiation pattern;
    (viii) Type(s) of emissions, and;
    (ix) Description of the proposed service area.

[[Page 652]]

    (2) If the proposed MVDDS antenna site does not meet the minimum 
spacing requirements on the date of original notification or on 
subsequent annual anniversary dates of non-operation as set forth in 
Sec. 101.129, then the MVDDS licensee shall not construct the proposed 
transmission facility unless all NGSO FSS licensees having active 
subscribers within the minimum separation distance agree to a shorter 
spacing. Nothing in this section shall preclude MVDDS and NGSO FSS 
licensees from agreeing to accept the siting of new MVDDS transmitting 
antennas that do no meet the minimum distance set forth in Sec. 
101.129. Incumbent point-to-point licensees' (those not licensed as 
MVDDS) facilities are to be operated in the band 12,200-12,700 MHz 
following the procedures, technical standards, and requirements of Sec. 
101.105 in order to protect stations providing Direct Broadcast 
Satellite Service.
    (g) Licensees operating in Basic Trading Areas authorized in the 
Local Multipoint Distribution Service. (1) When the transmitting 
facilities in a Basic Trading Area (BTA) are to be operated in the bands 
27,500-28,350 MHz; 29,100-29,250 MHz; and 31,000-31,300 MHz and the 
facilities are located within 20 kilometers of the boundaries of a BTA, 
each licensee must complete the frequency coordination process of 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section with respect to neighboring BTA 
licensees that may be affected by its operations prior to initiating 
service. In addition, all licensed transmitting facilities operating in 
the bands 31,000-31,075 MHz and 31,225-31,300 MHz and located within 20 
kilometers of neighboring facilities must complete the frequency 
coordination process of paragraph (d)(2) of this section with respect to 
such authorized operations before initiating service.
    (2) Response to notification should be made as quickly as possible, 
even if no technical problems are anticipated. Any response to 
notification indicating potential interference must specify the 
technical details and must be provided to the applicant, either 
electronically or in writing, within the 30-day notification period. 
Every reasonable effort should be made by all licensees to eliminate all 
problems and conflicts. If no response to notification is received 
within 30 days, the licensee will be deemed to have made reasonable 
efforts to coordinate and commence operation without a response. The 
beginning of the 30-day period is determined pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(2)(v) of this section.
    (h) Special requirements for operations in the band 29,100-29,250 
MHz. (1)(i) Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) receive 
stations operating on frequencies in the 29,100-29,250 MHz band within a 
radius of 75 nautical miles of the geographic coordinates provided by a 
non-GSO-MSS licensee pursuant to Sec. 101.113(c)(2) or (c)(3)(i) (the 
``feeder link earth station complex protection zone'') shall accept any 
interference caused to them by such earth station complexes and shall 
not claim protection from such earth station complexes.
    (ii) LMDS licensees operating on frequencies in the 29,100-29,250 
MHz band outside a feeder link earth station complex protection zone 
shall cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to resolve technical 
problems with the non-GSO MSS licensee to the extent that transmissions 
from the non-GSO MSS operator's feeder link earth station complex 
interfere with an LMDS receive station.
    (2) No more than 15 days after the release of a public notice 
announcing the commencement of LMDS auctions, feeder link earth station 
complexes to be licensed pursuant to Sec. 25.257 of this chapter shall 
be specified by a set of geographic coordinates in accordance with the 
following requirements: no feeder link earth station complex may be 
located in the top eight (8) metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), 
ranked by population, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget 
as of June 1993, using estimated populations as of December 1992; two 
(2) complexes may be located in MSAs 9 through 25, one of which must be 
Phoenix, AZ (for a complex at Chandler, AZ); two (2) complexes may be 
located in MSAs 26 to 50; three (3) complexes may be located in MSAs 51 
to 100, one of which must be Honolulu, Hawaii (for a complex at Waimea); 
and the three (3) remaining complexes must be located at least 75 
nautical miles from the borders

[[Page 653]]

of the 100 largest MSAs or in any MSA not included in the 100 largest 
MSAs. Any location allotted for one range of MSAs may be taken from an 
MSA below that range.
    (3)(i) Any non-GSO MSS licensee may at any time specify sets of 
geographic coordinates for feeder link earth station complexes with each 
earth station contained therein to be located at least 75 nautical miles 
from the border of the 100 largest MSAs.
    (ii) For purposes of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, non-GSO 
MSS feeder link earth station complexes shall be entitled to 
accommodation only if the affected non-GSO MSS licensee preapplies to 
the Commission for a feeder link earth station complex or certifies to 
the Commission within sixty days of receiving a copy of an LMDS 
application that it intends to file an application for a feeder link 
earth station complex within six months of the date of receipt of the 
LMDS application.
    (iii) If said non-GSO MSS licensee application is filed later than 
six months after certification of the Commission, the LMDS and non-GSO 
MSS entities shall still cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to 
resolve technical problems, but the LMDS licensee shall not be obligated 
to re-engineer its proposal or make changes to its system.
    (4) LMDS licensees or applicants proposing to operate hub stations 
on frequencies in the 29,100-29,250 MHz band at locations outside of the 
100 largest MSAs or within a distance of 150 nautical miles from a set 
of geographic coordinates specified under paragraphs (h)(2) or (h)(3)(i) 
of this section shall serve copies of their applications on all non-GSO 
MSS applicants, permittees or licensees meeting the criteria specified 
in Sec. 25.257(a). Non-GSO MSS licensees or applicants shall serve 
copies of their feeder link earth station applications, after the LMDS 
auction, on any LMDS applicant or licensee within a distance of 150 
nautical miles from the geographic coordinates that it specified under 
Sec. 101.113(c)(2) or (c)(3)(i). Any necessary coordination shall 
commence upon notification by the party receiving an application to the 
party who filed the application. The results of any such coordination 
shall be reported to the Commission within sixty days. The non-GSO MSS 
earth station licensee shall also provide all such LMDS licensees with a 
copy of its channel plan.
    (i)(1) When the licensed facilities are to be operated in the band 
38,600 MHz to 40,000 MHz and the facilities are located within 16 
kilometers of the boundaries of an Economic Area, each licensee must 
complete the frequency coordination process of subsection 101.103(d) 
with respect to neighboring EA licensees and existing licensees within 
its EA service area that may be affected by its operation prior to 
initiating service. In addition to the technical parameters listed in 
subsection 101.103(d), the coordinating licensee must also provide 
potentially affected parties technical information related to its 
subchannelization plan and system geometry.
    (2) Response to notification should be made as quickly as possible, 
even if no technical problems are anticipated. Any response to 
notification indicating potential interference must specify the 
technical details and must be provided to the licensee, either 
electronically or in writing, within 10 days of notification. Every 
reasonable effort should be made by all licensees to eliminate all 
problems and conflicts. If no response to notification is received 
within 10 days, the licensee will be deemed to have made reasonable 
efforts to coordinate and may commence operation without a response. The 
beginning of the 10-day period is determined pursuant to Sec. 
101.103(d)(v).

Sec. 101.105  Interference protection criteria.

    (a) The interference protection criteria for fixed stations subject 
to this part are as follows:
    (1) To long-haul analog systems, employing frequency modulated radio 
and frequency division multiplexing to provide multiple voice channels, 
the allowable interference level per exposure:

[[Page 654]]

    (i) Due to co-channel sideband-to-sideband interference must not 
exceed 5 pwpO (Picowatts of absolute noise power psophometrically 
weighted (pwpO), appearing in an equivalent voice band channel of 300-
3400 Hz); or
    (ii) Due to co-channel carrier-beat interference must not exceed 50 
pwpO.
    (2) To short-haul analog systems employing frequency modulated radio 
and frequency division multiplexing to provide multiple voice channels, 
the allowable interference level per exposure:
    (i) Due to co-channel sideband-to-sideband interference must not 
exceed 25 pwpO except in the 952-960 MHz band interference into single 
link fixed relay and control stations must not exceed 250 pwpO per 
exposure; or
    (ii) Due to co-channel carrier-beat interference must not exceed 50 
pwpO except in the 952-960 MHz band interference into single link fixed 
relay and control stations must not exceed 1000 pwpO per exposure.
    (3) FM-TV. In analog systems employing frequency modulated radio 
that is modulated by a standard, television (visual) signal, the 
allowable interference level per exposure may not exceed the levels 
which would apply to long-haul or short-haul FM-FDM systems, as outlined 
in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, having a 600-1200 voice 
channel capacity.
    (4) 12.2-12.7 GHz band. (i) To accommodate co-primary NGSO FSS earth 
stations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, the PFD of an MVDDS transmitting 
system must not exceed -135 dBW/m\2\ in any 4 kHz band at a reference 
point at the surface of the earth at a distance greater than 3 
kilometers from the MVDDS transmitting antenna.
    (ii) To accommodate co-primary Direct Broadcast Satellite Service 
earth stations, an MVDDS transmitting system must not exceed the EPFD 
levels specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section at any DBS 
subscriber location in accordance with the procedures listed in Sec. 
101.1440 of this part.
    (A) Definition of equivalent power flux density: The equivalent 
power flux density (EPFD) is the power flux density produced at a direct 
broadcast service (DBS) receive earth station, taking into account 
shielding effects and the off-axis discrimination of the receiving 
antenna assumed to be pointing at the appropriate DBS satellite(s) from 
the transmitting antenna of a multichannel video distribution and data 
service (MVDDS) transmit station. The EPFD in dBW/m\2\ in the reference 
bandwidth is calculated using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07JN04.000

Where:

P<INF>out</INF> = Total output power of the MVDDS transmitter (watts) 
          into antenna
Gm ([thetas]<INF>m</INF>,[phis]<INF>m</INF> = Gain of the MVDDS antenna 
          in the direction of the DBS earth station
G<INF>e</INF> ([thetas]<INF>e</INF>,[phis]<INF>e</INF> = Gain of the 
          earth station in the direction of the MVDDS antenna
I = Interference scaling factor for the earth station (1 dB for MVDDS 
          transmitters employing the modulation discussed in Section 
          3.1.5 of the MITRE Report (i.e., a QPSK modulated signal 
          passed through a square-root raised cosine filter). For other 
          modulation and filtering schemes, the interference scaling 
          factor can be measured using the procedures described in 
          Appendix A of the MITRE Report available at http://
          www.fcc.gov/oet/info/mitrereport/mitrereport--4--01.pdf).
G<INF>e, max</INF> = Maximum gain of the DBS earth station
d = the distance between the MVDDS transmitting antenna and the DBS 
          earth station (meters)

    (B) Regional equivalent power flux density levels:
    (1) -168.4 dBW/m\2\/4kHz in the Eastern region consisting of the 
District of Columbia and the following states: Maine, New Hampshire, 
Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, 
Tennessee, North

[[Page 655]]

Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and 
Florida;
    (2) -169.8 dBW/m\2\/4kHz in the Midwestern region consisting of the 
following states: Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, 
Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, 
Oklahoma, and Texas;
    (3) -171.0 dBW/m\2\/4kHz in the Southwestern region consisting of 
the following states: Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, 
Nevada, and California (south of 37[deg] North Latitude);
    (4) -172.1 dBW/m\2\/4kHz in the Northwestern region consisting of 
the following states: Washington, Oregon, California (north of 37[deg] 
North Latitude), Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Alaska, and Hawaii.
    (iii) Except for public safety entities, harmful interference 
protection from MVDDS stations to incumbent point-to-point 12 GHz fixed 
stations is not required. Incumbent point-to-point private operational 
fixed 12 GHz stations, except for public safety entities, are required 
to protect MVDDS stations under the process described in Sec. 
101.103(d) of this part.
    (5) 71,000-76,000 MHz; 81,000-86,000 MHz. In these bands the 
following interference criteria shall apply:
    (i) For receivers employing digital modulation: based upon 
manufacturer data and following TSB 10-F or other generally acceptable 
good engineering practice, for each potential case of interference a 
threshold-to-interference ratio (T/I) shall be determined that would 
cause 1.0 dB of degradation to the static threshold of the protected 
receiver. For the range of carrier power levels (C) between the clear-
air (unfaded) value and the fully-faded static threshold value, in no 
case shall interference cause C/I to be less than the T/I so determined 
unless it can be shown that the availability of the affected receiver 
would still be acceptable despite the interference.
    (ii) For receivers employing analog modulation: manufacturer data or 
industry criteria will specify a baseband signal-to-noise requirement 
(S/N) of the receiver that will result in acceptable signal quality for 
continuous operation. Following TSB 10-F or other generally acceptable 
good engineering practice, for each potential case of interference a C/I 
objective shall be calculated to ensure that this S/N will not be 
degraded by more than 1.0 dB. For the range of carrier power levels (C) 
between the clear-air (unfaded) value and the fully-faded threshold 
value, in no case shall interference cause the C/I to be less than the 
objective so determined unless it can be shown that the signal quality 
and availability of the affected receiver would still be acceptable 
despite the interference.
    (6) 92,000-94,000 MHz; 94,100-95,000 MHz. In these bands prior links 
shall be protected to a threshold-to-interference ratio (T/I) level of 
1.0 dB of degradation to the static threshold of the protected receiver. 
Any new link shall not decrease a previous link's desired-to-undesired 
(D/U) signal ratio below a minimum of 36 dB, unless the earlier link's 
licensee agrees to accept a lower D/U.
    (7) All stations operating under this part must protect the radio 
quiet zones as required by Sec. 1.924 of this chapter. Stations 
authorized by competitive bidding are cautioned that they must receive 
the appropriate approvals directly from the relevant quiet zone entity 
prior to operating.
    (b) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section 
the adjacent channel interference protection criteria to be afforded, 
regardless of system length, or type of modulation, multiplexing, or 
frequency band, must be such that the interfering signal does not 
produce more than 1.0 dB degradation of the practical threshold of the 
protected receiver. The ``practical threshold'' of the protected 
receiver can be based upon the definition in TSB 10, referenced in 
paragraph (c) of this section, or upon alternative generally acceptable 
good engineering standards.
    (c) Applying the criteria. (1) Guidelines for applying the 
interference protection criteria for fixed stations subject to this part 
are specified in the Telecommunications Industry Association's 
Telecommunications Systems Bulletin TSB 10, ``Interference Criteria for 
Microwave Systems'' (TSB 10). Other procedures that follow generally

[[Page 656]]

acceptable good engineering practices are also acceptable to the 
Commission.
    (2) If TSB 10 guidelines cannot be used, the following interference 
protection criteria may be used by calculating the ratio in dB between 
the desired (carrier signal) and the undesired (interfering) signal (C/I 
ratio) appearing at the input to the receiver under investigation 
(victim receiver). Except as provided in Sec. 101.147 where the 
applicant's proposed facilities are of a type not included in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section or where the development of the carrier-to-
interference (C/I) ratio is not covered by generally acceptable 
procedures, or where the applicant does not wish to develop the carrier-
to-interference ratio, the applicant must, in the absence of criteria or 
a developed C/I ratio, employ the following C/I protection ratios:
    (i) Co-Channel Interference. Both side band and carrier-beat, 
applicable to all bands; the existing or previously authorized system 
must be afforded a carrier to interfering signal protection ratio of at 
least 90 dB, except in the 952-960 MHz band where it must be 75dB, and 
in the 71,000-76,000 MHz and 81,000-86,000 MHz bands where the criteria 
in paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, and in the 92,000-94,000 
MHz and 94,100-95,000 MHz bands, where the criteria in paragraph (a)(6) 
of this section applies; or
    (ii) Adjacent Channel Interference. Applicable to all bands; the 
existing or previously authorized system must be afforded a carrier to 
interfering signal protection ratio of at least 56 dB, except in the 
71,000-76,000 MHz and 81,000-86,000 MHz bands where the criteria in 
paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, and in the 92,000-94,000 MHz 
and 94,100-95,000 MHz bands, where the criteria in paragraph (a)(6) of 
this section applies.
    (3) Applicants for frequencies listed in Sec. 101.147(b)(1) through 
(4) must make the following showings that protection criteria have been 
met over the entire service area of existing systems. Such showings may 
be made by the applicant or may be satisfied by a statement from a 
frequency coordinator.
    (i) For site-based multiple address stations in the 928-929/952-960 
MHz and the 932-932.5/941-941.5 MHz bands, a statement that the proposed 
system complies with the following co-channel separations from all 
existing stations and pending applications:

Fixed-to-fixed--145 km;
Fixed-to-mobile--113 km;
Mobile-to-mobile--81 km

    Note to paragraph (c)(3)(i): Multiple address systems employing only 
remote stations will be treated as mobile for the purposes of 
determining the appropriate separation. For mobile operation, the 
mileage is measured from the reference point specified on the license 
application. For fixed operation on subfrequencies in accordance with 
Sec. 101.147 the mileage also is measured from the reference point 
specified on the license application.

    (ii) In cases where the geographic separation standard in paragraph 
(c)(3)(i) of this section is not followed, an engineering analysis must 
be submitted to show the coordination of the proposed assignment with 
existing systems located closer than those standards. The engineering 
analyses will include:
    (A) Specification of the interference criteria and system parameters 
used in the interference study;
    (B) Nominal service areas of each system included in the 
interference analysis;
    (C) Modified service areas resulting from the proposed system. The 
propagation models used to establish the service boundary limits must be 
specified and any special terrain features considered in computing the 
interference impact should be described; and
    (D) A statement that all parties affected have agreed to the 
engineering analysis and will accept the calculated levels of 
interference.
    (iii) MAS EA licensees shall provide protection in accordance with 
Sec. 101.1333.
    (4) Multiple address systems operating on subfrequencies in 
accordance with Sec. 101.147 that propose to operate master stations at 
unspecified locations must define the operating area by a radius about a 
geographical coordinate and describe how interference to co-channel 
users will be controlled.
    (5) Multiple address frequencies in the 956.25-956.45 MHz bands may 
be assigned for use by mobile master stations on a primary basis. 
Multiple address frequencies in the 941.0-941.5 MHz bands that are 
licensed on a site-by-site basis and the 952 MHz bands may

[[Page 657]]

be assigned for use by primary mobile master stations on a case-by-case 
basis if the 956.25-956.45 MHz frequencies are unavailable. Multiple 
address mobile (master and remote) operation is permitted on frequencies 
licensed by geographic area subject to the interference protection 
criteria set forth in Sec. 101.1333, i.e., adjacent channel site-based 
licensees and co-channel operations in adjacent EAs. Mobile operation in 
the 959.85-960 MHz band is not permitted.
    (6) Each application for new or modified nodal station on channels 
numbered 4A, 4B, 7, 9, and 19/20 in the 10.6 GHz band must demonstrate 
that all existing co-channel stations are at least 56 kilometers from 
the proposed nodal station site. Applicants for these channels must 
certify that all licensees and applicants for stations on the adjacent 
channels within 56 kilometers of the proposed nodal station have been 
notified of the proposed station and do not object. Alternatively, or if 
one of the affected adjacent channel interests does object, the 
applicant may show that all affected adjacent channel parties are 
provided a C/I protection ratio of 0 dB. An applicant proposing to 
operate at an AAT greater than 91 meters must reduce its EIRP in 
accordance with the following table; however, in no case may EIRP exceed 
70 dBm on the 10.6 GHz channels:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         AAT (meters)                           EIRP dBm
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Above 300....................................................        +38
251 to 300...................................................         41
201 to 250...................................................         43
151 to 200...................................................         49
101 to 150...................................................         55
100 and below................................................         85
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (7) Each application for new or modified nodal station on channels 
numbered 21, 22, 23, and 24 in the 10.6 GHz band must include an 
analysis of the potential for harmful interference to all other licensed 
and previously applied for co-channel and adjacent channel stations 
located within 80 kilometers of the location of the proposed station. 
The criteria contained in Sec. 101.103(d)(2) must be used in this 
analysis. Applicants must certify that copies of this analysis have been 
served on all parties which might reasonably be expected to receive 
interference above the levels set out in Sec. 101.103(d)(2) within 5 
days of the date the subject application is filed with the Commission.
    (8) If the potential interference will exceed the prescribed limits, 
a statement shall be submitted with the application for new or modified 
stations to the effect that all parties have agreed to accept the higher 
level of interference.
    (d) Effective August 1, 1985, when a fixed station that conforms to 
the technical standards of this subpart (or, in the case of the 12,200-
12,700 MHz band, for an incumbent non-MVDDS station or a direct 
broadcast satellite station) receives or will receive interference in 
excess of the levels specified in this section as a result of an 
existing licensee's use of non-conforming equipment authorized between 
July 20, 1961 and July 1, 1976, and the interference would not result if 
the interfering station's equipment complied with the current technical 
standards, the licensee of the non-conforming station must take whatever 
steps are necessary to correct the situation up to the point of 
installing equipment which fully conforms to the technical standards of 
this subpart. In such cases, if the engineering analysis demonstrates 
that:
    (1) The conforming station would receive interference from a non-
conforming station in excess of the levels specified in this section; 
and
    (2) The interference would be eliminated if the non-conforming 
equipment were replaced with equipment which complies with the standards 
of this subpart, the licensee (or prospective licensee) of the station 
which would receive interference must provide written notice of the 
potential interference to both the non-conforming licensee and the 
Commission's office in Gettysburg, PA. The non-conforming licensee must 
make all required equipment changes within 180 days from the date of 
official Commission notice informing the licensee that it must upgrade 
its equipment, unless an alternative solution has been agreed to by all 
parties involved in the interference situation. If a non-conforming 
licensee fails to make all required changes within the

[[Page 658]]

specified period of time, the Commission may require the licensee to 
suspend operation until the changes are completed.
    (e) Interference dispute resolution procedures. Should a licensee 
licensed under this part receive harmful interference from another 
licensee licensed under this chapter, the parties involved shall comply 
with the dispute resolution procedures set forth herein:
    (1) The licensee experiencing the harmful interference shall notify 
the licensee believed to be causing the harmful interference and shall 
supply information describing its problem and supporting its claim;
    (2) Upon receipt of the harmful interference notice, the licensee 
alleged to be causing the harmful interference shall respond immediately 
and make every reasonable effort to identify and resolve the conflict; 
and
    (3) Licensees are encouraged to resolve the harmful interference 
prior to contacting the Commission.

\1\Applicable only to common carrier LTTS stations. Tolerance for 2450-
  2500 MHz is 0.005%. Beginning Aug. 9, 1975, this tolerance will govern
  the marketing of LTTS equipment and the issuance of all such
  authorizations for new radio equipment. Until that date new equipment
  may be authorized with a frequency tolerance of .03% in the frequency
  range 2,200 to 10,500 MHz and .05% in the range 10,500 MHz to 12,200
  MHz, and equipment so authorized may continue to be used for its life
  provided that it does not cause interference to the operation of any
  other licensee. Beginning March 1, 2005, new LTTS operators will not
  be licensed and existing LTTS licensees will not be renewed in the
  11.7-12.2 GHz band.
\2\ See subpart G of this part for the stability requirements for
  transmitters used in the Digital Electronic Message Service.
\3\ Existing type accepted equipment with a frequency tolerance of <plus-
  minus<ls-thn-eq>0.03% may be marketed until December 1, 1988.
  Equipment installed and operated prior to December 1, 1988 may
  continue to operate after that date with a minimum frequency tolerance
  of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.03%. However, the replacement of equipment
  requires that the current tolerance be met.
\4\ Applicable to private operational fixed point-to-point microwave and
  stations providing MVDDS.
\5\ For private operational fixed point-to-point microwave systems, with
  a channel greater than or equal to 50 KHz bandwidth, <plus-minus<ls-
  thn-eq>0.0005%; for multiple address master stations, regardless of
  bandwidth, <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.00015%; for multiple address remote
  stations with 12.5 KHz bandwidths, <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.00015%; for
  multiple address remote stations with channels greater than 12.5 KHz
  bandwidth, <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.0005%.
\6\ For stations authorized prior to March 11, 1997, transmitter
  tolerance shall not exceed 0.03%.
\7\ The frequency tolerance for stations authorized on or before April
  1, 2005 is 0.03%. Existing licensees and pending applicants on that
  date may continue to operate after that date with a frequency
  tolerance of 0.03%, provided that it does not cause harmful
  interference to the operation of any other licensee. For analog
  systems, if the channel bandwidth is greater than 30 MHz up to 50 MHz,
  the frequency tolerance standard will be 0.03%; if the channel
  bandwidth is 30 MHz or less, then the frequency tolerance standard
  will be 0.003%. This analog standard is conditional provided that
  harmful interference is not caused to digital stations operating
  within the 0.001% tolerance standards. If harmful interference is
  caused to stations operating with the more stringent standard, the
  onus shall be on the operators with the less stringent parameters to
  develop an engineering solution to the problem. For exceptions, see
  Sec. 101.147 and Sec. 101.507.
\8\ Equipment authorized to be operated in the 71,000-76,000 MHz, 81,000-
  86,000 MHz, 92,000-94,000 MHz and 94,100-95,000 MHz bands is exempt
  from the frequency tolerance requirement noted in the table of
  paragraph (a) of this section.

    (b) Heterodyne microwave radio systems may be authorized at a 
somewhat less restrictive frequency tolerance (up to .01 percent) to 
compensate for frequency shift caused by numerous repeaters between base 
band signal insertion. Where such relaxation is sought, applicant must 
provide all calculations

[[Page 659]]

and indicate the desired tolerance over each path. In such instances the 
radio transmitters and receivers used must individually be capable of 
complying with the tolerance specified in paragraph (a) of this section. 
Heterodyne operation is restricted to channel bandwidth of 10 MHz or 
greater.
    (c) As an additional requirement in any band where the Commission 
makes assignments according to a specified channel plan, provisions must 
be made to prevent the emission included within the occupied bandwidth 
from radiating outside the assigned channel at a level greater than that 
specified in Sec. 101.111.

Sec. 101.109  Bandwidth.

    (a) Each authorization issued pursuant to these rules will show, as 
the emission designator, a symbol representing the class of emission 
which must be prefixed by a number specifying the necessary bandwidth. 
This figure does not necessarily indicate the bandwidth actually 
occupied by the emission at any instant. In those cases where part 2 of 
this chapter does not provide a formula for the computation of the 
necessary bandwidth, the occupied bandwidth may be used in the emission 
designator.
    (b) Stations in this service will be authorized any type of 
emission, method of modulation, and transmission characteristic, 
consistent with efficient use of the spectrum and good engineering 
practice, except that Type B, damped-wave emission will not be 
authorized.
    (c) The maximum bandwidth which will be authorized per frequency 
assigned is set out in the table that follows. Regardless of the maximum 
authorized bandwidth specified for each frequency band, the Commission 
reserves the right to issue a license for less than the maximum 
bandwidth if it appears that a lesser bandwidth would be sufficient to 
support an applicant's intended communications.

\2\ 1250 KHz, 1875 KHz, or 2500 KHz on a case-by-case basis.
\3\ To be specified in authorization. For the band 92 to 95 GHz, maximum

  0.9 GHz segment from 94.1 to 95 GHz, or the total of the loaded band
  if smaller than the assigned bandwidth.
\4\ For exceptions, see Sec. 101.147(s).
\5\ A 12.5 kHz bandwidth applies only to frequencies listed in Sec.
  101.147(b)(1) through (4).
\6\ For frequencies listed in Sec. 101.147(b)(1) through (4),
  consideration will be given on a case-by-case basis to authorizing
  bandwidths up to 50 kHz.
\7\ For channel block assignments in the 24,250-25,250 MHz and 38,600-
  40,000 MHz bands, the authorized bandwidth is equivalent to an
  unpaired channel block assignment or to either half of a symmetrical
  paired channel block assignment. When adjacent channels are
  aggregated, equipment is permitted to operate over the full channel
  block aggregation without restriction.
Note to Footnote 7: Unwanted emissions shall be suppressed at the
  aggregate channel block edges based on the same roll-off rate as is
  specified for a single channel block in Sec. 101.111(a)(1) or in
  Sec. 101.111(a)(2)(ii) and (iii) as appropriate.
\8\ For incumbent private operational fixed point-to-point stations in
  this band (those not licensed as MVDDS), the maximum bandwidth shall
  be 20 MHz.

Sec. 101.111  Emission limitations.

    (a) The mean power of emissions must be attenuated below the mean 
output power of the transmitter in accordance with the following 
schedule:
    (1) When using transmissions other than those employing digital 
modulation techniques:
    (i) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 50 percent up to and including 100 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth: At least 25 decibels;
    (ii) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 100 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth: At least 35 decibels;
    (iii) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 43+10 
Log<INF>10</INF> (mean output power in watts) decibels, or 80 decibels, 
whichever is the lesser attenuation.
    (2) When using transmissions employing digital modulation techniques 
(see Sec. 101.141(b)) in situations not covered in this section:
    (i) For operating frequencies below 15 GHz, in any 4 KHz band, the 
center frequency of which is removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 50 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth: As specified by the following equation but in no event less 
than 50 decibels:

A = 35 + 0.8(P -50) + 10 Log10 B. (Attenuation greater than 80 decibels 
or to an absolute power of less than -13 dBm/1MHz is not required.) 
where:

A = Attenuation (in decibels) below the mean output power level.
P = Percent removed from the center frequency of the transmitter 
          bandwidth.
B = Authorized bandwidth in MHz.

    Note: MVDDS operations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band shall use 24 
megahertz for the value of B in the emission mask equation set forth in 
this section. The emission mask limitation shall only apply at the 12.2-
12.7 GHz band edges and does not restrict MVDDS channelization bandwidth 
within the band.

    (ii) For operating frequencies above 15 GHz, in any 1 MHz band, the 
center frequency of which is removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 50 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth: As specified by the following equation but in no event less 
than 11 decibels:

A = 11 + 0.4(P-50) + 10 Log<INF>10</INF> B. (Attenuation greater than 56 
decibels or to an absolute power of less than -13 dBm/1MHz is not 
required.)

    (iii) In any 1 MHz band, the center frequency of which is removed 
from the assigned frequency by more than 250 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth: At least 43 + 10 Log<INF>10</INF> (the mean output power in 
watts) decibels, or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation. 
The authorized bandwidth includes the nominal radio frequency bandwidth 
of an individual transmitter/modulator in block-assigned bands. 
Equipment licensed prior to April 1, 2005 shall only

[[Page 661]]

be required to meet this standard in any 4 kHz band.
    (iv) The emission mask for LMDS and the 24 GHz Service shall use the 
equation in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section and apply it only to 
the band edge of each block of spectrum, but not to subchannels 
established by licensees. The value of P in the equation is the 
percentage removed from the carrier frequency and assumes that the 
carrier frequency is the center of the actual bandwidth used. The 
emission mask can be satisfied by locating a carrier of the subchannel 
sufficiently far from the channel edges so that the emission levels of 
the mask are satisfied. The LMDS or 24 GHz emission mask shall use a 
value B (bandwidth) of 40 MHz, for all cases even in the case where a 
narrower subchannel is used (for instance the actual bandwidth is 10 
MHz) and the mean output power used in the calculation is the sum of the 
output power of a fully populated channel. For block assigned channels, 
the out-of-band emission limits apply only outside the assigned band of 
operation and not within the band.
    (v) The emission mask for the 71-76 GHz, 81-86 GHz, 92-94 GHz, and 
94.1-95 GHz bands used in the equation in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section applies only to the edge of each channel, but not to sub-
channels established by licensees. The value of P in the equation is for 
the percentage removed from the carrier frequency and assumes that the 
carrier frequency is the center of the actual bandwidth used. The value 
of B will always be 500 MHz. In the case where a narrower sub-channel is 
used within the assigned bandwidth, such sub-carrier will be located 
sufficiently far from the channel edges to satisfy the emission levels 
of the mask. The mean output power used in the calculation is the sum of 
the output power of a fully populated channel.
    (3) For Digital Termination System channels used in the Digital 
Electronic Message Service (DEMS) operating in the 10,550-10,680 MHz 
band:
    (i) In any 4 KHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from 
the edge of the DEMS channel by up to and including 1.125 times the DEMS 
subchannel bandwidth: As specified by the following equation may in no 
event be less than 50+10 log<INF>10</INF> N decibels:

A = 50 + 0.0333(F - 0.5B) + 10 log<INF>10</INF> N decibels

Where:

A = Attenuation (in decibels) below means output power level contained 
          within the DEMS channel for a given polarization.
B = Bandwidth of DEMS channel (in KHz).
F = Absolute value of the difference between the center frequency of the 
          4 KHz band measured and the center frequency of the DEMS 
          channel (in KHz).
N = Number of active subchannels of the given polarization within the 
          DEMS channel.

    (ii) In any 4 KHz band within the authorized DEMS band the center 
frequency of which is removed from the center frequency of the DEMS 
channel by more than the sum of 50% of the DEMS channel bandwidth plus 
1.125 times the subchannel bandwidth: As specified by the following 
equation but in no event less than 80 decibels:

A = 80 + 10 log<INF>10</INF> N decibels

    (iii) In any 4 KHz band the center frequency of which is outside the 
authorized DEMS band: At least 43+10 log<INF>10</INF> (mean output power 
in watts) decibels.
    (4) For DEMS channels in the 17,700-19,700 MHz band:
    (i) In any 4 KHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from 
the frequency of the center of the DEMS channel by more than 50 percent 
of the DEMS channel bandwidth up to and including 50 percent plus 500 
KHz: As specified by the following equation but in no event be less than 
50+10 log<INF>10</INF> N decibels:

A = 50 + 0.06(F -0.5B) + 10 log<INF>10</INF> N decibels

Where:

A = Attenuation (in decibels) below means output power level contained 
          within the DEMS channel for a given polarization.
B = Bandwidth of DEMS channel (in KHz).
F = Absolute value of the difference between the center frequency of the 
          4 KHz band measured and the center frequency of the DEMS 
          channel (in KHz).
N = Number of active subchannels of the given polarization within the 
          DEMS channel.

    (ii) In any 4 KHz band within the authorized DEMS band, the center 
frequency of which is removed from the

[[Page 662]]

center frequency of the DEMS channel by more than the sum of 50 percent 
of the channel bandwidth plus 500 KHz: As specified by the following 
equation but in no event less than 80 decibels:

A=80+10 log<INF>10</INF> N decibels

    (iii) In any 4 KHz band the center frequency of which is outside the 
authorized Digital Message Service band: At least 43+10 log<INF>10</INF> 
(mean output power in watts) decibels.
    (5) When using transmissions employing digital modulation techniques 
on the 900 MHz multiple address frequencies with a 12.5 KHz bandwidth, 
the power of any emission must be attenuated below the unmodulated 
carrier power of the transmitter (P) in accordance with the following 
schedule:
    (i) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized

to and including 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 116 
log<INF>10</INF> (fd/6.1) decibels or 50 plus 10 log<INF>10</INF> (P) or 
70 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation; and

    (c) The emission of an unmodulated carrier is prohibited except for 
test purposes as required for proper station and system maintenance.

Sec. 101.113  Transmitter power limitations.

    (a) On any authorized frequency, the average power delivered to an 
antenna in this service must be the minimum amount of power necessary to 
carry out the communications desired. Application of this principle 
includes, but is not to be limited to, requiring a licensee who replaces 
one or more of its antennas with larger antennas to reduce its antenna 
input power by an amount appropriate to compensate for the increased 
primary lobe gain of the replacement antenna(s). In no event shall the 
average equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP), as referenced to 
an isotropic radiator, exceed the values specified below. In cases of 
harmful interference, the Commission may, after notice and opportunity 
for hearing, order a change in the effective radiated power of this 
station. Further, the output power of a transmitter on any authorized 
frequency in this service may not exceed the following:

\2\ For multiple address operations, see Sec. 101.147. Remote alarm
  units that are part of a multiple address central station projection
  system are authorized a maximum of 2 watts.
\3\ When an omnidirectional antenna is authorized in the 2150-2160 MHz
  band, the maximum power shall be 60 dBm.

\5\ The output power of a DEMS System nodal transmitter shall not exceed
  0.5 watt per 250 kHz. The output power of a DEMS System user
  transmitter shall not exceed 0.04 watt per 250 kHz. The transmitter
  power in terms of the watts specified is the peak envelope power of
  the emission measured at the associated antenna input port. The
  operating power shall not exceed the authorized power by more than 10
  percent of the authorized power in watts at any time. Frequencies from
  10,600-10,680 MHz are subject to footnote US265 in the Table of
  Frequency Allocations in Sec. 2.106 of the Commission's Rules.
  Stations authorized prior to April 1, 2003 to exceed the 40 dBW limit
  may continue to operate at their authorized output power level
  indefinitely, provided that neither end point of the relevant link is
  relocated.
\6\ Maximum power delivered to the antenna shall not exceed -3 dBw.

\10\ See Sec. 101.147(s).
\11\ The EIRP for MVDDS stations is limited to 14.0 dBm per 24 MHz (-
  16.0 dBW per 24 MHz). Incumbent point-to-point stations may use up to
  +50 dBW except for low power systems which were licensed under Sec.

\12\ Beginning March 1, 2005, no new LTTS operators will be licensed and
  no existing LTTS licensees will be renewed in the 14.2-14.4 GHz band.
\13\ The maximum transmitter power is limited to 3 watts (5 dBW) unless
  a proportional reduction in maximum authorized EIRP is required under
  Sec. 101.115. The maximum transmitter power spectral density is
  limited to 150 mW per 100 MHz.

    (b) The power of transmitters that use Automatic Transmitter Power 
Control shall not exceed the power input or output specified in the 
instrument of station authorization. The power of non-ATPC transmitters 
shall be maintained as near as practicable to the power input or output 
specified in the instrument of station authorization.
    (c)(1) Transmitter power limitations. Point-to-point stations in the 
29.1-29.25 GHz band for the LMDS backbone between LMDS hubs shall be 
limited to a maximum allowable e.i.r.p. density per carrier of 23 dBW/
MHz in any one megahertz in clear air, and may exceed this limit by 
employment of adaptive power control in cases where link propagation 
attenuation exceeds the clear air value due to precipitation and only to 
the extent that the link is impaired.

applicants shall demonstrate that, under clear air operating conditions, 
the maximum aggregate of LMDS transmitting hub stations in a Basic 
Trading Area in the 29.1-29.25 GHz band will not transmit a co-frequency 
hub-to-subscriber e.i.r.p. spectral area density in any azimuthal 
direction in excess of X dBW/(MHz-km \2\) when averaged over any 4.375 
MHz band, where X is defined in Table 1. Individual hub stations may 
exceed their clear air e.i.r.p.s by employment of adaptive power control 
in cases where link propagation attenuation exceeds the clear air value 
and only to the extent that the link is impaired.

methods to reduce average power levels received by non-geostationary 
mobile satellite receivers, to the extent necessary to comply with

set forth below:
    (i) Alternate polarizations. LMDS hub transmitters in the LMDS 
service area may employ both vertical and horizontal linear 
polarizations such that 50 percent (plus or minus 10 percent) of the hub 
transmitters shall employ vertical polarization and 50 percent (plus or 
minus 10 percent) shall employ horizontal polarization.
    (ii) Frequency interleaving. LMDS hub transmitters in the LMDS 
service area may employ frequency interleaving such that 50 percent 
(plus or minus 10 percent) of the hub transmitters shall employ channel 
center frequencies which are different by one-half the channel bandwidth 
of the other 50 percent (plus or minus 10 percent) of the hub 
transmitters.
    (iii) Alternative methods. As alternatives to paragraphs (c)(4)(i) 
and (c)(4)(ii) of this section, LMDS operators may employ such other 
methods as may be shown to achieve equivalent reductions in average 
power density received by non-GSO MSS satellite receivers.

    (a) Unless otherwise authorized upon specific request by the 
applicant, each station authorized under the rules of this part must 
employ a directional antenna adjusted with the center of the major lobe 
of radiation in the horizontal plane directed toward the receiving 
station with which it communicates: provided, however, where a station 
communicates with more than one point, a multi- or omni-directional 
antenna may be authorized if necessary. New Periscope antenna systems 
will not, under ordinary circumstances, be authorized.
    (b) Fixed stations (other than temporary fixed stations and DEMS 
nodal stations) operating at 932.5 MHz or higher must employ 
transmitting and receiving antennas (excluding second receiving antennas 
for operations such as space diversity) meeting the appropriate 
performance Standard A indicated below, except that in areas not subject 
to frequency congestion, antennas meeting performance Standard B may be 
used, subject to the requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this 
section. Licensees shall comply with the antenna standards table shown 
in this paragraph in the following manner:
    (1) With either the maximum beamwidth to 3 dB points requirement or 
with the minimum antenna gain requirement; and
    (2) With the minimum radiation suppression to angle requirement.

\1\ If a licensee chooses to show compliance using maximum beamwidth to 3 dB points, the beamwidth limit shall apply in both the azimuth and the
  elevation planes.
\2\ Except for Multiple Address System frequencies listed in Sec. Sec. 101.147(b)(1) through (b)(4), where omnidirectional antennas may be used.
\3\ Antennas used at outlying stations as part of a central protection alarm system need conform to only the following 2 standards:
(i) The minimum on-beam forward gain must be at least 10 dBi, and
(ii) The minimum front-to-back ratio must be at least 20 dB.
\4\ Omnidirectional antennas may be authorized in the band 2150-2160 MHz.
\5\ These antenna standards apply to all point-to-point stations authorized after June 1, 1997. Existing licensees and pending applicants on that date
  are grandfathered and need not comply with these standards.
\6\ These antenna standards apply to all point-to-point stations authorized on or before June 1, 1997.
\7\ Except for antennas between 140[deg] and 180[deg] authorized or pending on January 1, 1989, in the band 10,550 to 10,565 MHz for which minimum
  radiation suppression to angle (in degrees) from centerline of main beam is 36 decibels.
\8\ These antenna standards apply only to DEMS User Stations licensed, in operation, or applied for prior to July 15, 1993.
\9\ Except for Temporary-fixed operations in the band 13200-13250 MHz with output powers less than 250 mW and as provided in Sec. 101.147(q), and
  except for antennas in the MVDDS service in the band 12.2-12.7 GHz.
\10\ DEMS User Station antennas in this band must meet performance Standard B and have a minimum antenna gain of 34 dBi. The maximum beamwidth
  requirement does not apply to DEMS User Stations. DEMS Nodal Stations need not comply with these standards. Stations authorized to operate in the
  24,250-25,250 MHz band do not have to meet these standards, however, the Commission may require the use of higher performance antennas where
  interference problems can be resolved by the use of such antennas.
\11\ Except as provided in Sec. 101.147(s).
\12\ The minimum front-to-back ratio shall be 38 dBi.
\13\ Mobile, except aeronautical mobile, stations need not comply with these standards.
\14\ Stations authorized to operate in the 38,600-40,000 MHz band may use antennas other than those meeting the Category A standard. However, the
  Commission may require the use of higher performance antennas where interference problems can be resolved by the use of such antennas.
\15\ Antenna gain less than 50 dBi (but greater than or equal to 43 dBi) is permitted only with a proportional reduction in maximum authorized EIRP in a
  ratio of 2 dB of power per 1 dB of gain, so that the maximum allowable EIRP (in dBW) for antennas of less than 50 dBi gain becomes +55-2(50-G), where
  G is the antenna gain in dBi. In addition, antennas in these bands must meet two additional standards for minimum radiation suppression: At angles
  between 1.2 and 5 degrees from the centerline of the main beam, co-polar discrimination must be G-28, where G is the antenna gain in dBi; and at
  angles of less than 5 degrees from the centerline of main beam, cross-polar discrimination must be at least 25 dB.

    (c) The Commission shall require the replacement of any antenna or 
periscope antenna system of a permanent fixed station operating at 932.5 
MHz or higher that does not meet performance Standard A specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section, at the expense of the licensee operating 
such antenna, upon a showing that said antenna causes or is likely to 
cause interference to (or receive interference from) any other 
authorized or applied for station whereas a higher performance antenna 
is not likely to involve such interference. Antenna performance is 
expected to meet the standards of paragraph (c) of this section for 
parallel polarization. For cases of potential interference, an antenna 
will not be considered to meet Standard A unless the parallel 
polarization performance for the discrimination angle involved meets the 
requirements, even if the cross-polarization performance controls the 
interference.

[[Page 667]]

    (d) In cases where passive reflectors are employed in conjunction 
with transmitting antenna systems, the foregoing paragraphs of this 
section also will be applicable. However, in such instances, the center 
of the major lobe of radiation from the antenna normally must be 
directed at the passive reflector, and the center of the major lobe of 
radiation from the passive reflector directed toward the receiving 
station with which it communicates.
    (e) Periscope antennas used at an electric power facility plant area 
will be excluded from the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section 
on a case-by-case basis where technical considerations or safety 
preclude the use of other types of antenna systems.
    (f) In the 10,700-11,700 MHz band, a fixed station may employ 
transmitting and receiving antennas meeting performance standard B in 
any area. If a Fixed Service or Fixed Satellite Service licensee or 
applicant makes a showing that it is likely to receive interference from 
such fixed station and that such interference would not exist if the 
fixed station used an antenna meeting performance standard A, the fixed 
station licensee must modify its use. Specifically, the fixed station 
licensee must either substitute an antenna meeting performance standard 
A or operate its system with an EIRP reduced so as not to radiate, in 
the direction of the other licensee, an EIRP in excess of that which 
would be radiated by a station using a Category A antenna and operating 
with the maximum EIRP allowed by the rules. A licensee or prior 
applicant using an antenna that does not meet performance Standard A may 
object to a prior coordination notice based on interference only if such 
interference would be predicted to exist if the licensee or prior 
applicant used an antenna meeting performance standard A.
    (g) In the event harmful interference is caused to the operation of 
other stations, the Commission may, after notice and opportunity for 
hearing, order changes to be made in the height, orientation, gain and 
radiation pattern of the antenna system.

    (b) Fixed stations (other than temporary fixed stations and DEMS 
nodal stations) operating at 932.5 MHz or higher must employ 
transmitting and receiving antennas (excluding second receiving antennas 
for operations such as space diversity) meeting the appropriate 
performance Standard A indicated below, except that in areas not subject 
to frequency congestion, antennas meeting performance Standard B may be 
used, subject to the requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this 
section. For frequencies with a Standard B1 and a Standard B2, in order 
to comply with Standard B an antenna must fully meet either Standard B1 
or Standard B2. Licensees shall comply with the antenna standards table 
shown in this paragraph in the following manner:

Sec. 101.117  Antenna polarization.

    Except as set forth herein, stations operating in the radio services 
included in this part are not limited as to the type of polarization of 
the radiated signal that may be employed. However, in the event 
interference in excess of permissible levels is caused to the operation 
of other stations as a result of employing other than linear 
polarization, the Commission may order a licensee to change its system 
polarization to mitigate the interference. No change in polarization may 
be made without prior authorization from the Commission. Unless 
otherwise allowed, only linear polarization (horizontal and vertical) 
shall be used. For LMDS systems, unless otherwise authorized, system 
operators are permitted to use any polarization within its service area, 
but only vertical and/or horizontal polarization for antennas located 
within 20 kilometers of the outermost edge of their service area.

Sec. 101.119  Simultaneous use of common antenna structures.

    The simultaneous use of common antenna structures by more than one 
radio station, or by one of more domestic public radio stations and one 
or more stations of any other class or service, may be authorized: 
provided, however, that each licensee or user of any such structure is 
responsible for maintaining the structure, and for painting and 
illuminating the structure when obstruction marking is required by the 
Commission. (See Sec. 101.21(a).)


<R05>
Sec. 101.125  Temporary fixed antenna height restrictions.

    The overall antenna structure heights employed by mobile stations in 
the Local Television Transmission Service and by stations authorized to 
operate at temporary fixed locations may not exceed the height criteria 
set forth in Sec. 17.7 of this chapter, unless in each instance, 
authorization for use of a specific maximum antenna height (above ground 
and above mean sea level) for each location has been obtained from the 
Commission prior to erection of the antenna. Requests for such 
authorization must show the inclusive dates of the proposed operation. 
(Complete information as to rules concerning the construction, marking 
and lighting of antenna structures is contained in part 17 of this 
chapter.)


<R05>
Sec. 101.129  Transmitter location.

    (a) The applicant must determine, prior to filing an application for 
a radio station authorization, that the antenna site specified therein 
is adequate to render the service proposed. In cases of questionable 
antenna locations, it is desirable to conduct propagation tests to 
indicate the field intensity which may be expected in the principal 
areas or at the fixed points of communication to be served, particularly 
where severe shadow problems may be expected. In considering 
applications proposing the use of such locations, the Commission may 
require site survey tests to be made pursuant to a developmental 
authorization in the particular service concerned. In such cases, 
propagation tests should be conducted in accordance with recognized 
engineering methods and should be made with a transmitting antenna 
simulating, as near as possible, the proposed antenna installation. Full 
data obtained from such surveys and its analysis, including a 
description of the methods used and the name, address and qualifications 
of the engineer making the survey, must be supplied to the Commission.
    (b) In the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, licensees must not locate MVDDS 
transmitting antennas within 10 km of any qualifying NGSO FSS receiver 
unless mutual agreement is obtained between the MVDDS and NGSO FSS 
licensees. Such agreements must be retained by the licensees and made 
available for inspection by interested parties upon request.
    (1) A qualifying NGSO FSS receiver, for the purposes of this 
section, is deemed to be one that is in regular use by an NGSO FSS 
subscriber for normal reception purposes in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band and 
not one for monitoring or testing purposes. In addition, qualifying 
receivers must either be in operation on the date or already be under 
construction and then operating within thirty days of the date that the

[[Page 670]]

MVDDS licensee notifies the NGSO FSS licensee of its intent to construct 
a new MVDDS transmitting antenna at a specified location.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the 10 
kilometer spacing requirement for each MVDDS transmitting antenna site 
shall not apply with respect to NGSO FSS receivers that might be 
installed or become operational (except for those under construction and 
operating within thirty days as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section) subsequent to the original date that the MVDDS licensee 
provided notice of its intention to construct a given transmission 
facility.
    (3) In the event that a proposed MVDDS transmitting antenna for 
which notice has been duly given to the NGSO FSS licensees has not been 
placed in normal operation within one calendar year of the date of 
notice, then the MVDDS licensee loses the benefit of the original 
notice. Upon such anniversary, the MVDDS licensee must re-determine 
compliance with the minimum 10 kilometer spacing requirement based upon 
locations of qualifying NGSO FSS receivers on that anniversary date. A 
new determination of compliance with the spacing requirement shall be 
made for each succeeding anniversary of non-operation for each proposed 
MVDDS transmission site or additional antenna. This provision 
contemplates that failure to commence normal operation at a given MVDDS 
transmitting antenna site within one year of the date of NGSO FSS 
notification may require successive relocations of the proposed 
transmitter site in order to meet the minimum spacing distance as 
determined on each anniversary of non-operation.

<R05>
Sec. 101.131  Transmitter construction and installation.

    (a) The equipment at the operating and transmitting positions must 
be so installed and protected that it is not accessible to, or capable 
of being operated by, persons other than those duly authorized by the 
licensee.
    (b) In any case where the maximum modulating frequency of a 
transmitter is prescribed by the Commission, the transmitter must be 
equipped with a low-pass or band-pass modulation filter of suitable 
performance characteristics. In those cases where a modulation limiter 
is employed, the modulation filter must be installed between the 
transmitter stage in which limiting is effected and the modulated stage 
of the transmitter.
    (c) Each transmitter employed in these services must be equipped 
with an appropriately labeled pilot lamp or meter which will provide 
continuous visual indication at the transmitter when its control 
circuits have been placed in a condition to activate the transmitter. In 
addition, facilities must be provided at each transmitter to permit the 
transmitter to be turned on and off independently of any remote control 
circuits associated therewith.
    (d) At each transmitter control point the following facilities must 
be installed:
    (1) A carrier operated device which will provide continuous visual 
indication when the transmitter is radiating, or, in lieu thereof, a 
pilot lamp or meter which will provide continuous visual indication when 
the transmitter control circuits have been placed in a condition to 
activate the transmitter; and
    (2) Facilities which will permit the operator to turn transmitter 
carrier on and off at will.
    (e) Transmitter control circuits from any control point must be so 
installed that grounding or shorting any line in the control circuit 
will not cause the transmitter to radiate: provided, however, That this 
provision will not be applicable to control circuits of stations which 
normally operate with continuous radiation or to control circuits which 
are under the effective operational control of responsible operating 
personnel 24 hours per day.


<R05>
Sec. 101.133  Limitations on use of transmitters.

    (a) Transmitters licensed for operation in Common Carrier services 
may be concurrently licensed or used for non-common carrier 
communication purposes. Mobile units may be concurrently licensed or 
used for non-common

[[Page 671]]

carrier communication purposes provided that the transmitter is 
certificated for use in each service.
    (b) Private operational fixed point-to-point microwave stations 
authorized in this service may communicate with associated operational-
fixed stations and fixed receivers and with units of associated stations 
in the mobile service licensed under Private Radio Service rule parts. 
In addition, intercommunication is permitted with other licensed 
stations and with U.S. Government stations in those cases which require 
cooperation or coordination of activities or when cooperative use 
arrangements in accordance with Sec. 101.135 are contemplated; 
provided, however, that where communication is desired with stations 
authorized to operate under the authority of a foreign jurisdiction, 
prior approval of this Commission must be obtained; And provided 
further, That the authority under which such other stations operate does 
not prohibit the intercommunication.
    (c) Two or more persons or governmental entities eligible for 
private operational fixed point-to-point microwave licenses may use the 
same transmitting equipment under the following terms and conditions:
    (1) Each licensee complies with the general operating requirements 
set out in this part;
    (2) Each licensee is eligible for the frequency(ies) on which the 
facility operates; and
    (3) Each licensee must have the ability to access the transmitter(s) 
that it is authorized to operate under the multiple licensing 
arrangement.
    (d) LMDS subscriber transmissions. LMDS licensees shall not operate 
transmitters from subscriber locations in the 29.1-29.25 GHz band.
    (e) Existing private operational fixed wireless licensees applying 
to become common carrier wireless licensees shall comply with all 
provisions of the Communications Act and the Commission's rules. 
Applicants must take all required filings, including FCC Form 601, and 
receive all necessary Commission approval prior to operating as a common 
carrier wireless licensee. The regulatory fee associated with FCC 
wireless application Form 601 is waived for applicants who are existing 
private operational fixed licensees seeking common carrier status, 
provided that such licensees have also complied with all other 
discontinuance requirements of Title II of the Act. Applicants are 
responsible for all other Commission regulatory fees.

Sec. 101.141  Microwave modulation.

    (a) Microwave transmitters employing digital modulation techniques 
and operating below 25.25 GHz (except for MVDDS stations in the 12,200-
12,700 MHz band) must, with appropriate multiplex equipment, comply with 
the following additional requirements:
    (1) The bit rate, in bits per second, must be equal to or greater 
than the bandwidth specified by the emission designator in Hertz (e.g., 
to be acceptable, equipment transmitting at a 20 Mb/s rate must not 
require a bandwidth of greater than 20 MHz), except the bandwidth used 
to calculate the minimum rate may not include any authorized guard band.
    (i) Stations authorized prior to December 1, 1988 may install 
equipment after that date with no minimum bit rate. Equipment applied 
for or authorized prior to April 1, 2005 in the 21.2-23.6 GHz band may 
be installed with no minimum bit rate.
    (ii) However, any digital equipment applied for after April 1, 2005 
and equipment replacing existing equipment in the 21.2-23.6 GHz band 
must meet the bit rate standard.
    (2) Equipment to be used for voice transmission placed in service, 
authorized, or applied for on or before June 1, 1997 in the 2110 to 2130 
and 2160 to 2180 MHz bands must be capable of satisfactory operation 
within the authorized bandwidth to encode at least 96 voice

[[Page 673]]

channels. Equipment placed in service, authorized, or applied for on or 
before June 1, 1997 in the 3700-4200, 5925-6425 (30 MHz bandwidth), and 
10,700-11,700 MHz (30 and 40 MHz bandwidths) bands must be capable of 
satisfactory operation within the authorized bandwidth to encode at 
least 1152 voice channels. These required loading levels may be reduced 
by a factor of 1/N provided that N transmitters may be operated 
satisfactorily, over the same radio path, within an authorized bandwidth 
less than, or equal to, the maximum authorizable bandwidth (e.g., the 
1152 channel requirement may be reduced to 576 if two transmitters can 
be satisfactorily operated over the same path within the maximum 
bandwidth). Where certificated equipment is designed to operate on the 
same frequency in a cross polarized configuration to meet the above 
capacity requirements, the Commission will require, at the time 
additional transmitters are authorized, that both polarizations of a 
frequency be used before a new frequency assignment is made, unless a 
single transmitter installation was found to be justified by the 
Commission at the time it authorized the first transmitter.
    (3) The following capacity and loading requirements must be met for 
equipment applied for, authorized, and placed in service after June 1, 
1997 in 3700-4200 MHz (4 GHz), 5925-6425, 6525-6875 MHz (6 GHz), 6875-
7125 MHz (7 GHz), 10,550-10,680 MHz (10 GHz), 10,700-11700 MHz (11 GHz), 
and 12,700-13,150 MHz (13 GHz) bands, except during anomalous signal 
fading. During anomalous signal fading, licensees may adjust to a 
modulation specified in their authorization if such modulation is 
necessary to allow licensees to maintain communications, even if the 
modulation will not comply with the capacity and loading requirements 
specified in this paragraph. Links that use equipment capable of 
adjusting modulation must be designed using generally accepted multipath 
fading and rain fading models to meet the specified capacity and loading 
requirements at least 99.95% of the time, in the aggregate of both 
directions in a two-way link.

\3\ This loading requirement must be met within 30 months of licensing.
  If two transmitters simultaneously operate on the same frequency over
  the same path, the requirement is reduced to 25 percent.

    (4) If a transmitter is authorized to operate in a bandwidth that is 
not listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, it must meet the minimum 
payload capacity and traffic loading requirements of the next largest 
channel bandwidth listed in the table; e.g., if the authorized bandwidth 
is 3.5 MHz, the minimum payload capacity must be 12.3 Mbits/s.
    (5) Transmitters carrying digital motion video motion material are 
exempt from the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) 
of this section, provided that at least 50 percent of the payload is 
digital video motion material and the minimum bit rate specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section is met. In the 6, 10, and 11 GHz bands, 
concatenation of multiple contiguous channels is permitted for channels 
of equal bandwidth on center frequencies, provided no other channels are 
available and the minimum payload capacity requirements are met.
    (6) Digital systems using bandwidths of 10 MHz or larger will be 
considered 50 percent loaded when the following condition is met: at 
least 50 percent of their total DS-1 capacity is being used. A DS-1 
channel is being used when it has been connected to a DS-0/DS-1 
multiplexer. For non-DS-0 services, such as, but not limited to, video 
or broadband data transmission, the next

[[Page 674]]

largest DS-1 equivalent will be considered for the computation of a 
loading percentage.
    (7) For digital systems, minimum payload capacities shall be 
expressed in numbers of DS-1s, DS-3s or STS-1s. The payload capacity 
required by the Commission shall correspond to commercially available 
equipment.
    (b) For purposes of compliance with the emission limitation 
requirements of Sec. 101.111(a)(2) and the requirements of paragraph 
(a) of this section, digital modulation techniques are considered as 
being employed when digital modulation occupies 50 percent or more to 
the total peak frequency deviation of a transmitted radio frequency 
carrier. The total peak frequency deviation will be determined by adding 
the deviation produced by the digital modulation signal and the 
deviation produced by any frequency division multiplex (FDM) modulation 
used. The deviation (D) produced by the FDM signal must be determined in 
accordance with Sec. 2.202(f) of this chapter.
    (c) Analog Modulation. Except for video transmission, an application 
for an initial working channel for a given route will not be accepted 
for filing where the anticipated loading (within five years for voice, 
or other period subject to reasonable projection) is less than the 
minimum specified for the following frequency bands. Absent 
extraordinary circumstances, applications proposing additional 
frequencies over existing routes will not be granted unless it is shown 
that the traffic load will shortly exhaust the capacity of the existing 
equipment. Where no construction of radio facilities is requested, 
licensees must submit this evidence with their filing of any necessary 
authority required pursuant to section 214 of the Communications Act and 
part 63 of this chapter.

    (ii) Traffic loading payload shall exceed 50 percent of payload 
capacity within 30 months of licensing. During anomalous signal fading, 
licensees subject to the capacity and loading requirements may adjust to 
a modulation specified in their authorization if such modulation is 
necessary to allow licensees to maintain communications, even if the 
modulation will not comply with the capacity and loading requirements 
specified in this paragraph. Links that must comply with the capacity 
and loading requirements that use equipment capable of adjusting 
modulation must be designed using generally accepted multipath fading 
and rain fading models to meet the specified capacity and loading 
requirements at least 99.95% of the time, in the aggregate of both 
directions in a two-way link.

For purposes of this subsection, a Fixed Service channel is being used 
if it is attached to a communications system that is capable of 
providing data to it at a rate that is sufficient to occupy at least 50 
percent of the payload capacity of the Fixed Service channel, after 
header compression is applied.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) For paths shorter than those specified in the table in paragraph 
(a) of this section, the EIRP shall not exceed the value derived from 
the following equation:

EIRP = MAXEIRP-40*log(A/B) dBW

Where: EIRP = The new maximum EIRP (equivalent isotropically radiated 
          power) in dBW. MAXEIRP = Maximum EIRP as set forth in the 
          Table in Section 101.113(a).
A = Minimum path length from the Table above for the frequency band in 
          kilometers.
B = The actual path length in kilometers.

    Note to paragraph (b): For transmitters using Automatic Transmitter 
Power Control, EIRP corresponds to the maximum transmitter power 
available, not the coordinated transmit power or the nominal transmit 
power.

    (c) Upon an appropriate technical showing, applicants and licensees 
unable to meet the minimum path length requirement may be granted an 
exception to these requirements.

    Note to paragraph (c): Links authorized prior to April 1, 1987, need 
not comply with this requirement.

Sec. 101.145  Interference to geostationary-satellites.

    These limitations are necessary to minimize the probability of 
harmful interference to reception in the bands 2655-2690 MHz, 5925-7075 
MHz, and 12.7-13.25 GHz on board geostationary-space stations in the 
fixed-satellite service.
    (a) Stations authorized prior to July 1, 1976 in the band 2655-2690 
MHz, which exceed the power levels in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section are permitted to operate indefinitely, provided that the 
operation of such stations does not result in harmful interference to 
reception in these bands on board geostationary space stations.
    (b) 2655 to 2690 MHz and 5925 to 7075 MHz. No directional 
transmitting antenna utilized by a fixed station operating in these 
bands (may be aimed within 2 degrees of the geostationary-satellite 
orbit, taking into account atmospheric refraction. However, exception 
may be made in unusual circumstances upon a showing that there is no 
reasonable alternative to the transmission path proposed. If there is no 
evidence that such exception would cause possible harmful interference 
to an authorized satellite system, said transmission path may be 
authorized on waiver basis where the maximum value of the equivalent 
isotropically radiated power (EIRP) does not exceed:
    (1) +47 dBW for any antenna beam directed within 0.5 degrees of the 
stationary satellite orbit; or
    (2) +47 to +55 dBW, on a linear decibel scale (8 dB per degree) for 
any antenna beam directed between 0.5 degrees and 1.5 degrees of the 
stationary orbit.
    (c) 12.7 to 13.25 GHz. No directional transmitting antenna utilized 
by a fixed station operating in this band may be aimed within 1.5 
degrees of the geostationary-satellite orbit, taking into account 
atmospheric refraction. However, exception may be made in unusual 
circumstances upon a showing that there is no reasonable alternative

[[Page 676]]

to the transmission path proposed. If there is no evidence that such 
exception would cause possible harmful interference to an authorized 
satellite system, said transmission path may be authorized on waiver 
basis where the maximum value of the equivalent isotropically radiated 
power (EIRP) does not exceed +45 dBW for any antenna beam directed 
within 1.5 degrees of the stationary satellite orbit.

not intersect with the service areas of television pickup stations.

    (b) Frequencies normally available for assignment in this service 
are set forth with applicable limitations in the following tables: 928-
960 MHz Multiple address system (MAS) frequencies are available for the 
point-to-multipoint and point-to-point transmission of a licensee's 
products or services, excluding video entertainment material, to a 
licensee's customer or for its own internal communications. The paired 
frequencies listed in this section are used for two-way communications 
between a master station and remote stations. Ancillary one-way 
communications on paired frequencies are permitted on a case-by-case 
basis. Ancillary communications between interrelated master stations are 
permitted on a secondary basis. The normal channel bandwidth assigned 
will be 12.5 kHz. EA licensees, however, may combine contiguous channels 
without limit or justification. Site-based licensees may combine 
contiguous channels up to 50 kHz, and more than 50 kHz only upon a 
showing of adequate justification. Any bandwidth (12.5 kHz, 25 kHz or 
greater) authorized in accordance with this section may be subdivided 
into narrower bandwidths to create additional (or sub) frequencies 
without the need to specify each discrete frequency within the specific 
bandwidth. Equipment that is used to create additional frequencies by 
narrowing bandwidth (whether authorized for a 12.5 kHz, 25 kHz or 
greater bandwidth) will be required to meet, at a minimum, the <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.00015 percent tolerance requirement so that all 
subfrequencies will be within the emission mask. Systems licensed for 
frequencies in these MAS bands prior to August 1, 1975, may continue to 
operate as authorized until June 11, 1996, at which time they must 
comply with current MAS operations based on the 12.5 kHz channelization 
set forth in this paragraph. Systems licensed between August 1, 1975, 
and January 1, 1981, inclusive, are required to comply with the 
grandfathered 25 kHz standard bandwidth and channelization requirements 
set forth in this paragraph. Systems originally licensed after January 
1, 1981, and on or before May 11, 1988, with bandwidths of 25 kHz and 
above, will be grandfathered indefinitely.

    Note to paragraph (b) introductory text: Paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(b)(5) and Tables 1 through 7 of this section pertain to Multiple 
Address System (MAS) frequencies and paragraph (b)(6) and Tables 8 
through 11 of this section pertain to Point-To-Point frequencies.

    (1) Frequencies listed in this paragraph are designated for private 
internal use and are subject to site-based licensing.

    (p)12,200 to 13,150 MHz. (1) 12,000-12,700 MHz. The Commission has 
allocated the 12.2-12.7 GHz band for use by the Direct Broadcast 
Satellite Service (DBS), the Multichannel Video Distribution and Data 
Service (MVDDS), and the Non-Geostationary Satellite Orbit Fixed 
Satellite Service (NGSO FSS). MVDDS shall be licensed on a non-harmful 
interference co-primary basis to existing DBS operations and on a co-
primary basis with NGSO FSS stations in this band. MVDDS use can be on a 
common carrier and/or non-common carrier basis and can use channels of 
any desired bandwidth up to the maximum of 500 MHz provided the EIRP 
does not exceed 14 dBm per 24 megahertz. Private operational fixed 
point-to-point microwave stations authorized after September 9, 1983, 
are licensed on a non-harmful interference basis to DBS and are required 
to make any and all adjustments necessary to prevent harmful 
interference to operating domestic DBS receivers. Incumbent public 
safety licensees shall be afforded protection from MVDDS and NGSO FSS 
licensees, however all other private operational fixed licensees shall 
be secondary to DBS, MVDDS and NGSO FSS licensees. As of May 23, 2002, 
the Commission no longer accepts applications for new licenses for 
point-to-point private operational fixed stations in this band, however, 
incumbent licensees and previously filed applicants may file 
applications for minor modifications and amendments (as defined in Sec. 
1.929 of this chapter) thereto, renewals, transfer of control, or 
assignment of license. Notwithstanding any other provisions, no private 
operational fixed point-to-point microwave stations are permitted to 
cause harmful interference to broadcasting-satellite stations of other 
countries operating in accordance with the Region 2 plan for the 
Broadcasting-Satellite Service established at the 1983 WARC.

    (q) Special provisions for incumbent low power, limited coverage 
systems in the band segments 12.2-12.7 GHz.
    (1) As of May 23, 2002, the Commission no longer accepts 
applications for new stations in this service and incumbent stations may 
remain in service provided they do not cause harmful interference to any 
other primary services licensed in this band as described in paragraph 
(p) of this section. However, incumbent licensees and previously filed 
applicants may file applications for minor modifications and amendments 
(as defined in Sec. 1.929 of this chapter) thereto, renewals, transfer 
of control, or assignment of license.
    (2) Prior to December 8, 2000, notwithstanding any contrary 
provisions in this part, the frequency pairs 12.220/12.460 GHz, 12.260/
12.500 GHz, 12.300/12.540 GHz and 12.340/12.580 GHz, were authorized for 
low power, limited coverage systems subject to the following provisions:
    (i) Maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) shall be 
55 dBm;
    (ii) The rated transmitter output power shall not exceed 0.5 watts;
    (iii) Frequency tolerance shall be maintained to within 0.01 percent 
of the assigned frequency;
    (iv) Maximum beamwidth shall not exceed 4 degrees. However, the 
sidelobe suppression criteria contained in Sec. 101.115 shall not 
apply, except that a minimum front-to-back ratio of 38 dB shall apply;
    (v) Upon showing of need, a maximum bandwidth of 12 MHz may be 
authorized per frequency assigned;
    (vi) Radio systems authorized under the provisions of this section 
shall have no more than three hops in tandem, except upon showing of 
need, but in any event the maximum tandem length shall not exceed 40 km 
(25 miles);
    (vii) Interfering signals at the receiver antenna terminals of 
stations authorized under this section shall not

[[Page 693]]

exceed -90 dBm and -70 dBm respectively, for co-channel and adjacent 
channel interfering signals, and
    (viii) Stations authorized under the provisions of this section 
shall provide the protection from interference specified in Sec. 
101.105 to stations operating in accordance with the provisions of this 
part.
    (r) 17,700 to 19,700 and 24,250 to 25,250 MHz: Operation of stations 
using frequencies in these bands is permitted to the extent specified in 
this paragraph. Until November 19, 2012, stations operating in the band 
18.3-18.58 GHz that were licensed or had applications pending before the 
Commission as of November 19, 2002 shall operate on a shared co-primary 
basis with other services under parts 21, 25, 74, and 78 of this 
chapter. Until October 31, 2011, operations in the band 19.26-19.3 GHz 
and low power systems operating pursuant to paragraph (r)(10) of this 
section shall operate on a co-primary basis. Until June 8, 2010, 
stations operating in the band 18.58-18.8 GHz that were licensed or had 
applications pending before the Commission as of June 8, 2000 may 
continue those operations on a shared co-primary basis with other 
services under parts 21, 25, 74, and 78 of this chapter. Until June 8, 
2010, stations operating in the band 18.8-19.3 GHz that were licensed or 
had applications pending before the Commission as of September 18, 1998 
may continue those operations on a shared co-primary basis with other 
services under parts 21, 25, 74, and 78 of this chapter. After November 
19, 2012, stations operating in the band 18.3-18.58 GHz are not entitled 
to protection from fixed-satellite service operations and must not cause 
unacceptable interference to fixed-satellite service station operations. 
After June 8, 2010, operations in the 18.58-19.30 GHz band are not 
entitled to protection from fixed-satellite service operations and must 
not cause unacceptable interference to fixed-satellite service station 
operations. After November 19, 2002, no applications for new stations 
for 47 CFR part 101 licenses will be accepted in the 18.3-18.58 GHz 
band. After June 8, 2000, no applications for new stations for 47 CFR 
part 101 licenses will be accepted in the 18.58-19.3 GHz band. 
Licensees, except 24 GHz band licensees, may use either a two-way link 
or one frequency of a frequency pair for a one-way link and must 
coordinate proposed operations pursuant to the procedures required in 
Sec. 101.103 of this subpart. (Note, however, that stations authorized 
as of September 9, 1983, to use frequencies in the band 17.7-19.7 GHz 
may, upon proper application, continue to be authorized for such 
operations, consistent with the above conditions related to the 18.58-
19.3 GHz band.) Applicants for one-way spectrum from 17.7-18.58 GHz for 
multichannel video programming distribution are governed by paragraph 
(r)(6) of this section. Licensees are also allowed to use one-way 
(unpaired) channels in the 17.7-17.74 GHz sub-band to pair with other 
channels in the FS portions of the 18 GHz band where, for example, the 
return pair is already in use and therefore blocked or in TDD systems. 
Stations used for MVPD operations in the 17.7-17.8 GHz band must 
coordinate with the Federal Government before operating in the zones 
specified in Sec. 1.924(e) of this chapter.

    (6) MVPD use: Multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) 
can use any size channels for one-way operations in the 17.7-18.58 GHz 
band for any permissible communications specified for this band in Sec. 
101.603 provided that they have coordinated the appropriate emission 
designators and power, but must request contiguous spectrum (minus 
spectrum that is already licensed or prior coordinated in the area and 
thus blocked). MVPD systems must meet the efficiency requirements of 
Sec. 101.141. Spectrum at 18.3-18.58 GHz is only available for 
grandfathered stations. See Sec. 101.85.

    (14) Special provision for low power systems in the 17,700-19,700 
MHz band: Notwithstanding other provisions in 47 CFR part 101 and except 
for specified areas around Washington, DC, and Denver, Colorado, 
licensees of point-to-multipoint channel pairs 25-29 identified in 
paragraph (r)(13) of this section may continue to operate in accordance 
with the requirements of Sec. 101.85 and may operate multiple low power 
transmitting devices within a defined service area. Operations are 
prohibited within 55 km when used outdoor and within 20 km when used 
indoor of the coordinates 38 deg.48[min] N/76 deg.52[min] W (Washington, 
DC area) and 39 deg.43[min] N/104 deg.46[min] W (Denver, Colorado area). 
The service area will be a 28 kilometer omni directional radius 
originating from specified center reference coordinates. The specified 
center coordinates must be no closer than 56 kilometers from any co-
channel nodal station or the specified center coordinates of another co-
channel system. Applicants/licensees do not need to specify the location 
of each individual transmitting device operating within their defined 
service areas. Such operations are subject to the following requirements 
on the low power transmitting devices:
    (i) Power must not exceed one watt EIRP and 100 milliwatts 
transmitter output power;
    (ii) A frequency tolerance of 0.001% must be maintained; and
    (iii) The mean power of emissions shall be attenuated in accordance 
with the following schedule:
    (A) In any 4 kHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from 
the center frequency of the assigned channel by more than 50 percent of 
the channel bandwidth and is within the bands 18,820-18,870 MHz or 
19,160-19,210 MHz:

A = 35 + .003 (F-0.5B) dB


or,

80 dB (whichever is the lesser attenuation).

Where:

A = Attenuation (in decibels) below output power level contained within 
          the channel for a given polarization.
B = Bandwidth of channel in kHz.
F = Absolute value of the difference between the center frequency of the 
          4 kHz band measured at the center frequency of the channel in 
          kHz.

    (B) In any 4 kHz band the center frequency of which is outside the 
bands 18.820-18.870 GHz: At least 43 + 10 log P (mean output power in 
watts) decibels.
    (iv) Low power stations authorized in the band 18.8-19.3 GHz after 
June 8, 2000, are restricted to indoor use only. No new licenses will be 
authorized for applications received after April 1, 2002.
    (s) 21,200 to 23,600 MHz: 50 MHz authorized bandwidth.

    (y) Special requirements for operations in the band 29.1-29.25 GHz. 
(1)(i) LMDS receive stations operating on frequencies in the 29.1-29.25 
GHz band within a radius of 75 nautical miles of the geographic 
coordinates provided by a non-GSO MSS licensee pursuant to paragraphs 
(c)(2) or (c)(3)(i) of this section (the ``feeder link earth station 
complex protection zone'') shall accept any interference caused to them 
by such earth station complexes and shall not claim protection from such 
earth station complexes.
    (ii) LMDS licensees operating on frequencies in the 29.1-29.25 GHz 
band outside a feeder link earth station complex protection zone shall 
cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to resolve technical 
problems with the non-GSO MSS licensee to the extent that transmissions 
from the non-GSO MSS operator's feeder link earth station complex 
interfere with an LMDS receive station.
    (2) No more than 15 days after the release of a public notice 
announcing the commencement of LMDS auctions, feeder link earth station 
complexes to be licensed pursuant to Section 25.257 shall be specified 
by a set of geographic coordinates in accordance with the following 
requirements: no feeder link earth station complex may be located in the 
top eight (8) metropolitan statistical areas (``MSAs''), ranked by 
population, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget as of June 
1993, using estimated populations as of December 1992; two (2) complexes 
may be located in MSAs 9 through 25, one of which must be Phoenix, AZ 
(for a complex at Chandler, AZ); two (2) complexes may be located in 
MSAs 26 to 50; three (3) complexes may be located in MSAs 51 to 100, one 
of which must be Honolulu, Hawaii (for a complex at Waimea); and the 
three (3) remaining complexes must be located at least 75 nautical miles 
from the borders of the 100 largest MSAs or in any MSA not included in 
the 100 largest MSAs. Any location allotted for one range of MSAs may be 
taken from an MSA below that range.
    (3)(i) Any non-GSO MSS licensee may at any time specify sets of 
geographic coordinates for feeder link earth station complexes with each 
earth station contained therein to be located at least 75 nautical miles 
from the borders of the 100 largest MSAs.
    (ii) For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, non-GSO 
MSS feeder link earth station complexes shall be entitled to 
accommodation only if the affected non-GSO MSS licensee preapplies to 
the Commission for a feeder link earth station complex or certifies to 
the Commission within sixty days of receiving a copy of an LMDS 
application that it intends to

[[Page 703]]

file an application for a feeder link earth station complex within six 
months of the date of receipt of the LMDS application.
    (iii) If said non-GSO MSS licensee application is filed later than 
six months after certification to the Commission, the LMDS and non-GSO 
MSS entities shall still cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to 
resolve technical problems, but the LMDS licensee shall not be obligated 
to re-engineer its proposal or make changes to its system.
    (4) LMDS licensees or applicants proposing to operate hub stations 
on frequencies in the 29.1-29.25 GHz band at locations outside of the 
100 largest MSAs or within a distance of 150 nautical miles from a set 
of geographic coordinates specified under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3)(i) 
of this section shall serve copies of their applications on all non-GSO 
MSS applicants, permitees or licensees meeting the criteria specified in 
Sec. 25.257(a). Non-GSO MSS licensees or applicants shall serve copies 
of their feeder link earth station applications, after the LMDS auction, 
on any LMDS applicant or licensee within a distance of 150 nautical 
miles from the geographic coordinates that it specified under paragraph 
(c)(2) or (c)(3)(i) of this section. Any necessary coordination shall 
commence upon notification by the party receiving an application to the 
party who filed the application. The results of any such coordination 
shall be reported to the Commission within sixty days. The non-GSO MSS 
earth station licensee shall also provide all such LMDS licensees with a 
copy of its channel plan.
    (z) 71,000-76,000 MHz; 81,000-86,000 MHz; 92,000-94,000 MHz; 94,100-
95,000 MHz. (1) Those applicants who are approved in accordance with FCC 
Form 601 will each be granted a single, non-exclusive nationwide 
license. Site-by-site registration is on a first-come, first-served 
basis. Registration will be in the Universal Licensing System until the 
Wireless Telecommunications Bureau announces by public notice, the 
implementation of a third-party database. See 47 CFR 101.1523. Links may 
not operate until NTIA approval is received. Licensees may use these 
bands for any point-to-point non-broadcast service.
    (2) Prior links shall be protected using the interference protection 
criteria set forth in section 101.105. For transmitters employing 
digital modulation techniques and operating in the 71,000-76,000 MHz or 
81,000-86,000 MHz bands, the licensee must construct a system that meets 
a minimum bit rate of 0.125 bits per second per Hertz of bandwidth. For 
transmitters that operate in the 92,000-94,000 MHz or 94,100-95,000 MHz 
bands, licensees must construct a system that meets a minimum bit rate 
of 1.0 bit per second per Hertz of bandwidth. If it is determined that a 
licensee has not met these loading requirements, then the database will 
be modified to limit coordination rights to the spectrum that is loaded 
and the licensee will lose protection rights on spectrum that has not 
been loaded.

carrier rendering any such free service must make and file, in 
duplicate, with the Commission, on or before the 31st of July and on or 
before the 31st day of January in each year, reports covering the 
periods of 6 months ending on the 30th of June and the 31st of December, 
respectively, next prior to said dates. These reports must show the 
names of the agencies to which free service was rendered pursuant to 
this rule, the general character of the communications handled for each 
agency, and the charges in dollars which would have accrued to the 
carrier for such service rendered to each agency if charges for such 
communications had been collected at the published tariff rates.

Sec. 101.303  Answers to notices of violation.

    Any person receiving official notice of a violation of the terms of 
the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, any other Federal statute or 
Executive Order pertaining to radio or wire communications or any 
international radio or wire communications treaty or convention, or 
regulations annexed thereto to which the United States is a party, or 
the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, 
must, within 10 days from such receipt, send a written answer to the 
office of the Commission originating the official notice. If an answer 
cannot be sent or an acknowledgment made within such 10-day period by 
reason of

[[Page 707]]

illness or other unavoidable circumstances, acknowledgment and answer 
must be made at the earliest practicable date with a satisfactory 
explanation of the delay. The answer to each notice must be complete in 
itself and may not be abbreviated by reference to other communications 
or answers to other notices. If the notice relates to some violation 
that may be due to the physical or electrical characteristics of 
transmitting apparatus, the answer must state fully what steps have been 
taken to prevent future violations, and, if any new apparatus is to be 
installed, the date such apparatus was ordered, the name of the 
manufacturer, and promised date of delivery. If the installation of such 
apparatus requires a construction permit, the file number of the 
application must be given or, if a file number has not been assigned by 
the Commission, such identification as will permit ready reference 
thereto. If the notice of violation relates to inadequate maintenance 
resulting in improper operation of the transmitter, the name and license 
number of the operator performing the maintenance must be given. If the 
notice of violation relates to some lack of attention to, or improper 
operation of, the transmitter by other employees, the reply must 
enumerate the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of such lack of 
attention or improper operation.

Sec. 101.305  Discontinuance, reduction or impairment of service.

    (a) If the public communication service provided by a station in the 
Common Carrier Radio Services, the Local Multipoint Distribution Service 
or 24 GHz Service is involuntarily discontinued, reduced or impaired for 
a period exceeding 48 hours, the station licensee must promptly notify 
the Commission. In every such case, the licensee must furnish full 
particulars as to the reasons for such discontinuance, reduction or 
impairment of service, including a statement as to when normal service 
is expected to be resumed. When normal service is resumed, prompt 
notification thereof must be given Commission.
    (b) No station licensee subject to title II of the Communications 
Act of 1934, as amended, may voluntarily discontinue, reduce or impair 
public communication service to a community or part of a community 
without obtaining prior authorization from the Commission pursuant to 
the procedures set forth in part 63 of this chapter. In the event that 
permanent discontinuance of service is authorized by the Commission, the 
station license is terminated; except that station licenses in the Local 
Multipoint Distribution Service and 24 GHz Service are not terminated if 
the discontinuance is a result of a change of status by the licensee 
from common carrier to non-common carrier pursuant to Sec. 1.929 of 
this chapter.
    (c) Any licensee not subject to title II of the Communications Act 
of 1934, as amended, who voluntarily discontinues, reduces or impairs 
public communication service to a community or a part of a community 
must notify the Commission within 7 days thereof. In the event of 
permanent discontinuance of service, the station license is 
automatically terminated; except that station licenses in the Local 
Multipoint Distribution Service and 24 GHz Service are not terminated if 
the discontinuance is a result of a change of status by the licensee 
from non-common carrier to common carrier pursuant to Sec. 1.929 of 
this chapter.
    (d) If any common carrier radio frequency should not be used to 
render any service as authorized during a consecutive period of twelve 
months at any time after construction is completed under circumstances 
that do not fall within the provisions of paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of 
this section, or, if removal of equipment or facilities has rendered the 
station not operational, the licensee must, within thirty days of the 
end of such period of nonuse:
    (1) Cancel the station license (or licenses); or
    (2) File an application for modification of the license (or 
licenses) to delete the unused frequency (or frequencies); or
    (3) Request waiver of this rule and demonstrate either that the 
frequency will be used (as evidenced by appropriate requests for 
service, etc.) within six months of the end of the initial period of 
nonuse, or that the frequency will be converted to allow rendition of 
other authorized public services within

[[Page 708]]

one year of the end of the initial period of nonuse by the filing of 
appropriate applications within six months of the end of the period of 
nonuse.

<R05>
Sec. 101.509  Interference protection criteria.

    (a) As a condition for use of frequencies in this service each 
licensee is required to:
    (1) Engineer the system to be reasonably compatible with adjacent 
and co-channel operations in the same or adjacent areas on all 
frequencies; and
    (2) Cooperate fully and in good faith to resolve whatever potential 
interference and transmission security problems may be present in 
adjacent and co-channel operations.
    (b) All harmful interference to other users of co-channel and 
adjacent channel use in the same or adjacent geographical area are 
prohibited. In areas where Economic Areas are in close proximity, 
careful consideration should be given to minimum power requirements and 
to the location, height, and radiation pattern of the transmitting and 
receiving antennas. Licensees are expected to cooperate fully in 
attempting to resolve problems of potential interference before bringing 
the matter to the attention of the Commission.

[[Page 711]]

    (c) Licensee shall coordinate their facilities whenever the 
facilities have optical line-of-sight into other licensees' areas or are 
within the same geographic area. Licensees are encouraged to develop 
operational agreements with relevant licensees in the same or adjacent 
areas. Incumbent SMSA licensee(s) shall retain exclusive rights to its 
channel(s) within its SMSA and must be protected.
    (d) Licensees shall comply with the appropriate coordination 
agreements between the United States and Canada and the United States 
and Mexico concerning cross-border sharing and use of the 24 GHz bands 
which may require using channels pairs in accordance with the table in 
Sec. 101.147(r)(9).
    (e) The Commission recommends that coordination is not necessary if 
the power flux density (pfd) at the boundary of the relevant adjacent 
area is lower than -114 dBW/m\2\ in any 1 MHz. This value can be changed 
and agreed upon by both coordinating parties. Licensees should be able 
to deploy with a pfd up to -94 dBW/m\2\ in any 1 MHz at the boundary of 
the relevant adjacent area without negatively affecting the successful 
operations of the adjacent area licensee.

within ten years of its license grant. A ``substantial service'' 
assessment will be made at renewal pursuant to the provisions and 
procedures set forth in Sec. 1.949 of this chapter. ``Substantial 
service'' is a service which is sound, favorable, and substantially 
above a level of mediocre service which just might minimally warrant 
renewal during its past license term.
    (b) Each licensee must, at a minimum file:
    (1) A report, maps and other supporting documents describing its 
current service in terms of geographic coverage and population served to 
the Commission. The report must also contain a description of the

    (2) Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated 
the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and a list of any 
pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in this 
paragraph (b)(2).
    (c) Failure to demonstrate that substantial service is being 
provided in the service area will result in forfeiture of the license, 
and the licensee will be unable to regain it.
    (d) The frequencies associated with incumbent authorizations, 
licensed on a SMSA basis, that have cancelled automatically or otherwise 
been recovered by the Commission will automatically revert to the 
applicable EA licensee.

Sec. 101.529  Renewal expectancy criteria for 24 GHz licenses.

    (a) A renewal applicant involved in a renewal proceeding shall 
receive a preference, commonly referred to as a renewal expectancy, that 
is the most important factor to be considered in the proceeding as long 
as the applicant's past record for the relevant license period 
demonstrates that:
    (1) The renewal applicant has provided ``substantial service'' 
pursuant to Sec. 101.527; and
    (2) The renewal applicant has substantially complied with applicable 
FCC rules, policies, and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
    (b) In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, a 
licensee in the 24 GHz service involved in a renewal proceeding must 
submit a showing explaining why it should receive a renewal expectancy. 
At a minimum, this showing must include:
    (1) A description of how the licensee has complied with the 
``substantial service'' requirement; and
    (2) Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated 
the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and a list of any 
pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in this 
paragraph (b)(2).
    (c) In making its showing of entitlement to a renewal expectancy, a 
renewal applicant may claim credit for any system modification 
applications that were pending on the date it filed its renewal 
application. Such credit will not be allowed if the modification 
application is dismissed or denied.

Sec. 101.1011  Construction requirements and criteria for renewal
expectancy.

    (a) LMDS licensees must make a showing of ``substantial service'' in 
their license area within ten years of being licensed. ``Substantial'' 
service is defined as service which is sound, favorable, and 
substantially above a level of mediocre service which might minimally 
warrant renewal. Failure by any licensee to meet this requirement will 
result in forfeiture of the license and the licensee will be ineligible 
to regain it.
    (b) A renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding 
shall receive a preference, commonly referred to as a renewal 
expectancy, that is the most important comparative factor to be 
considered in the proceeding as long as the applicant's past record for 
the relevant license period demonstrates that:
    (1) The renewal applicant has provided ``substantial'' service 
during its past license term; and
    (2) The renewal applicant has substantially complied with applicable 
FCC rules, policies, and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
    (c) In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, an LMDS 
renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding must 
submit a showing explaining why it should receive a renewal expectancy. 
At a minimum, this showing must include:
    (1) A description of its current service in terms of geographic 
coverage and population served:
    (2) An explanation of its record of expansion, including a timetable 
of new construction to meet changes in demand for service:
    (3) A description of its investments in its LMDS system; and
    (4) Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated 
the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and a list of any 
pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in this 
paragraph.
    (d) In making its showing of entitlement to a renewal expectancy, a 
renewal applicant may claim credit for any system modification 
applications that were pending on the date it filed its renewal 
application. Such credit will not be allowed if the modification 
application is dismissed or denied.

may be amended to:
    (i) Change the carrier status requested, or
    (ii) Add to the pending request in order to obtain both common 
carrier and non-common carrier status in a single license.
    (2) Amendments to change, or add to, the carrier status in a pending 
application are minor amendments pursuant to Sec. 1.927 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Modification of license. (1) A licensee may modify a license to:
    (i) Change the carrier status authorized, or
    (ii) Add to the status authorized in order to obtain both common 
carrier and non-common carrier status in a single license.
    (2) Applications to change, or add to, the carrier status in a 
license are modifications not requiring prior Commission authorization 
filed under Sec. 1.927 of this chapter. If the change results in the 
discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of an existing service, the 
licensee is also governed by Sec. 101.305(b) or (c) and submits the 
application under Sec. 1.927 of this chapter in conformance with the 
time frames and requirements of Sec. Sec. 101.305 (b) or (c).

Sec. 101.1111  Partitioning and disaggregation.

    (a) Definitions. Disaggregation. The assignment of discrete portions 
or ``blocks'' of spectrum licensed to a geographic licensee or 
qualifying entity.
    Partitioning. The assignment of geographic portions of a licensee's 
authorized service area along geopolitical or other boundaries.

[[Page 723]]

    (b) Eligibility. (1) Parties seeking approval for partitioning and 
disaggregation shall request an authorization for partial assignment of 
a license pursuant to Sec. 101.53. Parties shall submit the forms set 
forth in Sec. 101.15(e).
    (2) Licensees may apply to partition their licensed geographic 
service area or disaggregate their licensed spectrum at any time 
following the grant of their licenses.
    (c) Technical standards--(1) Partitioning. In the case of 
partitioning, requests for authorization for partial assignment of a 
license must include, as an attachment, a description of the partitioned 
service area. The partitioned service area shall be defined by 
coordinate points at every 3 degrees along the partitioned service area 
unless an FCC recognized service area is utilized (i.e., Major Trading 
Area, Basic Trading Area, Metropolitan Service Area, Rural Service Area 
or Economic Area) or county lines are followed. The geographic 
coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and seconds to the 
nearest second of latitude and longitude and must be based upon the 1983 
North American Datum (NAD83). In the case where an FCC recognized 
service area or county lines are utilized, applicants need only list the 
specific area(s) (through use of FCC designations or county names) that 
constitute the partitioned area. In such partitioning cases where an 
unjust enrichment payment is owed the Commission, the request for 
authorization for partial assignment of a license must include, as an 
attachment, a calculation of the population of the partitioned service 
area and the licensed geographic service area.
    (2) Disaggregation. Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.
    (3) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. The Commission will 
consider requests for partial assignment of licenses that propose 
combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.
    (d) License term. The license term for a partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. 101.67 of this chapter.
    (e) Construction requirements. Applications requesting approval for 
partitioning or disaggregation must include a certification by each 
party that it will satisfy the construction requirement set forth in 
Sec. 101.1011 of this chapter. Failure by a party to meet its 
respective construction requirement will result in the automatic 
cancellation of its license without further Commission action.

in aggregation, disaggregation, and partitioning within the bands 
licensed on a geographic area basis. Site-based licensees may aggregate 
spectrum in any MAS bands, but may not disaggregate their licensed 
spectrum or partition their licensed sites.
    (2) Eligible MAS licensees may apply to the Commission to partition 
their licensed geographic service areas to eligible entities and are 
free to determine the portion of their service areas to be partitioned. 
Eligible MAS licensees may aggregate or disaggregate their licensed 
spectrum at any time following the grant of a license.

[[Page 726]]

    (b) Technical standards--(1) Aggregation. (i) There is no limitation 
on the amount of spectrum that an MAS licensee may aggregate.
    (ii) Spectrum licensed to MAS licensees does not count toward the 
CMRS spectrum cap discussed in Sec. 20.6 of this chapter.
    (2) Disaggregation. Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount. A 
licensee need not retain a minimum amount of spectrum.
    (3) Partitioning. In the case of partitioning, applicants and 
licensees must file FCC Form 603 pursuant to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter 
and list the partitioned service area on a schedule to the application. 
The geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and 
seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude, and must be 
based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83).
    (4) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. The Commission will 
consider requests from geographic area licensees for partial assignment 
of licenses that propose combinations of partitioning and 
disaggregation.
    (c) Construction requirements--(1) Disaggregation. Partial assignors 
and assignees for license disaggregation have two options to meet 
construction requirements. Under the first option, the disaggregator and 
disaggregatee would certify that they each will share responsibility for 
meeting the applicable construction requirements set forth in Sec. 
101.1325 for the geographic service area. If parties choose this option 
and either party fails to meet the applicable construction requirements, 
both licenses would be subject to forfeiture at renewal. The second 
option allows the parties to agree that either the disaggregator or 
disaggregatee would be responsible for meeting the requirements in Sec. 
101.1325 for the geographic service area. If parties choose this option, 
and the party responsible for meeting the construction requirement fails 
to do so, only the license of the non-performing party would be subject 
to forfeiture at renewal.
    (2) Partitioning. Partial assignors and assignees for license 
partitioning have two options to meet construction requirements. Under 
the first option, the partitionor and partitionee would each certify 
that they will independently satisfy the applicable construction 
requirements set forth in Sec. 101.1325 for their respective 
partitioned areas. If either licensee fails to meet its requirement in 
Sec. 101.1325, only the non-performing licensee's renewal application 
would be subject to dismissal. Under the second option, the partitionor 
certifies that it has met or will meet the requirement in Sec. 101.1325 
for the entire market. If the partitionor fails to meet the requirement 
in Sec. 101.1325, however, only its license would be subject to 
forfeiture at renewal.
    (3) All applications requesting partial assignments of license for 
partitioning or disaggregation must certify in the appropriate portion 
of the application which construction option is selected.
    (4) Responsible parties must submit supporting documents showing 
compliance with the respective construction requirements within the 
appropriate construction benchmarks set forth in Sec. 101.1325.
    (d) License term. The license term for a partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. 101.1313.

<R05>
Sec. 101.1325  Construction requirements.

    (a) Incumbent and site-based licenses are subject to the 
construction requirements set forth in Sec. 101.63.
    (b) Each MAS EA licensee must provide service to at least one-fifth 
of the population in its service area or ``substantial service'' within 
five years of the license grant. In addition, MAS EA licensees must make 
a showing of continued ``substantial service'' within ten years of the 
license grant. Licensees must file maps and other supporting documents 
showing compliance with the respective construction requirements within 
the appropriate five- and ten-year benchmarks of the date of their 
initial licenses.

[[Page 727]]

    (c) Failure by any licensee to meet these requirements will result 
in forfeiture or non-renewal of the initial license, and the licensee 
will be ineligible to regain it.

<R05>
Sec. 101.1327  Renewal expectancy for EA licensees.

    (a) A renewal applicant shall receive a renewal expectancy at the 
end of the license period as long as the applicant:
    (1) Demonstrates that the licensee has provided continued 
``substantial service,'' i.e., service which is sound, favorable, and 
substantially above a level of mediocre service which just might 
minimally warrant renewal, during its past license term;
    (2) Demonstrates that the licensee has substantially complied with 
applicable Commission Rules, policies, and the Communications Act of 
1934, as amended;
    (3) Provides an explanation of the licensee's record of expansion, 
including a timetable of the construction of new facilities to meet 
changes in demand for services provided by the licensee; and (4) 
Provides a description of investments made by the licensee in its 
system.
    (b) In determining whether a renewal applicant has complied with the 
``substantial service'' requirement by the end of the ten-year initial 
license term, the Commission may consider factors such as:
    (1) Whether the licensee is offering a specialized or 
technologically sophisticated service that does not require a high level 
of coverage to be of benefit to customers; and
    (2) Whether the licensee's operations service niche markets or focus 
on serving populations outside of areas served by other licensees. The 
``substantial service'' requirement can, however, be met in other ways, 
and the Commission will review each licensee's showing on a case-by-case 
basis.
    (c) A ``substantial service'' assessment will be made at renewal 
pursuant to the procedures contained in Sec. 1.949 of this chapter.

Sec. 101.1329  EA Station license, location, modifications.

    EA licensees may construct master and remote stations anywhere 
inside the area authorized in their licenses, without prior approval, so 
long as the Commission's technical and other Rules are complied with, 
except that individual licenses are required for any master station 
that:
    (a) Requires the submission of an environmental assessment under 
Sec. 1.1307 of this chapter;
    (b) Requires international coordination; or
    (c) The station would affect areas identified in Sec. 1.924 of this 
chapter.

Sec. 101.1331  Treatment of incumbents.

    (a) Any MAS station licensed by the Commission prior to July 1, 1999 
in the 928.0-928.85 MHz/952.0-952.85 MHz/956.25-956.45 MHz and 928.85-
929.0 MHz/959.85-960.0 MHz bands, as well as assignments or transfers of 
such stations approved by the Commission and consummated as of January 
19, 2000, shall be considered incumbent.
    (b) Incumbent operators in the 928.0-928.85 MHz/952.0-952.85 MHz/
956.25-956.45 MHz bands are grandfathered as of January 19, 2000, and 
may continue to operate and expand their systems pursuant to the 
interference protection and co-channel spacing criteria contained in 
Sec. 101.105.
    (1) MAS operators are prohibited from acquiring additional 
frequencies in the 928.0-928.85 MHz/952.0-952.85 MHz/956.25-956.45 MHz 
bands and the 932.25625-932.49375 MHz/941.25625-941.49375 MHz bands for 
the purpose of expanding private carrier service and from changing the 
use of their frequencies in any manner that is inconsistent with this 
part. Refer to Sec. 101.147 for designated uses.
    (2) Incumbent operators in the 928.0-928.85 MHz/952.0-952.85 MHz/
956.25-956.45 MHz bands will include incumbents as defined in Sec. 
101.1331(a), as well as, their transferees and/or assignees and the 
successors of the transferees and/or assignees and retain their 
grandfathered status, provided that the use of the MAS frequencies 
remains unchanged

[[Page 728]]

from that of the transferor and/or assignor of the license.
    (c) Incumbent operators in the 928.85-929.0/959.85-960.0 MHz bands 
are grandfathered as of January 19, 2000, and may expand their systems 
provided that the signal level of the additional transmitter(s) does not 
increase the composite contour that occurs at a 40.2 kilometer (25-mile) 
radius from the center of each master station transmitter site. 
Incumbent operators and geographic area licensees may negotiate 
alternative criteria.
    (d) The frequencies associated with incumbent authorizations in the 
928/959 MHz bands that have cancelled automatically or otherwise been 
recovered by the Commission will automatically revert to the applicable 
EA licensee.
    (e) The frequencies associated with incumbent authorizations in the 
928/952/956 MHz bands that have cancelled automatically will revert to 
the Commission.

Sec. 101.1333  Interference protection criteria.

    (a) Frequency coordination. All EA licensees are required to 
coordinate their frequency usage with co-channel adjacent area licensees 
and all other affected parties.
    (b) EA licensees are prohibited from exceeding a signal strength of 
40 dB[micro]V/m at their service area boundaries, unless a higher signal 
strength is agreed to by all affected co-channel, adjacent area 
licensees.
    (c) EA licensees are prohibited from exceeding a signal strength of 
40 dB[micro]V/m at incumbent licensees' 40.2 kilometer (25-mile) radius 
composite contour specified in Sec. 101.1331(c).
    (d) In general, licensees shall comply with the appropriate 
coordination agreements between the United States and Canada and the 
United States and Mexico concerning cross-border sharing and use of the 
applicable MAS frequencies.
    (1) Canada--932.0-932.25 MHz and 941.0-941.25 MHz. (i) Within Lines 
A, B, C, and D, as defined in Sec. 1.928(e) of this chapter, along the 
U.S./Canada border, U.S. stations operating in the 932.0-932.25 MHz and 
941.0-941.25 MHz bands are on a secondary basis and may operate provided 
that they shall not transmit a power flux density (PFD) at the border 
greater than -100 dBW/m\2\ nor -94 dBW/m\2\, respectively. The U.S. has 
full use of the frequencies in these regions up to the border in the 
bands 932.25-932.50 MHz and 941.25-941.50 MHz, and Canadian stations may 
operate on a secondary basis provided they do not exceed the respective 
PFDs shown above. PFD can be determined using the following formula: PFD 
(dBW/m\2\) = 10 log [EIRP/4[pi](D\2\], where EIRP is in watts, D is in 
meters, and the power is relative to an isotropic radiator. The 
technical parameters are also limited by tables 1 and 2:

Canada border, U.S. stations operating in the 928.50-928.75 MHz and 
952.50-952.75 MHz bands are on an unprotected basis and may operate 
provided that they shall not transmit a power flux density (PFD) at or 
beyond the border greater than -100 dBW/m\2\. The U.S. has full use of 
the frequencies in these regions up to the border in the bands 928.25-
928.50 MHz and 952.25-952.50 MHz, and Canadian stations may operate on 
an unprotected basis provided they do not exceed the PFD above. 
Frequencies in the bands 928.00-928.25 MHz, 928.75-929.00 MHz, 952.00-
952.25 MHz, and 952.75-952.85 MHz are available for use on a 
coordinated, first-in-time, shared basis subject to protecting 
grandfathered stations. New stations must provide a minimum of 145 km 
(90 miles) separation or alternatively limit the actual PFD of the 
proposed station to -100 dBW/m\2\, at the existing co-channel master 
stations of the other country, or as mutually agreed upon on a case-by-
case basis. Coordination is not required if the PFD at the border is 
lower than -100 dBW/m\2\. The technical criteria are also limited by the 
following:

Maximum EIRP for master stations in the MHz band: 1000 watts (30 dBW) 
    952-953
Maximum EIRP for fixed remote stations or stations in the 928-929 MHz

    (3) Mexico. Within 113 kilometers of the U.S./Mexico border, U.S. 
stations operating in the 932.0-932.25 MHz and 941.0-941.25 MHz bands 
are on a secondary basis (non-interference to Mexican primary licensees) 
and may operate provided that they shall not transmit a power flux 
density (PFD) at or beyond the border greater than -100 dBW/m\2\. Upon 
notification from the Commission, U.S. licensees must take proper 
measures to eliminate any harmful interference caused to Mexican primary 
assignments. The U.S. has full use of the frequencies in these regions 
up to the border in the bands 932.25-932.50 MHz and 941.25-941.50 MHz, 
and Mexican stations may operate on a secondary basis (non-interference 
to U.S. primary licensees) provided they do not exceed the PFD shown 
above. Stations using the 932-932.5 MHz band shall be limited to the 
maximum effective isotropic radiated power of 50 watts (17 dBW).

Subpart P_Multichannel Video Distribution and Data Service Rules for the 
                           12.2	12.7 GHz Band

    Source: 69 FR 31746, June 7, 2004, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1401  Service areas.

    Multichannel Video Distribution and Data Service (MVDDS) is licensed 
on the basis of Designated Market Areas (DMAs). The 214 DMA service 
areas are based on the 210 Designated Market Areas delineated by Nielsen 
Media Research and published in its publication entitled U.S. Television 
Household Estimates, September 2002, plus four FCC-defined DMA-like 
service areas.
    (a) Alaska--Balance of State (all geographic areas of Alaska not 
included in Nielsen's three DMAs for the state: Anchorage, Fairbanks, 
and Juneau);
    (b) Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands;
    (c) Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands; and
    (d) American Samoa.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1403  Broadcast carriage requirements.

    MVDDS licensees are not required to provide all local television 
channels to subscribers within its area and thus are not required to 
comply with the must-carry rules, nor the local signal carriage 
requirements of the Rural Local Broadcast Signal Act. See Multichannel 
Video and Cable Television Service Rules, Subpart D (Carriage of 
Television Broadcast Signals), 47 CFR 76.51-76.70. If an MVDDS licensee 
meets the statutory definition of Multiple Video Programming Distributor 
(MVPD), the retransmission consent requirement of section 325(b)(1) of 
the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 325(b)(1)) shall 
apply to that MVDDS licensee. Any MVDDS licensee that is an MVPD must 
obtain the prior express authority of a broadcast station before 
retransmitting that station's signal, subject to the exceptions 
contained in section 325(b)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended (47 U.S.C. 325(b)(2)). Network nonduplication, syndicated 
exclusivity, sports blackout, and leased access rules shall not be 
imposed on MVDDS licensees.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1405  Channeling plan.

    Each license shall have one spectrum block of 500 megahertz per 
geographic area that can be divided into any size channels. 
Disaggregation is not allowed.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1407  Permissible operations for MVDDS.

    MVDDS licensees must use spectrum in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band for any 
digital fixed non-broadcast service (broadcast services are intended for 
reception of the general public and not on a subscribership basis) 
including one-way direct-to-home/office wireless service. Mobile and 
aeronautical services are not authorized. Two-way services may be 
provided by using other spectrum or media for the return or upstream 
path.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1409  Treatment of incumbent licensees.

    Terrestrial private operational fixed point-to-point licensees in 
the 12.2-12.7 GHz band which were licensed prior to MVDDS or NGSO FSS 
satellite stations are incumbent point-to-point stations and are not 
entitled to protection from harmful interference caused by later MVDDS 
or NGSO FSS entrants in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, except for public safety 
stations which must be protected. MVDDS and NGSO FSS operators have the 
responsibility of resolving any harmful interference problems that their 
operations may cause to these public safety incumbent point-to-point 
operations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band. Incumbent public safety 
terrestrial point-to-point licensees may only make minor changes to 
their stations without losing this protection. This does not relieve 
current point-to-point licensees of their obligation to protect BSS 
operations in the subject frequency band. All point-to-point 
applications, including low-power operations, for new licenses, major 
amendments to pending applications, or major modifications to existing 
licenses for the 12.2-12.7 GHz band are no longer accepted except for 
renewals and changes in ownership. See Sec. 1.929 of this chapter for 
definitions of major and minor changes.

<R05>
Sec. 101.1411  Regulatory status and eligibility.

    (a) MVDDS licensees are permitted to provide one-way video 
programming and data services on a non-common carrier and/or on a common 
carrier basis. MVDDS is not required to be treated as a common carrier 
service unless it is providing non-Internet voice and data services 
through the public switched network.
    (b) MVDDS licensees in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band are subject to the 
requirements set forth in Sec. 101.7.
    (c) Any entity, other than one precluded by Sec. Sec. 101.7 and 
101.1412, is eligible for authorization to provide MVDDS under this 
part. Authorization will be granted upon proper application filing in 
accordance with the Commission's rules.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1412  MVDDS eligibility restrictions for cable operators.

    (a) Eligibility for MVDDS license. No cable operator, nor any entity 
owning an attributable interest in a cable operator, shall have an 
attributable interest in an MVDDS license if such cable operator's 
service area significantly overlaps the MVDDS license area, as 
``significantly overlaps'' is defined in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) Definition of cable operator. For the purposes of paragraph (a) 
of this section, the term ``cable operator'' means a company that is 
franchised to provide cable service, as defined in 47 CFR 76.5(ff) of 
this chapter, in all or part of the MVDDS license area.
    (c) For the purpose of this section, the term ``MVPD household'' 
refers to a household that subscribes to one or more Multichannel Video 
Program Distributors (MVPDs), as defined in 47 CFR 76.1000(e) of this 
chapter.
    (d) Waiver of restriction. Upon completion of the initial award of 
an MVDDS license, a cable operator may petition for a waiver of the 
restriction on eligibility based upon a showing that changed 
circumstances or new evidence indicate that no significant likelihood of 
substantial competitive harm will result from the operator retaining an 
attributable interest in the MVDDS license.
    (e) Significant overlap with service area. For purposes of paragraph 
(a) of this section, significant overlap occurs when a cable operator's 
subscribers in the MVDDS license area make up thirty-five percent or 
more of the MVPD households in that MVDDS license area.
    (f) Definition of attributable interest. For purposes of paragraph 
(a) of this section, an entity shall be considered to have an 
attributable interest in a cable operator or MVDDS licensee pursuant to 
the following criteria:
    (1) A controlling interest shall constitute an attributable 
interest. Controlling interest means majority voting equity ownership, 
any general partnership interest, or any means of actual working control 
(including negative control) over the operation of the entity, in 
whatever manner exercised.
    (2) Any general partnership interest in a partnership;
    (3) Partnership and similar ownership interests (including limited 
partnership interests) amounting to 20 percent or more of the total 
partnership interests, calculated according to both the percentage of 
equity paid in and the percentage of distribution of profits and losses;
    (4) Any stock interest amounting to 20 percent or more of the 
outstanding voting stock of an entity;
    (5) Any voting or non-voting stock interest, amounting to 20 percent 
or more of the total outstanding stock of an entity;
    (6) Stock interests held in trust that exceed the limit set forth in 
paragraph (f) of this section shall constitute an attributable interest 
of any person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, of any 
person who has the sole power to sell such stock, and, in the case of 
stock held in trust, of any person who has the right to revoke the trust 
at will or to replace the trustee at will. If the trustee has a 
familial, personal, or extra-trust business relationship to the grantor 
or the beneficiary, the stock interests held in trust shall constitute 
an attributable interest of such grantor or beneficiary, as appropriate.
    (7) Debt and interests such as warrants and convertible debentures, 
options, or other interests (except non-voting stock) with rights of 
conversion to voting interests shall not constitute

[[Page 732]]

attributable interests unless and until conversion is effected.
    (8) An interest in a Limited Liability Company (LLC) or Registered 
Limited Liability Partnership (RLLP) amounting to 20 percent or more, 
shall constitute an attributable interest of each such limited partner.
    (9) Officers and directors of a cable operator, an MVDDS licensee, 
or an entity that controls such cable operator or MVDDS licensee, shall 
be considered to have an attributable interest in such cable operator or 
MVDDS licensee.
    (10) Ownership interests that are held indirectly by any party 
through one or more intervening corporations or other entities shall be 
determined by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for 
each link in the vertical ownership chain and application of the 
relevant attribution benchmark to the resulting product, except that, if 
the ownership for any interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 
percent or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were 
a 100 percent interest.
    (11) Any person who manages the operations of a cable operator or an 
MVDDS licensee pursuant to a management agreement shall be considered to 
have an attributable interest in such cable operator or MVDDS licensee, 
if such person or its affiliate has authority to make decisions or 
otherwise engage in practices or activities that determine, or 
significantly influence:
    (i) The nature or types of services offered by such entity;
    (ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (iii) The prices charged for such services.
    (12) Any person or its affiliate who enters into a joint marketing 
arrangement with a cable operator, an MVDDS licensee, or an affiliate of 
such entity, shall be considered to have an attributable interest in 
such cable operator, MVDDS licensee, or affiliate, if such person or its 
affiliate has authority to make decisions or otherwise engage in 
practices or activities that determine:
    (i) The nature or types of services offered by such entity;
    (ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (iii) The prices charged for such services.
    (g) Divestiture. Any cable operator, or any entity owning an 
attributable interest in a cable operator, that would otherwise be 
barred from acquiring an attributable interest in an MVDDS license by 
the eligibility restriction in paragraph (a) of this section, may be a 
party to an MVDDS application (i.e., have an attributable interest in 
the applicant), and such applicant will be eligible for an MVDDS 
license, pursuant to the divestiture procedures set forth in paragraphs 
(g)(1) through (g)(6) of this section.
    (1) Divestiture shall be limited to the following prescribed means:
    (i) An MVDDS applicant holding an attributable interest in a cable 
operator may divest such interest in the cable company.
    (ii) Other MVDDS applicants disqualified under paragraph (a) of this 
section, will be permitted to:
    (A) Partition and divest that portion of the existing service area 
that causes it to exceed the overlap restriction in paragraph (a) of 
this section, subject to applicable regulations of state and local 
governments; or
    (B) Partition and divest that portion of the MVDDS geographic 
service area that exceeds the overlap restriction in paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (iii) Divestiture may be to an interim trustee if a buyer has not 
been secured in the required period of time, as long as the MVDDS 
applicant has no interest in or control of the trustee and the trustee 
may dispose of the license as it sees fit.
    (2) The MVDDS applicant shall certify as an exhibit to its short 
form application that it and all parties to the application will come 
into compliance with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) If such MVDDS applicant is a successful bidder in an auction, it 
must submit with its long-form application a signed statement describing 
its efforts to date and future plans to come into compliance with the 
eligibility restrictions in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (4) If such an MVDDS applicant is otherwise qualified, its 
application will be granted subject to a condition that the applicant 
shall come into compliance with the eligibility restrictions in

[[Page 733]]

paragraph (a) within ninety (90) days of final grant of such MVDDS 
license.
    (5) An MVDDS applicant will be considered to have come into 
compliance with paragraph (a) of this section if:
    (i) In the case of the divestiture of a portion of an MVDDS license 
service area, it has successfully completed the assignment or transfer 
of control of the requisite portion of the MVDDS geographic service 
area.
    (ii) In all other cases, it has submitted to the Commission a signed 
certification that it has come into compliance with paragraph (a) of 
this section by the following means, identified in such certification:
    (A) By divestiture of a disqualifying interest in a cable operator, 
identified in terms of the interest owned, the owner of such interest 
(and, if such owner is not the applicant itself, the relationship of the 
owner to the applicant), the name of the party to whom such interest has 
been divested, and the date such divestiture was executed; or
    (B) By divestiture of the requisite portion of the cable operator's 
existing service area, identified in terms of the name of the party to 
whom such interest has been divested, the date such divestiture was 
executed, the name of any regulatory agency that must approve such 
divestiture, and the date on which an application was filed for this 
purpose with the regulatory agency.
    (6) If no such certification or application is tendered to the 
Commission within ninety (90) days of final grant of the initial 
license, the Commission may cancel or rescind the license automatically, 
shall retain all monies paid to the Commission, and, based on the facts 
presented, shall take any other action it may deem appropriate.

    Note to Sec. 101.1412: Waivers of Sec. 101.1412(f) may be granted 
upon an affirmative showing:
    (a) That the interest holder has less than a fifty percent voting 
interest in the licensee and there is an unaffiliated single holder of a 
fifty percent or greater voting interest;
    (b) That the interest holder is not likely to affect the local 
market in an anticompetitive manner;
    (c) That the interest holder is not involved in the operations of 
the licensee and does not have the ability to influence the licensee on 
a regular basis; and
    (d) That grant of a waiver is in the public interest because the 
benefits to the public of common ownership outweigh any potential 
anticompetitive harm to the market.

<R05>
Sec. 101.1413  License term and renewal expectancy.

    (a) The MVDDS license term is ten years, beginning on the date of 
the initial authorization grant.
    (b) Application of a renewal expectancy is based on a showing of 
substantial service at the end of five years into the license period and 
ten years into the license period. The substantial service requirement 
is defined as a service that is sound, favorable, and substantially 
above a level of mediocre service which might minimally warrant renewal. 
At the end of five years into the license term and ten years into the 
license period, the Commission will consider factors such as:
    (1) Whether the licensee's operations service niche markets or focus 
on serving populations outside of areas serviced by other MVDDS 
licensees;
    (2) Whether the licensee's operations serve populations with limited 
access to telecommunications services; and
    (3) A demonstration of service to a significant portion of the 
population or land area of the licensed area.
    (c) The renewal application of an MVDDS licensee must include the 
following showings in order to claim a renewal expectancy:
    (1) A coverage map depicting the served and unserved areas;
    (2) A corresponding description of current service in terms of 
geographic coverage and population served or transmitter locations in 
the served areas; and
    (3) Copies of any Commission Orders finding the licensee to have 
violated the Communications Act or any Commission rule or policy and a 
list of any pending proceedings that relate to any matter described by 
the requirements for the renewal expectancy.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1415  Partitioning and disaggregation.

    (a) MVDDS licensees are permitted to partition licensed geographic 
areas along county borders (Parishes in Louisiana or Territories in 
Alaska).

[[Page 734]]

Disaggregation will not be permitted by MVDDS licensees in the 12.2-12.7 
GHz band. ``Partitioning'' is the assignment of geographic portions of a 
license along geopolitical or other boundaries. ``Disaggregation'' is 
the assignment of discrete portions or ``blocks'' of spectrum licensed 
to a geographic licensee or qualifying entity.
    (b) Eligibility. (1) Parties seeking approval for partitioning shall 
request from the Commission an authorization for partial assignment of a 
license pursuant to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter.
    (2) MVDDS licensees may apply to the Commission to partition their 
licensed geographic service areas to eligible entities and are free to 
partition their licensed spectrum at any time following the grant of a 
license.
    (3) Any existing frequency coordination agreements shall convey with 
the assignment of the geographic area or spectrum, and shall remain in 
effect for the term of the agreement unless new agreements are reached.
    (c) Technical standards. (1) Partitioning. In the case of 
partitioning, applicants and licensees must file FCC Form 603 pursuant 
to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter and list the partitioned service area on 
a schedule to the application.
    (2) The geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, 
minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude and 
must be based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83).
    (d) Unjust enrichment. 12 GHz licensees that received a bidding 
credit and partition their licenses to entities not meeting the 
eligibility standards for such a bidding credit, will be subject to the 
provisions concerning unjust enrichment as set forth in Sec. 1.2111 of 
this chapter.
    (e) License term. The MVDDS license term is ten years, beginning on 
the date of the initial authorization grant. The license term for a 
partitioned license area shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. 101.1413.
    (f) Construction requirements. Applications requesting approval for 
partitioning must include a certification by each party stating that one 
or both parties will satisfy the construction requirement set forth in 
Sec. 101.1413. Failure by a party to meet its respective construction 
requirement will result in the automatic cancellation of its license 
without further Commission action.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1417  Annual report.

    Each MVDDS licensee shall file with the Broadband Division of the 
Wireless Telecommunications Bureau of the Commission two copies of a 
report by March 1 of each year for the preceding calendar year. This 
report must include the following:
    (a) Name and address of licensee;
    (b) Station(s) call letters and primary geographic service area(s); 
and
    (c) The following statistical information for the licensee's station 
(and each channel thereof):
    (1) The total number of separate subscribers served during the 
calendar year;
    (2) The total hours of transmission service rendered during the 
calendar year to all subscribers;
    (3) The total hours of transmission service rendered during the 
calendar year involving the transmission of local broadcast signals; and
    (4) A list of each period of time during the calendar year in which 
the station rendered no service as authorized, if the time period was a 
consecutive period longer than 48 hours.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1421  Coordination of adjacent area MVDDS stations.

    (a) MVDDS licensees in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band are required to 
develop sharing and protection agreements based on the design and 
architecture of their systems, in order to ensure that no harmful 
interference occurs between adjacent geographical area licensees. MVDDS 
licensees shall:
    (1) Engineer systems to be reasonably compatible with adjacent and 
co-channel operations in the adjacent areas on all its frequencies; and
    (2) Cooperate fully and in good faith to resolve interference and 
transmission problems that are present on adjacent and co-channel 
operations in adjacent areas.
    (b) Harmful interference to public safety stations, co-channel MVDDS 
stations operating in adjacent geographic areas, and stations operating

[[Page 735]]

on adjacent channels to MVDDS stations is prohibited. In areas where the 
DMAs are in close proximity, careful consideration should be given to 
power requirements and to the location, height, and radiation pattern of 
the transmitting and receiving antennas. Licensees are expected to 
cooperate fully in attempting to resolve problems of potential 
interference before bringing the matter to the attention of the 
Commission.
    (c) Licensees shall coordinate their facilities whenever the 
facilities have optical line-of-sight into other licensees' areas or are 
within the same geographic area. Licensees are encouraged to develop 
operational agreements with relevant licensees in the adjacent 
geographic areas. Incumbent public safety POFS licensee(s) shall retain 
exclusive rights to its channel(s) within the relevant geographical 
areas and must be protected in accordance with the procedures in Sec. 
101.103. A list of public safety incumbents is attached as Appendix I to 
the Memorandum Opinion and Order and Second Report and Order, Docket 98-
206, released May 23, 2002. Please check with the Commission for any 
updates to that list.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1423  Canadian and Mexican coordination.

    Pursuant to Sec. 2.301 of this chapter, MVDDS systems in the United 
States within 56 km (35 miles) of the Canadian and Mexican border will 
be granted conditional licenses, until final international agreements 
are approved. These systems may not cause harmful interference to 
stations in Canada or Mexico. MVDDS stations must comply with the 
procedures outlined under Sec. Sec. 101.147(p) and 1.928(f)(1) and 
(f)(2) of this chapter until final international agreements concerning 
MVDDS are signed. Section 1.928(f) of this chapter states that 
transmitting antennas can be located as close as five miles (eight 
kilometers) of the border if they point within a sector of 160 degrees 
away from the border, and as close as thirty-five miles (fifty-six km) 
of the border if they point within a sector of 200 degrees toward the 
border without coordination with Canada. MVDDS licensees shall apply 
this method near the Canadian and Mexican borders. No stations are 
allowed within 5 miles of the borders.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1425  RF safety.

    MVDDS stations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz frequency band do not operate 
with output powers that equal or exceed 1640 watts EIRP and therefore 
will not be subject to the routine environmental evaluation rules for 
radiation hazards, as set forth in Sec. 1.1307 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1427  MVDDS licenses subject to competitive bidding.

    Mutually exclusive initial applications for MVDDS licenses in the 
12.2-12.7 GHz band are subject to competitive bidding. The general 
competitive bidding procedures set forth in part 1, subpart Q of this 
chapter will apply unless otherwise provided in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1429  Designated entities.

    (a) Eligibility for small business provisions. (1) A very small 
business is an entity that, together with its controlling interests and 
affiliates, has average annual gross revenues not exceeding $3 million 
for the preceding three years.
    (2) A small business is an entity that, together with its 
controlling interests and affiliates, has average annual gross revenues 
not exceeding $15 million for the preceding three years.
    (3) An entrepreneur is an entity that, together with its controlling 
interests and affiliates, has average annual gross revenues not 
exceeding $40 million for the preceding three years.
    (b) Bidding credits. A winning bidder that qualifies as a very small 
business, as defined in this section, or a consortium of very small 
businesses may use the bidding credit specified in Sec. 1.2110(f)(2)(i) 
of this chapter. A winning bidder that qualifies as a small business, as 
defined in this section, or a consortium of small businesses may use the 
bidding credit specified in Sec. 1.2110(f)(2)(ii) of this chapter. A 
winning bidder that qualifies as an entrepreneur, as defined in this 
section, or a consortium of entrepreneurs may use the bidding credit 
specified in Sec. 1.2110(f)(2)(iii) of this chapter.

[[Page 736]]


<R05>
Sec. 101.1440  MVDDS protection of DBS.

    (a) An MVDDS licensee shall not begin operation unless it can ensure 
that the EPFD from its transmitting antenna at all DBS customers of 
record locations is below the values listed for the appropriate region 
in Sec. 101.105(a)(4)(ii). Alternatively, MVDDS licensees may obtain a 
signed written agreement from DBS customers of record stating that they 
are aware of and agree to their DBS system receiving MVDDS signal levels 
in excess of the appropriate EPFD limits specified in Sec. 
101.105(a)(4)(ii). DBS customers of record are those who had their DBS 
receive antennas installed prior to or within the 30 day period after 
notification to the DBS operator by the MVDDS licensee of the proposed 
MVDDS transmitting antenna site.
    (b) MVDDS licensees are required to conduct a survey of the area 
around its proposed transmitting antenna site to determine the location 
of all DBS customers of record that may potentially be affected by the 
introduction of its MVDDS service. The MVDDS licensee must assess 
whether the signal levels from its system, under its deployment plans, 
would exceed the appropriate EPFD levels in Sec. 101.105(a)(4)(ii) at 
any DBS customer of record location. Using EPFD calculations, terrain 
and building structure characteristics, and the survey results, an MVDDS 
licensee must make a determination of whether its signal level(s) will 
exceed the EPFD limit at any DBS customer of record sites. To assist in 
making this determination, the MVDDS provider can use the EPFD contour 
model developed by the Commission and described in Appendix J of the 
Memorandum Opinion and Order and Second Report and Order, ET Docket 98-
206 or on the OET website at http://www.fcc.gov/oet/dockets/et98-206.
    (c) If the MVDDS licensee determines that its signal level will 
exceed the EPFD limit at any DBS customer site, it shall take whatever 
steps are necessary, up to and including finding a new transmit site, to 
ensure that the EPFD limit will not be exceeded at any DBS customer 
location.
    (d) Coordination between MVDDS and DBS licensees. (1) At least 90 
days prior to the planned date of MVDDS commencement of operations, the 
MVDDS licensee shall provide the following information to the DBS 
licensee(s):
    (i) Geographic location (including NAD 83 coordinates) of its 
proposed station location;
    (ii) Maximum EIRP of each transmitting antenna system;
    (iii) Height above ground level for each transmitting antenna;
    (iv) Antenna type along with main beam azimuth and altitude 
orientation information, and description of the antenna radiation 
pattern;
    (v) Description of the proposed service area; and
    (vi) Survey results along with a technical description of how it 
determined compliance with the appropriate EPFD level at all DBS 
subscriber locations.
    (2) No later than forty-five days after receipt of the MVDDS system 
information in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the DBS licensee(s) 
shall provide the MVDDS licensee with a list of only those new DBS 
customer locations that have been installed in the 30-day period 
following the MVDDS notification and that the DBS licensee believes may 
receive harmful interference or where the prescribed EPFD limits may be 
exceeded. In addition, the DBS licensee(s) could indicate agreement with 
the MVDDS licensee's technical assessment, or identify DBS customer 
locations that the MVDDS licensee failed to consider or DBS customer 
locations where they believe the MVDDS licensee erred in its analysis 
and could exceed the prescribed EPFD limit.
    (3) Prior to commencement of operation, the MVDDS licensee must take 
into account any new DBS customers or other relevant information 
provided by DBS licensees in response to the notification in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section.
    (e) Beginning thirty days after the DBS licensees are notified of a 
potential MVDDS site in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the DBS 
licensees are responsible for providing information they deem necessary 
for those entities who install all future DBS receive antennas on its 
system to take into account the presence of MVDDS operations so that 
these DBS receive antennas can be located in such a way as to avoid the 
MVDDS signal. These later

[[Page 737]]

installed DBS receive antennas shall have no further rights of complaint 
against the notified MVDDS transmitting antenna(s).
    (f) In the event of either an increase in the EPFD contour in any 
direction or a major modification as defined in Sec. 1.929 of this 
chapter, such as the addition of an antenna, to an MVDDS station, the 
procedures of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section and rights of 
complaint begin anew. Exceptions to this are renewal, transfer of 
control, and assignment of license applications.
    (g) Interference complaints. The MVDDS licensee must satisfy all 
complaints of interference to DBS customers of record which are received 
during a one year period after commencement of operation of the 
transmitting facility. Specifically, the MVDDS licensee must correct 
interference caused to a DBS customer of record or cease operation if it 
is demonstrated that the DBS customer is receiving harmful interference 
from the MVDDS system or that the MVDDS signal exceeds the permitted 
EPFD level at the DBS customer location.

    The 70/80/90 GHz bands are licensed on the basis of non-exclusive 
nationwide licenses. There is no limit to the number of non-exclusive 
nationwide licenses that may be granted for these bands, and these 
licenses will serve as a prerequisite for registering individual links.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1505  Segmentation plan.

    (a) An entity may request any portion of the 71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz 
bands, up to 5 gigahertz in each segment for a total of 10 gigahertz. 
Licensees are also permitted to register smaller segments.
    (b) The 92-95 GHz band is divided into three segments: 92.0-94.0 GHz 
and 94.1-95.0 GHz for non-government and government users, and 94.0-94.1 
GHz for Federal Government use. Pairing is allowed and segments may be 
aggregated without limit. The bands in paragraph (a) of this section can 
be included for a possible 12.9 gigahertz maximum aggregation. Licensees 
are also permitted to register smaller segments than provided here.

[70 FR 29998, May 25, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 101.1507  Permissible operations.

    Licensees may use the 70 GHz, 80 GHz and 90 GHz bands for any point-
to-point, non-broadcast service. The segments may be unpaired or paired, 
but paring will be permitted only in a standardized manner (e.g., 71-
72.25 GHz may be paired only with 81-82.25 GHz, and so on). The segments 
may be aggregated without limit.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1511  Regulatory status and eligibility.

    (a) Licensees are permitted to provide services on a non-common 
carrier and/or on a common carrier basis.
    (b) Licensees are subject to the requirements set forth in Sec. 
101.7.
    (c) Any entity, other than one precluded by Sec. 101.7, is eligible 
for authorization to provide service under this part. Authorization will 
be granted upon proper application filing and link coordination in 
accordance with the Commission's rules.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1513  License term and renewal expectancy.

    The license term is ten years, beginning on the date of the initial 
authorization (nationwide license) grant. Registering links will not 
change the overall renewal period of the license.

[70 FR 29998, May 25, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 101.1523  Sharing and coordination among non-government licensees
and between non-government and government services.

    (a) Registration of each link in the 71-76 GHz, 81-86 GHz, and 92-95 
GHz bands will be in the Universal Licensing System until the Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau announces by public notice the implementation 
of a third-party database.
    (b) The licensee or applicant shall:
    (1) Complete coordination with Federal Government links according to 
the coordination standards and procedures

[[Page 738]]

adopted in Report and Order, FCC 03-248, and as further detailed in 
subsequent implementation public notices issued consistent with that 
order;
    (2) Provide an electronic copy of an interference analysis to the 
third-party database manager which demonstrates that the potential for 
harmful interference to or from all previously registered non-government 
links has been analyzed according to the standards of section 101.105 
and generally accepted good engineering practice, and that the proposed 
non-government link will neither cause harmful interference to, nor 
receive harmful interference from, any previously registered non-
government link; and
    (3) Provide upon request any information related to the interference 
analysis and the corresponding link. The third-party database managers 
shall receive and retain the interference analyses electronically and 
make them available to the public. Protection of individual links 
against harmful interference from other links shall be granted to first-
in-time registered links. Successful completion of coordination via the 
NTIA automated mechanism shall constitute successful non-Federal 
Government to Federal Government coordination for that individual link.
    (c) In addition, the following types of non-Federal Government links 
require the filing with the Commission an FCC Form 601 for each link for 
the purpose of coordination and registration, in addition to registering 
each link in the third-party database:
    (1) Facilities requiring the submission of an Environmental 
Assessment,
    (2) Facilities requiring international coordination, and
    (3) Operation in quiet zones.

Sec. 201.0  Background.

    National policy with respect to the conservation, allocation and use 
of the Nation's telecommunications resources during crises and 
emergencies is set forth in Executive Order 12472. The following parts 
of this chapter address specific responsibilities with respect to 
management of telecommunications resources and related procedures which 
bear upon provision, restoration and continuity of telecommunications 
services during crises and emergencies. In doing so, the chapter 
encompasses both national security and emergency preparedness 
activities, consistent with Executive Order 12472. This concept of 
national security and emergency preparedness telecommunications services 
(as defined in Sec. 201.2(g)) includes crises that do not necessarily 
entail serious degradation of, or serious threats to, national security. 
It therefore is a broader concept than the term ``national security 
emergency preparedness activities'' in Executive Order 12656, which 
concerns only national security emergencies, and preparedness activities 
necessarily related to such emergencies.


<R05>
Sec. 201.1  Authority.

    (a) Authorities and responsibilities related to and bearing upon 
national security and emergency preparedness telecommunications matters 
are set forth in:
    (1) Section 706 of the Communications Act of 1934 (48 Stat. 1104, 47 
U.S.C. 606), as amended.
    (2) The National Security Act of 1947, as amended (61 Stat. 496, 50 
U.S.C. 402).
    (3) The Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. 
app. 2251 et seq.).

the Executive Agent, the NCS Committee of Principals and the Manager. 
The NCS Committee of Principals consists of representatives from those 
Federal departments, agencies or entities, designated by the President, 
which lease or own telecommunications facilities or services of 
significance to national security and emergency preparedness, and, to 
the extent permitted by law, other Executive entities which bear policy, 
regulatory or enforcement responsibilities of importance to national 
security and emergency preparedness telecommunications capabilities. The 
NCS is a confederative arrangement in which member Federal agencies 
participate with their owned and leased telecommunications assets to 
provide necessary communications services for the Federal Government, 
under all conditions, including nuclear war.
    (e) National Coordinating Center (NCC) refers to the joint industry-
government telecommunications entity established by the NCS pursuant to 
Executive Order 12472 to assist in the initiation, coordination, 
restoration and reconstitution of national security and emergency 
preparedness telecommunications services or facilities under all 
conditions of crisis or emergency.
    (f) National priorities means those essential actions and activities 
in which the government and the private sector must become engaged in 
the interests of national survival and recovery.
    (g) National security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) 
telecommunications services, or NS/EP services, means those 
telecommunication services which are used to maintain a state of 
readiness or to respond to and manage any event or crisis (local, 
national, or international) which causes or could cause injury or harm 
to the population, damage to or loss of property, or degrades or 
threatens the NS/EP posture of the United States.
    (h) NS/EP treatment refers to the provisioning of a 
telecommunications service before others based on the provisioning 
priority level assigned by the Executive Office of the President.
    (i) National Telecommunications Management Structure (NTMS) means a 
survivable and enduring management structure which will support the 
exercise of the war power functions of the President under section 706 
of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 606), as amended.
    (j) Private sector means those sectors of non-government entities 
that are users of telecommunications services.
    (k) Telecommunications means any transmission, emission, or 
reception of signs, signals, writing, images, graphics, and sounds or 
intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, optical, or other 
electromagnetic systems.
    (l) Telecommunications resources include telecommunications 
personnel, equipment, material, facilities, systems, and services, 
public and private, wheresoever located within the jurisdiction of the 
United States.
    (m) Wartime emergency means a crisis or event which permits the 
exercise of the war power functions of the President under section 706 
of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 606), as amended.


<R05>
Sec. 201.3  Policy.

    (a) The Federal Government is responsible for resources 
mobilization, including determination of the need for and the extent of 
mobilization necessary in all crises and emergencies, wartime and non-
wartime.
    (b) The President has limited non-wartime NS/EP telecommunications 
functions, and wartime NS/EP functions under the Communications Act of 
1934 (as amended), which have been delegated to Federal agencies under 
Executive Order 12472. Federal, State, and local governments share the 
responsibility for conservation of the Nation's telecommunications 
resources.
    (1) The achievement of survival and recovery during a crisis or 
emergency would establish an unavoidable interdependence between and 
among Federal, State, and local authorities; therefore, there should be 
no barriers between Federal and State levels of authorities and between 
State and local levels of authorities which would impede, obstruct, or 
otherwise hinder effective conservation and equitable allocation of 
telecommunications resources and services to the needs of the Nation.

[[Page 743]]

    (2) The Federal Government will rely upon State governments and 
their telecommunications management organizations for management or 
control of intrastate carrier services and continuity of 
interconnectivity with interstate carriers to assure that national 
objectives and priorities are properly served. Applicable regulations of 
the Federal Communications Commission govern the extent of the 
allocation of responsibility between Federal and State authorities for 
the management of NS/EP intrastate carrier services and the 
interconnectivity of intrastate services for NS/EP telecommunications 
functions.
    (c) A system of telecommunications service priorities will be 
established which facilitates the provisioning and early restoration of 
services considered vital to national interests during those events or 
crises which warrant NS/EP treatment.
    (d) The President is authorized during, or in anticipation of, an 
emergency or major disaster (as defined in the Disaster Relief Act of 
19/4) to establish temporary telecommunications systems and to make such 
telecommunications available to State and local government officials and 
such other persons as deemed appropriate (42 U.S.C. 5185).
    (e) The President also is authorized, during war, when necessary in 
the interest of national defense and security, to direct or establish 
priorities for essential communications with any commercial or 
governmental carrier and to prevent obstruction of telecommunications. 
The President may also suspend or amend rules and regulations, close 
stations and facilities, and authorize U.S. government use and control 
of telecommunications resources with regard to:
    (1) Radio communications (during war, or Presidentially declared 
threat of war, public peril, disaster or national emergency or a need to 
preserve the neutrality of the U.S.) and
    (2) Wire communications (during war or threat of war).
    (f) During an attack on the United States by an aggressor nation, 
and in an immediate postattack period, all decisions regarding the use 
of telecommunications resources will be directed to the objective of 
national survival and recovery. In order to achieve this objective, 
postattack resources will be assigned to activities concerned with the 
maintenance and saving of lives, immediate military defense and 
response, and economic activities essential to continued economic 
survival and recovery.
    (g) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will 
serve as the central authority to control, coordinate, and direct the 
activities of the Nation's telecommunications facilities, systems, and 
services during periods of wartime emergency as determined under section 
706 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 606), as amended.
    (h) Telecommunications resources of the Federal Government will be 
employed, as required, to best serve the continuity of government and 
national interests.
    (i) Federal agencies will, in the development of emergency 
operational plans, minimize, to the extent feasible, dependence upon 
telecommunications services for continuity of essential operations.

<R05>
Sec. 202.0  Objectives.

    (a) During, or in anticipation of, a non-wartime emergency or 
natural disaster, a telecommunications capacity must exist to provide 
temporary telecommunications service to State and local government 
officials and other

[[Page 744]]

persons deemed appropriate by the President.
    (b) In the event of a general war and attack upon the Nation, a 
national telecommunications capability must exist that will support 
telecommunications requirements with respect to national security, 
survival and recovery. The development of survivable telecommunications 
to support essential functions (including an emergency broadcasting 
system), and technical compatibility of signaling methods, transmission 
modes, switching facilities, and terminal devices to permit exchange of 
communications over the surviving media of all systems, government or 
commercial, are crucial elements of such a national capability. In 
addition, a survivable national telecommunications management structure 
is necessary to manage initiation, coordination and restoration of 
telecommunications services. The management structure must include the 
following:
    (1) Legal authority for telecommunications management.
    (2) A control mechanism to manage the initiation, coordination and 
restoration of telecommunications services.
    (3) Procedures to ensure timely damage assessment and allocation of 
residual resources and controlled restoration of services based on 
national policy/direction.
    (4) The capability to execute a telecommunications recovery plan 
based on national policy/guidance.
    (c) Notwithstanding any provision regarding NS/EP Planning and 
Execution, nothing in this part shall be deemed to affect the 
authorities or responsibilities of the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, or any Office or official thereof; or reassign 
any function assigned any agency under the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, or under any other law, 
or any function vested by law in the Federal Communications Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 202.1  Policies.

    (a) The telecommunications resources of the Nation will be available 
for government use during crises and emergencies, wartime and non-
wartime, and to satisfy the needs of the public welfare and safety.
    (b) The National Plan for Telecommunications Support in Non-Wartime 
Emergencies provides procedures for planning and using National 
telecommunications assets and resources in support of non-wartime 
emergencies, including those covered by the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, 
in Presidentially declared Emergencies and Major Disasters, 
Extraordinary Situations, and other emergencies.
    (c) An NS/EP Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) System will 
provide procedures to authorize priority treatment for the provisioning 
and restoration of NS/EP telecommunications services for wartime and 
non-wartime emergencies.
    (d) In wartime emergencies, facilities management will remain 
decentralized to the extent feasible to assure continued flexibility of 
operational response to critical needs, subject to the management 
direction and overriding authority of those officials delegated to act 
for and with the consent of the central point of authority within the 
Federal Government.
    (1) Federally owned, leased, and/or operated telecommunications 
facilities, systems, and networks will be managed during such an 
emergency by the agency normally controlling the facility, system, or 
network except that all operations will be subject to the management 
direction and authority of the officials delegated overall management 
responsibility for Federal Government systems.
    (2) Facilities other than those of the Federal Government, with the 
exception of radio stations in the Aviation Services and certain classes 
of radio stations in the Maritime Services, will be managed by the 
authorized common carrier or other person owning and operating such 
facilities subject to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) guidance 
and direction or in accordance with State or local plans if not subject 
to FCC jurisdiction.
    (3) Radio stations in the Aviation Services and those aboard vessels 
in the Maritime Service will be subject to the control of the Secretary 
of Defense during a national emergency.

[[Page 745]]

    (e) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy is 
the single point of authority within the Federal Government for the 
wartime emergency functions under section 706 of the Communications Act 
(47 U.S.C. 606) with respect to the allocation and use of surviving 
resources in support of national objectives enunciated by the President. 
Authority may be redelegated as necessary and when it can be exercised 
within boundaries established by Presidential authority.
    (f) Radio frequency utilization during a wartime emergency will be 
in accordance with authorizations, assignments, and mobilization plans 
in existence at the onset of the emergency. Subject to the overriding 
control of the Director, OSTP, under the President's War Emergency 
Powers, spectrum management regarding the authorization and assignment 
of radio frequencies will be made by the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration (NTLA) for the Federal Government, and the 
Director, OSTP, through the FCC, for all other entities subject to the 
Commission's jurisdiction. Radio stations are subject to closure if 
considered a threat to national security.
    (g) Section 706 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 
confers authority to the President in the matter of suspension of all 
rules and regulations pertaining to the use and operation of 
telecommunications facilities, public or private during wartime 
emergencies.


<R05>
Sec. 202.2  Criteria and guidance.

    NS/EP planning in government and industry with respect to effective 
conservation and use of surviving telecommunications resources in a 
disaster, emergency or postattack period must provide for orderly and 
uninhibited restoration of services by the carriers and authoritative 
control of services allocation which will assure that priority will be 
afforded the most critical needs of government and the private sector 
with respect to these objectives.
    (a) The preservation of the integrity of characteristics and 
capabilities of the Nation's telecommunications systems and networks 
during wartime or non-wartime emergencies is of the utmost importance. 
This can best be accomplished by centralized policy development, 
planning, and broad direction. Detailed operations management will 
remain decentralized in order to retain flexibility in the use of 
individual systems in responding to the needs of national security, 
survival and recovery. Each Federal agency responsible for 
telecommunications systems operations, and the carriers, are responsible 
for planning with respect to emergency operations. Guidance in this 
matter has been issued from a number of sources and contained in:
    (1) Annex C-XI (Telecommunications), Federal Emergency Plan D 
(Classified).
    (2) National Plan for Telecommunications Support in Non-wartime 
Emergencies.
    (3) The National Communications System Management Plan for Annex

C-XI (Telecommunications) Federal Emergency Plan D (Classified).
    (b) The continuity of essential communications services will be 
maintained through the use of controls and operational procedures to 
assure that priority is given to vital services. NS/EP 
telecommunications services entail policies, procedures and 
responsibilities as described in parts 211 and 213 of this chapter.
    (c) The Nation's telecommunications systems facilities are 
vulnerable to physical and radiological damage. Planning factors with 
respect to the resumption of services in a disaster or postattack period 
must consider the probable loss of facilities which formerly provided 
direct and/or alternate intercity services among surviving population 
centers. Since surviving areas and population centers would serve as the 
sources of support to crippled areas of the Nation, the resumption of 
services between and among surviving metropolitan areas will be a high 
priority with the carriers.


<R05>
Sec. 202.3  Plans preparation and execution.

    Federal authority, substantive provisions, and functional 
responsibilities of the executive office are summarized in the 
following:

[[Page 746]]

accordance with the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601).
    (b) Non-wartime emergency functions. (1) The National Security 
Advisor shall:
    (i) Advise and assist the President in coordinating the development 
of policy, plans, programs and standards within the Federal Government 
for the identification, allocation and use of the Nation's 
telecommunications resources by the Federal Government, and by State and 
local governments, private industry and volunteer organizations, upon 
request, to the extent practicable and otherwise consistent with the 
law, during those crises or emergencies in which the exercise of the 
President's war power functions is not required or permitted by law.
    (ii) Provide policy oversight and direction of the activities of the 
NCS.
    (2) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy 
shall:
    (i) Provide information, advice, guidance and assistance, as 
appropriate, to the President and to those Federal departments and 
agencies with responsibilities for the provision, management or 
allocation of telecommunications resources during those crises or 
emergencies in which the exercise of the President's war power functions 
is not required or permitted by law.
    (ii) Establish a Joint Telecommunications Resources Board (JTRB) to 
assist the Director in providing information, advice, guidance and 
assistance, as appropriate, to the President and to those Federal 
Departments and agencies with responsibilities for the provision, 
management, or allocation of telecommunications resources, during those 
crises or emergencies in which the exercise of the President's war power 
functions is not required or permitted by law.
    (c) Planning and oversight responsibilities. (1) The National 
Security Advisor shall advise and assist the President in:
    (i) Coordination and development of policy, plans, programs and 
standards for the mobilization and use of the Nation's commercial, 
government, and privately owned telecommunications resources to meet 
national security and emergency preparedness telecommunications 
requirements.
    (ii) Providing policy oversight and direction of the activities of 
the NCS; and
    (iii) Providing policy oversight and guidance for the execution of 
the responsibilities assigned to the Federal departments and agencies by 
Executive Order 12472.
    (2) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (or 
a designee) shall:
    (i) Advise and assist the President in the administration of a 
system of radio spectrum priorities for those spectrum dependent 
telecommunications resources of the Federal government which support 
national security and emergency preparedness telecommunications 
functions.
    (ii) Certify or approve priorities for radio spectrum use by the 
Federal government, including the resolution of any conflicts in or 
among priorities under all conditions or crisis or emergency.
    (3) The National Security Advisor, the Director of the Office of 
Science and Technology Policy and the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget shall, in consultation with the Executive Agent 
for the NCS and the NCS Committee of Principals, determine what 
constitutes national security and emergency preparedness 
telecommunications requirements.
    (4) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in 
consultation with the National Security Advisor and the NCS, will 
prescribe general guidelines and procedures for reviewing the

budget estimates by participating agencies.
    (d) Performance of essential government and public services during a 
national emergency, as defined in section 706 of the Communications Act 
(47 U.S.C. 606), as amended, will require a means for communications 
between government and the private sector, communications essential to 
operations of elements of the national economy, and communications for 
national defense and civil defense purposes. The needs of the private 
sector and those of government should be properly coordinated to ensure 
that responses to each of these communities of interest, government and 
private sector, are appropriately balanced. For this reason, with regard 
to wartime emergency functions, the Director, Office of Science and 
Technology Policy (OSTP), has delegated the responsibility for the 
private sector to the Chairman, Federal Communications Commission (FCC), 
and responsibility for the needs of government to the Executive Agent, 
National Communications System (NCS). A parity of level of authority of 
these officials is established. They will coordinate and negotiate 
telecommunications conflicts with respect to the allocation and use of 
the Nation's telecommunications resources, reporting to the Director on 
unresolved issues which are within the domain of their respective 
responsibilities and authorities.
    (e) In order to support the NS/EP telecommunications needs of the 
Federal government, State and local governments, private industry and 
volunteer organizations, under all circumstances, including those of 
crisis or emergency, the following functions shall be performed:
    (1) The Secretary of Commerce, for all conditions of crisis or 
emergency, shall:
    (i) Develop plans and procedures concerning radio spectrum

<R05>
Sec. 211.0  Purpose.

    This part establishes policies and procedures under which government 
and private entities will be furnished restoration priorities to insure 
that leased intercity private line telecommunications services vital to 
the national interest will be maintained during the continuance of a war 
in which the United States engaged. It supersedes the Director of 
Telecommunications Management Order of January 15, 1967 (32 FR 791, 47 
CFR part 201), which is hereby canceled. To assure the effective ability 
to implement its provisions, and also in order that government and 
industry resources may be used effectively under all conditions ranging 
from national emergencies to international crises, including nuclear 
attack, a single set of rules and procedures is essential, and they must 
be applied on a day-to-day basis so that the priorities they establish 
can be implemented at once when the occasion arises. As provided for in 
part 18 of Executive Order 11490, as amended (3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 
820), policies, plans, and procedures developed pursuant to the 
Executive order shall be in consonance with the plans and policies 
contained in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 211.1  Authority.

    (a) Authority to direct priorities for the restoration of 
communications services in national emergencies is vested in the 
President, including authority conferred by section 103 of the National 
Security Act of 1947, as amended (50 U.S.C. 404), section 101 of the 
Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2070), 
section 201 of the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950, as amended (50 
U.S.C. App. 2281), section 1 of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1958, as 
amended (3 CFR, 1954-1958 Comp., p. 447), and section 606 of the Federal 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended. (47 U.S.C. 606).
    (b) Authority to develop plans policies, and procedures for the 
establishment of such restoration priorities has been delegated to the 
National Security Council, by Executive Orders 11051, 11490, and by the 
President's Memorandum of August 21, 1963 (28 FR 9413, 3 CFR part 858 
(1959-63 comp.)), all as amended by Executive Order 12046, (FR 43, 13349 
et seq.).


<R05>
Sec. 211.2  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply herein--
    (a) Communications common carrier or carrier means any person gaged 
in communications common carriage for hire, in intrastate, interstate, 
or international telecommunications.

[[Page 751]]

    (b) Circuit means a carrier's specific designation of the overall 
facilities provided between, and including, terminals for furnishing 
service. When service involves network switching, circuit includes those 
circuits between subscriber premises and switching centers (access 
lines) and those between switching centers (trunks).
    (c) Station means transmitting or receiving equipment or combination 
transmitting and receiving equipment, at any location, or any premise, 
connected for private line service.
    (d) Private line service means leased intercity private line service 
provided by carriers for intercity domestic and international 
communications over integrated communications pathways, and includes 
interchange facilities, local channels, and station equipment which may 
be integral components of such communications service.
    (e) Restoration means the recommencement of service by patching, 
rerouting, substitution of component parts, and other means, as 
determined necessary by a carrier.
    (f) Government means Federal, foreign, State, county, municipal, and 
other local government agencies. Specific qualifications will be 
supplied whenever reference to a particular level of government is 
intended, e.g., Federal Government, State government. Foreign Government 
includes coalitions of governments secured by treaty, including NATO, 
SEATO, OAS, UN, and associations of governments or government agencies, 
including the Pan American Union, International Postal Union, and 
International Monetary Fund. Quasi-government includes eleemosynary 
relief organizations, such as the Red Cross organizations.
    (g) National Communications System (NCS) means that system 
established by the President's Memorandum of August 21, 1963, 
``Establishment of a National Communications System'' (28 FR 9413, 3 
CFR, 1959-1963 Comp., p. 858).
    (h) Executive Agent means the Executive Agent of the National 
Communications System.
    (i) Commission means the Federal Communications Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 211.3  Scope and coverage.

    (a) The priority system and procedures established by this part are 
applicable to:
    (1) U.S. domestic leased intercity private line services, including 
private line switched network services;
    (2) U.S. international leased private line services to the point of 
foreign entry;
    (3) Foreign extensions of U.S. international leased private line 
services to the extent possible through agreement between U.S. carriers 
and foreign correspondents;
    (4) International leased private line services terminating in or 
transiting the United States;
    (5) Federal Government-owned and leased circuits.
    (b) The priority system and procedures established by this part are 
not applicable to operational circuits or order wires of the carriers 
needed for circuit reactivation and maintenance purposes, which shall 
have priority of restoration over all other circuits and shall be exempt 
from interruption for the purpose of restoring priority services.


<R05>
Sec. 211.4  Policy.

    During the continuance of a war in which the United States is 
engaged and when the provisions of this part are invoked, all 
communications common carriers shall comply with the following 
principles insofar as possible:
    (a) Whenever necessary to maintain or restore a service having a 
designated priority, services having lower priority, lower subpriority, 
or no priority, will be interrupted in the reverse order of priority 
starting with nonpriority services.
    (b) When services are interrupted to restore priority services, 
carriers will endeavor if feasible to notify users of the reason for the 
preemption.
    (c) When public correspondence circuits are needed to satisfy 
requirements for priority services, idle circuits will be selected 
first. A minimum number of public correspondence circuits shall at all 
times be kept available so as to provide for the transmission of 
precedence-type messages and calls.

[[Page 752]]

    (d) Communications common carriers will not interrupt conversations 
having priority classification except insofar as necessary to restore 
services of higher priority.
    (e) It is recognized that as a practical matter in providing for the 
maintenance or restoration of a priority service or services operating 
within a multiple circuit-type facility (such as a carrier band, cable, 
or multiplex system), lower priority, lower subpriority, or nonpriority 
services on paralleled channels within a band or system may be restored 
concurrently with higher priority services. Such reactivation shall not, 
however, interfere with the expedited restoration of other priority 
services.
    (f) The Executive Agent is authorized to instruct the carriers on 
the percentage of government-switched network intermachine trunks to be 
restored to provide capacity for priority access line traffic.
    (g) The carriers are authorized to honor NCS-certified priorities 
from other authorized carriers for leased facilities.
    (h) The carriers are authorized to honor restoration priorities 
certified by the Executive Agent.
    (i) To ensure the effectiveness of the system of restoration 
priorities established by this part it is essential that rigorous 
standards be applied. Users are requested and directed to examine their 
private line service requirements in light of the criteria specified in 
this part and with regard to the availability of alternate 
communications facilities such as public correspondence message 
services, and Government-owned emergency communications systems.


<R05>
Sec. 211.5  Priorities.

    There are hereby established four levels of restoration priority. 
Within each level, subpriorities may be established by the Executive 
Agent, with the concurrence of the National Security Council, for both 
government and nongovernment services. The subpriorities categories 
currently in use, which have been established by the Executive Agent 
will remain in effect until modified. Compatibility of subcategories 
applicable to government and nongovernment users is essential to achieve 
the objective of a single restoration priority system.
    (a) Priority 1. Priority 1 shall be the highest level of restoration 
priority, and shall be afforded only to Federal and Foreign Government 
private line services, and to Industrial/Commercial services which are 
designated for prearranged voluntary participation with the Federal 
Government in a national emergency. Circuit requirements in this level 
of priority shall be limited to those esential to national survival if 
nuclear attack occurs for:
    (1) Obtaining or disseminating critical intelligence concerning the 
attack, or immediately necessary to maintain the internal security of 
the United States;
    (2) Conducting diplomatic negotiations critical to the arresting or 
limiting of hostilities;
    (3) Executing military command and control functions essential to 
defense and retaliation;
    (4) Giving warning to the U.S. population;
    (5) Maintaining federal Government functions essential to national 
survival under nuclear attack conditions.
    (b) Priority 2. Priority 2 shall be the second highest level of 
restoration priority, and shall be afforded only to Federal and Foreign 
Government private line services, and to Industrial/Commercial services 
which are designated for prearranged voluntary participation with the 
Federal Government in a national emergency. Circuit requirements in this 
level shall be limited to those essential, at a time when nuclear attack 
threatens, to maintain an optimum defense posture and to give civil 
alert to the U.S. population. These are circuit requirements whose 
unavailability would present serious dangers:
    (1) Reducing significantly the preparedness of U.S. defense and 
retalitory forces;
    (2) Affecting adversely the ability of the United States to conduct 
critical preattack diplomatic negotiations to reduce or limit the threat 
of war;
    (3) Interfering with the effectual direction of the U.S. population 
in the interest of civil defense and survival;

[[Page 753]]

    (4) Weakening U.S. capability to accomplish critical national 
internal security functions;
    (5) Inhibiting the provision of essential Federal Government 
functions necessary to meet a preattack situation.
    (c) Priority 3. Priority 3 shall be the third highest level of 
restoration priority and shall be afforded to government, quais-
government, and Industrial/Commercial private line services: Provided, 
however, That Priority 3 will be afforded circuits serving Industrial/
Commercial, State, county, municipal, and quasi-state and local 
government agencies only where, during an emergency, at least one 
station in the circuit (or in connected circuits if switched service is 
involved) will be manned continually, or where such circuits are 
automated and will be under constant surveillance from a remote 
location. Circuit requirements in this level shall be limited to those 
necessary for U.S. military defense and diplomacy, for law and order, 
and for national health and safety in a national emergency involving 
heightened possibility of hostilities. These are curcuit requirements 
needed to:
    (1) Insure performance of critical logistic functions, public 
utility services, and administrative-military support functions;
    (2) Inform key diplomatic posts of the situation and of U.S. 
intentions;
    (3) Secure and disseminate urgent intelligence;
    (4) Distribute essential food and other supplies critical to health;
    (5) Provide for critical damage control functions;
    (6) Provide for hospitalization;
    (7) Continue critical Government functions;
    (8) Provide transportation for the foregoing activities.
    (d) Priority 4. Priority shall be the fourth highest restoration 
priority and shall be afforded to government, quasi-government, and 
Industrial/Commercial private line services: Provided, however, That 
Priority 4 will be afforded circuits serving Industrial/Commercial, 
State, county, municipal, and quasi-state and local government agencies 
only where, during an emergency, at least one station in the circuit (or 
in connected circuits if switched service is involved) will be manned 
continually, or where such circuits are automated and will be under 
constant surveillance from a remote location. Circuit requirements in 
this level shall be limited to those necessary for the maintenance of 
the public welfare and the national economy in a situation short of 
nuclear attack, or during reconstitution after attack. These include 
circuit requirements needed to continue the more important financial, 
economic, health, and safety activities of the Nation.


<R05>
Sec. 211.6  Submission and processing of restoration priority requests.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided below, all requests for restoration 
priority assignments will be submitted to the Executive Agent in the 
format prescribed by him for processing and certification.
    (b) Priority 3 and 4 applications from county and municipal 
governments, quasi-state and local government agencies and private 
entites shall be forwarded to the Federal Communications Commission for 
its approval and for certification to the carriers. These submissions 
will be in the form prescribed by the Commission.
    (c) Industrial/Commercial entities designated for prearranged 
voluntary participation with the Federal Government in a national 
emergency should submit separate applications to the Commission when 
requesting the assignment of priorities in category 1 or 2. Such 
assignments will require the approval of the National Security Council 
in order to continue to be effective during a war emergency. In all 
cases the justification for restoration priorities will contain a 
validation statement from the Government agency with whom participation 
is prearranged.
    (d) Requests for restoration priority assignments made by Foreign 
Government agencies, except for NATO, NATO national military authority, 
and such other requests as the Executive Agent may be designated, will 
be submitted to the Department of State for initial evaluation and 
review. The Department will forward to the Executive Agent for 
processing and approval such of these requests as it finds acceptable.

[[Page 754]]

    (e) Requests for restoration priority assignments made by NATO, NATO 
national military authority, and such other requests as the Executive 
Agent may designate, will be forwarded through established Allied Long 
Lines Agency (ALLA) channels to the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary 
will forward to the Executive Agent for processing and approval such of 
these requests as he finds acceptable pursuant to approved NATO/U.S. 
procedures.
    (f) Requests for temporary upgrading of restoration priority 
assignments occasioned by special critical conditions, including natural 
disasters, heightened diplomatic and political tenseness, and tracking 
and control of manned space operations, may be submitted to the 
Executive Agent together with such information as he may require for 
expedited processing decision.
    (g) All assignments, denials and changes of restoration priorities 
and subpriorities are subject to review and modification by the National 
Security Council.
    (h) When requesting service from the carriers the user must include 
the certified restoration priority on the service authorization.


<R05>
Sec. 211.7  Obligation of carriers.

    (a) During the continuance of a war in which the United States is 
engaged, and when the provisions of this part are invoked, all carriers 
shall accord restoration priority assignments certified pursuant to this 
part priority over all other circuits.
    (b) To promote the national interest and defense preparedness, 
carriers shall:
    (1) Maintain such records of restoration priority assignments 
certified pursuant to this part as may be necessary to enable prompt 
implementation;
    (2) Enter into agreements, to the extent possible, with their 
foreign correspondents to effect restoration of the foreign portion of 
leased international services in accordance with this part;
    (3) Notify the Executive Agent of foreign correspondent procedures 
affecting Federal Government services that are not reasonably consistent 
with the priority requirements of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 213.0  Authority.

    (a) The voice and message precedence procedures for departments and 
agencies of the Federal Government prescribed by this part are 
prescribed pursuant to Executive Order No. 12046 (43 FR 13349 et seq.) 
and the President's memorandum of August 21, 1963, which established the 
National Communications System (28 FR 9413; 3 CFR, 1959-1963 Comp., p. 
858).
    (b) The procedures applicable to communications common carriers and 
non-Federal Government users prescribed by this part are prescribed by 
authority conferred upon the President by subsection 606(a) of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and delegated to the National 
Security Council by Executive Order 12046. That authority under section 
606(a) may be exercised only during the continuance of a war in which 
the United States is engaged.


<R05>
Sec. 213.1  Background and purpose.

    (a) The National Security Council and the Federal Communications 
Commission have agreed upon a precedence system for the expeditious 
handling of messages and calls transmitted over Government and public 
correspondence facilities in all types of situations from peacetime to 
massive nuclear attack. Effectuation of that system requires that the 
Director issue a circular and that the Commission concurrently issue an 
order prescribing the standards, procedures, policies, and regulations 
that together, constitute this single integrated precedence system.
    (b) In conformity with that agreement the National Security Council 
is issuing this circular the purpose of

[[Page 756]]

which is to prescribe, on behalf of the President, that part of those 
standards, procedures, policies, and regulations which are within the 
cognizance of the NSC. No significance should be attached to the fact 
that slightly different terms are used in their circular from those used 
in the companion order of the FCC. Those differences result from 
differences in terms in the basic legal authorities of the director and 
the Commission rather than from an intent to denote a distinction in 
purpose or effect.


<R05>
Sec. 213.2  Scope.

    The precedence system contained herein is applicable to:
    (a) Users of Government service facilities, whether owned or leased.
    (b) Users of public correspondence service facilities of the 
communication common carriers, to U.S. domestic and international 
communication common carriers, and to the extent possible by agreement 
between the latter and their foreign correspondents.


<R05>
Sec. 213.3  Cancellation.

    This circular cancels:
    (a) Attachments A and B to Annex 3 of DMO 3000.1, dated November 8, 
1963 (28 FR 12273).
    (b) That portion of the memorandum of the Special Assistant to the 
President for Telecommunications, dated August 27, 1964, pertaining to 
message precedences.


<R05>
Sec. 213.4  Definitions.

    As used herein:
    (a) Public correspondence services means those services offered to 
the general public for communications between all points served by a 
carrier or by interconnected carriers on a nonexclusive message by 
message or call by call basis, as differentiated from leased private 
line services.
    (b) The term precedence means the order in which messages and calls 
are processed. Transmission of information and call completion is 
therefore to be accomplished in the order required by the precedence 
designator. Any such properly categorized communications precede 
noncategorized communications.
    (c) The term Government where used alone means Federal, foreign, 
State, county, or municipal government agencies. Specific reference will 
be made whenever it is intended to apply to less than the whole, e.g., 
State Government, Federal Government, etc.
    (d) The term Foreign Government includes those foreign diplomatic 
and consular establishments and those coalitions or associations of 
governments such as NATO, SEATO, OAS, UN, and associations of 
governments or governmental agencies such as Pan American Union, 
International Postal Union, International Monetary Fund, and similar 
organizations.
    (e) The term message means a written or other form of record 
communication prepared for transmission and delivery at the destination.
    (f) The term call means a request from a user for a connection to 
another station whether for telephone or record communication.


<R05>
Sec. 213.5  Precedence designators.

    (a) The following precedence designators are available for 
Government and public correspondence users:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  Domestic public
            Federal Government                   correspondence and
                                           international telephone calls
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flash....................................  Flash emergency.
Immediate................................  Immediate emergency.
Priority.................................  Priority emergency.
Routine..................................  (No domestic equivalent.)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Government and non-Government users of public correspondence 
services will handle their international messages in accordance with 
current ITU Telegraph Regulations. Government users should note that, 
generally, the only precedence designator available for their use for 
international messages sent over public correspondence circuits if Etat 
Priorite. The ITU Regulations do not contain precedence designators 
which equate to Flash, Immediate, or Priority. Accordingly, Government 
messages whether Flash, Immediate, or Priority precedence when sent over 
international public correspondence circuits will be handled as Etat 
Priorite messages. Thus, Priority messages will receive the same 
treatment in transmission and processing as

[[Page 757]]

Immediate or Flash messages. Conversely, Etat Priorite messages received 
in the United States shall be transmitted and processed in the order of 
receipt, to the extent possible. The precedence designator available for 
non-Government users of public correspondence services is Urgent. The 
Urgent designator is limited for use only during wartime conditions, as 
declared pursuant to section 606 of the Communications Act of 1934.
    (c) Domestic and International U.S. common carriers, insofar as 
practicable by agreement with their foreign correspondents, shall 
endeavor to arrange the proper level of precedence handling of 
international messages and calls originating, terminating in, or 
transiting the United States: Provided, however, That insofar as 
international messages are concerned the level of precedence shall be 
consistent with the International Telecommunication Conventions and 
regulations thereunder.
    (d) The Government designators shall be used throughout the Federal 
Government. All messages and telephone calls sent via public 
correspondence services shall use domestic or international public 
correspondence des ignators as appropriate. Thus, the responsibility is 
on Government and public correspondence users to recognize and use the 
appropriate designators when using public correspondence services.
    (e) On international telephone calls the carrier's operator will 
convert to the appropriate international designator.


<R05>
Sec. 213.6  Criteria.

    (a) Flash, Flash Emergency. (1) This is the highest order of 
precedence and shall be strictly limited to Federal and Foreign 
Government agencies.
    (2) Flash, or Flash Emergency telephone calls or messages shall be 
handled in the order received and ahead of all calls or messages except 
as indicated for international messages in ITU Regulations. When 
necessary to obtain a circuit for a Flash, or Flash Emergency call any 
call in progress of a lesser precedence will be interrupted, if 
feasible. Any message of a lesser precedence in the process of 
transmission will be halted, if feasible, to clear the channel for the 
Flash or Flash Emergency transmission. Flash or Flash Emergency 
precedence shall be reserved for calls and messages having an immediate 
bearing on:
    (i) Command and control of military forces essential to defense and 
retaliation.
    (ii) Critical intelligence essential to national survival.
    (iii) Conduct of diplomatic negotiations critical to the arresting 
or limiting of hostilities.
    (iv) Dissemination of critical civil alert information essential to 
national survival.
    (v) Continuity of Federal governmental functions essential to 
national survival.
    (vi) Fulfillment of critical U.S. internal security functions 
essential to national survival.
    (vii) Catastrophic events of national or international significance, 
such as Presidential Action Notices essential to national survival 
during attack or preattack conditions.
    (b) Immediate, Immediate Emergency, Urgent. Immediate, Immediate 
Emergency, or Urgent telephone calls or messages shall be handled as 
fast as possible and ahead of all other calls or messages except those 
having a higher precedence. Any message or call of a lower precedence in 
the process of transmission will be halted, if feasible, to clear the 
channel for this transmission. It will be reserved generally for calls 
or messages pertaining to:
    (1) Situations which gravely affect the security of national and 
allied forces.
    (2) Reconstitution of forces in a post attack period.
    (3) Intelligence essential to national security.
    (4) Conduct of diplomatic negotiations to reduce or limit the threat 
of war.
    (5) Implementation of Federal Government actions essential to 
national survival.
    (6) Situations which gravely affect the internal security of the 
United States.
    (7) Civil defense actions concerning direction of our population and 
its survival.

[[Page 758]]

    (8) Disasters or events of extensive seriousness having an immediate 
and detrimental effect on the welfare of the population.
    (9) Vital information having an immediate effect on aircraft, 
spacecraft, or missile operations.
    (c) Priority, Priority Emergency, Urgent. Priority, Priority 
Emergency, or Urgent messages and calls shall take precedence over 
messages or calls designated Routine, or in the case of common carriers, 
over all nonprecedence traffic. Priority, Priority Emergency, or Urgent 
precedence is generally reserved for calls or messages which require 
expeditious action. Examples are calls or messages pertaining to:
    (1) Information on locations where attack is impending or where fire 
or air support will soon be placed.
    (2) Air-ground integrated operations.
    (3) Important intelligence.
    (4) Important diplomatic information.
    (5) Important information concerning the launch, operation, or 
recovery of spacecraft or missiles.
    (6) Movement of naval, air, and ground forces.
    (7) Coordination between governmental agencies concerning the 
performance of emergency preparedness functions.
    (8) Major civil aircraft accidents.
    (9) Maintaining the public health, safety, and the welfare of our 
population.
    (10) Critical logistic functions, provisions of critical public 
utility services, and administrative military support functions.
    (11) Distributing essential food and supplies critical to health.
    (12) Accomplishing tasks necessary to insure critical damage control 
functions.
    (13) Preparations for adequate hospitalization.
    (14) Continuity of critical Government functions.
    (15) Arranging minimum transportation for accomplishing the 
aforesaid functions.
    (16) Continuing or reestablishing our more important financial, 
economic, health, and safety activities. Producing, procuring, and 
distributing food materials and supplies which are considered necessary 
to the immediate support of a war effort, the national defense, or for 
expediting the means of meeting the effects of natural disas ters.
    (17) Prompt delivery of information by press representatives to news 
media organizations and newspapers covering news of national or 
widespread disasters.
    (d) Routine; no domestic equivalent. Routine precedence designation 
applies to those normal day-to-day communications which require rapid 
transmission by telephone or message, but do not require urgent or 
preferential handling.


<R05>
Sec. 213.7  Policies.

    (a) Calls and messages in each precedence classification above shall 
have no precedence over others within the same classification, except 
where, within the same classification, they cannot be handled 
simultaneously. Then, they shall be handled in the order of their 
receipt.
    (b) Individuals whose requirements qualify them to use the 
precedence system share the responsibility for insuring its 
effectiveness. Users must familiarize themselves with the purposes to be 
served by the use of each precedence designator. It must be remembered 
that the entire system will operate successfully only if the use of the 
precedence designator is limited strictly to the intended purposes. Each 
user must consider whether each message or call requires any special 
precedence and exercise care not to specify a higher precedence than 
circumstances require.
    (c) For public correspondence message services, the domestic or 
international precedence designators shall be shown in full by the 
sender as the first word preceding the name of the addressee.
    (d) For public correspondence call services, the user should first 
attempt to complete the call in the normal manner. In the event the user 
is unable to complete the call and the type of communication falls 
within one of the precedence categories listed herein the call should be 
filed with an operator for completion and the user must specify the 
required precedence handling by stating that this is a Flash Emergency,

[[Page 759]]

Immediate Emergency, or Priority Emergency call, whichever the case may 
be.
    (e) Any apparent misuse of precedence indicators by non-Federal 
Government activities brought to the attention of the communication 
common carriers shall be referred to the FCC on and after-the-fact 
basis.
    (f) Any apparent misuse by Federal Government activities brought to 
the attention of the communication common carriers shall be referred to 
the Executive Agent, National Communications System. The Executive Agent 
will refer any matter which cannot be resolved with the cognizant 
Government activity to the National Security Council, for decision.
    (g) It is essential to provide public message and call capability 
for the transmission of military, governmental, and essential non-
Government precedence messages and calls. Private line services for 
military, governmental, and other essential users are protected under a 
Priority System for Intercity Private Line Services promulgated by the 
FCC (FCC Order 67-51) and the National Security Council. However, during 
national emergencies, military, governmental, and other essential users 
will have additional requirements for prompt completion of precedence 
traffic over public correspondence communication common carrier 
facilities. Therefore, notwithstanding the provisions of the above-
described Priority System for Intercity Private Line Services, 
communication common carriers shall have available a minimum number of 
public correspondence circuits at all times so as to provide for the 
transmission of precedence type messages and calls. Normally, the 
communication common carriers shall use their judgment in determining 
this number of circuits required for public correspondence precedence 
traffic. However, the authority is reserved to the National Security 
Council or the Federal Communications Commission, as appropriate to the 
time and situation, to revise the decisions of the carriers respecting 
the allocation of circuits, and to resolve any questions which are 
referred to them by the carriers or the users.


<R05>
Sec. 213.8  Implementation.

    Federal departments and agencies are authorized to issue such 
additional orders as are necessary to effect implementation of this 
circular.

<R05>
Sec. 215.0  Purpose and authority.

    The purpose of this part is to designate a focal point within the 
Federal Government for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) information 
concerning telecommunications. It is issued pursuant to the authority of 
Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977, 42 FR 56101, 91 Stat. 1633, as 
amended (5 U.S.C. appendix), Executive Order 12472, (49 FR 13471; 3 CFR, 
1984 Comp., p. 193), ``Assignment of National Security and Emergency 
Preparedness Telecommunications, April 3, 1984 and Executive Order 
12046, 43 FR 13349, ``Relating to the Transfer of Telecommunications 
Functions,'' May 27, 1978, as amended by Executive Order 12472.


<R05>
Sec. 215.1  Background.

    (a) The nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is part of the complex 
environment produced by nuclear explosions. It consists of transient 
voltages and currents which can cause malfunctioning and serious damage 
to electrical and electronic equipment.
    (b) The Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA) is the overall technical 
coordinator for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and DOE laboratories on 
matters concerning nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons effects, and nuclear 
weapons testing. It acts as the focal point between the service 
laboratories and other agencies. The National Communications System 
(NCS), with the Defense Communications Agency (DCA), maintains a data 
base for telecommunications. DCA also provides the primary capability 
for the NCS to conduct telecommunications survivability studies for 
civil and military departments and agencies.
    (c) In order to disseminate among affected Federal agencies 
information concerning the telecommunications effects of EMP and 
available protective measures, and in order to avoid duplication of 
research efforts, it is desirable to designate a focal point within the 
Federal Government for telecommunications EMP matters.


<R05>
Sec. 215.2  Assignment of responsibilities.

    The Executive Agent, NCS, shall be the focal point within the 
Federal Government for all EMP technical data and studies concerning 
telecommunications. It shall provide such data and the results of such 
studies to all appropriate agencies requesting them. It shall coordinate 
and approve EMP telecommunications tests and studies, and shall keep the 
National Security Advisor informed regarding such tests and studies 
being conducted and planned.

the Executive Office of the President (EOP) in the National Level NSEP 
Telecommunications Program (NLP).
    2. Scope: This MOA is limited to the implementation and recurring 
costs of approved national level NSEP telecommunications programs, 
including termination liability costs, if applicable. Development costs 
will be funded by the Department of Defense.
    3. Background: In April 1984, Executive Order No. 12472, 
``Assignment of National Security and Emergency Preparedness 
Telecommunications Functions,'' established a framework for the funding 
of NSEP telecommunications initiatives by the NCS, providing for:
    a. The prescription, by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 
consultation with the National Security Council (NSC) and the NCS, of 
general guidelines and procedures for reviewing the financing of the NCS 
within the budgetary process, and for the preparation of budget 
estimates by participating agencies.
    b. The determination, by the NSC, the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy (OSTP), and OMB in consultation with the Executive 
Agent, NCS, and the NCS Committee of Principals (COP), of what 
constitutes NSEP telecommunications requirements, and

President directed in National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 201, 
that ``implementation and recurring costs for national level NSEP 
telecommunications programs (i.e., those which benefit multiple Federal 
departments, agencies or entities) shall be shared on a pro rata basis 
determined by each organization's share of NSEP telecommunications 
requirements.'' The Director, OMB, subsequently instructed the NCS 
member organizations to work with the Manager, NCS, to develop the 
necessary agreements for the payment of member funds to the Office of 
the Manager, NCS (OMNCS).
    4.0 Responsibilities
    4.1 The Office of the Manager, NCS, shall:

Restoration Priority Assignments,'' July 8, 1970: and NCS Circular 55-2, 
``NCS Data Base,'' November 21, 1977, with Change 1, May 30, 1978; are 
hereby superseded by, and cancelled under the authority of this 
directive on its effective date.
    6. Definitions. See appendix.
    7. Scope of the NSEP TSP System.
    a. Domestic NSEP Services. The NSEP TSP System and procedures 
established in 47 CFR part 64 and in this directive authorize priority 
treatment to the following domestic telecommunication services 
(including portions of U.S. international telecommunication services 
provided by U.S. vendors) for which provisioning or restoration priority 
levels are requested, assigned, and approved in accordance with this 
directive and any implementing manuals:
    (1) Common carrier services which are:
    (a) Interstate or foreign telecommunication services.
    (b) Intrastate telecommunication services inseparable from 
interstate or foreign telecommunications services, and intrastate 
telecommunication services to which priority levels are assigned 
pursuant to paragraph 13 of this directive.
    (Note: Initially, the NSEP TSP System's applicability to public 
switched services is limited to (a) provisioning of such services (e.g., 
business, centrex, cellular, foreign exchange, Wide Area Telephone 
Service (WATS) and other services that the selected vendor is able to 
provision), and (b) restoration of services that the selected vendor is 
able to restore.)
    (2) Services which are provided by government and/or non-common 
carriers and are interconnected to common carrier services assigned a 
priority level pursuant to paragraph 13 of this directive.
    b. Control Services and Orderwires. The NSEP TSP System and 
procedures implemented in this directive are not applicable to authorize 
priority treatment to control services or orderwires owned by a service 
vendor and needed for provisioning, restoration, or maintenance of other 
services owned by that vendor. Such control services and orderwires 
shall have priority of provisioning and restoration over all other 
telecommunication services (including NSEP services) and shall be exempt 
from preemption. However, the NSEP TSP System and procedures implemented 
in this directive are applicable to control services or orderwires 
leased by a service vendor or user from another service vendor.
    c. Other Services. The NSEP TSP System may apply, at the discretion 
of and upon special arrangements by the entities involved, to authorize 
priority treatment to the following telecommunication services:
    (1) Government or non-common carrier services which are not 
connected to common carrier provided services assigned a priority level 
pursuant to paragraph 13 of this directive.
    (2) Portions of U.S. international services which are provided by 
foreign correspondents. (Subject to pertinent law, including references 
4a, 4c, and 4f, U.S. telecommunication service vendors are encouraged to 
ensure that relevant operating arrangements are consistent to the 
maximum extent practicable with the NSEP TSP System. If such agreements 
do not exist, U.S. telecommunication service vendors should handle 
service provisioning and/or restoration in accordance with any system 
acceptable to their foreign correspondents which allows provisioning and 
restoration in the manner most comparable to the procedures established 
in this directive.) In addition, the U.S. government, acting through the 
Department of State, may enter into the following types of agreements to 
ensure that priority provisioning and restoration procedures consistent 
with those governing domestic services within the NSEP TSP System are in 
place: (a) Bilateral agreements for reciprocal priority treatment for 
critical foreign government telecommunication services in the U.S., and 
(b) multilateral agreements within such international telecommunication 
organizations as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Allied Long 
Lines Agency or Civil Communications Planning Committee, which have or 
are conducive to having a provisioning and restoration priority system.
    d. Subpriority and Precedence Systems. Service users may implement 
subpriority and/or precedence systems that are consistent, and do not 
conflict with, the NSEP TSP System.
    8. Policy. The NSEP TSP System is the regulatory, administrative, 
and operational system authorizing and providing for priority treatment 
(i.e., provisioning, and restoration) of NSEP telecommunication services 
(see definition in appendix). As such, it establishes the framework for 
NSEP telecommunication service vendors to provision, restore, or 
otherwise act on a priority basis to ensure effective NSEP 
telecommunication services. The NSEP TSP System allows the assignment of 
priority levels to any NSEP service across three time periods, or stress 
conditions: Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization, Attack/War, and Post-Attack/
Recovery. All requests for priority level assignments will be processed 
through the Manager, NCS. Although priority levels normally will be 
assigned by the Manager, NCS, and retained by service vendors, only for 
the current time period, they may also be preassigned for the other two 
time periods at the request of service users who are able to identify 
and

[[Page 773]]

justify, in advance, their wartime or post-attack NSEP telecommunication 
requirements. Absent such preassigned priority levels for the Attack/War 
and Post-Attack/Recovery periods, priority level assignments for the 
Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization period will remain in effect. At all 
times, priority level assignments will be subject to revision by the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC); or, on an interim basis, the 
Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP); and the 
Manager, NCS, based upon changing NSEP needs. No other system of 
telecommunication service priorities which conflicts with the NSEP TSP 
System is authorized.
    9. Legal Basis for the NSEP TSP System. The laws and regulations 
authorizing the NSEP TSP System are those cited above in paragraphs 3 
and 4.
    a. Communications Act. Sections 1, 4(i), and 201 thru 205 of the 
Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C., 151, 154(i), and 201 thru 205) 
grant to the FCC the authority over assignment and approval of 
priorities for provisioning and restoration of common carrier-provided 
telecommunication services. Under section 706 of the Communications Act, 
this authority may be superseded, and expanded to include privately 
owned telecommunication services, by the war emergency powers of the 
President of the United States.
    b. Executive Order No. 12472. In Executive Order No. 12472, the 
President tasked the NCS to assist the Director, OSTP, in the exercise 
of the President's war emergency powers. Executive Order No. 12472 also 
directs the Manager, NCS, to assist the Director, OSTP, in executing 
those functions by developing plans and procedures for the management, 
allocation and use (including the establishment of priorities and 
preferences) of federally owned or leased telecommunication assets.
    c. Federal Rules. The FCC and Executive Office of the President 
(EOP) have used their respective authorizations to develop and establish 
the NSEP TSP System as the one uniform system of priorities for the 
provisioning and restoration of NSEP telecommunication services, both 
before and after invocation of the section 706 Presidential war 
emergency powers. The Federal rules governing the NSEP TSP System have 
been promulgated by the FCC and OSTP (on behalf of the EOP) in title 47 
of the Code of Federal Regulations. In those rules, the FCC has 
requested the EOP to administer the NSEP TSP System before the 
invocation of section 706 of the Communications Act, Presidential war 
emergency powers. In this directive, the EOP assigns to the Manager, 
NCS, both this administrative authority to administer the NSEP TSP 
System before, and the President's statutory authority to administer the 
NSEP TSP System after, the invocation of the section 706 Presidential 
war emergency powers.
    d. Defense Production Act. The Defense Production Act of 1950 
authorizes the President to require the priority performance of 
contracts and orders necessary to promote national defense. It also 
authorizes the President to allocate materials and facilities as 
necessary to promote national defense. Pursuant to the Defense 
Production Act, regulations promulgated by the Department of Commerce in 
the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) permit the 
assignment of ``priority ratings'' to equipment associated with NSEP 
telecommunication services warranting priority treatment, if they 
support authorized programs under Schedule I of the DPAS.
    e. Contracts. NSEP telecommunication service users may also employ 
contractual mechanisms to obtain the priority provisioning or 
restoration of service, including customer premises equipment and 
wiring. However, any such contractual arrangements must be consistent 
with NSEP TSP System rules and regulations, including any priority order 
of provisioning and restoration assigned in accordance with the NSEP TSP 
System.
    10. Responsibilities.
    a. Federal Communications Commission. As authorized by the 
Communications Act the FCC will:
    (1) Provide regulatory oversight of implementation of the NSEP TSP 
System.
    (2) Enforce NSEP TSP System rules and regulations which are 
contained in 47, CFR, part 64.
    (3) Act as final authority for approval, revision, or disapproval of 
priority actions by the Manager, NCS, and adjudicate disputes regarding 
either priority actions or denials of requests for priority actions by 
the Manager, NCS, until superseded by the President's war emergency 
powers under section 706 of the Communications Act.
    (4) Function (on a discretionary basis) as a sponsoring Federal 
organization. (See paragraph 10d below.)
    b. Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy. The Director, 
OSTP, EOP, will:
    (1) During exercise of the President's war emergency powers under 
section 706 of the Communications Act, act as the final approval 
authority for priority actions or denials of requests for priority 
actions, adjudicating any disputes.
    (2) Provide oversight of Executive branch activities associated with 
the NSEP TSP System, including assignment of priority levels for 
telecommunications service provisioning and restoration across all time 
periods.
    (3) Function (on a discretionary basis) as a sponsoring Federal 
organization. (See paragraph 10d below.)
    c. Manager, NCS. The Manager, NCS, will:

[[Page 774]]

    (1) Implement the NSEP TSP System under the oversight of the FCC and 
Director, OSTP, in consultation with the NCS Committee of Principals.
    (2) Administer the NSEP TSP System, which includes:
    (a) Receiving, processing, and evaluating requests for priority 
actions from service users, or sponsoring Federal government 
organizations on behalf of service users (e.g., Departments of State or 
Defense on behalf of foreign governments, Federal Emergency Management 
Agency on behalf of state and local governments, and any Federal 
organization on behalf of private industry entities). Action on such 
requests will be completed within 30 days of receipt.
    (b) Assigning, revising, revalidating, or revoking priority levels 
as necessary or upon request of service users concerned, and denying 
requests for priority actions as necessary, using paragraph 16 of this 
directive. Under circumstances short of exercise of Presidential war 
emergency powers under section 706 of the Communications Act and time 
permitting, coordinate such changes in priority level assignments in 
advance with requesting and/or affected parties. Action on such requests 
will be completed within 30 days of receipt.
    (c) Maintaining data on priority level assignments.
    (d) Periodically forwarding to the FCC and Director, OSTP, lists of 
priority actions for review and approval.
    (e) Periodically initiating reconciliation.
    (f) Testing and evaluating the NSEP TSP System for effectiveness.
    (g) Conducting audits as necessary. Any Telecommunications Service 
Priority (TSP) System user may request the Manager, NCS to conduct an 
audit. (See the definition of an ``audit'' in appendix A.)
    (h) Issuing, subject to review by the FCC, procedures supplemental 
to and consistent with this directive regarding operation and use of the 
NSEP TSP System.
    (i) Serving as a centralized point-of-contact for collecting and

for treatment of classified and proprietary material) information 
concerning use and abuse of the NSEP TSP System.
    (j) Establishing and assisting a TSP System Oversight Committee to 
identify and review any problems developing in the system and 
recommending actions to correct them or prevent recurrence. In addition 
to representatives of the EOP, representatives from private industry 
(including telecommunication service vendors), state and local 
governments, the FCC, and other organizations may be appointed to the 
committee.
    (k) Reporting at least quarterly to the FCC; Director, OSTP; and TSP 
System Oversight Committee, together with any recommendations for 
action, the operational status of and trends in the NSEP TSP System, 
including:
    (i) Numbers of requests processed for the various priority actions, 
and the priority levels assigned.
    (ii) Relative percentages of services assigned to each priority 
level under each NSEP category and subcategory.
    (iii) Any apparent serious misassignment or abuse of priority level 
assignments.
    (iv) Any existing or developing problem.
    (l) Submitting semi-annually to the FCC; Director, OSTP; and TSP 
System Oversight Committee a summary report identifying the time and 
event associated with each invocation of NSEP treatment under paragraph 
13c of this directive and section 10c of 47 CFR part 64; whether the 
NSEP service requirement was adequately handled; and whether any 
additional charges were incurred. These reports will be due by April 
30th for the preceding July through December and by October 31st for the 
preceding January through June time periods.
    (3) Function (on a discretionary basis) as a sponsoring Federal 
organization. (See paragraph 10d below.)
    d. Sponsoring Federal Organizations. Sponsoring Federal 
organizations will:
    (1) Review and decide whether to sponsor private industry (including 
telecommunication service vendors) requests for priority actions. 
Federal organizations will forward sponsored requests with 
recommendations for disposition to the Manager, NCS. Recommendations 
will be based on paragraph 16 of this directive.
    (2) Forward notification of priority actions or denials of requests 
for priority actions to the requesting private industry entities, for 
disposition.
    (3) Cooperate with the Manager, NCS, during reconciliation, 
revalidation, and audits.
    e. Departments of State and Defense. The Departments of State and 
Defense will, in addition to the responsibilities listed in paragraph 
10h below:
    (1) Review and decide whether to sponsor requests for priority level 
assignments from foreign governments and forward sponsored requests to 
the Manager, NCS, with recommendations for disposition. Recommendations 
will be based on paragraph 16 of this directive and whether or not 
priority treatment is afforded to U.S. NSEP telecommunication service 
requirements in the foreign country concerned.
    (2) Forward notification of priority actions or denials of requests 
for priority actions to the requesting foreign government entities, for 
disposition.
    f. Department of Energy. The Department of Energy will, in addition 
to the responsibilities listed in paragraph 10h below:
    (1) Review and decide whether to sponsor public and private 
interstate power utility

[[Page 775]]

company requests for priority actions and forward sponsored requests 
with recommendations for disposition to the Manager, NCS. 
Recommendations will be based on paragraph 16 of this directive. This 
does not preclude public and private power utility companies from 
obtaining sponsorship elsewhere.
    (2) Forward notification of priority actions or denials of requests 
for priority actions to the requesting public and private power utility 
companies for disposition.
    g. Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Federal Emergency 
Management Agency will, in addition to the responsibilities listed in 
paragraph 10h below:
    (1) Review and decide whether to sponsor state and local government 
requests for priority actions and forward sponsored requests with 
recommendations for disposition to the Manager, NCS. Recommendations 
will be based on paragraph 16 of this directive.
    (2) Forward notification of priority actions or denials of requests 
for priority actions to the requesting state and local government 
entities, for disposition.
    h. Federal Organizations. Federal organizations will:
    (1) Ensure that NSEP TSP System users within each organization 
comply with their obligations under the NSEP TSP System.
    (2) Provision and restore government-provided services (which are 
interconnected with commercially provided services assigned a priority 
level pursuant to paragraph 13 of this directive) in accordance with 
NSEP TSP System rules and regulations. (See paragraph 7a(2) of this 
directive.)
    (3) Function (on a discretionary basis) as sponsoring Federal 
organizations for private sector service users (e.g., government 
contractors).
    (4) Cooperate with the Manager, NCS, during reconciliation, 
revalidation, and audits.
    i. Service Users. Service users, or entities acting on their behalf, 
will:
    (1) Identify services requiring priority level assignments and 
request and justify priority level assignments in accordance with this 
directive and any supplemental NCS issuances.
    (2) Justify and revalidate all priority level assignments at least 
every three years.
    (3) For services assigned priority levels, ensure (through 
contractual means or otherwise) availability of customer premises 
equipment and wiring necessary for end-to-end service operation by the 
service due date, and continued operation; and, for such services in the 
Emergency NSEP category, by the time that vendors are prepared to 
provide the services. Additionally, designate the organization 
responsible for the service on an end-to-end basis.
    (4) Be prepared to accept services assigned priority levels by the 
service due dates or, for services in the Emergency NSEP category, when 
they are available.
    (5) Pay vendors any authorized costs associated with services that 
are assigned priority levels.
    (6) Report to vendors any failed or unusable services that are 
assigned priority levels.
    (7) Designate a 24-hour point-of-contact for matters concerning each 
request for priority action and apprise the Manager, NCS.
    (8) Upon termination of services that are assigned priority levels, 
or circumstances warranting revisions in priority level assignment 
(e.g., expansion of service), request and justify revocation or 
revision.
    (9) When NSEP treatment is invoked under paragraph 13c of this 
directive, within 90 days following provisioning of the service 
involved, forward to the Manager, NCS complete information identifying 
the time and event associated with the invocation and regarding whether 
the NSEP service requirement was adequately handled and whether any 
additional charges were incurred.
    (10) Cooperate with the Manager, NCS, during reconciliation, 
revalidation, and audits.
    j. Service Vendors. Service vendors will comply with the provisions 
of 47 CFR part 64. When those provisions are superseded by the 
President's war emergency powers under section 706 of the Communications 
Act, vendors will continue to comply with 47 CFR part 64, subject to 
further direction by Director, OSTP.
    11. Preemption of Existing Services. When necessary to provision or 
restore NSEP services, service vendors may preempt services they provide 
as specified below. ``User,'' as used in this section, means any user of 
a telecommunications service, to include both NSEP and non-NSEP 
services. Prior consent by a preempted user is not required.
    a. The sequence in which existing services may be preempted to 
provision NSEP services assigned a provisioning priority level ``E'' or 
restore NSEP services assigned a restoration priority level from ``1'' 
through ``5'':
    (1) Non-NSEP services: If suitable spare services are not available, 
then, based on the considerations in 47 CFR part 64 and the service 
vendor's best judgement, non-NSEP services will be preempted. After 
ensuring a sufficient number of public switched services will remain 
available for public use, based on the service vendor's best judgement, 
such services may be used to satisfy a requirement for provisioning or 
restoring NSEP services.
    (2) NSEP Services: If no suitable spare or non-NSEP services are 
available, then existing NSEP services may be preempted to provision or 
restore NSEP services with higher priority level assignments. When this 
is necessary, NSEP services will be selected for preemption in the 
inverse order of priority level assignment.

[[Page 776]]

    (3) Service vendors who are preempting services will ensure their 
best effort to notify the service user of the preempted service and 
state the reason for and estimated duration of the preemption.
    b. Service vendors may, based on their best judgement, determine the 
sequence in which existing services may be preempted to provision NSEP 
services assigned a provisioning priority of ``1'' through ``5.'' 
Preemption is not subject to the consent of the user whose service will 
be preempted.
    12. Requests for Priority Actions. All service users are required to 
submit requests for priority actions through the Manager, NCS, in the 
format and following the procedures prescribed by the Manager.
    13. Assignment, Approval, Use, and Invocation of Priority Levels.
    a. Assignment and Approval of Priority Levels and Priority Actions.
    (1) Priority level assignments or other priority actions will be 
based upon section 16, NSEP TSP System Categories, Criteria, and 
Priority Levels, of this directive. A priority level assignment or other 
priority action made by the Manager, NCS, will serve as the 
recommendation of the Director, OSTP (on behalf of the EOP) to the FCC. 
If the Director, OSTP does not approve the priority level assignment or 
other priority action made by the Manager, NCS, then the Director can 
direct the Manager, NCS, to revise or revoke the priority level 
assignment or other priority action.
    (2) Until the President's war emergency powers under Section 706 of 
the Communications Act are invoked, priority level assignments or other 
priority actions must be approved by the FCC. (If the FCC does not 
approve the priority level assignment or other priority action, then it 
can direct the Manager, NCS, to revise or revoke the priority level 
assignment or other priority action.) However, the FCC has instructed 
service vendors to implement any priority level assignments or other 
priority actions that are pending FCC approval.
    (3) After invocation of the President's war emergency powers, the 
requirement for FCC approval of priority level assignments or other 
priority actions may be superseded by other procedures issued by the 
Director, OSTP.
    b. Use of Priority Level Assignments.
    (1) All provisioning and restoration priority level assignments for 
services in the Emergency NSEP category will be included in initial 
service orders to vendors. Provision priority level assignments for 
Essential NSEP services, however, will not usually be included in 
initial service orders to vendors. NSEP treatment for Essential NSEP 
services will be invoked and provisioning priority level assignments 
will be conveyed to service vendors only if the vendors cannot meet 
needed service dates through the normal provisioning process.
    (2) Any revision or revocation of either provisioning or restoration 
priority level assignments will also be transmitted to vendors.
    (3) Service vendors shall accept priority levels and/or revisions 
only after assignment by the Manager, NCS. (Note: Service vendors acting 
as prime contractors for NSEP services will accept assigned NSEP 
priority levels only when they are accompanied by the Manager, NCS 
designated service identification (i.e., TSP Authorization Code). 
However, service vendors are authorized to accept priority levels and/or 
revisions from users and contracting activities before assignment by the 
Manager, NCS when service vendors, users, and contracting activities are 
unable to communicate with either the FCC, Director, OSTP, or the 
Manager, NCS. Processing of Emergency NSEP service requests will not be 
delayed for verification purposes.
    c. Invocation of NSEP Treatment. To invoke NSEP treatment for the 
priority provisioning of an NSEP telecommunications service, an 
authorized Federal official either within, or acting on behalf of, the 
service user's organization must make a written or oral declaration to 
concerned service vendor(s) and the Manager, NCS, that NSEP treatment is 
being invoked. Authorized Federal officials include the head or director 
of a Federal agency, commander of a unified/specified military command, 
chief of a military service, or commander of a major military command; 
the delegates of any of the foregoing; or any other officials as 
specified in supplemental procedures issued by the Manager, NCS. The 
authority to invoke NSEP treatment may be delegated only to a general or 
flag officer of a military service, civilian employee of equivalent 
grade (e.g., Senior Executive Service member), Federal Coordinating 
Officer or Federal Emergency Communications Coordinator/Manager, or any 
other such officials specified in supplemental procedures issued by the 
EOP. Delegates must be designated as such in writing, and written or 
oral invocations must be accomplished, in accordance with supplemental 
procedures issued by the Manager, NCS.
    14. Resubmission of Circuits Presently Assigned Restoration 
Priorities. All circuits assigned restoration priorities must be 
reviewed for eligibility for initial restoration priority level 
assignment under the provisions of this directive. Circuits assigned 
restoration priorities, and for which restoration priority level 
assignments are requested under paragraph 12 of this directive, will be 
resubmitted to the Manager, NCS. To resubmit such circuits, service 
users will comply with applicable provisions of paragraphs 10i and 13 of 
this directive.

[[Page 777]]

    15. Appeal. Service users or sponsoring Federal organizations may 
appeal any priority level assignment, denial, revision, revocation, 
approval, or disapproval to the Manager, NCS within 30 days of 
notification to the service user. The appellant must use the form or 
format required by the Manager, NCS and must serve the FCC with a copy 
of its appeal. The Manager, NCS will act on the appeal within 90 days of 
receipt. Service users and sponsoring Federal organizations may only 
then appeal directly to the FCC. Such FCC appeal must be filed within 30 
days of notification of the Manager, NCS' decision on appeal. 
Additionally, the Manager, NCS may appeal any FCC revisions, approvals 
or disapprovals to the FCC. All appeals to the FCC must be submitted 
using the form or format required. The party filing its appeal with the 
FCC must include factual details supporting its claim and must serve a 
copy on the Manager, NCS and any other party directly involved. Such 
party may file a response within 20 days, and replies may be filed 
within 10 days thereafter. The Commission will not issue public notices 
of such submissions. The Commission will provide notice of its decision 
to the parties of record. Any appeals to the Manager, NCS that include a 
claim of new information that has not been presented before for 
consideration may be submitted at any time.
    16. NSEP TSP System Categories, Criteria, and Priority Levels.
    a. General. NSEP TSP System categories and criteria, and permissible 
priority level assignments, are defined and explained below.
    (1) The Essential NSEP category has four subcategories (i.e., 
National Security Leadership; National Security Posture and U.S. 
Population Attack Warning; Public Health, Safety, and Maintenance of Law 
and Order; and Public Welfare and Maintenance of National Economic 
Posture). Each subcategory has its own criteria. Criteria are also shown 
for the Emergency NSEP category, which has no subcategories.
    (2) Priority levels of ``1,'' ``2,'' ``3,'' ``4,'' and ``5'' may be 
assigned for provisioning and/or restoration of Essential NSEP 
telecommunication services. However, for Emergency NSEP 
telecommunication services, a priority level ``E'' is assigned for 
provisioning. A restoration priority level from ``1'' through ``5'' may 
be assigned if an Emergency NSEP service also qualifies for such a 
restoration priority level under the Essential NSEP category.
    (3) The NSEP TSP System allows the assignment of priority levels to 
any NSEP telecommunications service across three time periods, or stress 
conditions: Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization, Attack/War, and Post-Attack/
Recovery. Priority levels will normally be assigned only for the first 
time period. These assigned priority levels will apply through the onset 
of any attack, but it is expected that they would later be revised by 
surviving authorized telecommunication resource managers within the 
Executive Office of the President based upon specific facts and 
circumstances arising during the Attack/War and Post-Attack/Recovery 
time periods.
    (4) Service users may, for their own internal use, assign 
subpriorities to their services assigned priority levels. Receipt of and 
response to any such subpriorities is optional for service vendors.
    (5) The following paragraphs provide a detailed explanation of the 
categories, subcategories, criteria, and priority level assignments, 
beginning with the Emergency NSEP category.
    b. Emergency NSEP. Telecommunication services in the Emergency NSEP 
category are those new services so critical as to be required to be 
provisioned at the earliest possible time, without regard to the costs 
of obtaining them.
    (1) Criteria. To qualify under the Emergency NSEP category, the 
service must meet the criteria of directly supporting or resulting from 
at least one of the following NSEP functions:
    (a) Federal government activity responding to a Presidentially 
declared disaster or emergency as defined in the Disaster Relief Act (42 
U.S.C. 5122).
    (b) State or local government activity responding to a 
Presidentially, state, or locally declared disaster or emergency.
    (c) Response to a state of crisis declared by the National Command 
Authorities (e.g., exercise of presidential war emergency powers under 
Section 706 of the Communications Act, supra).
    (d) Efforts to protect endangered U.S. personnel or property.
    (e) Response to an enemy or terrorist action, civil disturbance, 
natural disaster, or any other unpredictable occurrence that has damaged 
facilities whose uninterrupted operation is critical to NSEP or the 
management of other ongoing crises.
    (f) Certification by the head or director of a Federal agency, 
commander of a unified/specified command, chief of a military service, 
or commander of a major military command, that the telecommunications 
service is so critical to protection of life and property or to NSEP 
that it must be provided immediately.
    (g) A request from an official authorized pursuant to the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. and 18 U.S.C. 
2511, 2518, 2519).
    (2) Priority Level Assignment.
    (a) Services qualifying under the Emergency NSEP category are 
assigned priority level ``E'' for provisioning.
    (b) After 30 days, assignments of provisioning priority level ``E'' 
for Emergency

[[Page 778]]

NSEP services are automatically revoked unless extended for another 30-
day period. A notice of any such revocation will be sent to service 
vendors.
    (c) For restoration, Emergency NSEP services may be assigned 
priority levels under the provisions applicable to Essential NSEP 
services (see paragraph 16.c.). Emergency NSEP services not otherwise 
qualifying for restoration priority level assignment as Essential NSEP 
may be assigned a restoration priority level ``5'' for a 30-day period. 
Such 30-day restoration priority level assignments will be revoked 
automatically unless extended for another 30-day period. A notice of any 
such revocation will be sent to service vendors.
    c. Essential NSEP. Telecommunication services in the Essential NSEP 
category are those required to be provisioned by due dates specified by 
service users, or restored promptly, normally without regard to 
associated overtime or expediting costs. They may be assigned priority 
levels of ``1,'' ``2,'' ``3,'' ``4,'' or ``5'' for both provisioning and 
restoration, depending upon the nature and urgency of the supported 
function, the impact of a lack of service or service interruption upon 
the supported function, and, for priority access to public switched 
services, the user's level of responsibility. Priority level assignments 
will be valid for no more than three years unless revalidated. To be 
categorized as Essential NSEP, a telecommunications service must qualify 
under one of the four subcategories described below: National Security 
Leadership; National Security Posture and U.S. Population Attack 
Warning; Public Health, Safety, and Maintenance of Law and Order; or 
Public Welfare and Maintenance of the National Economic Posture. (Note: 
Under emergency circumstances, Essential NSEP telecommunication services 
may be recategorized as Emergency NSEP and assigned a priority level 
``E'' for provisioning.)
    (1) National Security Leadership. This subcategory will be strictly 
limited to only those telecommunication services essential to national 
survival if nuclear attack threatens or occurs, and critical orderwire 
and control services necessary to ensure the rapid and efficient 
provisioning or restoration of other NSEP telecommunication services. 
Services in this subcategory are those for which a service interruption 
of even a few minutes would have serious adverse impact upon the 
supported NSEP function.
    (a) Criteria. To qualify under this subcategory, a service must be 
at least one of the following:
    (i) Critical orderwire, or control service, supporting other NSEP 
functions.
    (ii) Presidential communications service critical to continuity of 
government and national leadership during crisis situations.
    (iii) National Command Authority communications service for military 
command and control critical to National survival.
    (iv) Intelligence communications service critical to warning of 
potentially catastrophic attack.
    (v) Communications service supporting the conduct of diplomatic 
negotiations critical to arresting or limiting hostilities.
    (b) Priority Level Assignment. Services under this subcategory will 
normally be assigned, during Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization, priority 
level ``1'' for provisioning and restoration.
    (2) National Security Posture and U.S. Population Attack Warning. 
This subcategory covers those minimum additional telecommunication 
services essential to maintaining an optimum defense, diplomatic, or 
continuity-of-government posture before, during, and after crisis 
situations. Such situations are those ranging from national emergencies 
to international crises, including nuclear attack. Services in this 
subcategory are those for which a service interruption ranging from a 
few minutes to one day would have serious adverse impact upon the 
supported NSEP function.
    (a) Criteria. To qualify under this subcategory, a service must 
support at least one of the following NSEP functions:
    (i) Threat assessment and attack warning.
    (ii) Conduct of diplomacy.
    (iii) Collection, processing, and dissemination of intelligence.
    (iv) Command and control of military forces.
    (v) Military mobilization.
    (vi) Continuity of Federal government before, during, and after 
crisis situations.
    (vii) Continuity of state and local government functions supporting 
the Federal government during and after national emergencies.
    (viii) Recovery of critical national functions after crisis 
situations.
    (ix) National space operations.
    (b) Priority Level Assignment. Services under this subcategory will 
normally be assigned, during Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization, priority 
levels ``2,'' ``3,'' ``4,'' or ``5'' for provisioning and restoration.
    (3) Public Health, Safety, and Maintenance of Law and Order. This 
subcategory covers the minimum number of telecommunication services 
necessary for giving civil alert to the U.S. population and maintaining 
law and order and the health and safety of the U.S. population in times 
of any national, regional, or serious local emergency. These services 
are those for which a service interruption ranging from a few minutes to 
one day would have serious adverse impact upon the supported NSEP 
functions.
    (a) Criteria. To qualify under this subcategory, a service must 
support at least one of the following NSEP functions:

[[Page 779]]

    (i) Population warning (other than attack warning).
    (ii) Law enforcement.
    (iii) Continuity of critical state and local government functions 
(other than support of the Federal government during and after national 
emergencies).
    (iv) Hospitals and distribution of medical supplies.
    (v) Critical logistic functions and public utility services.
    (vi) Civil air traffic control.
    (vii) Military assistance to civil authorities.
    (viii) Defense and protection of critical industrial facilities.
    (ix) Critical weather services.
    (x) Transportation to accomplish the foregoing NSEP functions.
    (b) Priority Level Assignment. Services under this subcategory will 
normally be assigned, during Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization, priority 
levels ``3,'' ``4,'' or ``5'' for provisioning and restoration.
    (4) Public Welfare and Maintenance of National Economic Posture. 
This subcategory covers the minimum number of telecommunication services 
necessary for maintaining the public welfare and national economic 
posture during any national or regional emergency. These services are 
those for which a service interruption ranging from a few minutes to one 
day would have serious adverse impact upon the supported NSEP function.
    (a) Criteria. To qualify under this subcategory, a service must 
support at least one of the following NSEP functions:
    (i) Distribution of food and other essential supplies.
    (ii) Maintenance of national monetary, credit, and financial 
systems.
    (iii) Maintenance of price, wage, rent, and salary stabilization, 
and consumer rationing programs.
    (iv) Control of production and distribution of strategic materials 
and energy supplies.
    (v) Prevention and control of environmental hazards or damage.
    (vii) Transportation to accomplish the foregoing NSEP functions.
    (b) Priority Level Assignment. Services under this subcategory will 
normally be assigned, during Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization, priority 
levels ``4'' or ``5'' for provisioning and restoration.
    d. Limitations. Priority levels will be assigned only to the minimum 
number of telecommunication services required to support an NSEP 
function. Priority levels will not normally be assigned to back-up 
services on a continuing basis, absent additional justification (e.g., a 
service user specifies a requirement for physically diverse routing or 
contracts for additional continuity-of-service features). The Executive 
Office of the President may also establish limitations upon the relative 
numbers of services which may be assigned any restoration priority 
level. These limitations will not take precedence over laws or executive 
orders. Such limitations shall not be exceeded absent waiver by the 
Executive Office of the President.
    e. Non-NSEP Services. Telecommunication services in the non-NSEP 
category will be those which do not meet the criteria for either 
Emergency NSEP or Essential NSEP.
    17. Authorizing Provision. NCS manuals implementing this directive 
are authorized.
    18. Effective Date. This directive is effective immediately.
    19. Expiration. This directive is in effect until superseded or 
cancelled.

    Telecommunication services that are used to maintain a state of 
readiness or to respond to and manage any event or crisis (local, 
national, or international) that causes or could cause injury or harm to 
the population, damage to or loss of property, or degrades or threatens 
the NSEP posture of the United States. These services fall into two 
specific categories. Emergency NSEP and Essential NSEP, and are assigned 
priority levels.

        National Security Emergency Preparedness (NSEP) Treatment

    The provisioning of a telecommunications service before others based 
on the provisioning priority level assigned by the Manager, NCS, in 
accordance with this directive.

                             Priority Action

    The assignment, revision, revocation, or revalidation by the 
Manager, NCS, in accordance with this directive, of a priority level 
associated with an NSEP telecommunications service.

                             Priority Level

    The level that may be assigned to an NSEP telecommunications service 
specifying the order in which provisioning or restoration of the service 
is to occur relative to other NSEP and/or non-NSEP telecommunication 
services. Authorized priority levels are designated (highest to lowest) 
``E,. ``1,'' ``2,'' ``3,'' ``4,'' and ``5'' for provisioning and ``1,'' 
``2,'' ``3,'' ``4,'' and ``5'' for restoration.

                        Priority Level Assignment

Telecommunications Operations--Shared Resources (SHARES) High Frequency 
                           (HF) Radio Program

September 30, 1988.

    1. Purpose. This directive establishes National Communications 
System (NCS) policies pertaining to operation and use of the Shared 
Resources (SHARES) High Frequency (HF) Radio Program.
    2. Applicability. This directive is binding upon NCS and other 
Executive entities who voluntarily elect to participate in the SHARES HF 
Radio Program.
    3. Authority. This directive is issued under the authority of 
Executive Order No. 12472, ``Assignment of National Security and 
Emergency Preparedness Telecommunications Functions,'' April 3, 1984, 49 
FR 13471 (1984); and NCS Directive 1-1, ``National Communications System 
(NCS) Issuance System,'' November 30, 1987.
    4. References.
    a. Executive Order (E.0.) No. 12472, ``Assignment of National 
Security and Emergency Preparedness Telecommunications Functions,'' 
April 3, 1984, 49 FR 13471 (1984).
    b. National Telecommunications & Information Administration (NTIA), 
``Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency 
Management,'' May, 1986 Edition as revised May, 1987 or current edition/
revision.
    5. General.
    a. E.O. No. 12472 established national policy guidance in support of 
National Security Emergency Preparedness (NSEP) objectives. Executive 
Order No. 12472 mandates that action be taken to ``. . . ensure that a 
national telecommunications infrastructure is developed . . .''. 
Consistent with the Executive Order, functionally similar government 
telecommunications networks should be designed to interchange traffic in 
support of national leadership requirements.
    b. The SHARES HF Radio Program will provide a backup capability to 
exchange critical information among Federal entities to support NSEP. 
Federally controlled HF radio resources will be shared to establish a 
robust NSEP HF radio communications infrastructure. The program involves 
a collection of existing Federally controlled HF radio stations that 
inter-operate to transmit NSEP messages when normal means of 
communication are not available.
    6. Policy.
    a. Any participating Federal entity will accept, to the extent that 
acceptance does not interfere with the mission responsibilities of the 
entity, emergency messages of other Federal entities, or other 
components of the same entity, for transmission by HF radio to the 
addressee or to another participant for relay to the addressee.
    b. A SHARES message is an emergency message to be sent via the 
SHARES network. It consists of information that must be communicated to 
a Federal entity and is of critical importance to the Federal 
Government, the entity's mission, and/or involves the preservation of 
life and the protection of property.
    c. Transmission of SHARES messages will be guided by the policy of 
the agency accepting the message. Advice that a ``SHARES Message'' is to 
be transmitted will serve to notify operating personnel that a critical 
NSEP message requirement exists, and implicitly, that normal 
communication paths are not available.

[[Page 782]]

    7. Responsibilities.
    a. NCS entities participating in the SHARES HF Radio Program will, 
to the maximum extent possible:
    (1) Identify HF stations under their control for participation in 
the SHARES Program.
    (2) Maintain the operational readiness of their SHARES HF stations.
    (3) Provide updated information as necessary for inclusion in a 
SHARES HF Radio Program Directory. Use of Federal frequencies for SHARES 
traffic shall be in accordance with National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration (NTIA) ``Manual of Regulations and Procedures 
for Federal Radio Frequency Management.''
    (4) Ensure participation of available stations in scheduled 
exercises.
    (5) Provide representation, as required, at meetings, briefings, 
conferences, and other official SHARES HF Radio Program activities.
    b. The Manager, NCS, will administer the SHARES HF Radio Program and 
perform the management functions defined below:
    (1) Publish and periodically update, as NCS issuances, a User 
Manual, giving detailed procedures for using SHARES HF Radio Program 
capabilities, and HF Directory of participating Federally controlled HF 
radio stations.
    (2) Develop, schedule, and administer periodic exercises of the 
SHARES HF Radio Program capabilities.
    (3) Perform other functions, as necessary, to improve SHARES 
capabilities.
    8. Authorizing Provision. NCS manuals implementing this directive 
are authorized.
    9. Effective Date. This directive is effective immediately.
    10. Expiration. This directive is in effect until superseded or 
cancelled.

    (a) Contents. A State's application for funds for the E-911 grant 
program must consist of the following components:
    (1) State 911 Plan. A plan that details the projects and activities 
proposed to be funded for the implementation and operation of Phase II 
E-911 services or migration to an IP-enabled emergency network, 
establishes metrics and a

[[Page 790]]

time table for grant implementation, and describes the steps the State 
has taken to--
    (i) Coordinate its application with local governments, tribal 
organizations, and PSAPs within the State;
    (ii) Ensure that at least 90 percent of the grant funds will be used 
for the direct benefit of PSAPs and not more than 10 percent of the 
grant funds will be used for the State's administrative expenses related 
to the E-911 grant program;
    (iii) Give priority to communities without 911 capability as of 
August 3, 2007 to establish Phase II coverage by identifying the 
percentage of grant funds designated for those communities or provide an 
explanation why such designation would not be practicable in 
successfully accomplishing the purposes of the grant;

    (2) Project budget. A project budget for all proposed projects and 
activities to be funded by the grant funds identified for the State in 
appendix A and matching funds. Specifically, for each project or 
activity, the State must:
    (i) Demonstrate that the project or activity meets the eligible use 
requirement in Sec. 400.7; and
    (ii) Identify the non-Federal sources, which meet the requirements 
of 49 CFR 18.24, that will fund at least 50 percent of the cost; except 
that as provided in 48 U.S.C. 1469a, the requirement for non-Federal 
matching funds (including in-kind contributions) is waived for American 
Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands 
for grant amounts up to $200,000.
    (3) Supplemental project budget. States that meet the qualification 
requirements for the initial distribution of E-911 grant funds may also 
qualify for additional grant funds that may become available. To be 
eligible for any such additional grant funds that may become available 
in accordance with Sec. 400.6, a State must submit, with its 
application, a supplemental project budget that identifies the maximum 
dollar amount the State is able to match from non-Federal sources 
meeting the requirements of 49 CFR 18.24, and includes projects or 
activities for those grant and matching amounts, up to the total amount 
in the project budget submitted under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. 
This information must be provided to the same level of detail as 
required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and be consistent with 
the State 911 Plan required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (4) Designated E-911 Coordinator. The identification of a single

office or coordinator with the authority to manage E-911 services, that 
office or coordinator must be identified as the designated E-911 
Coordinator and apply for the grant on behalf of the State. If the State 
does not have such an office or coordinator established, the Governor of 
the State must appoint a single officer or governmental body to serve as 
the E-911 Coordinator in order to qualify for an E-911 grant. If the 
designated E-911 Coordinator is a governmental body, an official 
representative of the governmental body shall be identified to sign the 
certifications for the E-911 Coordinator. The State must notify NHTSA in 
writing within 30 days of any change in appointment of the E-911 
Coordinator.
    (5) Certifications. (i) The certification in appendix B to this 
part, signed by the E-911 Coordinator, certifying that the State has 
complied with the required statutory and programmatic conditions in 
submitting its application. The State must certify that during the time 
period 180 days preceding the application date, the State has not 
diverted any portion of designated E-911 charges imposed by the State 
for any purpose other than the purposes for which such charges are 
designated, that no taxing jurisdiction in the State that will be a 
recipient of E-911 grant funds has diverted any portion of designated E-
911 charges imposed by the

[[Page 791]]

taxing jurisdiction for any purpose other than the purposes for which 
such charges are designated, and that neither the State nor any taxing 
jurisdiction in the State that is a recipient of E-911 grant funds will 
divert designated E-911 charges for any purpose other than the purposes 
for which such charges are designated throughout the time period during 
which grant funds are available.
    (ii) Submitted on an annual basis 30 days after the end of each 
fiscal year during which grant funds are available, the certification in 
appendix C to this part, signed by the E-911 Coordinator, making the 
same certification as required under paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section 
concerning the diversion of designated E-911 charges.
    (b) Due date. The State must submit the application documents 
identified in this section so that they are received by the ICO no later 
than August 4, 2009. Failure to meet this deadline will preclude the 
State from receiving consideration for an E-911 grant award.
