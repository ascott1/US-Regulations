                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2002), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

of the initial license grant, or the authorization becomes invalid and 
must be returned to the Commission for cancellation. ``Substantial'' 
service is defined as service which is sound, favorable, and 
substantially above a level of mediocre service which just might 
minimally warrant renewal. For site-based AMTS coast station licensees, 
when a new license has been issued or additional operating frequencies 
have been authorized, if the station or frequencies authorized have not 
been placed in operation within two years from the date of the grant, 
the authorization becomes invalid and must be returned to the Commission 
for cancellation.
    (b) Public fixed stations. When a new license has been issued or 
additional operating frequencies have been authorized, the licensee must 
notify the Commission in accordance with Sec. 1.946 of this chapter that 
the station or frequencies authorized have been placed in operation 
within twelve months from the date of the grant.

Sec. 80.51  Ship earth station licensing.

    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) A ship earth station authorized to operate the INMARSAT space 
segment must display the Commission license in conjunction with the 
commissioning certificate issued by the INMARSAT Organization. Ship 
earth stations that were operating in the MARISAT system and are not 
commissioned by the INMARSAT Organization will continue to be used in 
the INMARSAT system without a commissioning certificate issued by the 
INMARSAT Organization. The continued use of such equipment, however, 
will not be permitted after September 1, 1991, unless a commissioning 
certificate is obtained from the INMARSAT Organization. Notwithstanding 
the requirements in this paragraph, ship earth stations can operate in 
the INMARSAT space segment without an INMARSAT issued commissioning 
certificate provided an appropriate written approval is obtained from 
the INMARSAT Organization in addition to the Commission's license.

United States and Canada, assignment of VHF frequencies in the band 156-
162 MHz to public coast stations in certain areas of Washington state, 
the Great Lakes and the east coast of the United States must be made in 
accordance with the provisions of this section.
    (b) Definitions. On the west coast, specific terms are defined as 
follows:
    (1) Inland Waters Public Correspondence Sector. A distinct 
geographical area in which one primary and one supplementary channel is 
allotted. A number of local channels may also be authorized.
    (2) Coastal Waters Public Correspondence Sector. A distinct 
geographical area in which one primary and one supplementary channel is 
allotted. Local channels may also be authorized.
    (3) Inland Waters. Inland waters of western Washington and British 
Columbia bounded by 47 degrees latitude on the south, the Canada/U.S.A. 
Coordination Zone Line B on the north, and to the west by 124 degrees 40 
minutes longitude at the west entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
    (4) Coastal Waters. Waters along the Pacific Coast of Washington 
state and Vancouver Island within the Canada/U.S.A. Coordination Zone.
    (5) Inland Waters Primary Channel. A channel intended to cover the 
greater portion of an Inland Waters Public Correspondence Sector. It may 
provide some coverage to an adjacent sector but must not provide 
coverage beyond the adjacent sector. Harmful interference beyond the 
adjacent sector must not occur. Only one primary channel will be 
authorized in any sector.
    (6) Inland waters of western Washington and British Columbia bounded 
by 46 deg.59[min]59.3[sec] north latitude on the south, the Canada/
U.S.A. Coordination Zone Line B on the south, and to the west by 
124 deg.40[min]4.7[sec] west latitude at the west entrance to the Strait 
of Juan de Fuca.

    Note: All coordinates are referenced to North American Datum 1983 
(NAD83).

    (7) Inland Waters Local Channel. A channel designed to provide local 
coverage of certain bays, inlets and ports where coverage by primary or 
supplementary channels is poor or where heavy traffic loading warrants. 
A local channel must not cause harmful interference to any primary or 
supplementary channels. Coverage must be confined to the designated 
sector.
    (8) Coastal Waters Primary Channel. Same as (5) except for technical 
characteristics.
    (9) Coastal Waters Supplementary Channel. Same as (6) except for 
technical characteristics.
    (10) Coastal Waters Local Channel. Same as (7) except for technical 
characteristics.
    (c) Technical characteristics. On the west coast, technical 
characteristics of public correspondence stations will be as follows:
    (1) Inland Waters Primary and Supplementary Channels. The effective 
radiated power (ERP) must not exceed 60

[[Page 22]]

watts. Antenna height must not exceed 152 meters (500 feet) above mean 
sea level (AMSL) with the exceptions noted in paragraph (d)(5) of this 
section.
    (2) Inland Waters Local Channel. ERP must not exceed 8 watts with an 
antenna height of no more than 15 meters (50 feet) AMSL or the ERP must 
not exceed 2 watts with an antenna height of no more than 30 meters (100 
feet) AMSL.
    (3) Coastal Waters Primary and Supplementary Channels. ERP must not 
exceed 125 watts with no antenna restrictions.
    (4) Coastal Waters Local Channel. ERP must not exceed 10 watts with 
a maximum antenna height of 76 meters (250 feet) AMSL.
    (5) Harmful interference will be determined and resolved using the 
definition and procedures of the ITU Radio Regulations.
    (6) To keep the ERP and antenna elevations at a minimum and to limit 
coverage to the desired areas, an informal application may be filed for 
special temporary authority in accordance with Secs. 1.41 and 1.931 of 
this chapter to conduct a field survey to obtain necessary data for 
informal application. Such data may accompany the application and be 
used in lieu of theoretical calculations as required in subpart P of 
this part. The Seattle FCC District Office must be notified in advance 
of scheduled tests.
    (d) Canada/U.S.A. channeling arrangement for West Coast VHF maritime 
mobile public correspondence. (1) The provisions of the Canada/U.S. 
channeling arrangement apply to waters of the State of Washington and of 
the Province of British Columbia within the coordination boundaries of 
``Arrangement A'' of the Canada/U.S.A. Frequency Coordination Agreement 
above 30 MHz. In addition, all inland waters as far south as Olympia are 
to be included. A map of these waters is contained in paragraph (d)(6) 
of this section, Figure 1.
    (2) The channeling arrangement applies to the following VHF public 
correspondence channels: Channels 24, 84, 25, 85, 26, 86, 27, 87 and 28.
    (3) Public correspondence stations may be established by either 
country in accordance with the provisions of the arrangements. However, 
there must be an exchange of information prior to the establishment of 
new stations or a change in technical parameters of existing stations. 
Any channel except that used as primary or supplementary channel in a 
given sector is available for use as a local channel in that sector. 
Local channels are not protected from interference caused by primary or 
supplementary channels in adjacent sectors if these stations are in 
compliance with this section.
    (4) Preliminary local Canadian/U.S. coordination is required for all 
applications at variance with this section. This coordination will be in 
accordance with the provisions of Arrangement ``A'' of the Canada/U.S. 
Frequency Coordination Agreement over 30 MHz. Stations at variance with 
the arrangement are not protected from interference and must not cause 
interference to existing or future stations which are in accordance with 
the agreement.
    (5) Stations in existence at the time of the arrangement must have 
complied with the provisions of the arrangement within 12 months after 
it became effective with the following exceptions:

chapter, with a 9 dB correction for antenna height differential.
    (3) Nationwide or multi-region LF, MF, and HF public coast station 
licensees, see Secs. 80.357(b)(1), 80.361(a), 80.363(a)(2), 80.371(b), 
and 80.374, may partition their spectrum pursuant to

[[Page 28]]

the procedures set forth in this section, except that frequencies or 
frequency pairs licensed to more than one licensee as of March 13, 2002 
may be partitioned only by the earliest licensee, and only on the 
condition that the partitionee shall operate on a secondary, non-
interference basis to stations licensed as of March 13, 2002 other than 
the earliest licensee. Coordination with government users is required 
for partitioning of spectrum the licensing of which is subject to 
coordination with government users.
    (b) Technical standards. (1) Partitioning. In the case of 
partitioning, all requests for authorization for partial assignment of a 
license must include, as an attachment, a description of the partitioned 
service area. The partitioned service area shall be defined by 
coordinate points at every 3 degrees along the partitioned service area 
unless an FCC-recognized service area is utilized (e.g., Metropolitan 
Service Area, Rural Service Area, or Economic Area) or county lines are 
used. The geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, 
and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude, and must be 
based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83). In a case where an 
FCC-recognized service area or county lines are utilized, applicants 
need only list the specific area(s) (through use of FCC designations or 
county names) that constitute the partitioned area.
    (2) Disaggregation. VHF (156-162 MHz) spectrum may only be 
disaggregated according to frequency pairs. AMTS spectrum may be 
disaggregated in any amount.
    (3) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. The Commission will 
consider requests for partial assignment of licenses that propose 
combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.
    (c) License term. The license term for a partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's term as provided for in Sec. 80.25 of this part.
    (d) Construction Requirements. (1) Partitioning. Partial assignors 
and assignees for license partitioning have two options to meet 
construction requirements. Under the first option, the partitionor and 
partitionee would each certify that they will independently satisfy the 
substantial service requirement for their respective partitioned areas. 
If either licensee failed to meet its substantial service showing 
requirement, only the non-performing licensee's renewal application 
would be subject to dismissal. Under the second option, the partitioner 
certifies that it has met or will meet the substantial service 
requirement for the entire market. If the partitioner fails to meet the 
substantial service standard, however, only its renewal application 
would be subject to forfeiture at renewal.
    (2) Disaggregation. Partial assignors and assignees for license 
disaggregation have two options to meet construction requirements. Under 
the first option, the disaggregator and disaggregatee would certify that 
they each will share responsibility for meeting the substantial service 
requirement for the geographic service area. If parties choose this 
option and either party fails to do so, both licenses would be subject 
to forfeiture at renewal. The second option would allow the parties to 
agree that either the disaggregator or the disaggregatee would be 
responsible for meeting the substantial service requirement for the 
geographic service area. If parties choose this option, and the party 
responsible for meeting the construction requirement fails to do so, 
only the license of the nonperforming party would be subject to 
forfeiture at renewal.
    (3) Site-based AMTS, and nationwide or multi-region LF, MF, and HF 
public coast. Parties seeking to acquire a partitioned license or 
disaggregated spectrum from a site-based AMTS, or nationwide or multi-
region LF, MF, and HF public coast licensee will be required to 
construct and commence ``service to subscribers'' in all facilities 
acquired through such transactions within the original construction 
deadline for each facility as set forth in Sec. 80.49. Failure to meet 
the individual construction deadline will result in the automatic 
termination of the facility's authorization.

appropriate test operating procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 80.97  Radiotelegraph operating procedures.

    This section applies to ships and coast stations authorized to 
transmit in the band 405-525 kHz.
    (a) Except for the transmission of distress or urgency signals, all 
transmissions must cease within the band 485-515 kHz during each 500 kHz 
silence period.
    (b) Stations transmitting telegraphy must use the service 
abbreviations (``Q'' code) listed in Appendix 14 to the Radio 
Regulations.
    (c) The call consists of:
    (1) The call sign of the station called, not more than twice; the 
word ``DE'' and the call sign of the calling station, not more than 
twice; if useful, the frequency on which the called station should 
reply; and the letter ``K''.
    (2) If the call is transmitted twice at an interval of not less than 
one minute, it must not be repeated until after an interval of three 
minutes.
    (d) The reply to calls consists of: The call sign of the calling 
station, not more than twice; the word ``DE''; and the call sign of the 
station called, once only.


<R05>
Sec. 80.98  Radiotelegraph testing procedures.

    (a) Stations authorized to use telegraphy may conduct tests on any 
assigned frequency. Emissions must not cause harmful interference. When 
radiation is necessary the radiotelegraph testing procedure described in 
this paragraph must be followed:
    (1) The operator must not interfere with transmissions in progress.
    (2) The operator must transmit ``IE'' (two dots, space, one dot) on 
the test frequency as a warning that test emissions are about to be 
made. When the frequency of the test emission is within the frequency 
band 405-525 kHz, a watch must be maintained on 500 kHz throughout the 
test period.
    (3) If any station transmits ``AS'' (wait), testing must be 
suspended. When transmission of ``IE'' is resumed and no response is 
heard, the test may proceed.
    (4) Test signals composed of a series of ``VVV'' having a duration 
of not more than ten seconds, followed by the call sign of the testing 
station will be transmitted. The call sign must be sent clearly at a 
speed of approximately 10 words per minute. This test transmission must 
not be repeated until a period of at least one minute has elapsed. On 
500 kHz in a region of heavy traffic, at least five minutes must elapse 
before the test transmission is repeated.

[[Page 35]]

    (b) When testing is conducted on 500 kHz, no tests will be conducted 
during the 500 kHz silence periods. Care must be exercised not to so 
prolong and space the dash portion of the ``VVV'' series as to form the 
alarm signal.
    (c) When testing is conducted on any frequency in the band 8362-8366 
kHz, tests must not actuate any automatic alarm receiver.


<R05>
Sec. 80.99  Radiotelegraph station identification.

    This section applies to coast, ship and survival craft stations 
authorized to transmit in the band 405-525 kHz.
    (a) The station transmitting radiotelegraph emissions must be 
identified by its call sign. The call sign must be transmitted with the 
telegraphy emission normally used by the station. The call sign must be 
transmitted at 20 minute intervals when transmission is sustained for 
more than 20 minutes. When a ship station is exchanging public 
correspondence communications, the identification may be deferred until 
completion of each communication with any other station.
    (b) The requirements of this section do not apply to survival craft 
stations when transmitting distress signals automatically or when 
operating on 121.500 MHz for radiobeacon purposes.
    (c) Emergency position indicating radiobeacon stations do not 
require identification.


<R05>
Sec. 80.100  Morse code requirement.

    The code employed for telegraphy must be the Morse code specified in 
the Telegraph Regulations annexed to the International Telecommunication 
Convention. Pertinent extracts from the Telegraph Regulations are 
contained in the ``Manual for Use by the Maritime Mobile and Maritime 
Mobile-Satellite Services'' published by the International 
Telecommunication Union.


<R05>
Sec. 80.101  Radiotelephone testing procedures.

    This section is applicable to all stations using telephony except 
where otherwise specified.
    (a) Station licensees must not cause harmful interference. When 
radiation is necessary or unavoidable, the testing procedure described 
below must be followed:
    (1) The operator must not interfere with transmissions in progress.
    (2) The testing station's call sign, followed by the word ``test'', 
must be announced on the radio-channel being used for the test.
    (3) If any station responds ``wait'', the test must be suspended for 
a minimum of 30 seconds, then repeat the call sign followed by the word 
``test'' and listen again for a response. To continue the test, the 
operator must use counts or phrases which do not conflict with normal 
operating signals, and must end with the station's call sign. Test 
signals must not exceed ten seconds, and must not be repeated until at 
least one minute has elapsed. On the frequency 2182 kHz or 156.800 MHz, 
the time between tests must be a minimum of five minutes.
    (b) Testing of transmitters must be confined to single frequency 
channels on working frequencies. However, 2182 kHz and 156.800 MHz may 
be used to contact ship or coast stations as appropriate when signal 
reports are necessary. Short tests on 2182 kHz by vessels with DSB (A3) 
equipment for distress and safety purposes are permitted to evaluate the 
compatibility of that equipment with an A3J emission system. U. S. Coast 
Guard stations may be contacted on 2182 kHz or 156.800 MHz for test 
purposes only when tests are being conducted by Commission employees, 
when FCC-licensed technicians are conducting inspections on behalf of 
the Commission, when qualified technicians are installing or repairing 
radiotelephone equipment, or when qualified ship's personnel conduct an 
operational check requested by the U.S. Coast Guard. In these cases the 
test must be identified as``FCC''or``technical''.
    (c) Survival craft transmitter tests must not be made within 
actuating range of automatic alarm receivers. Survival craft 
transmitters must not be tested on the frequency 500 kHz during the 
silence periods.

Sec. 80.111  Radiotelephone operating procedures for coast stations.

    This section applies to all coast stations using telephony which are 
subject to this part.
    (a) Limitations on calling. (1) Except when transmitting a general 
call to all stations for announcing or preceding the transmission of 
distress, urgency, or safety messages, a coast station must call the 
particular station(s) with which it intends to communicate.
    (2) Coast stations must call ship stations by voice unless it is 
known that the particular ship station may be contacted by other means 
such as automatic actuation of a selective ringing or calling device.
    (3) Coast stations may be authorized emission for selective calling 
on each working frequency.
    (4) Calling a particular station must not continue for more than one 
minute in each instance. If the called station does not reply, that 
station must not again be called for two minutes. When a called station 
does not reply to a call sent three times at intervals of two minutes, 
the calling must cease for fifteen minutes. However, if harmful 
interference will not be caused to other communications in progress, the 
call may be repeated after three minutes.
    (5) A coast station must not attempt to communicate with a ship 
station that has specifically called another coast station until it 
becomes evident that the called station does not answer, or that 
communication between the ship station and the called station cannot be 
carried on because of unsatisfactory operating conditions.
    (6) Calls to establish communication must be initiated on an 
available common working frequency when such a frequency exists and it 
is known that the called ship maintains a simultaneous watch on the 
common working frequency and the appropriate calling frequency(ies).
    (b) Time limitation on calling frequency. Transmissions by coast 
stations on 2182 kHz or 156.800 MHz must be minimized and any one 
exchange of

communications must not exceed one minute in duration.
    (c) Change to working frequency. After establishing communications 
with another station by call and reply on 2182 kHz or 156.800 MHz coast 
stations must change to an authorized working channel for the 
transmission of messages.
    (d) Use of busy signal. A coast station, when communicating with a 
ship station which transmits to the coast station on a radio channel 
which is a different channel from that used by the coast station for 
transmission, may transmit a ``busy'' signal whenever transmission from 
the ship station is being received. The characteristics of the ``busy'' 
signal are contained in Sec. 80.74.

    (d) Limitations on calling. Calling a particular station must not 
continue for more than 30 seconds in each instance. If the called 
station does not reply, the station must not again be called until after 
an interval of 2 minutes. When a called station called does not reply to 
a call sent three times at intervals of 2 minutes, the calling must 
cease and must not be renewed until after an interval of 15 minutes; 
however, if there is no reason to believe that harmful interference will 
be caused to other communications in progress, the call sent three times 
at intervals of 2 minutes may be repeated after a pause of not less than 
3 minutes. In event of an emergency involving safety, the provisions of 
this paragraph do not apply.
    (e) Limitations on working. Any one exchange of communications 
between any two ship stations on 2003, 2142, 2638, 2738, or 2830 kHz or 
between a ship station and a private coast station on 2738 or 2830 kHz 
must not exceed 3 minutes after the stations have established contact. 
Subsequent to such exchange of communications, the same two stations 
must not again use 2003, 2142, 2638, 2738, or 2830 kHz for communication 
with each other until 10 minutes have elapsed.
    (f) Transmission limitation on 2182 kHz and 156.800 MHz. To 
facilitate the reception of distress calls, all transmissions on 2182 
kHz and 156.800 MHz (channel 16) must be minimized and transmissions on 
156.800 MHz must not exceed 1 minute.
    (g) Limitations on commercial communication. On frequencies in the 
band 156-162 MHz, the exchange of commercial communication must be 
limited to the minimum practicable transmission time. In the conduct of 
ship-shore communication other than distress, stations on board ship 
must comply with instructions given by the private coast station or 
marine utility station on shore with which they are communicating.
    (h) 2182 kHz silence periods. To facilitate the reception of 
distress calls, transmission by ship or survival craft stations is 
prohibited on any frequency (including 2182 kHz) within the band 2173.5-
2190.5 kHz during each 2182 kHz silence period.

    (a) Transmitters must meet the following modulation requirements:
    (1) When double sideband emission is used the peak modulation must 
be maintained between 75 and 100 percent;
    (2) When phase or frequency modulation is used in the 156-162 MHz 
band the peak modulation must be maintained between 75 and 100 percent. 
A frequency deviation of <plus-minus> 5 kHz is defined as 100 percent 
peak modulation; and
    (3) In single sideband operation the upper sideband must be 
transmitted. Single sideband transmitters must automatically limit the 
peak envelope power to their authorized operating power and meet the

    (b) Radiotelephone transmitters using A3E, F3E and G3E emission must 
have a modulation limiter to prevent any modulation over 100 percent. 
This requirement does not apply to survival craft transmitters, to 
transmitters that do not require a license or to transmitters whose 
output power does not exceed 3 watts.
    (c) Coast station transmitters operated in the 72.0-73.0 MHz and 
75.4-76.0 MHz bands must be equipped with an audio low-pass filter. The 
filter must be installed between the modulation limiter and the 
modulated radio frequency stage. At frequencies between 3 kHz and 15 kHz 
it must have an attenuation greater than at 1 kHz by at least 
40log<INF>10</INF> (f/3) dB where ``f'' is the frequency in kilohertz.

9320-9500 MHz band must operate in a variable frequency mode and respond 
on their operating frequencies with a maximum error equivalent to 100 
meters. Additionally, their response must be encoded with a Morse 
character starting with a dash. The duration of a Morse dot is defined

The duration of the response code must not exceed 50 microseconds. The 
sensitivity of the stations must be adjustable so that received signals 
below -10 dBm at the antenna will not activate the transponder. Antenna 
polarization must be horizontal when operating in the 9320-9500 MHz band 
and either horizontal or both horizontal and vertical when operating in 
the 2920-3100 MHz band. Racons using frequency agile transmitting 
techniques must include circuitry designed to reduce interference caused 
by triggering from radar antenna sidelobes.

[[Page 55]]

dot), meaning ``You should not come any closer''. The width of a Morse 
dot is defined as equal to the width of a space and \1/3\ of the width 
of a Morse dash;

circuitry designed to reduce interference caused by triggering from 
radar antenna sidelobes.
    (2) Selectable transponders must be authorized under part 5 of the

    (b) A main transmitter must operate at its required antenna power 
when adjusted to any required operating frequency and energized by the 
main power supply of the ship station or by an equivalent power supply.
    (c) A main transmitter must be equipped to measure (1) antenna 
current, (2) transmitter power supply voltages, and (3) anode or 
collector current(s).
    (d) The antenna power must be determined at the operating carrier 
frequency by the product of the antenna resistance and the square of the 
average antenna current, both measured at the same point in the antenna 
circuit at approximately ground potential.
    (e) A main transmitter producing more than 250 watts output power 
must have the output power reduced to not more than 150 watts when used 
for telegraphy. In stations where a separate telegraph transmitter 
operable on the same frequencies as the main transmitter with an output 
power of less than 250 watts, is installed, the power reduction 
requirement does not apply. Such separate transmitters must not obtain

watch must be maintained at least twice each hour for 3 minutes 
commencing at x h.00 and x h.30 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) using 
either a loudspeaker or headphone. Expect for distress, urgency or 
safety messages, ship stations must not transmit during the silence 
periods on 2182 kHz.


<R05>
Sec. 80.305  Watch requirements of the Communications Act and the Safety Convention.

    (a) Each ship of the United States which is equipped with a 
radiotelegraph station for compliance with part II of title III of the 
Communications Act or chapter IV of the Safety Convention must:
    (1) Keep a continuous and efficient watch on 500 kHz by means of 
radio officers while being navigated in the open sea outside a harbor or 
port. In lieu thereof, on a cargo ship equipped with a radiotelegraph 
auto alarm in proper operating condition, an efficient watch on 500 kHz 
must be maintained by means of a radio officer for at least 8 hours per 
day in the aggregate, i.e., for at least one-third of each day or 
portion of each day that the vessel is navigated in the open sea outside 
of a harbor or port.
    (2) Keep a continuous and efficient watch on the radiotelephone 
distress frequency 2182 kHz from the principal radio operating position 
or the room from which the vessel is normally steered while being 
navigated in the open sea outside a harbor or port. A radiotelephone 
distress frequency watch receiver having a loudspeaker and a 
radiotelephone auto alarm facility must be used to keep the continuous 
watch on 2182 kHz if such watch is kept from the room from which the 
vessel is normally steered. After a determination by the master that 
conditions are such that maintenance of the listening watch would 
interfere with the safe navigation of the ship, the watch may be 
maintained by the use of the radiotelephone auto alarm facility alone.

[[Page 71]]

    (3) Keep a continuous and efficient watch on the VHF distress 
frequency 156.800 MHz from the room from which the vessel is normally 
steered while in the open sea outside a harbor or port. The watch must 
be maintained by a designated member of the crew who may perform other 
duties, relating to the operation or navigation of the vessel, provided 
such other duties do not interfere with the effectiveness of the watch. 
Use of a properly adjusted squelch or brief interruptions due to other 
nearby VHF transmissions are not considered to adversely affect the 
continuity or efficiency of the required watch on the VHF distress 
frequency. This watch need not be maintained by vessels subject to the 
Bridge-to-Bridge Act and participating in a Vessel Traffic Services 
(VTS) system as required or recommended by the U.S. Coast Guard, when an 
efficient listening watch is maintained on both the bridge-to-bridge 
frequency and a separate assigned VTS frequency.
    (b) Each cargo ship of the United States which is equipped with a 
radiotelephone station for compliance with part II of title III of the 
Communications Act or chapter IV of the Safety Convention must while 
being navigated outside of a harbor or port:
    (1) Keep a continuous watch on 2182 kHz in the room from which the 
vessel is normally steered while at sea, whenever such station is not 
being used for authorized traffic. Such watch must be maintained by at 
least one officer or crewmember who may perform other duties relating to 
the operation or navigation of the vessel, provided such other duties do 
not interfere with the watch. A radiotelephone watch receiver having a 
loudspeaker and a radiotelephone auto alarm must be used to keep the 
continuous watch on 2182 kHz. After a determination by the master that 
maintenance of the watch would interfere with the safe navigation of the 
ship, the watch may be maintained by use of the radiotelephone auto 
alarm facility alone.
    (2) Keep a continuous watch on 156.800 MHz from the room from which 
the vessel is normally steered. The watch must be maintained by a 
crewmember who may perform other duties, relating to the operation or 
navigation of the vessel, provided such other duties do not interfere 
with the watch. Use of properly adjusted squelch of brief interruptions 
due to other nearby VHF transmissions are not considered to adversely 
affect the watch. This watch need not be maintained by vessels subject 
to the Bridge-to-Bridge Act and participating in a Vessel Traffic 
Services (VTS) system when a watch is maintained on both the bridge-to-
bridge frequency and a VTS frequency.
    (c) Each vessel of the United States transporting more than six 
passengers for hire, which is equipped with a radiotelephone station for 
compliance with part III of title III of the Communications Act must, 
while being navigated in the open sea or any tidewater within the 
jurisdiction of the United States adjacent or contiguous to the open 
sea, keep a continuous watch on 2182 kHz while the vessel is beyond VHF 
communication range of the nearest VHF coast station, whenever the 
radiotelephone station is not being used for authorized traffic. A VHF 
watch must be kept on 156.800 MHz whenever such station is not being 
used for authorized traffic. The VHF watch must be maintained at the 
vessel's steering station actually in use by the qualified operator as 
defined by Sec. 80.157 or by a crewmember who may perform other duties 
relating to the operation or navigation of the vessel, provided such 
other duties do not interfere with the watch. The use of a properly 
adjusted squelch is not considered to adversely affect the watch. The 
VHF watch need not be maintained by vessels subject to the Bridge-to-
Bridge Act and participating in a Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system 
when an efficient listening watch is maintained on both the bridge-to-
bridge frequency and a VTS frequency.


<R05>
Sec. 80.306  Provisions governing the radiotelegraph watch.

    (a) The radio officer must use the main or reserve receiver, and 
either headphones or a loudspeaker to keep the watch on 500 kHz.
    (b) During the watch, the radio officer may temporarily interrupt 
the required watch on 500 kHz while transmitting or receiving signals or 
messages to or from a station but only if it

[[Page 72]]

is not feasible to simultaneously handle such traffic and listen on 500 
kHz by split headphones or a loudspeaker. The watch on 500 kHz must, 
however, without exception be maintained during the silence periods.
    (c) During this watch, on vessels subject to the Communications Act 
and the Safety Convention on international voyages, the radio officer 
may discontinue listening when handling traffic on other frequencies or 
performing other essential radio duties, but only if it is impracticable 
to listen by split headphones or loudspeaker. The watch must always be 
maintained by a radio officer using headphones or loudspeaker during the 
silence periods. The term ``essential radio duties'' in this rule 
includes urgent repairs of radiocommunication equipment used for safety 
or radio navigational equipment by order of the master.
    (d) When authorized by the master, the radio officer may perform 
maintenance repair of communications, navigation or other electronic 
equipment outside of the radiotelegraph room, provided that the 
listening watch on 500 kHz can be maintained by headphones, 
loudspeakers, portable receivers, or other suitable means. The watch on 
500 kHz must be maintained in the radiotelegraph room during the silence 
period.


<R05>
Sec. 80.307  Compulsory use of radiotelegraph auto alarm.

    The radiotelegraph auto alarm required on a cargo ship subject to 
the radiotelegraph provisions of part II of title III of the 
Communications Act or the Safety Convention must be in operation, 
connected to the main antenna and adjusted for optimum efficiency at all 
times while the ship is being navigated in the open sea when a radio 
officer is not listening on the frequency 500 kHz, except under the 
circumstances as set forth in Sec. 80.306(b).


<R05>
Sec. 80.308  Watch required by the Great Lakes Radio Agreement.

    (a) Each ship of the United States that is equipped with a 
radiotelephone station for compliance with the Great Lakes Radio 
Agreement must when underway keep a watch on:
    (1) 156.800 MHz on board a vessel 20 meters (65 feet) and over in 
length, a vessel engaged in towing (See Sec. 80.951(b)), or a vessel 
carrying more than 6 passengers for hire. This watch must be maintained 
whenever the station is not being used for authorized traffic. However, 
a watch on 156.800 MHz need not be maintained by a vessel maintaining a 
watch on the bridge-to-bridge frequency 156.650 MHz and participating in 
a Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system and maintaining a watch on the 
specified VTS frequency.
    (2) 156.650 MHz on board a vessel 38 meters (124 feet) and over in 
length, a vessel engaged in towing (See Sec. 80.951(b)), or a vessel 
carrying more than six passengers for hire. This watch must be 
maintained continuously and effectively. Sequential monitoring is not 
sufficient. Portable VHF equipment may be used to meet this requirement. 
Vessels are exempted from this requirement while transiting the St. 
Lawrence Seaway and complying with the Joint Regulations of the St. 
Lawrence Seaway Authority and St. Lawrence Seaway Development 
Corporation between the lower exit of St. Lambert Lock at Montreal and 
Crossover Island, New York and in the Welland Canal and approaches 
between Calling in Point No. 15 and No. 16.
    (b) The watch must be maintained by the master, or person designated 
by the master, who may perform other duties provided they do not 
interfere with the effectiveness of the watch.

    The distress call has absolute priority over all other 
transmissions. All stations which hear it must immediately cease any 
transmission capable of interfering with the distress traffic and must 
continue to listen on the frequency used for the emission of the 
distress call. This call must not be addressed to a particular station. 
Acknowledgement of receipt must not be given before the distress message 
which follows it is sent.


<R05>
Sec. 80.313  Frequencies for use in distress.

    The frequencies specified in the bands below are for use by mobile 
stations in distress. The conventional emission is shown. When a ship 
station cannot transmit on the designated frequency or the conventional 
emission, it may use any available frequency or emission. Frequencies 
for distress and safety calling using digital selective calling 
techniques are listed in Sec. 80.359(b). Distress and safety NB-DP 
frequencies are indicated by footnote 2 in Sec. 80.361(b).

<R05>
Sec. 80.314  Distress signals.

    (a) The international radiotelegraphy distress signal consists of 
the group ``three dots, three dashes, three dots'' (... ---...), 
symbolized herein by SOS, transmitted as a single signal in which the 
dashes are slightly prolonged so as to be distinguished clearly from the 
dots.
    (b) The international radiotelephone distress signal consists of the 
word MAYDAY, pronounced as the French expression ``m'aider''.
    (c) These distress signals indicate that a mobile station is 
threatened by grave and imminent danger and requests immediate 
assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 80.315  Distress calls.

    (a) The radiotelegraph distress call consists of:
    (1) The distress signal SOS, sent three times;
    (2) The word DE;
    (3) The call sign of the mobile station in distress, sent three 
times.
    (b) The radiotelephone distress call consists of:
    (1) The distress signal MAYDAY spoken three times;
    (2) The words THIS IS;
    (3) The call sign (or name, if no call sign assigned) of the mobile 
station in distress, spoken three times.


<R05>
Sec. 80.316  Distress messages.

    (a) The radiotelegraph distress message consists of:
    (1) The distress signal SOS;
    (2) The name of the mobile station in distress;
    (3) Particulars of its position;
    (4) The nature of the distress;

[[Page 74]]

    (5) The kind of assistance desired;
    (6) Any other information which might facilitate rescue.
    (b) The radiotelephone distress message consists of:
    (1) The distress signal MAYDAY;
    (2) The name of the mobile station in distress;
    (3) Particulars of its position;
    (4) The nature of the distress;
    (5) The kind of assistance desired;
    (6) Any other information which might facilitate rescue, for 
example, the length, color, and type of vessel, number of persons on 
board.
    (c) As a general rule, a ship must signal its position in latitude 
and longitude, using figures for the degrees and minutes, together with 
one of the words NORTH or SOUTH and one of the words EAST or WEST. In 
radiotelegraphy, the signal .-.-.- must be used to separate the degrees 
from the minutes. When practicable, the true bearing and distance in 
nautical miles from a known geographical position may be given.


<R05>
Sec. 80.317  Radiotelegraph and radiotelephone alarm signals.

    (a) The international radiotelegraph alarm signal consists of a 
series of twelve dashes sent in one minute, the duration of each dash 
being four seconds and the duration of the interval between consecutive 
dashes one second. The purpose of this special signal is the actuation 
of automatic devices giving the alarm to attract the attention of the 
operator when there is no listening watch on the distress frequency.
    (b) The international radiotelephone alarm signal consists of two 
substantially sinusoidal audio frequency tones transmitted alternately. 
One tone must have a frequency of 2200 Hertz and the other a frequency 
of 1300 Hertz, the duration of each tone being 250 milliseconds. When 
generated by automatic means, the radiotelephone alarm signal must be 
transmitted continuously for a period of at least 30 seconds, but not 
exceeding one minute; when generated by other means, the signal must be 
transmitted as continuously as practicable over a period of 
approximately one minute. The purpose of this special signal is to 
attract the attention of the person on watch or to actuate automatic 
devices giving the alarm.


<R05>
Sec. 80.318  Use of alarm signals.

    (a) The radiotelegraph or radiotelephone alarm signal, as 
appropriate, must only be used to announce:
    (1) That a distress call or message is about to follow;
    (2) The transmission of an urgent cyclone warning. In this case the 
alarm signal may only be used by coast stations authorized by the 
Commission to do so; or
    (3) The loss of a person or persons overboard. In this case the 
alarm signal may only be used when the assistance of other ships is 
required and cannot be satisfactorily obtained by the use of the urgency 
signal only, but the alarm signal must not be repeated by other 
stations. The message must be preceded by the urgency signal.
    (b) In cases described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, 
the transmission of the warning or message by radiotelegraphy must not 
begin until two minutes after the end of the radiotelegraph alarm 
signal.


<R05>
Sec. 80.319  Radiotelegraph distress call and message transmission procedure.

    (a) The radiotelegraph distress procedure consists of the following 
six steps: however, when time is vital, the first and second steps may 
be omitted. These two steps of the distress procedure may also be 
omitted in circumstances when transmission of the alarm signal is 
considered unnecessary:
    (1) The radiotelegraph alarm signal;
    (2) The distress call and an interval of two minutes;
    (3) The distress call;
    (4) The distress message;
    (5) Two dashes of ten to fifteen seconds each;
    (6) The call sign of the mobile station in distress.
    (b) The radiotelegraph distress transmissions must be sent by means 
of the international Morse code at a speed not exceeding 16 words per 
minute nor less than 8 words per minute.
    (c) The distress message, preceded by the distress call, must be 
repeated at intervals, especially during the 500 kHz international 
silence periods, until an

[[Page 75]]

answer is received. The radiotelegraph alarm signal may also be 
repeated, if necessary.
    (d) The transmissions under paragraphs (a) (5) and (6) of this 
section, which are to permit direction finding stations to determine the 
position of the station in distress, may be repeated at frequent 
intervals if necessary.
    (e) When the mobile station in distress receives no answer to a 
distress message transmitted on the distress frequency, the message may 
be repeated on any other available frequency on which attention might be 
attracted.


<R05>
Sec. 80.320  Radiotelephone distress call and message transmission procedure.

    (a) The radiotelephone distress procedure consists of:
    (1) The radiotelephone alarm signal (whenever possible);
    (2) The distress call;
    (3) The distress message.
    (b) Radiotelephone distress transmissions must be made slowly and 
distinctly, each word being clearly pronounced to facilitate 
transcription.
    (c) After the transmission by radiotelephony of its distress 
message, the mobile station may be requested to transmit suitable 
signals followed by its call sign or name, to permit direction-finding 
stations to determine its position. This request may be repeated at 
frequent intervals if necessary.
    (d) The distress message, preceded by the distress call, must be 
repeated at intervals until an answer is received. This repetition must 
be preceded by the radiotelephone alarm signal whenever possible.
    (e) When the mobile station in distress receives no answer to a 
distress message transmitted on the distress frequency, the message may 
be repeated on any other available frequency on which attention might be 
attracted.


<R05>
Sec. 80.321  Acknowledgement of receipt of distress message.

    (a) Stations of the maritime mobile service which receive a distress 
message from a mobile station which is beyond any possible doubt in 
their vicinity must immediately acknowledge receipt. However, in areas 
where reliable communication with one or more coast stations is 
practicable, ship stations may defer this acknowledgement for a short 
interval so that a coast station may acknowledge receipt.
    (b) Stations of the maritime mobile service which receive a distress 
message from a mobile station which beyond any possible doubt is not in 
their vicinity, must allow a short interval of time to elapse before 
acknowledging receipt of the message in order to permit stations nearer 
to the mobile station in distress to acknowledge receipt without 
interference.


<R05>
Sec. 80.322  Form of acknowledgement.

    (a) The acknowledgement of receipt of a radiotelegraph distress 
message is transmitted in the following form:
    (1) The distress signal SOS;
    (2) The call sign of the station sending the distress message, sent 
three times;
    (3) The word DE;
    (4) The call sign of the station acknowledging receipt, sent three 
times;
    (5) The group RRR;
    (6) The message signal SOS.
    (b) The acknowledgement of receipt of a radiotelephone distress 
message is transmitted in the following form:
    (1) The distress signal MAYDAY;
    (2) The call sign or other identification of the station sending the 
distress message, spoken three times;
    (3) The words THIS IS;
    (4) The call sign or other identification of the station 
acknowledging receipt, spoken three times;
    (5) The word RECEIVED;
    (6) The distress signal MAYDAY.


<R05>
Sec. 80.323  Information furnished by an acknowledging station.

    (a) Every mobile station which acknowledges receipt of a distress 
message must on the order of the master or person responsible for the 
ship, aircraft, or other vehicle carrying such mobile station, transmit 
as soon as possible the following information in the order shown:
    (1) Its identifier;
    (2) Its position;
    (3) The speed at which it is proceeding towards, and the approximate

[[Page 76]]

time it will take to reach the mobile station in distress.
    (b) Before sending this message, the station must ensure that it 
will not interfere with the emissions of other stations better situated 
to render immediate assistance to the station in distress.


<R05>
Sec. 80.324  Transmission of distress message by station not itself in distress.

    (a) A mobile station or a land station which learns that a mobile 
station is in distress must transmit a distress message in any of the 
following cases:
    (1) When the station in distress cannot transmit the distress 
message.
    (2) When the master or person responsible for the ship, aircraft, or 
other vehicle not in distress, or for the land station, believes that 
further help is necessary.
    (3) When, although not in a position to assist, it has heard a 
distress message which has not been acknowledged. When a mobile station 
transmits such a distress message, it must notify the authorities who 
may be able to assist.
    (b) Transmission must be made on the international distress 
frequencies or on any other available frequency on which attention might 
be attracted.
    (c) Transmission of the distress message must always be preceded by 
the call indicated below, which must itself be preceded whenever 
possible by the radiotelegraph or radiotelephone alarm signal. This call 
consists of:
    (1) When radiotelegraphy is used:
    (i) The signal DDD SOS SOS SOS DDD:
    (ii) The word DE;
    (iii) The call sign of the transmitting station, sent three times.
    (2) When radiotelephony is used:
    (i) The signal MAYDAY RELAY, spoken three times;
    (ii) The words THIS IS;
    (iii) The call sign or other identification of the transmitting 
station, spoken three times.
    (d) When the radiotelegraph alarm signal is used, an interval of two 
minutes must be allowed, whenever this is considered necessary, before 
the transmission of the call mentioned in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 80.325  Control of distress traffic.

    (a) Distress traffic consists of all messages relating to the 
immediate assistance required by the mobile station in distress. In 
distress traffic, the distress signal must be sent before the call and 
at the beginning of the preamble of any radiotelegram.
    (b) The control of distress traffic is the responsibility of the 
mobile station in distress or of the station which has sent the distress 
message. These stations may delegate the control of the distress traffic 
to another station.
    (c) The station in distress or the station in control of distress 
traffic may impose silence either on all stations of the mobile service 
in the area or on any station which interferes with the distress 
traffic. It must address these instructions ``to all stations'' or to 
one station only, according to circumstances. In either case, it must 
use one of the following signals which are reserved for use by the 
mobile station in distress and for the station controlling distress 
traffic:
    (1) In radiotelegraphy, the abbreviation QRT, followed by the 
distress signal SOS.
    (2) In radiotelephony, the signal SEELONCE MAYDAY.
    (d) If essential, any station of the mobile service near the ship, 
aircraft, or other vehicle in distress may also impose silence. It must 
use for this purpose:
    (1) In radiotelegraphy, the abbreviation QRT, followed by the word 
DISTRESS and its own call sign;
    (2) In radiotelephony, the word SEELONCE, followed by the word 
DISTRESS and its own call sign or other identification.


<R05>
Sec. 80.326  Notification of resumption of normal working.

    (a) When distress traffic has ceased, or when complete silence is no 
longer necessary on a frequency which has been used for distress 
traffic, the station which has controlled this traffic must transmit on 
that frequency a message addressed ``to all stations'' indicating that 
normal working may be resumed.
    (1) In radiotelegraphy, this message consists of:
    (i) The distress signal SOS;

[[Page 77]]

    (ii) The call ``to all stations'' (CQ), sent three times;
    (iii) The word DE;
    (iv) The call sign of the station sending the message;
    (v) The time of handing in the message;
    (vi) The name and call sign of the mobile station which was in 
distress;
    (vii) The service abbreviation QUM.
    (2) In radiotelephony, this message consists of:
    (i) The distress signal MAYDAY;
    (ii) The call ``Hello all stations'', spoken three times;
    (iii) The words THIS IS;
    (iv) The call sign or other identification of the station sending 
the message;
    (v) The time of handing in of the message;
    (vi) The name and call sign of the mobile station which was in 
distress;
    (vii) The words SEELONCE FEENEE OR PRU-DONCE.
    (b) Until they receive the foregoing message indicating that normal 
or limited working may be resumed, all stations which are aware of the 
distress traffic, and which are not taking part in it, are forbidden to 
transmit on the frequencies on which the distress traffic is taking 
place.


<R05>
Sec. 80.327  Urgency signals.

    (a) The urgency signal indicates that the calling station has a very 
urgent message to transmit concerning the safety of a ship, aircraft, or 
other vehicle, or the safety of a person. The urgency signal must be 
sent only on the authority of the master or person responsible for the 
mobile station.
    (b) In radiotelegraphy, the urgency signal consists of three 
repetitions of the group XXX, sent with the individual letters of each 
group, and the successive groups clearly separated from each other. It 
must be transmitted before the call.
    (c) In radiotelephony, the urgency signal consists of three oral 
repetitions of the group of words PAN PAN transmitted before the call.
    (d) The urgency signal has priority over all other communications 
except distress. All mobile and land stations which hear it must not 
interfere with the transmission of the message which follows the urgency 
signal.

[51 FR 31213, Sept. 2, 1986, as amended at 52 FR 35245, Sept. 18, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 80.328  Urgency message.

    (a) The urgency signal and call, and the message following it, must 
be sent on one of the international distress frequencies. Stations which 
cannot transmit on a distress frequency may use any other available 
frequency on which attention might be attracted.
    (b) Mobile stations which hear the urgency signal must continue to 
listen for at least three minutes. At the end of this period, if no 
urgency message has been heard, they may resume their normal service. 
However, land and mobile stations which are in communication on 
frequencies other than those used for the transmission of the urgency 
signal and of the call which follows it may continue their normal work 
without interruption provided the urgency message is not addressed ``to 
all stations''.
    (c) When the urgency signal has been sent before transmitting a 
message ``to all stations'' which calls for action by the stations 
receiving the message, the station responsible for its transmission must 
cancel it as soon as it knows that action is no longer necessary. This 
message of cancellation must likewise be addressed ``to all stations''.


<R05>
Sec. 80.329  Safety signals.

    (a) The safety signal indicates that the station is about to 
transmit a message concerning the safety of navigation or giving 
important meteorological warnings.
    (b) In radiotelegraphy, the safety signal consists of three 
repetitions of the group TTT, sent with the individual letters of each 
group, and the successive groups clearly separated from each other. It 
must be sent before the call.
    (c) In radiotelephony, the safety signal consists of the word 
SECURITE, pronounced as in French, spoken three times and transmitted 
before the call.
    (d) The safety signal and call must be sent on one of the 
international distress frequencies (500 kHz or 8364 kHz radiotelegraph; 
2182 kHz or 156.8 MHz radiotelephone). Stations which cannot transmit on 
a distress frequency may

[[Page 78]]

use any other available frequency on which attention might be attracted.


<R05>
Sec. 80.330  Safety message.

    (a) The safety signal and call must be followed by the safety 
message. Where practicable, the safety message should be sent on a 
working frequency, and a suitable announcement to this effect must be 
made at the end of the call.
    (b) Except for the cases mentioned in paragraph (c) of this section, 
the safety signal when sent on the frequency 500 kHz must be transmitted 
toward the end of the first available silence period; the safety message 
must be transmitted immediately after the silence period.
    (c) Messages about meteorological warnings, of cyclones, dangerous 
ice, dangerous wrecks, or any other imminent danger to marine navigation 
must be preceded by the safety signal.
    (d) Stations hearing the safety signal must not make any 
transmission likely to interfere with the message.


<R05>
Sec. 80.331  Bridge-to-bridge communication procedure.

    (a) Vessels subject to the Bridge-to-Bridge Act transmitting on the 
designated navigational frequency must conduct communications in a 
format similar to those given below:
    (1) This is the (name of vessel). My position is (give readily 
identifiable position, course and speed) about to (describe contemplated 
action). Out.
    (2) Vessel off (give a readily identifiable position). This is (name 
of vessel) off (give a readily identifiable position). I plan to (give 
proposed course of action). Over.
    (3) (Coast station), this is (vessel's name) off (give readily 
identifiable position). I plan to (give proposed course of action). 
Over.
    (b) Vessels acknowledging receipt must answer ``(Name of vessel 
calling). This is (Name of vessel answering). Received your call,'' and 
follow with an indication of their intentions. Communications must 
terminate when each ship is satisfied that the other no longer poses a 
threat to its safety and is ended with ``Out''.
    (c) Use of power greater than 1 watt in a bridge-to-bridge station 
shall be limited to the following three situations:
    (1) Emergency.
    (2) Failure of the vessel being called to respond to a second call 
at low power.
    (3) A broadcast call as in paragraph (a)(1) of this section in a 
blind situation, e.g., rounding a bend in a river.


<R05>
Sec. 80.332  Equipment to aid search and rescue operations.

    (a) Survival craft stations may transmit distress, urgency and 
safety signals, calls and messages.
    (b) EPIRB's may transmit only in accordance with the requirements of 
subparts V and X of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 80.333  Stations in the maritime mobile-satellite service.

    The provisions of Secs. 80.311 and 80.324 apply to the operations of 
ship earth stations in the maritime mobile-satellite service.

<R05>
Sec. 80.351  Scope.

    The following sections describe the carrier frequencies and general 
uses of radiotelegraphy with respect to the following:

--Distress, urgency, safety, call and reply.
--Working.
--Digital selective calling (DSC).
--Narrow-band direct-printing (NB-DP).
--Facsimile.


<R05>
Sec. 80.353  General uses--radiotelegraphy.

    (a) Unless otherwise indicated radiotelegraphy may be used by ship 
and public coast stations only.
    (b) The signal code for Morse telegraphy must be the international 
Morse code signals specified in the Telegraph Regulations annexed to the 
International Telecommunication Convention.
    (c) To facilitate communications, ship stations transmitting by 
means of radiotelegraphy must use the service abbreviations (``Q'' 
signals) listed in Appendix 14 to the ITU Radio Regulations whenever 
practicable.

[[Page 79]]

    (d) In order to reduce interference stations must attempt to select 
calling frequencies which provide the most favorable propagational 
characteristics for effecting reliable communications.
    (e) Coast stations may apply to use for telegraphy communications 
any additional coast station frequencies that are allocated for such 
communications in the 10-27500 kHz band that are not listed in this 
part. See the Table of Frequency allocations in Sec. 2.106 of this 
chapter. The use of such frequencies will be authorized initially with a 
six month provisional period.
    (f) Radiotelegraphy stations communicating with a Government station 
may transmit on a Government frequency when authorized to do so by the 
Government station or agency if the emission, bandwidth and frequency 
tolerance of the non-Government station are within the same limits as 
the Government station.


<R05>
Sec. 80.355  Distress, urgency, safety, call and reply Morse code frequencies.

    This section describes the distress, urgency, safety, call and reply 
carrier frequencies assignable to stations for Morse code 
radiotelegraphy.
    (a) Frequencies in the 100-160 kHz band. The international calling 
frequency in the 100-160 kHz band is 143 kHz using A1A or J2A emission. 
When a ship station operating in the 100-160 kHz band desires to 
communicate with a coast station, it must call on the frequency 143 kHz 
unless the International List of Coast Stations provides otherwise. 
Coast stations must reply on their normal working frequency in this 
band. Only individual calls, replies to such calls, and transmission of 
signals preparatory to traffic may be transmitted on 143 kHz.
    (b) Frequencies in the 405-535 kHz band. (1) The international 
distress, urgency, safety, call and reply frequency used by ship and 
coast stations operating in the 405-525 kHz band is 500 kHz. A2A and A2B 
or H2A and H2B emissions are preferred for distress calls, distress 
traffic and for urgency and safety messages. For call and reply messages 
A1A or J2A emission must be used. In order to facilitate distress 
communications routine correspondence tranmissions on 500 kHz must be 
reduced to a minimum.
    (2) In Region 2 and areas of heavy traffic ship stations must 
request coast stations to listen on the ship station's working 
frequencies.
    (3) In areas where 500 kHz is used for distress a ship or coast 
station must use the supplementary calling frequency 512 kHz for routine 
calling and normally request a reply on its working frequency. The 
called station may reply on 512 kHz when requested to do so by the 
calling station.
    (c) Frequencies in the 2000-27500 kHz band--(1) Survival craft 
frequencies: Survival craft operating on 8364 kHz must use A2A or H2A 
emission to establish communications related to search and rescue 
operations.
    (2) Ship station frequencies. The following table describes the 
calling frequencies in the 4000-27500 kHz band which are available for 
use by authorized ship stations equipped with crystal controlled 
oscillators for A1A or J2A radiotelegraphy. There are two series of 
frequencies for worldwide use and two series of frequencies for each 
geographic region. Ship stations with synthesized transmitters may 
operate on every full 100 Hz increment in the 0.5 kHz channel for the 
frequencies listed, except for 100 Hz above and below those designated 
for worldwide use. During normal business hours when not communicating 
on other frequencies, all U.S. coast radiotelegraph stations must 
monitor the worldwide frequencies and the initial calling frequencies 
for the region in which it is located. The specific frequencies which 
must be monitored by a coast station will vary with propagation 
conditions. The calling frequencies which are routinely monitored by 
specific coast stations can be determined by reference to the ITU 
publication entitled ``List of Coast Stations''. Initial calls by ship 
stations must be made on the appropriate initial calling frequency 
first. Calls on the worldwide frequencies may be made only after calls 
on the appropriate initial calling frequency are unsuccessful.

Sec. 80.357  Morse code working frequencies.

    This section describes the working frequencies assignable to 
maritime stations for A1A or J2A radiotelegraphy.
    (a) Ship station frequencies--(1) Frequencies in the 100-160 kHz 
band. The following table describes the working carrier frequencies in 
the 100-160 kHz band which are assignable to ship stations. A ship 
station may also transmit on a radiotelegraphy working channel of a 
coast station within the 100-160 kHz band when directed to do so by the 
coast station provided interference is not caused to any land, fixed, 
broadcast, or radiolocation station.

\1\ The frequency 410 kHz may be used on a secondary basis for the
  transmission of radiodetermination information and for transmitting by
  radiotelegraph radiodetermination related messages to direction-
  finding stations.
\2\ The frequency 512 kHz may be used as a supplementary calling
  frequency when 500 kHz is used for distress, safety and urgency
  communications. The use of the 512 kHz as a working frequency is
  prohibited in areas where it is used as a supplementary calling
  frequency when 500 kHz is used for distress, safety, and urgency
  communications.
\3\ The frequency 518 kHz is a receive only frequency by ship stations.
  It is used by U.S. Coast Guard coast stations for NB-DP transmissions
  of meteorological and navigational warnings to ships.

    (3) Frequencies in the 2000-27500 kHz band. This paragraph describes 
the

working frequencies and Channel Series in the 2000-27500 kHz band which 
are assignable to ship stations.
    (i) Two Channel Series will be assigned for routine use to each ship 
station. Frequencies from any other Channel Series may be used if the 
frequencies in the assigned Channel Series are not adequate for 
communications.

    (ii) If the frequencies listed in paragraph (3)(i) of this section 
are not adequate for communications, ship stations may use any of the 
non-paired narrow-band direct-printing frequencies listed in 
Sec. 80.361(b) of this part for A1A or J2A radiotelegraphy.
    (b) Coast station frequencies.--(1) Frequencies in the 100-27500 kHz 
band. The following table describes the working carrier frequencies in 
the 100-27500 kHz band which are assignable to coast stations located in 
the designated geographical areas. The exclusive maritime mobile HF 
bands listed in the table contained in Sec. 80.363(b) of this part are 
also available for assignment to public coast stations for A1A or J2A 
radiotelegraphy following coordination with government users. With 
respect to frequencies that are assignable in more than one geographical 
area, once the frequency is assigned to one licensee, any subsequent 
license will be authorized on a secondary, non-interference basis with 
respect to the incumbent license's existing operation. If the first 
licensee later seeks authorization to operate in an additional 
geographic area, such authorization will be on a secondary, non-
interference basis to other co-channel licensees.

\1\ All frequencies in this table are shown in kilohertz.

    (2) Conditions of use. The following conditions are applicable to 
these frequencies:
    (i) Frequencies in the 100-160 kHz band are assignable to coast 
stations for high seas communications only;
    (ii) Frequencies above 5 MHz may be assigned primarily to stations 
serving the high seas and secondarily to stations serving inland waters 
of the United States, including the Great Lakes, under the condition 
that interference will not be caused to any coast station serving the 
high seas.
    (iii) The frequency 410 kHz may be used on a secondary basis for the 
transmission of radiodetermination information and for transmitting by 
radiotelegraph radiodetermination messages to direction-finding 
stations; and
    (iv) The frequency 512 kHz may be used as a supplementary calling 
frequency when 500 kHz is used for distress, urgency and safety 
communications. The use of the 512 kHz as a working frequency is 
prohibited in areas where 500 kHz is used for distress, urgency and 
safety communications.

Sec. 80.359  Frequencies for digital selective calling (DSC).

    (a) General purpose calling. The following table describes the 
calling frequencies for use by authorized ship and coast stations for 
general purpose DSC. There are three series of paried frequencies. One 
series is for worldwide use; the other two series are for regional use. 
The ``Series A'' designation includes coast stations along, and ship 
stations in, the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean 
Sea. The ``Series B'' designation includes stations in any remaining 
areas. Stations must initiate contact on the appropriate regional 
frequency depending upon the location of the called station and 
propagation conditions. Acknowledgement is made on the paired frequency. 
The worldwide frequencies may be used for international calling, if 
calls on the appropriate regional frequencies are unsuccessful, or the 
regional series does not contain the appropriate band (e.g., 2 MHz). 
During normal working hours, all public coast stations capable of DSC 
operations must monitor the worldwide and regional frequencies 
appropriate for its location. The specific frequencies to be monitored 
will vary with propagation conditions.

    (2) Applicants for these frequencies must submit a substantial 
showing of need based on the following factors:
    (i) A schedule of each currently licensed NBDP frequency and the 
expected use of the proposed frequencies;
    (ii) For additional frequencies within the same MHz band, a factual 
showing of the 3 busiest hours of any 4 days within a consecutive 10 day 
period for each of the 2 months immediately preceding the filing of the 
application indicating that the applicant has used its currently 
assigned frequencies within the same MHz band an aggregate average of at 
least 40% of the 3 busiest hours of each day for exchanging 
communications; and
    (iii) Any other facts that support the need for the proposed 
assignment, e.g., evidence of radio interference by another station 
located near enough to render a currently licensed frequency 
substantially unusable.
    (b) Non-paired channels. The following table describes the 
frequencies and Channel Series with F1B or J2B emission which are

carrier frequency 2191 kHz may be used as a supplementary calling 
frequency in areas of heavy usage of 2182 kHz. All stations must use J3E 
emission when operating on 2182 and 2191 kHz, except that:
    (1) H3E emission may be used on 2182 kHz for communications with 
foreign coast and ship stations; or,
    (2) A3E emission may be used on 2182 kHz by portable survival craft 
stations, or transmitters authorized for use prior to January 1, 1972. 
See Sec. 80.203(c).
    (b) The frequencies 4125.0 kHz, 6215 kHz, 8291 kHz, 12290 kHz, and 
16420 kHz may be used by coast and ship stations on a simplex basis for 
distress and safety communications. The frequency 4125.0 kHz may also be 
used for distress and safety communications between aircraft and 
maritime mobile stations.
    (c) The frequency 5167.5 kHz is available to any station for 
emergency communications in the State of Alaska. Peak envelope power of 
stations operating on this frequency must not exceed 150 watts. This 
frequency may also be used by Alaska private fixed stations for calling 
and listening, but only for establishing communication.
    (d) In the 4000-27500 kHz band, the following coast frequencies are 
available for assignment to public coast stations for call and reply 
communications. The paired ship frequencies are available for use by 
authorized ship stations.

\1\ Unlimited hours of use from December 15 to April 1 and day only from
  April 1 to December 15. Harmful interference must not be caused to any
  station in the Great Lakes region.
\2\ In the Great Lakes region 2206 kHz is not available for transmission
  to U.S. ships except in the case of distress. U.S. coast stations in
  the Great Lakes area may use 2514, 2550 and 2582 kHz on a shared basis
  with coast stations of Canada. Except in the case of distress, the
  frequency 2550 kHz must not be used for transmission to ship stations
  of Canada since the associated ship station transmit frequency 2158
  kHz is not available to Canadian ship stations for transmission and
  2582 kHz must not be used for public correspondence transmissions to
  U.S. ship stations since the associated ship transmit frequency 2206
  kHz is not available to U.S. ship stations for transmissions except in
  the case of distress.
\3\ Limited to a peak envelope power of 150 watts.
\4\ Harmful interference must not be caused to any coast station in the
  Caribbean region.
\5\ But see section 80.373(c)(3) of this chapter.

    (b) Working frequencies in the 4000-27500 kHz band. This paragraph 
describes the working carrier frequencies in the 4000-27500 kHz band. 
With respect to frequencies that are assignable in more than one 
geographical area, once the frequency is assigned to one licensee, any 
subsequent license will be authorized on a secondary, non-interference 
basis with respect to the incumbent license's existing operation. If the 
first licensee later seeks authorization to operate in an additional 
geographic area, such authorization will be on a secondary, non-
interference basis to other co-channel licensees.
    (1) The following table specifies the carrier frequencies available 
for assignment to public coast stations. The paired ship frequencies are 
available for use by authorized ship stations. The specific frequency 
assignment available to public coast stations for a particular 
geographic area is indicated by

an ``x'' under the appropriate column. The allotment areas are in 
accordance with the ``Standard Defined Areas'' as identified in the 
International Radio Regulations, Appendix 25 Planning System, and 
indicated in the preface to the International Frequency List (IFL).

    (2) The following table specifies the non-paired carrier frequencies 
that are available for assignment to public coast stations for simplex 
operations. These frequencies are available for use by authorized ship 
stations for transmissions to coast stations (simplex operations). 
Assignments on these frequencies must accept interference. They are 
shared with government users and are considered ``common use'' 
frequencies under the international Radio Regulations. They cannot be 
notified for inclusion in the Master International Frequency Register, 
which provides stations with interference protection, but may be listed 
in the international List of Coast Stations. (See Radio Regulation No. 
1220 and Recommendation 304.)

\1\ For special assignment of frequencies in this band in certain areas
  of Washington State, the Great Lakes and the east coast of the United
  States pursuant to arrangements between the United States and Canada,
  see subpart B of this part.
\2\ The frequency pair 157.275/161.875 MHz is available on a primary
  basis to ship and public coast stations. In Alaska it is also
  available on a secondary basis to private mobile repeater stations.
\3\ Within 120 km (75 miles) of the United States/Canada border, in the
  area of the Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca and its
  approaches, the frequency 157.425 MHz is available for use by ship
  stations for public correspondence communications only. One hundred
  twenty kilometers (75 miles) from the United States/Canada border
  157.425 MHz is available for intership and commercial communications.
  Outside the Puget Sound area and its approaches and the Great Lakes,
  157.425 MHz is available for communications between commercial fishing
  vessels and associated aircraft while engaged in commercial fishing
  activities.

    (ii) Service areas in the marine VHF 156-162 MHz band are VHF Public 
Coast Station Areas (VPCSAs). As listed in the table in this paragraph, 
VPCSAs are based on, and composed of one or more of, the U.S. Department 
of Commerce's 172 Economic Areas (EAs). See 60 FR 13114 (March 10, 
1995). In addition, the Commission shall treat Guam and the Northern 
Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, 
American Samoa, and the Gulf of Mexico as EA-like areas 173-176, 
respectively. Maps of the EAs and VPCSAs are available for public 
inspection and copying at the Federal Communications Commission, Public 
Safety and Private Wireless Division, 445 12th St., SW., Room 4-C330, 
Washington, DC. Except as shown in the table, the frequency pairs listed 
in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section are available for assignment to a 
single licensee in each of the VPCSAs listed in the table in this 
paragraph. In addition to the listed EAs listed in the table in this 
paragraph, each VPCSA also includes the adjacent waters under the 
jurisdiction of the United States.

    (iii) Subject to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, each licensee may 
also operate on 12.5 kHz offset frequencies in areas where the licensee 
is authorized on both frequencies adjacent to the offset frequency, and 
in areas where the licensee on the other side of the offset frequency 
consents to the licensee's use of the adjacent offset frequency.
    (2) Any recovered channel pairs will revert automatically to the 
holder of the VPCSA license within which such channels are included, 
except the channel pairs listed in the table in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section. Those channel pairs, and any channel pairs recovered where 
there is no VPCSA licensee, will be retained by the Commission for 
future licensing.
    (3) VPCSA licensees may not operate on Channel 228B (162.0125 MHz), 
which is available for use in the Coast Guard's Ports and Waterways 
Safety System (PAWSS)). In addition, within six months of the conclusion 
of the competitive bidding procedures to determine the licensees in each 
VPCSA, the U.S. Coast Guard shall submit to each licensee of VPCSAs 1-9 
a plan specifying up to two narrowband channel pairs offset 12.5 kHz 
from the channels set forth in the table in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section, for use in the PAWSS. The final selection of the PAWSS channel 
pairs can be negotiated (if the VPCSA licensee objects to the Coast 
Guard proposal, it shall make a counterproposal within three months) and 
established by an agreement between the parties. All parties are 
required to negotiate in good faith. If no agreement is reached within 
one year of the date the Coast Guard submitted its plan, the Coast Guard 
may petition the Commission to select the channel pairs.
    (4) Subject to the requirements of Sec. 1.924 of this chapter and 
Sec. 80.21, each VPCSA licensee may place stations anywhere within its 
region without obtaining prior Commission approval provided:
    (i) It provides to co-channel coast station incumbent licensees, and 
incumbent Private Land Mobile Radio licensees authorized under part 90 
of this chapter on a primary basis, protection as defined in subpart P 
of this part. VPCSA licensees that share a common border may either 
distribute the available frequencies upon mutual agreement or request

    (4) Channels in the 219-220 MHz band are also used on a secondary, 
non-interference basis by amateur stations participating in digital 
message forwarding systems. Amateur stations may not cause harmful 
interference to AMTS operations and must accept any harmful interference 
from AMTS operation. Amateur stations within 80 km (50 miles) of an AMTS 
coast station must obtain written approval from the AMTS licensee prior 
to operating in the 219-220 MHz band. Amateur stations within 640 km 
(398 miles) of an AMTS coast station must notify the AMTS licensee in 
writing at least 30 days prior to initiation of operations in the 219-
220 MHz band. All amateur stations must notify the American Radio Relay 
League in writing at least 30 days prior to initiation of operations in 
the 219-220 MHz band (ARRL, 225 Main St., Newington, CT 06111-1494).
    (b) Subject to the requirements of Sec. 1.924 of this chapter, 
Secs. 80.215(h), and 80.475(a), each AMTS geographic area licensee may 
place stations anywhere within its region without obtaining prior 
Commission approval provided:
    (1) The AMTS geographic area licensee must locate its stations at 
least 120 kilometers from the stations of co-channel site-based AMTS 
licensees. Shorter separations between such stations will be considered 
by the Commission on a case-by-case basis upon submission of a technical 
analysis indicating that at least 10 dB protection will be provided to 
an site-based licensee's predicted 38 dBu signal level contour. The 
site-based licensee's predicted 38 dBu signal level contour shall be 
calculated using the F(50, 50) field strength chart for Channels 7 
through 13 in Sec. 73.699 (Fig. 10) of this chapter, with a 9 dB 
correction for antenna height differential. The 10 dB protection to the 
site-based licensee's predicted 38 dBu signal level contour shall be 
calculated using the F(50, 10) field strength chart for Channels 7-13 in 
Sec. 73.699 (Fig. 10a) of this chapter, with a 9 dB correction factor 
for antenna height differential.
    (2) The locations and/or technical parameters of the transmitters 
are such that individual coordination of the channel assignment(s) with 
a foreign administration, under applicable international agreements and 
rules in this part, is not required.
    (3) For any construction or alteration that would exceed the 
requirements of Sec. 17.7 of this chapter, licensees must notify the 
appropriate Regional Office of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA 
Form 7460-1) and file a request for antenna height clearance and 
obstruction marking and lighting specifications (FCC Form 854) with the 
FCC, Attn: Information Processing Branch, 1270 Fairfield Rd., 
Gettysburg, PA 17325-7245.
    (4) The transmitters must not have a significant environmental 
effect as defined by Secs. 1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter.
    (c) Any recovered frequency blocks will revert automatically to the 
holder of the geographic area license within which such frequencies are 
included. Any frequency blocks recovered where there is no geographic 
area licensee will be retained by the Commission for future licensing.
    (d) Automated multi-station system. Great Lakes Region. The 
following table describes the assignable carrier frequency pairs to 
provide communication services including automated calling, teleprinter 
and facsimile:

    (3) +17 dBu (decibels referred to 1 microvolt per meter).
    (4) 7 microvolts per meter.


<R05>
Sec. 80.755  Applicability.

    Applications for maritime frequencies in the 156-162 MHz band must 
include a map showing the proposed service area contour. The service 
area contour must be computed in accordance with the following 
procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 80.757  Topographical data.

    (a) In the preparation of profile graphs and in determining the 
location and height above sea level of the antenna site, the elevations 
or contour intervals must be taken from U.S. Geological Survey 
topographic quadrangle maps, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maps or 
Tennessee Valley Authority maps, whichever is the latest, for all areas 
for which maps are available. If such maps are not published for the 
area in question, the next best topographic information must be used. 
The maps used must include the principal area to be served. U.S. 
Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps may be obtained from the 
Eastern Distribution Branch, U.S. Geological Survey, 1200 South Eads 
Street, Arlington, VA 22202, for maps of areas east of the Mississippi 
River, including Minnesota,

[[Page 126]]

Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, and from the Western Distribution 
Branch, U.S. Geological Survey, Federal Center, Denver CO 80225, for 
maps of areas west of the Mississippi River, including Alaska, Hawaii, 
Louisiana, Guam and American Samoa. Sectional aeronautical charts are 
available from the Distribution Division, National Ocean Service, 
Riverdale, MD 20840.
    (b) In lieu of maps, the average terrain elevation may be computer 
generated, using elevations from a 30 second point or better topographic 
data file such as those available for the U.S. Geological Survey's 
National Geographic Information Center or the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration's National Geophysical Data Center. In case 
of dispute maps will be used to determine the correct value.


<R05>
Sec. 80.759  Average terrain elevation.

    (a)(1) Draw radials from the antenna site for each 45 degrees of 
azimuth starting with true north. Any such radial which extends entirely 
over land from the antenna site to the point of +17 dBu field strength 
need not be drawn.
    (2) If the distance from the antenna site to the point of +17 dBu 
field strength between any of the 45 degrees radials would be less than 
the distances calculated along these radials, an additional radial 
between such adjacent radials must be plotted and calculations made in 
each case. Each additional radial must be that radial along which it 
appears by inspection that transmission loss would be greatest.
    (b) Draw a circle of 16 km (10 statute mile) radius using the 
antenna site as the center. Divide each radial into 320 meter (0.2 
statute mile) increments inside the circumference to the 3.2 km (2 
statute mile) point.
    (c) Calculate the height above sea level of each 320 meter (0.2 
statute mile) division by interpolating the contour intervals of the 
map, and record the value.
    (d) Average the values by adding them and dividing by the number of 
readings along each radial.
    (e) Calculate the height above average terrain by averaging the 
values calculated for each radial.

<R05>
Sec. 80.761  Conversion graphs.

    The following graphs must be employed where conversion from one to 
the other of the indicated types of units is required.
    (a) Graph 1. To convert effective radiated power in watts to dBk or 
to dBW, find the power in watts on the horizontal axis. Move vertically 
along the line representing the power to the diagonal line. Move 
horizontally from the diagonal to the right side to read dBW and to the 
left to read dBk.
    (b) Graph 2. To convert microvolts across 50 ohms to received power 
in dBW, find the signal in microvolts on the horizontal axis. Move 
vertically to the diagonal line, then move right horizontally to read 
dBW.

<R05>
Sec. 80.763  Effective antenna height.

    The effective height of the antenna is the vertical distance between 
the center of the radiating system above the mean sea level and the 
average terrain elevation.

[[Page 130]]


<R05>
Sec. 80.765  Effective radiated power.

    Effective radiated power is used in computing the service area 
contour. The effective radiated power is derived from the transmitter 
output power, loss in the transmission system including duplexers, 
cavities, circulators, switches and filters, and the gain relative to a 
half-wave dipole of the antenna system.


<R05>
Sec. 80.767  Propagation curve.

    The propagation graph, Sec. 80.767 Graph 1, must be used in 
computing the service area contour. The graph provides data for field 
strengths in dBu for an effective radiated power of 1 kW, over sea 
water, fresh water or land (smooth earth); transmitting antena heights 
of 4,800, 3,200, 1,600, 800, 400, 200, and 100 feet; based on a 
receiving antenna height of 9 meters (30 feet), for the 156-162 MHz 
band. The use of this is described in this section.
    (a) Calculate the effective radiated power of the coast station, Ps 
in dB referred to 1 kW (dBk), as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC02AP91.005

where,
Pt=Transmitter output power in dB referred to 1 kW: Transmitter output 
power in watts is converted to dBk by Pt=10 [log10 (Power in watts)]-30. 
Also see Sec. 80.761 Graph 1 for a conversion graph.
G=Antenna gain in dB referred to a standard half-wave dipole, in the 
direction of each plotted radial, and
L=Line losses between the transmitter and the antenna, in dB.
    Notes: 1. To determine field strengths where the distance is known, 
for effective radiated powers other than 1kW (0 dBk): Enter the graph 
from the ``statute miles'' scale at the known distance, read up to 
intersection with the curve for the antenna height, read left to the 
``dBu for 1 kW radiated'' scale and note the referenced field strength 
(Fe). The value of the actual field strength (F) in dBu will be F=Fe+Ps 
where Ps is the effective radiated power calculated above.
    2. To determine distance, where the actual field strength is 
specified, for effective radiated powers other than 0 dBk: The value of 
the field referenced strength will be Fe=F-Ps in dBu. Enter the graph, 
from the ``dBu for 1 kW radiated'' scale at the corrected value of Fe, 
read right to intersection with the antenna height, read down to 
``statute miles'' scale.
    (b) Determine the antenna height. For antenna heights between the 
heights for which this graph is drawn, use linear interpolation; assume 
linear height-gain for antennas higher than 4,800 feet.
    (c) For receiver antenna heights lower than 9 meters (30 feet), 
assume that the field strength is the same as at 9 meters (30 feet).
    (d) Assume that propagation over fresh water or over land is the 
same as that over sea water.

Sec. 80.769  Shadow loss.

    Where the transmission path is obstructed the received signal must 
be adjusted to include shadow loss. Attenuation due to shadowing must be 
taken from Sec. 80.769 Graph 1, as follows:
    (a) Inspect the map(s) to determine if a hill(s) obstructs an 
imaginary line of

[[Page 132]]

sight (dashed line on illustrative profiles of Sec. 80.769 Graph 1 from 
the average terrain elevation at the coast station antenna to the water 
level at the ship location. If average terrain elevation exceeds the 
actual ground elevation at the antenna site, the latter elevation must 
be used as the average terrain elevation.
    (b) If a hill appears to obstruct the radio path, plot the antenna 
site elevation, the obstruction elevation and the height of the ship 
station on rectangular coordinate paper using elevation above mean sea 
level as the vertical scale and distance in statute miles as the 
horizontal scale. Then draw a straight line between the antenna and the 
ship.
    (c) If a hill obstructs the imaginary line of sight, determine its 
height (H) above the imaginary line and its distance (D) from either the 
coast or ship station, whichever is nearer, as illustrated by examples 
``A'' and ``B'' on Graph 1.
    (d) Read the shadow loss from this Graph 1 and subtract that loss 
from the computed received signal.
    (e) Where more than one hill obstructs the transmission path, 
determine the height and position of a single equivalent hill, as 
illustrated by example ``C'' on this graph. Read the shadow loss from 
this graph for the equivalent hill.

<R05>
Sec. 80.771  Method of computing coverage.

    Compute the +17 dBu contour as follows:
    (a) Determine the effective antenna height above mean sea level 
according to the procedures in Secs. 80.757-80.761.
    (b) Determine the effective radiated power according to Sec. 80,765. 
Determine

[[Page 134]]

for each radial the distance from the antenna site to the +17 dBu point 
of field strength using procedures of Secs. 80.765 and 80.767.
    (c) Plot on a suitable map each point of +17 dBu field strength for 
all radials and draw the contour by connecting the adjacent points by a 
smooth curve.


<R05>
Sec. 80.773  Co-channel interference protection.

    (a) Where a VHF public coast station geographic area licensee shares 
a frequency with an incumbent VHF public coast station licensee, the 
ratio of desired to undesired signal strengths must be at least 12 dB 
within the service area of the station.
    (b) Where a VHF public coast station geographic area licensee shares 
a frequency with an incumbent private land mobile radio licensee, the 
VHF public coast station geographic area licensee must provide at least 
10 dB protection to the PLMR incumbent's predicted 38 dBu signal level 
contour. The PLMR incumbent's predicted 38 dBu signal level contour is 
calculated using the F(50, 50) field strength chart for Channels 7-13 in 
Sec. 73.699 (Fig. 10a) of this chapter, with a 9 dB correction factor 
for antenna height differential, and is based on the licensee's 
authorized effective radiated power and antenna height-above-average-
terrain.
    (c) VHF public coast station geographic area licensees are 
prohibited from exceeding a field strength of +5 dBu (decibels 
referenced to 1 microvolt per meter) at their service area boundaries, 
unless all the affected VHF public coast station geographic area 
licensees agree to the higher field strength.

St. Lawrence as far east as the lower exit of the St. Lambert Lock at 
Montreal in the Province of Quebec, Canada,'' but does not include such 
of the connecting and tributary waters as may be specified in the 
Technical Regulations. The Technical Regulations do not include any 
connecting and tributary waters except the St. Mary's River, the St. 
Clair River, Lake St. Clair, the Detroit River and the Welland Canal. A 
vessel to which the Great Lakes Radio Agreement applies and which falls 
into the specific categories by paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this 
section and not excepted by paragraph (d) or (e) of this section must 
comply with this subpart while navigated on the Great Lakes.

Sec. 80.1003  Station required.

    Vessels subject to the Bridge-to-Bridge Act must have a 
radiotelephone installation to enable the vessel to participate in 
navigational communications. This radiotelephone installation must be 
continuously associated with the ship even though a portable 
installation is used. Foreign vessels coming into U.S. waters where a 
bridge-to-bridge station is required may fulfill this requirement by use 
of portable equipment brought a board by the pilot. Non portable 
equipment, when used, must be arranged to facilitate repair. The 
equipment must be protected against vibration, moisture, temperature and 
excessive currents and voltages.


<R05>
Sec. 80.1005  Inspection of station.

    The bridge-to-bridge radiotelephone station will be inspected on 
vessels subject to regular inspections pursuant to the requirements of 
Parts II and III of Title III of the Communications Act, the Safety 
Convention or the Great Lakes Agreement at the time of the regular 
inspection. If after such inspection, the Commission determines that the 
Bridge-to-Bridge Act, the rules of the Commission and the station 
license are met, an endorsement will be made on the appropriate 
document. The validity of the endorsement will run concurrently with the 
period of the regular inspection. Each vessel must carry a certificate 
with a valid endorsement while subject to the Bridge-to-Bridge Act. All 
other bridge-to-bridge stations will be inspected from time to time. An 
inspection of the bridge-to-bridge station on a Great Lakes Agreement 
vessel must normally be made at the same time as the Great Lakes 
Agreement inspection is conducted by a technician holding one of the 
following: a General Radiotelephone Operator License, a GMDSS Radio 
Maintainer's License, a Second Class Radiotelegraph Operator's 
Certificate, or a First Class Radiotelegraph Operator's Certificate. 
Additionally, the technician must not

[[Page 164]]

be the vessel's owner, operator, master, or an employee of any of them. 
Ships subject to the Bridge-to-Bridge Act may, in lieu of an endorsed 
certificate, certify compliance in the station log required by section 
80.409(f).

    (e) An identification code, issued by the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States Program Manager for 
the 406.025 MHz COSPAS/SARSAT satellite system, must be programmed in 
each EPIRB unit to establish a unique identification for each EPIRB 
station. With each marketable EPIRB unit the manufacturer or grantee 
must include a postage pre-paid registration card printed with the EPIRB 
identification code addressed to: NOAA/NESDIS, SARSAT Operations 
Division, E/SP3, Federal Building 4, Washington, DC 20233. The 
registration card must request the owner's name, address, telephone 
number, type of ship, alternate emergency contact and include the 
following statement: ``WARNING--failure to register this EPIRB with NOAA 
before installation could result in a monetary forfeiture being issued 
to the owner.''
    (f) To enhance protection of life and property it is mandatory that 
each 406.025 MHz EPIRB be registered with NOAA before installation and 
that information be kept up-to-date. Therefore, in addition to the 
identification plate or label requirements contained

       Operating Procedures for Distress and Safety Communications


<R05>
Sec. 80.1109  Distress, urgency, and safety communications.

    (a) Distress traffic consists of all messages relating to the 
immediate assistance required by the ship in distress, including search 
and rescue communications and on-scene communications. Distress traffic 
must as far as possible be on the frequencies contained in Sec. 80.1077.

[[Page 184]]

    (b) Urgency and safety communications include: navigational and 
meteorological warnings and urgent information; ship-to-ship safety 
navigation communications; ship reporting communications; support 
communications for search and rescue operations; other urgency and 
safety messages and communications relating to the navigation, movements 
and needs of ships and weather observation messages destined for an 
official meteorological service.
    (c) Intership navigation safety communications are those VHF 
radiotelephone communications conducted between ships for the purpose of 
contributing to the safe movement of ships. The frequency 156.650 MHz is 
used for intership navigation safety communications (see Sec. 80.1077).


<R05>
Sec. 80.1111  Distress alerting.

    (a) The transmission of a distress alert indicates that a mobile 
unit or person is in distress and requires immediate assistance. The 
distress alert is a digital selective call using a distress call format 
in bands used for terrestrial radiocommunication or a distress message 
format, which is relayed through space stations.
    (b) The distress alert must be sent through a satellite either with 
absolute priority in general communication channels or on exclusive 
distress and safety frequencies or, alternatively, on the distress and 
safety frequencies in the MF, HF, and VHF bands using digital selective 
calling.
    (c) The distress alert must be sent only on the authority of the 
person responsible for the ship, aircraft or other vehicle carrying the 
mobile station or the mobile earth station.
    (d) All stations which receive a distress alert transmitted by 
digital selective calling must immediately cease any transmission 
capable of interfering with distress traffic and must continue watch 
until the call has been acknowledged.


<R05>
Sec. 80.1113  Transmission of a distress alert.

    (a) The distress alert must identify the station in distress and its 
position. The distress alert may also contain information regarding the 
nature of the distress, the type of assistance required, the course and 
speed of the mobile unit, the time that this information was recorded 
and any other information which might facilitate rescue.
    (b) The format of distress calls and distress messages must be in 
accordance with CCIR Recommendation 493 as specified in Sec. 80.1101.
    (c) Ship-to-shore distress alerts are used to alert Rescue 
Coordination Centers via coast stations or coast earth stations that a 
ship is in distress. These alerts are based on the use of transmissions 
via satellites (from a ship earth station or a satellite EPIRB) and 
terrestrial services (from ship stations and EPIRBs).
    (d) Ship-to-ship distress alerts are used to alert other ships in 
the vicinity of the ship in distress and are based on the use of digital 
selective calling in the VHF, MF, and HF bands.
    (e) Shore-to-ship distress alert relays are used by a station or 
Rescue Coordination Center to relay information about a ship in distress 
to, as appropriate, all ships, a selected group of ships, or a specific 
ship by satellite and/or terrestrial means. The distress alert relay 
must contain the identification of the mobile unit in distress, its 
position and all other information which might facilitate rescue.


<R05>
Sec. 80.1115  Transmission of a distress alert by a station not itself in distress.

    (a) A station in the mobile or mobile-satellite service which learns 
that a mobile unit is in distress must initiate and transmit a distress 
alert relay in any of the following cases:
    (1) When the mobile unit in distress is not itself in a position to 
transmit the distress alert; or
    (2) When the master or person responsible for the mobile unit not in 
distress or the person responsible for the land station determines that 
further help is necessary.
    (b) A station transmitting a distress alert relay in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section or Sec. 80.1121(c) must indicate that it 
is not itself in distress.

[[Page 185]]


<R05>
Sec. 80.1117  Procedure for receipt and acknowledgement of distress alerts.

    (a) Acknowledgement by digital selective calling of receipt of a 
distress alert in the terrestrial services must comply with CCIR 
Recommendation 541, which is incorporated by reference.
    (b) Acknowledgement through a satellite of receipt of a distress 
alert from a ship earth station must be sent immediately (see 
Sec. 80.1119).
    (c) Acknowledgement by radiotelephony of receipt of a distress alert 
from a ship station or a ship earth station must be given in the 
following form:
    (1) The distress signal MAYDAY;
    (2) The call sign or other identification of the station sending the 
distress message, spoken three times;
    (3) The words THIS IS (or DE spoken as DELTA ECHO in case of 
language difficulties);
    (4) The call sign or other identification of the station 
acknowledging receipt, spoken three times;
    (5) The word RECEIVED (or RRR spoken as ROMEO ROMEO ROMEO in case of 
language difficulties);
    (6) The distress signal MAYDAY.
    (d) The acknowledgement by direct-printing telegraphy of receipt of 
a distress alert from a ship station must be given in the following 
form:
    (1) The distress signal MAYDAY;
    (2) The call sign or other identification of the station sending the 
distress alert;
    (3) The word DE;
    (4) The call sign or other identification of the station 
acknowledging receipt of the distress alert;
    (5) The signal RRR;
    (6) The distress signal MAYDAY.
    (e) The acknowledgement by direct-printing telegraphy of receipt of 
a distress alert from a ship earth station must be given by the coast 
earth station receiving the distress alert by retransmitting the ship 
station identity of the ship transmitting the distress alert.


<R05>
Sec. 80.1119  Receipt and acknowledgement of distress alerts by coast stations and coast earth stations.

    (a) Coast stations that receive a distress alert should defer 
acknowledgement for a short interval so that receipt may be acknowledged 
by a Rescue Coordination Center. Where an acknowledgement is not 
forthcoming within 3 minutes, the coast station in receipt of distress 
alerts must ensure that they are routed to a Rescue Coordination Center 
as soon as possible. Coast stations must provide assistance for distress 
communications when requested to do so by the U.S. Coast Guard. (This 
subpart does not specify any radio watches for coast stations.)
    (b) Coast earth stations in receipt of distress alerts must ensure 
that they are routed as soon as possible to a Rescue Coordination 
Center. Coast earth stations must relay, as soon as possible, an 
acknowledgement of a distress alert from a Rescue Coordination Center.
    (c) Certain messages must be carried without charge, regardless of 
the means by which they are transmitted:
    (1) Distress alert messages;
    (2) Search and rescue coordination messages;
    (3) Medical assistance messages where an imminent danger to life is 
present, or
    (4) Urgent meteorological or navigational danger messages passed in 
the ship-to-shore direction.


<R05>
Sec. 80.1121  Receipt and acknowledgement of distress alerts by ship stations and ship earth stations.

    (a) Ship or ship earth stations that receive a distress alert must, 
as soon as possible, inform the master or person responsible for the 
ship of the contents of the distress alert.
    (b) In areas where reliable communications with one or more coast 
stations are practicable, ship stations in receipt of a distress alert 
should defer acknowledgement for a short interval so that receipt may be 
acknowledged by a coast station.
    (c) Ship stations operating in areas where reliable communications 
with a coast station are not practicable that receive a distress alert 
from a ship station which is, beyond doubt, in their vicinity, must, as 
soon as possible and if appropriately equipped, acknowledge receipt and 
inform a Rescue Coordination Center through a coast station or coast 
earth station (see Sec. 80.1115(a)(2)). However, a ship station 
receiving an

[[Page 186]]

HF distress alert must not acknowledge it but must observe the 
requirements of Sec. 80.1123, and must, if the alert is not acknowledged 
by a coast station within 3 minutes, relay the distress alert.
    (d) A ship station acknowledging receipt of a distress alert in 
accordance with paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section should:
    (1) Acknowledge receipt of the alert by using radiotelephony on the 
distress and safety traffic frequency in the band used for the alert;
    (2) If acknowledgement by radiotelephony of the distress alert 
received on the MF or VHF distress alerting frequency is unsuccessful, 
acknowledge receipt of the distress alert by responding with a digital 
selective call on the appropriate frequency.
    (e) A ship station in receipt of a shore-to-ship distress alert 
relay (see Sec. 80.1113(e)) should establish communication as directed 
and render such assistance as required and appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 80.1123  Watch requirements for ship stations.

    (a) While at sea, all ships must maintain a continuous watch:
    (1) On VHF DSC channel 70, if the ship is fitted with a VHF radio 
installation in accordance with Sec. 80.1085(a)(2);
    (2) On the distress and safety DSC frequency 2187.5 kHz, if the ship 
is fitted with an MF radio installation in accordance with 
Secs. 80.1089(a)(2) or 80.1091(a)(3);
    (3) On the distress and safety DSC frequencies 2187.5 kHz and 8414.5 
kHz also on at least one of the distress and safety DSC frequencies 
4207.5 kHz, 6312 kHz, 12577 kHz, or 16804.5 kHz appropriate to the time 
of day and the geographical position of the ship, if the ship is fitted 
with an MF/HF radio installation in accordance with 
Secs. 80.1091(a)(2)(ii) or 80.1093(a) of this part (this watch may be 
kept by means of a scanning receiver limited to six distress and safety 
DSC frequencies); and
    (4) For satellite shore-to-ship distress alert, if the ship is 
fitted with an INMARSAT ship earth station in accordance with 
Sec. 80.1091(a)(1).
    (b) While at sea, all ships must maintain radio watches for 
broadcasts of maritime safety information on the appropriate frequency 
or frequencies on which such information is broadcast for the area in 
which the ship is navigating.
    (c) Until February 1, 1999, every ship while at sea must maintain, 
when practicable, a continuous listening watch on VHF Channel 16. This 
watch must be kept at the position from which the ship is normally 
navigated or at a position which is continuously manned.
    (d) Until February 1, 1999, every ship required to carry a 
radiotelephone watch receiver must maintain, while at sea, a continuous 
watch on the radiotelephone distress frequency 2182 kHz. This watch must 
be kept at the position from which the ship is normally navigated or at 
a position which is continuously manned.
    (e) On receipt of a distress alert transmitted by use of digital 
selective calling techniques, ship stations must set watch on the 
radiotelephone distress and safety traffic frequency associated with the 
distress and safety calling frequency on which the distress alert was 
received.
    (f) Ship stations with narrow-band direct printing equipment must 
set watch on the narrow-band direct-printing frequency associated with 
the distress alert signal if it indicates that narrow-band direct-
printing is to be used for subsequent distress communications. If 
practicable, they should additionally set watch on the radiotelephone 
frequency associated with the distress alert frequency.


<R05>
Sec. 80.1125  Search and rescue coordinating communications.

    (a) The distress signal consists of the word MAYDAY, pronounced in 
radiotelephony as the French expression ``M'aider''. For distress 
traffic by radiotelephony, when establishing communications, calls must 
be prefixed by the distress signal MAYDAY.
    (b) Error correction techniques, in accordance with CCIR 
Recommendation 625 as specified in Sec. 80.1101, must be used for 
distress traffic by direct-printing telegraphy. All messages must be 
preceded by at least one carriage return, a line feed signal, a letter 
shift

[[Page 187]]

signal and the distress signal MAYDAY.
    (c) Distress communications by direct-printing telegraphy should be 
in the ARQ mode when ships are communicating directly to the Coast Guard 
or other coast stations on channels which they normally guard. Other 
distress communications, including those on simplex channels provided 
for that purpose, should be in the broadcast forward error correction 
mode. The ARQ mode may subsequently be used when it is advantageous to 
do so.
    (d) The Rescue Coordination Center responsible for controlling a 
search and rescue operation will also coordinate the distress traffic 
relating to the incident or may appoint another station to do so.
    (e) The Rescue Coordination Center coordinating distress traffic, 
the unit coordinating search and rescue operations, or the coast station 
involved may impose silence on stations which interfere with that 
traffic. This instruction may be addressed to all stations or to one 
station only, according to circumstances. In either case, the following 
will be used:
    (1) In radiotelephony, the signal SEELONCE MAYDAY, pronounced as the 
French expression ``silence, m'aider'';
    (2) In narrow-band direct-printing telegraphy normally using 
forward-error correcting mode, the signal SILENCE MAYDAY. However, the 
ARQ mode may be used when it is advantageous to do so.
    (f) Until they receive the message indicating that normal working 
may be resumed (see paragraph (h) of this section), all stations which 
are aware of the distress traffic, and which are not taking part in it, 
and which are not in distress, are forbidden to transmit on the 
frequencies in which the distress traffic is taking place.
    (g) Stations following distress traffic that are able to continue 
normal service may do so when the distress traffic is well established 
and on condition that it observes the provisions of paragraph (f) of 
this section and that it does not interfere with distress traffic.
    (h) When distress traffic has ceased on frequencies which have been 
used for distress traffic, the Rescue Coordination Center controlling a 
search and rescue operation must initiate a message for transmission on 
these frequencies indicating that distress traffic has finished.
    (i) In radiotelephony, the message referred to in paragraph (h) of 
this section consists of:
    (1) The distress signal MAYDAY;
    (2) The call ``Hello all stations'' or CQ (spoken as CHARLIE QUEBEC) 
spoken three times;
    (3) The words THIS IS (or DE spoken as DELTA ECHO in the case of 
language difficulties);
    (4) The call sign or other identification of the station sending the 
message;
    (5) The time when the distress situation has ceased;
    (6) The name and call sign of the mobile station which was in 
distress;
    (7) The words SEELONCE FEENEE pronounced as the French words 
``silence fini''
    (j) In direct-printing telegraphy, the message referred to in 
paragraph (h) of this section consists of:
    (1) The distress signal MAYDAY;
    (2) The call CQ;
    (3) The word DE;
    (4) The call sign or other identification of the station sending the 
message;
    (5) The time when distress situation has ceased;
    (6) The name and call sign of the mobil station which was in 
distress; and
    (7) The words SILENCE FINI.

    (a) On-scene communications are those between mobile unit in 
distress and assisting mobile units, and between the mobile units and 
unit coordinating search and rescue operations.
    (b) Control of on-scene communications is the responsibility of the 
unit coordinating search and rescue operations. Simplex communications 
must be used so that all on-scene mobile stations may share relevant 
information concerning the distress incident. If direct-printing 
telegraphy is used, it must be in the forward error-correcting mode in 
accordance with CCIR Recommendation 625 as specified in Sec. 80.1101.

[[Page 188]]

    (c) The preferred frequencies in radiotelephony for on-scene 
communications are 156.8 MHz and 2182 kHz. The frequency 2174.5 kHz may 
also be used for ship-to-ship on-scene communications using narrow-band 
direct-printing telegraphy in the forward error correcting mode in 
accordance with CCIR Recommendation 625 as specified in Sec. 80.1101.
    (d) In addition to 156.8 MHz and 2182 kHz, the frequencies 3023 kHz, 
4125 kHz, 5680 kHz, 123.1 MHz and 156.3 MHz may be used for ship-to-
aircraft on-scene communications.
    (e) The selection or designation of on-scene frequencies is the 
responsibility of the unit coordinating search and rescue operations. 
Normally, once an on-scene frequency is established, a continuous aural 
or teleprinter watch is maintained by all participating on-scene mobile 
units on the selected frequency.


<R05>
Sec. 80.1129  Locating and homing signals.

    (a) Locating signals are radio transmissions intended to facilitate 
the finding of a mobile unit in distress or the location of survivors. 
These signals include those transmitted by searching units and those 
transmitted by the mobile unit in distress, by survival craft, by float-
free EPIRBS, by satellite EPRIBs, and by search and rescue radar 
transponders to assist the searching units.
    (b) Homing singnals are those locating signals which are transmitted 
by mobile units in distress, or by survival craft, for the purpose of 
providing searching units with a signal that can be used to determine 
the bearing to the transmitting stations.
    (c) Locating signals may be transmitted in the following frequency 
bands: 117.975-136 MHz, 121.5 MHz, 156-174 MHz, 406-406.1 MHz, and 9200-
9500 MHz.

must be made on one or more of the distress and safety calling 
frequencies specified in Sec. 80.1077 using digital selective calling 
and the urgency call format. A separate announcement need not be made if 
the urgency message is to be transmitted through the maritime mobile-
satellite service.
    (b) The urgency signal and message must be transmitted on one or 
more of the distress and safety traffic frequencies specified in 
Sec. 80.1077, or via the maritime mobile-satellite service or on other 
frequencies used for this purpose.
    (c) The urgency signal consists of the words PAN PAN. In 
radiotelephony each word of the group must be pronounced as the French 
word ``panne''.
    (d) The urgency call format and the urgency signal indicate that the 
calling station has a very urgent message to transmit concerning the 
safety of a mobile unit or a person.
    (e) In radiotelephony, the urgency message must be preceded by the 
urgency signal, repeated three times, and the identification of the 
transmitting station.
    (f) In narrow-band direct-printing, the urgency message must be 
preceded by the urgency signal and the identification of the 
transmitting station.
    (g) The urgency call format or urgency signal must be sent only on 
the authority of the master or the person responsible for the mobile 
unit carrying the mobile station or mobile earth station.
    (h) The urgency call format or the urgency signal may be transmitted 
by a land station or a coast earth station with the approval of the 
responsible authority.
    (i) When an urgency message which calls for action by the stations 
receiving the message has been transmitted, the station responsible for 
its transmission must cancel it as soon as it knows that action is no 
longer necessary.
    (j) Error correction techniques, in accordance with CCIR 
Recommendation 625 as specified in Sec. 80.1101, must be used for 
urgency messages by direct-printing telegraphy. All messages must be 
preceded by at least one carriage return, a line feed signal, a letter 
shift signal and the urgency signal PAN PAN.

[[Page 189]]

    (k) Urgency communications by direct-printing telegraphy should be 
in the ARQ mode when communicating directly to the Coast Guard or other 
coast stations on channels which they normally guard. Other distress 
communications, including those on simplex channels provided for that 
purpose, should be in the broadcast forward error correction mode. The 
ARQ mode may subsequently be used when it is advantageous to do so.


<R05>

frequencies specified in Sec. 80.1077 using digital selective calling 
techniques. A separate announcement need not be made if the message is 
to be transmitted through the maritime mobile-satellite service.
    (b) The safety signal and message must normally be transmitted on 
one or more of the distress and safety traffic frequencies specified in 
Sec. 80.1077, or via the maritime mobile satellite service or on other 
frequencies used for this purpose.
    (c) The safety signal consists of the word SECURITE. In 
radiotelephony, it is pronounced as in French.
    (d) The safety call format or the safety signal indicates that the 
calling station has an important navigational or meteorological warning 
to transmit.
    (e) In radiotelephony, the safety message must be preceded by the 
safety signal, repeated three times, and the identification of the 
transmitting station.
    (f) In narrow-band direct-printing, the safety message must be 
preceded by the safety signal and the identification of the transmitting 
station.
    (g) Error correction techniques, in accordance with CCIR

interest equity, or outstanding stock, or outstanding voting stock shall 
be attributed as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) through (c)(2)(ix) 
of this section.
    (iii) Stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any 
person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, to any person 
who has the sole power to sell such stock, and, to any person who has 
the right to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. 
If the trustee has a familial, personal, or extra-trust business 
relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the grantor or 
beneficiary, as appropriate, will be attributed with the stock interests 
held in trust.
    (iv) Non-voting stock shall be attributed as an interest in the 
issuing entity.
    (v) Limited partnership interests shall be attributed to limited 
partners and shall be calculated according to both the percentage of 
equity paid in and the percentage of distribution of profits and losses.
    (vi) Officers and directors of an entity shall be considered to have 
an attributable interest in the entity. The officers and directors of an 
entity that controls a licensee or applicant shall be considered to have 
an attributable interest in the licensee or applicant.
    (vii) Ownership interests that are held indirectly by any party 
through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by 
successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in 
the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution 
benchmark to the resulting product, except that if the ownership 
percentage for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent 
or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 
percent interest.
    (viii) Any person who manages the operations of an applicant or 
licensee pursuant to a management agreement shall be considered to have 
an attributable interest in such applicant or licensee if such person, 
or its affiliate pursuant to Sec. 1.2110(b)(4) of this chapter, has 
authority to make decisions or otherwise engage in practices or 
activities that determine, or significantly influence:
    (A) The nature or types of services offered by such an applicant or

Sec. 87.141  Modulation requirements.

    (a) When A3E emission is used, the modulation percentage must not 
exceed 100 percent. This requirement does not apply to emergency locator 
transmitters or survival craft transmitters.
    (b) A double sideband full carrier amplitude modulated 
radiotelephone transmitter with rated carrier power output exceeding 10 
watts must be capable of automatically preventing modulation in excess 
of 100 percent.
    (c) If any licensed radiotelephone transmitter causes harmful 
interference to any authorized radio service because of excessive 
modulation, the Commission will require the use of the transmitter to be 
discontinued until it is rendered capable of automatically preventing 
modulation in excess of 100 percent.
    (d) Single sideband transmitters must be able to operate in the 
following modes:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                        Level N(dB) of the carrier with
             Carrier mode                respect to peak envelope power
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full carrier (H3E)...................  O<ls-thn-eq>N<ls-thn-eq>-6.
Suppressed carrier (J3E).............  Aircraft stations N<-26[gE]
                                       Aeronautical stations N<-40.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) Each frequency modulated transmitter operating in the band 72.0-
76.0 MHz must have a modulation limiter.
    (f) Each frequency modulated transmitter equipped with a modulation 
limiter must have a low pass filter between the modulation limiter and 
the modulated stage. At audio frequencies between 3 kHz and 15 kHz, the 
filter must have an attenuation greater than the attenuation at 1 kHz by 
at least 40 log<INF>10</INF> (f/3) db where ``f'' is the frequency in 
kilohertz. Above 15 kHz, the attenuation must be at least 28 db greater 
than the attenuation at 1 kHz.
    (g) Except that symmetric side bands are not required, the 
modulation characteristics for ELTs must be in accordance with 
specifications contained in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
Technical Standard Order (TSO) Document TSO-C91a titled ``Emergency 
Locator Transmitter (ELT) Equipment'' dated April 29, 1985. TSO-C91a is 
incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a). TSO-C91a 
may be obtained from the Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation 
Administration, Office of Airworthiness, 800 Independence Avenue SW., 
Washington DC 20591.
    (h) ELTs must use A3X emission and may use A3E or NON emissions on 
an optional basis while transmitting. Each transmission of a synthesized 
or recorded voice message from an ELT must be preceded by the words 
``this is a recording''; transmission of A3E or

[[Page 212]]

NON emission must not exceed 90 seconds; and any transmission of A3E or 
NON emissions must be followed by at least three minutes of A3X 
emission.
    (i) ELTs manufactured on or after October 1, 1988, must have a 
clearly defined carrier frequency distinct from the modulation sidebands 
for the mandatory emission, A3X, and, if used, the A3E or NON emissions. 
On 121.500 MHz at least thirty per cent of the total power emitted 
during any transmission cycle with or without modulation must be 
contained within plus or minus 30 Hz of the carrier frequency. On 
243.000 MHz at least thirty percent of the total power emitted during 
any transmission cycle with or without modulation must be contained 
within plus or minus 60 Hz of the carrier frequency. Additionally, if 
the type of emission is changed during transmission, the carrier 
frequency must not shift more than plus or minus 30 Hz on 121.500 MHz 
and not more than plus or minus 60Hz on 243.000 MHz. The long term 
stability of the carrier frequency must comply with the requirements in 
Sec. 87.133 of this part.
    (j) Transmitters used at Aircraft earth stations must employ BPSK 
for transmission rates up to and including 2400 bits per second, and 
QPSK for higher rates.

Sec. 87.143  Transmitter control requirements.

    (a) Each transmitter must be installed so that it is not accessible 
to, or capable of being operated by persons other than those authorized 
by the licensee.
    (b) Each station must be provided with a control point at the 
location of the transmitting equipment, unless otherwise specifically 
authorized. Except for aeronautical enroute stations governed by 
paragraph (e) of this section, a control point is the location at which 
the radio operator is stationed. It is the position at which the 
transmitter(s) can immediately be turned off.
    (c) Applicants for additional control points at aeronautical 
advisory (unicom) stations must specify the location of each proposed 
control point.
    (d) Except for aeronautical enroute stations governed by paragraph 
(f) of this section, the control point must have the following 
facilities installed:
    (1) A device that indicates when the transmitter is radiating or 
when the transmitter control circuits have been switched on. This 
requirement does not apply to aircraft stations;
    (2) Aurally monitoring of all transmissions originating at dispatch 
points;
    (3) A way to disconnect dispatch points from the transmitter; and
    (4) A way to turn off the transmitter.
    (e) A dispatch point is an operating position subordinate to the 
control point. Dispatch points may be installed without authorization 
from the Commission, and dispatch point operators are not required to be 
licensed.
    (f) In the aeronautical enroute service, the control point for an 
automatically controlled enroute station is the computer facility which 
controls the transmitter. Any computer controlled transmitter must be 
equipped to automatically shut down after 3 minutes of continuous 
transmission of an unmodulated carrier.


<R05>
Sec. 87.145  Acceptability of transmitters for licensing.

    (a) Each transmitter must be certificated for use in these services, 
except as listed in paragraph (c) of this section. However, aircraft 
stations which transmit on maritime mobile frequencies must use 
transmitters certificated for use in ship stations in accordance with 
part 80 of this chapter. Certification under part 80 is not required for 
aircraft earth stations transmitting on maritime mobile-satellite 
frequencies. Such stations must be certificated under part 87.
    (b) Some radio equipment installed on air carrier aircraft must meet 
the requirements of the Commission and the requirements of the FAA. The 
FAA requirements may be obtained from the FAA, Aircraft Maintenance 
Division, 800 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20591.
    (c) The equipment listed below is exempted from certification. The 
operation of transmitters which have not been certificated must not 
result in harmful interference due to the failure

[[Page 213]]

of those transmitters to comply with technical standards of this 
subpart.
    (1) Development or Civil Air Patrol transmitters.
    (2) Flight test station transmitters for limited periods where 
justified.
    (3) U.S. Government transmitters furnished in the performance of a 
U.S. Government contract if the use of certificated equipment would 
increase the cost of the contract or if the transmitter will be 
incorporated in the finished product. However, such equipment must meet 
the technical standards contained in this subpart.
    (4) ELTs verified in accordance with Sec. 87.147(e).
    (5) Signal generators when used as radionavigation land test 
stations (MTF).
    (d) Aircraft earth stations must correct their transmit frequencies 
for Doppler effect relative to the satellite. The transmitted signal may 
not deviate more than 335 Hz from the desired transmit frequency. (This 
is a root sum square error which assumes zero error for the received 
ground earth station signal and includes the AES transmit/receive 
frequency reference error and the AES automatic frequency control 
residual errors.) The applicant must attest that the equipment provides 
adequate Doppler effect compensation and where applicable, that 
measurements have been made that demonstrate compliance. Submission of 
data demonstrating compliance is not required unless requested by the 
Commission.

[63 FR 36607, July 7, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 87.147  Authorization of equipment.

    (a) Certification may be requested by following the procedures in 
part 2 of this chapter. Aircraft transmitters must meet the requirements 
over an ambient temperature range of -20 degrees to +50 degrees Celsius.
    (b) ELTs manufactured after October 1, 1988, must meet the output 
power characteristics contained in Sec. 87.141(i) when tested in 
accordance with the Signal Enhancement Test contained in subpart N, part 
2 of this chapter. A report of the measurements must be submitted with 
each application for certification. ELTs that meet the output power 
characteristics of the section must have a permanent label prominently 
displayed on the outer casing state, ``Meets FCC Rule for improved 
satellite detection.'' This label, however, must not be placed on the 
equipment without authorization to do so by the Commission. Application 
for such authorization may be made either by submission of a new 
application for certification accompanied by the required fee and all 
information and test data required by parts 2 and 87 of this chapter or, 
for ELTs approved prior to October 1, 1988, a letter requesting such 
authorization, including appropriate test data and a showing that all 
units produced under the original equipment authorization comply with 
the requirements of this paragraph without change to the original 
circuitry.
    (c) An applicant for a station license may request certification for 
an individual transmitter by following the procedure in part 2 of this 
chapter. Such a transmitter will be individually certified and so noted 
on the station license.
    (d) An applicant for certification of equipment intended for 
transmission in any of the frequency bands listed in paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section must notify the FAA of the filing of a certification 
application. The letter of notification must be mailed to: FAA, Spectrum 
Engineering Division, 800 Independence Ave. SW., Washington, DC 20591 no 
later than the date of filing of the application with the Commission.
    (1) The notification must describe the equipment, give the 
manufacturer's identification, antenna characteristics, rated output 
power, emission type and characteristics, the frequency or frequencies 
of operation, and essential receiver characteristics if protection is 
required.
    (2) The certification application must include a copy of the 
notification letter to the FAA. The Commission will not act for 21 days 
after receipt of the application to afford the FAA an opportunity to 
comment. If the FAA objects to the application for equipment 
authorization, it should mail its objection with a showing that the 
equipment is incompatible with the National Airspace System to: Office 
of Engineering and Technology Laboratory, Authorization and Evaluation 
Division, 7435 Oakland Mills Rd., Columbia, MD

[[Page 214]]

21046. If the Commission receives such an objection, the Commission will 
consider the FAA showing before taking final action on the application.
    (3) The frequency bands are as follows:

74.800 MHz to 75.200 MHz
108.000 MHz to 137.000 MHz
328.600 MHz to 335.400 MHz

the airport operator and all aviation services organizations may be 
licensed to operate a unicom on the assigned frequency.
    (c) At an airport where only one unicom may be licensed, when the 
Commission believes that the unicom

[[Page 226]]

has been abandoned or has ceased operation, another unicom may be 
licensed on an interim basis pending final determination of the status 
of the original unicom. An applicant for an interim license must notify 
the present licensee and must comply with the notice requirements of 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) An applicant for a unicom license, renewal or modification of 
frequency assignment at an airport which does not have a control tower, 
RCO or FAA flight service station must notify in writing the owner of 
the airport and all aviation service organizations located at the 
airport. The notice must include the applicant's name and address, the 
name of the airport and a statement that the applicant intends to file 
an application with the Commission for a unicom. The notice must be 
given within the ten days preceding the filing of the application with 
the Commission. Each applicant must certify upon application that either 
notice has been given and include the date of notification, or notice is 
not required because the applicant owns the airport and there are no 
organizations that should be notified.

    (4) An automated unicom may not provide weather information at an 
airport that has an operational, FAA-certified, automatic weather 
facility, unless the unicom itself is certified by the FAA.
    (5) If weather information is provided by an automated unicom:
    (i) weather sensors must be placed in order to adequately represent 
the weather conditions at the airport(s) to be served;
    (ii) the weather information must be proceeded by the word 
``advisory;''
    (iii) the phrase ``automated advisory'' must be included when the 
weather information was gathered by real-time sensors or within the last 
minute; and,
    (iv) the time and date of the last update must be included when the 
weather information was not gathered within the last minute.
    (c) Only one automated unicom may be operated at an uncontrolled 
airport.

[[Page 227]]

Prior to the operation of an automated unicom at an airport with more 
than one unicom licensee, all of the licensees at that airport must sign 
a letter of agreement stating which licensee(s) control the automated 
unicom operations, and, if control is to be shared among several 
operators, how that control will be divided or scheduled. The original 
or a copy of the letter of agreement must be kept with each licensees' 
station records. Within 90 days of the date upon which a new unicom 
operator is licensed at an airport where more than one unicom is 
authorized, and an automated unicom is being operated, an amended letter 
of agreement that includes the new licensee's signature must be signed 
or automated unicom operations must cease.

Sec. 87.265  Administrative communications.

    Domestic VHF aeronautical enroute stations authorized to use A9W 
emission on any frequency listed in Sec. 87.263(a)(1) or 
Sec. 87.263(a)(3) may transmit digital administrative communications on 
a secondary basis, in addition to the operational and control 
communications routinely permitted under Sec. 87.261(a) above. Such 
secondary administrative communications must directly relate to the 
business of a participating aircraft operator in providing travel and 
transportation services to the flying public or to the travel, 
transportation or scheduling activities of the aircraft operator itself. 
Stations transmitting administrative communications must provide 
absolute priority for operational control and other safety 
communications by means of an automatic priority control system.

    (d)(1) Frequencies in the bands 1435-1525 MHz and 2360-2390 MHz are 
assigned primarily for telemetry and telecommand operations associated 
with the flight testing of manned or unmanned aircraft and missiles, or 
their major components. The band 1525-1535 MHz is also available for 
these purposes on a secondary basis. In the band 2320-2345 MHz, the 
mobile and radiolocation services are allocated on a primary basis until 
a Broadcast-Satellite (sound) service has been brought into use in such 
a manner as to affect or be affected by the mobile and radiolocation 
services in those service areas. Permissible uses of these bands include 
telemetry and telecommand transmissions associated with the launching 
and reentry into the earth's atmosphere as well as any incidental 
orbiting prior to reentry of manned or unmanned objects undergoing 
flight tests. In the 1435-1530 MHz band, the following frequencies are 
shared with flight telemetry mobile stations: 1444.5, 1453.5, 1501.5, 
1515.5, 1524.5 and 1525.5 MHz. In the 2320-2345 MHz and 2360-2390 MHz 
bands, the following frequencies may be assigned on a co-equal basis for 
telemetry and associated telecommand operations in fully operational or 
expendable and re-usable launch vehicles whether or not such operations 
involve flight testing: 2332.5, 2364.5, 2370.5 and 2382.5 MHz. In the 
2360-2390 MHz band, all other telemetry and telecommand uses are 
secondary to the above stated launch vehicle uses.
    (2) The authorized bandwidths for stations operating in the bands 
1435.0-1525.0 MHz, 1525.0-1535.0 MHz and 2310.0-2390.0 MHz are normally 
1, 3 or 5 MHz. Applications for greater bandwidths will be considered in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 87.135. Each assignment will be 
centered on a frequency between 1435.5 MHz and 1534.5 MHz or between 
2310.5 MHz and 2389.5 MHz, with 1 MHz channel spacing.
    (e) 121.500 MHz: Emergency and distress only.

[[Page 236]]

Aviation Services during any national or local emergency situation 
constituting a threat to national security or safety of life and 
property. This subpart is consistent with the Aeronautical Emergency 
Communications System Plan for all Aviation Services licensees of the 
Commission which was developed pursuant to sections 1, 4(o), 301 and 303 
of the Communications Act, and Executive Order 11490, as amended. This 
Plan provides for emergency communications to meet the requirements of 
the Plan for the Security Control of Air Traffic and Air Navigation Aids 
(SCATANA), Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF), War Air Service Program 
(WASP) and, where applicable, State and Regional Disaster Airlift 
Planning (SARDA).


<R05>
Sec. 87.395  Plan for the Security Control of Air Traffic and Air Navigation Aids (Short Title: SCATANA).

    (a) The Plan for the Security Control of Air Traffic and Air 
Navigation Aids (SCATANA) is promulgated in furtherance of the Federal 
Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, the Communications Act and Executive 
Order 11490, as amended. SCATANA defines the responsibilities of the 
Commission for the security control of non-Federal air navigation aids.
    (b) Under the responsibilities defined in SCATANA, an FCC Support 
Plan for the Security Control of Non-Federal Air Navigation Aids has 
been developed by the Commission. The FCC Support Plan defines 
responsibilities, procedures, and instructions in consonance with 
SCATANA which will effect control of non-Federal air navigation aids 
when SCATANA is implemented. It permits the use of such navigation aids 
by aircraft of military and civil agencies when SCATANA is implemented. 
The FCC Support Plan highlights those parts of SCATANA which deal 
specifically with non-Federal air navigation aids. SCATANA and the FCC 
Support Plan apply to radionavigation stations authorized by the 
Commission in the following manner:
    (1) All licensees are subject to restrictions imposed by appropriate 
military authorities pursuant to SCATANA and the FCC Support Plan when 
an Air Defense Emergency or Defense Emergency exists or is imminent. The 
restrictions will be imposed through FAA Air Route Traffic Control 
Centers (ARTCCs).
    (2) All licensees of aeronautical radionavigation (VOR/DME, ILS, 
MLS, LF and MF non-directional beacons) stations will comply with 
SCATANA implementation instructions from FAA ARTCCs as follows:
    (i) Shut down the above navigation aids as directed. These 
instructions will permit time to land or disperse airborne aircraft, and 
will permit extension of time when the air traffic situation dictates.
    (ii) Shut down as soon as possible stations which require more than 
five minutes control time, unless directed otherwise or unless such 
stations are essential for the handling of existing air traffic.
    (iii) Operate aeronautical radionavigation stations to ensure that 
required stations, as indicated in flight plans, will be available for 
authorized aircraft flights.
    (3) Licensees of aeronautical radionavigation stations will be 
notified of the reduction or removal of SCATANA restrictions by FAA 
ARTCCs when notice of the termination is issued.
    (4) Licensees of aeronautical radionavigation stations may 
voluntarily participate in SCATANA tests as requested by an ARTCC. 
SCATANA testing must not interrupt the normal service of non-Federal air 
navigation aids.


<R05>
Sec. 87.397  Emergency operations.

    (a) The licensee of any land station in the Aviation services, 
during a local emergency involving the safety of life and property may 
communicate in a manner other than that specified in the license (See 
Sec. 87.395). Such emergency operations may include operation at other 
locations or with equipment not specified in the license or by 
unlicensed personnel provided that:
    (1) Such operations are under the control and supervision of the 
station licensee,
    (2) The emergency use is discontinued as soon as practicable upon 
termination of the emergency,
    (3) In no event shall any station transmit on frequencies other than 
or

[[Page 237]]

with power in excess of that specified in the license,
    (4) The details of the emergency must be retained with the station 
license, and
    (5) At a controlled airport these communications must be coordinated 
with the FAA.
    (b) The unicom frequencies listed in subpart G may also be used for 
communications with private aircraft engaged in organized civil defense 
activities in preparation for, during an enemy attack or immediately 
after an enemy attack. When used for these purposes, unicoms may be 
moved from place to place or operated at unspecified locations, except 
at landing areas served by other unicoms or control towers.
    (c) In any case in which a license for unattended operation has been 
granted, the Commission may at any time, for national defense, modify 
the license.

          Subpart Q--Stations in the Radiodetermination Service


<R05>
Sec. 87.471  Scope of service.

    Stations in the aeronautical radiodetermination service provide 
radionavigation and radiolocation services.
    (a) Transmission by radionavigation land stations must be limited to 
aeronautical navigation, including obstruction warning.
    (b) Radionavigation land test stations are used for the testing and 
calibration of aircraft navigational aids and associated equipment. When 
used as radionavigation land test stations (MTF) signal generators must 
be licensed as radionavigation land test stations (MTF). Transmission 
must be limited to cases when radiation is necessary and there is no 
alternative.
    (c) Transmissions by emergency locator transmitter (ELT) test 
stations must be limited to necessary testing of ELTs and to training 
operations related to the use of such transmitters.

[53 FR 28940, Aug. 1, 1988, as amended at 58 FR 67696, Dec. 22, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 87.473  Supplemental eligibility.

    (a) Licenses for radionavigation land test stations (MTF) will be 
granted only to applicants engaged in the development, manufacture or 
maintenance of aircraft radionavigation equipment. Licenses for 
radionavigation land test stations (OTF) will be granted only to 
applicants who agree to establish the facility at an airport for the use 
of the public.
    (b) Licenses for ELT test stations will be granted only to 
applicants to train personnel in the operation and location of ELTs, or 
for testing related to the manufacture or design of ELTs.

Sec. 87.475  Frequencies.

    (a) Frequency coordination. The Commission will assign frequencies 
to radionavigation land stations and radionavigation land test stations 
after coordination with the FAA. The applicant must notify the 
appropriate Regional Office of the FAA prior to submission to the 
Commission of an application for a new station or for modification of an 
existing station to change frequency, power, location or emission. Each 
application must include the FAA Regional Office notified and date of 
notification.
    (b) Frequencies available for radionavigation land stations. (1) 
LORAN-C is a long range navigation system which operates in the 90-110 
kHz band.
    (2) Radiobeacon stations enable an aircraft station to determine 
bearing or direction in relation to the radiobeacon station. 
Radiobeacons operate in the bands 190-285 kHz; 325-435; and 510-525 kHz.
    (3) Aeronautical marker beacon stations radiate a vertical 
distinctive pattern on 75 MHz which provides position information to 
aircraft.
    (4) The following table lists the specific frequencies in the 
108.100-111.950 MHz band which are assignable to localizer stations with 
simultaneous radiotelephone channels and their associated glide path 
station frequency from the 328.600-335.400 MHz band.

Sec. 87.479  Harmful interference to radionavigation land stations.

    (a) Military or other Government stations have been authorized to 
establish wide-band systems using frequency-hopping spread spectrum 
techniques in the 960-1215 MHz band. Authorization for a Joint Tactical 
Information Distribution Systems (JTIDS) has been permitted on the basis 
of non-interference to the established aeronautical radionavigation 
service in this band. In order to accommodate the requirements for the 
system within the band, restrictions are imposed. Transmissions will be 
automatically prevented if:
    (1) The frequency-hopping mode fails to distribute the JTIDS 
spectrum uniformly across the band;
    (2) The radiated pulse varies from the specified width of 6.4 
microseconds <plus-minus>5%;
    (3) The energy radiated within <plus-minus>7 MHz of 1030 and 1090 
MHz exceeds a level of 60 dB below the peak of the JTIDS spectrum as 
measured in a 300 kHz bandwidth. The JTIDS will be prohibited from 
transmitting if the time slot duty factor exceeds a 20 percent duty 
factor for any single user and a 40 percent composite duty factor for 
all JTIDS emitters in a geographic area.
    (b) If radionavigation systems operating in the 960-1215 MHz band 
experience interference or unexplained loss of equipment performance, 
the situation must be reported immediately to the nearest office of the 
FAA, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, 
Washington, DC 20504, or the nearest Federal Communications Commission 
field office. The following information must be provided to the extent 
available:
    (1) Name, call sign and category of station experiencing the 
interference;
    (2) Date and time of occurrence;

[[Page 243]]

    (3) Geographical location at time of occurrence;
    (4) Frequency interfered with;
    (5) Nature of interference; and
    (6) Other particulars.

for radiobeacon service and capable of transmitting by self-actuating 
means;
    (2) The emissions of the transmitter must be continuously monitored 
by a licensed operator, or by a direct positive automatic monitor, 
supplemented by aural monitoring at suitable intervals;
    (3) If as a result of aural monitoring it is determined that a 
deviation from the terms of the station license has occurred, the 
transmitters must be disabled immediately by a properly authorized 
person. If automatic monitoring is used, the monitor must insure that 
the operation of the transmitter meets the license terms or is disabled;
    (4) A properly authorized person must be able to reach the 
transmitter and disable it in a reasonable amount of time, so as not to 
adversely affect life or property in the air;
    (5) The equipment must be inspected at least every 180 days. Results 
of inspections must be kept in the station maintenance records;
    (6) The transmitter is not operable by or accessible to, other than 
authorized persons;
    (7) The transmitter is in a remote location.

    Prior to submitting an application, each applicant must notify the 
nearest appropriate FAA Regional Spectrum Management Office. Each 
application must be accompanied by a statement showing the name of the 
FAA Regional Office and date notified. The Commission will assign the 
frequency. Normally, frequencies available for air traffic control 
operations set forth in subpart E will be assigned to an AWOS, ASOS, or 
to an ATIS. When a licensee has entered into an agreement with the FAA 
to operate the same station as both an AWOS and as an ATIS, or as an 
ASOS and an ATIS, the same frequency will be used in both modes of 
operation.

    (g) Former public correspondence working channels in the maritime 
VHF (156-162 MHz) band allocated for public safety use in 33 inland 
Economic Areas.
    (1) We define service areas in the marine VHF (156-162 MHz) band by 
forty-two geographic areas called VHF Public Coast Service Areas 
(VPCSAs). See Sec. 80.371(c)(1)(ii) of this chapter (Public 
correspondence frequencies). VPCSAs are based on, and composed of one or 
more of, the U.S. Department of Commerce's 172 Economic Areas (EAs). See 
60 Fed Reg. 13114 (Mar. 10, 1995). You may inspect and copy maps of the 
EAs and VPCSAs at the FCC Reference Center, Room CY A-257, 445 12th St., 
S.W., Washington, DC 20554. These maps and data are also available on 
the FCC website at http://www.fcc.gov/oet/info/maps/areas/. We number 
public correspondence channels in the maritime VHF (156-162 MHz) band as 
channels 24 to 28 and channels 84 to 88. Each channel number represents 
a channel pair. See Sec. 80.371(c) of this chapter.
    (2) We allocated two contiguous 25 kHz public correspondence

    Source: 62 FR 18874, Apr. 17, 1997, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 90.31  Scope.

    The Industrial/Business Radio Pool covers the licensing of the radio 
communications of entities engaged in commercial activities, engaged in 
clergy activities, operating educational, philanthropic, or 
ecclesiastical institutions, or operating hospitals, clinics, or medical 
associations. Rules as to eligibility for licensing, frequencies 
available, permissible communications and classes and number of 
stations, and any special requirements are set forth in the following 
sections.


<R05>
Sec. 90.33  General eligibility.

    (a) In addition to the eligibility shown in the Industrial/Business 
Pool, eligibility is also provided for any corporation proposing to 
furnish nonprofit radiocommunication service to its parent corporation, 
to another subsidiary of the same parent, or to its own subsidiary. This 
corporate eligibility is not subject to the cooperative use provision of 
Sec. 90.179.
    (b) Eligibility is also provided for a nonprofit corporation or 
association

[[Page 285]]

that is organized for the purpose of furnishing a radiocommunications 
service to persons who meet the eligibility requirements of the 
Industrial/Business Pool. Such use is subject to the cooperative use 
provisions of Sec. 90.179.


<R05>
Sec. 90.35  Industrial/Business Pool.

    (a) Eligibility. Persons primarily engaged in any of the following 
activities are eligible to hold authorizations in the Industrial/
Business Pool to provide commercial mobile radio service as defined in 
part 20 of this chapter or to operate stations for transmission of 
communications necessary to such activities of the licensee:
    (1) The operation of a commercial activity;
    (2) The operation of educational, philanthropic, or ecclesiastical 
institutions;
    (3) Clergy activities; or
    (4) The operation of hospitals, clinics, or medical associations.
    (b) Industrial/Business Pool frequencies. (1) The following table 
indicates frequencies available for assignment to Industrial/Business 
Pool stations, together with the class of station(s) to which they are 
normally assigned, the specific assignment limitations which are 
explained in paragraph (b) of this section, and the certified frequency 
coordinator for each frequency:
    (2) Unless otherwise specified, coordination of frequencies in the 
Industrial/Business pool must be done in accordance with the following:
    (i) Unless specified elsewhere in this part, frequencies without any 
coordinator specified in the Coordinator column of paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section may be coordinated by any frequency coordinator certified 
in the Industrial/Business Pool.
    (ii) A letter symbol in the Coordinator column of the frequency 
table in paragraph (b)(3) of this section designates the mandatory 
certified frequency coordinator for the associated frequency in the 
table. However, any coordinator certified in the Industrial/Business 
Pool may coordinate applications on such frequencies provided the prior 
written consent of the designated coordinator is obtained. Frequencies 
for which two coordinators are listed may be coordinated by either of 
the listed coordinators.
    (iii) Applications for new or modified facilities on frequencies 
shared prior to radio service consolidation by the former Manufacturers 
Radio Service, the Forest Products Radio Service, the Power Radio 
Service, the Petroleum Radio Service, the Motor Carrier Radio Service, 
the Railroad Radio Service and the Automobile Emergency Radio Service 
may be coordinated by any certified Industrial/Business Pool 
coordinator. However, in the event that the interference contour of a 
proposed station would overlap the service contour of an existing 
station licensed on one of these previously shared frequencies, the 
written concurrence of the coordinator associated with the industry for 
which the existing station license was issued, or the written 
concurrence of the licensee of the existing station, shall be obtained. 
For the purposes of this Sec. 90.35, the service contour for UHF 
stations is the 39 dBu contour; and the interference contour for UHF 
stations is the 21 dBu contour; the service contour for VHF stations is 
the 37 dBu contour; and the interference contour for VHF stations is the 
19 dBu contour.
    (iv) The letter symbols listed in the Coordinator column of the 
frequency table in paragraph (b)(3) of this section refer to specific 
frequency coordinators as follows:

IP--Petroleum Coordinator
IW--Power Coordinator
LR--Railroad Coordinator
LA--Automobile Emergency Coordinator

    (3) Frequencies.

mobile facilities authorized to use other frequencies available for 
itinerant operation in the Industrial/Business Pool. All such use of 
these frequencies for fixed systems is limited to locations 161 or more 
km. (100 mi.) from the center of any urbanized area of 200,000 or more 
population, except that the distance may be 120 km. (75 mi.) if the 
output power does not exceed 20 watts. All such fixed systems are 
limited to a maximum of two frequencies and must employ directional 
antennas with a front-to-back ratio of at least 15 dB. The centers of 
urbanized areas of 200,000 or more population are determined from the 
appendix, page 226, of the U.S. Commerce publication, ``Air Line 
Distance Between Cities in the United States.'' Urbanized areas of 
200,000 or more population are defined in the U.S. Census of Population, 
1960, volume 1, table 23, page 1-50.
    (59) This frequency may be assigned primarily for stations used for 
the purpose of controlling slave locomotives that are placed within a 
train to assist the lead locomotive by providing, among other functions, 
auxiliary starting, pulling, and braking actions. Additionally, on a 
secondary basis this frequency may be assigned for remote control of all 
types of locomotives and, within a railroad yard or terminal area, for 
remote control of cab indicator devices placed with a locomotive to give 
visual signals to the operator of the locomotive. (A1, A2, F1 or F2 
emissions may be authorized.)
    (60)(i) This frequency is available for voice or non-voice 
communications concerned with cargo handling from a dock or cargo 
handling facility, a vessel alongside the dock, or cargo handling 
facility. The effective radiated power (ERP) shall not exceed 2 watts. 
Mobile relay stations may be temporarily installed on vessels located at 
or in the vicinity of a dock or cargo handling facility. The center of 
the radiating system of the mobile relay shall be located no more than 3 
meters (10 feet) above the vessel's highest working dock.
    (ii) This frequency is also available for low power non-cargo 
handling operations, both voice and non-voice, on a secondary basis to 
cargo handling communications. This frequency will not be assigned for 
non-cargo handling operations at temporary locations.

condition; or
    (E) Confirmation of status, or that an operation or correction has 
been accomplished.
    (ii) The maximum duration of any one non-voice signal may not exceed 
2 seconds and shall not be transmitted more than three times.
    (iii) Systems employing automatic interrogation shall be limited to 
non-voice techniques and shall not be activated for this purpose more 
than 10 seconds out of any 60-second period. This 10-second frame 
includes both transmit and response times.
    (iv) The bandwidth shall not exceed that authorized to the licensee 
for the primary operation on the frequency concerned.
    (v) Frequency loading resulting from the use of secondary signaling 
will not be considered in whole or in part as a justification for 
authorizing additional frequencies in the licensee's mobile system.
    (vi) A mobile service frequency may not be used exclusively for 
secondary signaling.
    (vii) The output power shall not exceed 30 watts (at the remote 
site).
    (viii) A1D, A2D, F1D, or F2D emission may be authorized.
    (ix) The transmitter shall be designed to deactivate automatically 
after 3 minutes of continuous carrier radiation.
    (x) Operational fixed stations authorized under this paragraph are 
exempt from the requirements of Secs. 90.137(b), 90.429(d), 90.425 and 
90.433.
    (xi) On these frequencies, base, mobile relay or mobile stations may 
transmit secondary tone or impulse signals to receivers, as provided in 
this section.
    (65) Licensees providing a central station commercial protection 
service may communicate with police or fire stations, or vehicles, on 
this frequency, and may install licensed transmitting units which 
operate on this frequency at police or fire stations, or in police or 
fire vehicles, if the frequency's primary use is in a base/mobile system 
for a central station commercial protection service.
    (66) This frequency may be assigned only to persons rendering a 
central station commercial protection service, which is defined in 
paragraph (c)(63) of

[[Page 318]]

this section, within the service area of the radio station utilizing the 
frequency.
    (67) Use of this frequency is on a secondary basis and subject to 
the provisions of Sec. 90.267 (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(7).
    (68) Maximum permissible power output for stations on airports is 3 
watts. Each station authorized on this frequency will be classified and 
licensed as a mobile station. Any units of such a station, however, may 
provide the functions of a base station on a secondary basis to mobile 
service operations provided that the vertical separation between the 
control point or ground level and the center of the radiating portion of 
the antenna of any units so used shall not exceed 8 m (25 ft.).
    (69) This frequency may be used on a secondary, non-interference 
basis by a hospital or health care institution holding a license to 
operate a radio station under this part to operate a medical radio 
telemetry device with an output power not to exceed 20 milliwatts 
without specific authorization from the Commission.
    (70) Subpart L of this part contains rules for assignment of 
frequencies in the 470-512 MHz band.
    (71) Subpart S of this part contains rules for assignment of 
frequencies in the 806-821/851-866 and 896-901/935-940 MHz bands.
    (72) Assignment of frequencies above 928 MHz for operational-fixed 
stations is governed by part 101 of this chapter.
    (73) Frequencies in this band are available only for one-way paging 
operations in accordance with Sec. 90.494.
    (74) Available only on a shared basis with stations in other 
services, and subject to no protection from interference due to the 
operation of industrial, scientific, or medical (ISM) devices. In the 
2483.5-2500 MHz band, no applications for new or modification to 
existing stations to increase the number of transmitters will be 
accepted. Existing licensees as of July 25, 1985, or on a subsequent 
date following as a result of submitting an application for license on 
or before July 25, 1985, are grandfathered and their operation is co-
primary with the Radiodetermination Satellite Service.
    (75) Use of frequencies in this band is limited to developmental 
operation and is subject to the provisions of subpart Q of this part.
    (76) The frequencies in the band 10.55-10.68 GHz are available for 
Digital Termination Systems and for associated intermodal links in the 
Point-to-Point Microwave Service. No new licenses will be issued under 
this subpart but current licenses will be renewed.
    (77) All communications on this frequency must be conducted within 
the boundaries or confines of the licensee's business premises.
    (78) Base and mobile stations authorized as of April 1, 1968, may 
continue to be authorized for such operation on a secondary basis to the 
Maritime Mobile Service. The licensees of such stations may renew, 
modify, reinstate, or assign their licenses in those cases where such 
assignment accompanies a change of ownership of the licensee's business 
to the assignee, and may expand existing systems when using that 
frequency; however, they will not be authorized to establish any new 
systems.
    (79) Frequencies may be assigned in pairs with the separation 
between base and mobile transmit frequencies being 5.26 MHz. A mobile 
station may be assigned the frequency which would normally be assigned 
to a base station for single frequency operation. However, this single-
frequency operation may be subject to interference that would not occur 
to a two-frequency system. Base or mobile stations located 80.5 km (50 
miles) or less from the center or any urbanized area of 600,000 or more 
population (U.S. Census of Population, 1970) must be operated in the 
half-duplex mode.
    (80) Concurrence from the Petroleum Coordinator is required only for 
applications for this frequency that request authorization for 
transmitters in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, or Texas.
    (81) Concurrence from the Petroleum Coordinator is required only for 
applications for this frequency that request authorization for 
transmitters in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, or 
Washington.

electric utility that generates, transmits, or distributes electrical 
energy for use by the general public or by the members of a cooperative 
organization may operate PLC systems and shall supply to a Federal 
Communications Commission/National Telecommunications and Information 
Administration recognized industry-operated entity, information on all 
existing, changes to existing, and proposed systems for inclusion in a 
data base. Such information shall include the frequency, power, location 
of transmitter(s), location of receivers and other technical and 
operational parameters, which would characterize the system's potential 
both to interfere with authorized radio users, and to receive harmful 
interference from these users. In an agreed upon format, the industry-
operated entity shall inform the NTIA and the FCC of these system 
characteristics prior to implementation of any proposed PLC system and 
shall provide monthly or periodic lists with supplements of PLC systems. 
The FCC and NTIA will supply appropriate application and licensing 
information to the notification activity regarding authorized radio 
stations operating in the band. PLC systems in this band operate on a 
noninterference basis to radio systems assigned frequencies by the NTIA 
or licensed by the FCC and are not protected from interference due to 
these radio operations.

    (c) Explanation of assignment limitations appearing in the frequency 
table of paragraph (b) of this section:
    (1) This frequency band is shared with and stations operating in 
this frequency band in this service are on a secondary basis to stations 
licensed in the International Fixed Service and the Maritime Mobile 
Service.
    (2) This frequency band is shared with and stations operating in 
this frequency band in this service are on a secondary basis to the 
LORAN Navigation System; all operations are limited to radiolocation 
lands stations in accordance with footnote US104, Sec. 2.106 of this 
chapter.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (4) Non-Government radiolocation service in this band is on a 
secondary basis to stations in the Aeronautical

[[Page 322]]

Radionavigation Service operating on 1638 or 1708 kHz.
    (5) Station assignments on frequencies in this band will be made 
subject to the conditions that the maximum output power shall not exceed 
375 watts and the maximum authorized bandwidth shall not exceed 2 kHz.
    (6) Because of the operation of stations having priority on the same 
or adjacent frequencies in this or in other countries, frequency 
assignments in this band may either be unavailable of may be subject to 
certain technical of operational limitations. Therefore, applications 
for frequency assignments in this band shall include information 
concerning the transmitter output power; the type and directional 
characteristics of the antenna and the minimum hours of operation (GMT).
    (7) This band is shared with the Disaster Communications Service 
(part 99) and operations are on a secondary basis to that service 
between local sunset and local sunrise, or at any time during an actual 
or imminent disaster. Local sunrise and sunset times shall be derived 
from the 1946 American Nautical Almanac. Each frequency assignment in 
this band is on an exclusive basis within the daytime primary service 
area to which assigned. The daytime primary service area is the area 
where the signal intensities are adequate for radiolocation purposes 
during the hours from sunrise to sunset from all stations in the 
radiolocation system of which the station in question is a part; that 
is, the primary service area of the station coincides with the primary 
service area of the system. The normal minimum geographical separation 
between stations of different licensees shall be at least 580 km. (360 
mi.) when the stations are operated on the same frequency or on 
different frequencies separated by less than 3 kHz. Where geographical 
separation of less than 580 km. (360 mi.) is desired under these 
circumstances it must be shown that the desired separation will result 
in protection ratio of at least 20 decibels throughout the daytime 
primary service area of other stations. Applications in this band are 
placed on public notice in accordance with Sec. 1.962 of this chapter. 
Where the number of applicants requesting authority to serve an area 
exceeds the number of frequencies available for assignment; or where it 
appears that fewer applicants or licensees than the number before it 
should be given authority to serve a particular area; or where it 
appears that an applicant, either directly or indirectly, seeks to use 
more than 25 kHz of the available spectrum space in this band, the 
applications may be designated for hearing.
    (8) Frequencies in this band may only be assigned to radiolocation 
stations which are also assigned frequencies in the 1605-1800 kHz band, 
provided the use of frequencies in this band is necessary for the proper 
functioning of the particular radiolocation system. Operations in this 
band are on a secondary basis to stations operating in accordance with 
the Commission's table of frequency allocations contained in Sec. 2.106 
of this chapter.
    (9) This band is allocated to the Radiolocation Service on a 
secondary basis to other fixed or mobile services and must accept any 
harmful interference that may be experienced from such services or from 
the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) equipment operating in 
accordance with part 18 of this chapter. In the 2483.5-2500 MHz band, no 
applications for new or modification to existing stations to increase 
the number of transmitters will be accepted. Existing licensees as of 
July 25, 1985, or on a subsequent date following as a result of 
submitting an application for license on or before July 25, 1985, are 
grandfathered and their operation is co-primary with the 
Radiodetermination Satellite Service.
    (10) Speed measuring devices will not be authorized in this band.
    (11) This frequency band is shared with and is on a secondary basis 
to the Maritime Radionavigation Stations (part 80) and to the Government 
Radiolocation Service.
    (12) This frequency is shared with and is on a secondary basis to 
the Government Radiolocation Service.
    (13) Operations in this band are limited to survey operations using 
transmitters with a peak power not to exceed 5 watts into the antenna.
    (14) This frequency band is shared with and is on a secondary basis 
to the Aeronautical Radionavigation Service

[[Page 323]]

(part 87) and to the Government Radiolocation Service.
    (15) The non-Government Radiolocation Service in this band is 
secondary to the Maritime Radionavigation Stations (part 80), the 
Aeronautical Radionavigation Service (part 87) and the Government 
Radiolocation Service.
    (16) This frequency band is shared with and is on a secondary basis 
to the Maritime Radionavigation Stations (part 80) and the Government 
Meteorological Aids Service.
    (17) Operation in this frequency band is on a secondary basis to 
airborne Doppler radars at 8800 MHz.
    (18) Radiolocation installations will be coordinated with the 
Government Meteorological Aids Service, and insofar as practicable, will 
be adjusted to meet the needs of that service.
    (19) Operations in this band are on a secondary basis to the Amateur 
Radio Service (part 97). Pulsed emissions are prohibited.
    (20) This band is restricted to radiolocation systems using type N0N 
emission with a power not to exceed 40 watts into the antenna.
    (21) Non-Government radiolocation stations in the band are secondary 
to the Government Radiolocation Service, the Amateur Radio Service and 
the Amateur-Satellite Service. Pulse-ranging radiolocation stations in 
this band may be authorized along the shorelines of Alaska and the 
contiguous 48 states. Radiolocation stations using spread spectrum 
techniques may be authorized in the band 420-435 MHz for operation 
within the contiguous 48 states and Alaska. Also, stations using spread 
spectrum techniques shall be limited to a maximum output power of 50 
watts, shall be subject to the applicable technical standards in 
Sec. 90.209 until such time as more definitive standards are adopted by 
the Commission and shall identify in accordance with Sec. 90.425(c)(3). 
Authorizations will be granted on a case-by-case basis; however, 
operations proposed to be located within the zones set forth in 
Sec. 90.177(e) should not expect to be accommodated.
    (22) For frequencies 2455 MHz, 10,525 MHz, and 24,125 MHz, only 
unmodulated, continuous wave (NON) emission shall be employed. The 
frequency 24.10 GHz, and frequencies in the 24.20-24.25 GHz band may use 
NON emission along with an ancillary FM digital emission. The frequency 
24.10 GHz will be used for the purpose of alerting motorists of 
hazardous driving conditions and the presence of emergency vehicles. 
Equipment operating on 24.10 GHz must keep the deviation of the FM 
digital signal within <plus-minus> 5 MHz. Equipment operating on this 
frequency must have a frequency stability of at least 2000 ppm and is 
exempt from the requirements of Secs. 90.403(c), 90.403(f), and 90.429 
of this part.
    (23) Devices designed to operate as field disturbance sensors on 
frequencies between 2450 and 2500 MHz with a field strength equal to or 
less than 50,000 microvolts per meter at 30 meters, on a fundamental 
frequency, will not be licensed or certificated for use under this part. 
Such equipment must comply with the requirements for field disturbance 
sensors as set forth in part 15 of this chapter.
    (24) Devices designed to operate as field disturbance sensors on 
frequencies between 10,500 and 10,550 MHz and between 24,050 and 24,250 
MHz, with field strength equal to or less than 250,000 microvolts per 
meter at 30 meters, on the fundamental frequency, will not be licensed 
or certificated for use under this part. Such equipment must comply with 
the requirements for field disturbance sensors as set forth in part 15 
of this chapter.
    (25) Station assignments on frequencies in this band will be made 
subject to the conditions that the maximum output power shall not exceed 
375 watts and the maximum authorized bandwidth shall not exceed 1.0 kHz.
    (26) Each frequency assignment in this band is on an exclusive basis 
within the primary service area to which assigned. The primary service 
area is the area where the signal intensities are adequate for 
radiolocation purposes from all stations in the radiolocation system of 
which the station in question is a part; that is, the primary service 
area of the station coincides with the primary service area of the 
system. The normal minimum geographical separation between stations of 
different licensees shall be at least 1931 km (1200 miles) when the 
stations are

[[Page 324]]

operated on the same frequency or on different frequencies separated by 
less than 1.0 kHz. Where geographical separation of less than 1931 km 
(1200 miles) is requested under these circumstances, it must be shown 
that the desired separation will result in a protection ratio of at 
least 20 decibels throughout the primary service area of other stations.
    (27) Notwithstanding the bandwidth limitations otherwise set forth 
in this section of the rules, wideband systems desiring to operate in 
this band may use such bandwidth as is necessary for proper operation of 
the system provided that the field strength does not exceed 120 
microvolts per meter per square root Hertz (120 uv/m/Hz\1/2\) at 1.6 km 
(1 mile). Such wideband operations shall be authorized on a secondary 
basis to stations operating within otherwise applicable technical 
standards. Applications for wideband systems in this band will be 
accepted beginning December 15, 1985.
    (28) Since the 1605-1705 kHz band has been reallocated for AM 
broadcasting, no new assignments in the 1605-1705 kHz portion of this 
band shall be made after September 30, 1985.
    (29) Beginning July 1, 1987, licensees of existing systems 
authorized frequencies in the 1605-1705 kHz portion of this band may 
request modification of their authorizations to change frequencies to 
the 1900-2000 kHz band.
    (30) Until July 1, 1988, this band will be available only for 
licensees of existing systems operating in the 1605-1705 kHz portion of 
the 1605-1715 kHz band requesting modification of their authorizations 
to change frequencies to this band and for licensees of wideband 
systems. On July 1, 1988, requests for new station authorizations in 
this band will be accepted and, if necessary, will be subject to the 
random selection procedures outlined in Sec. 1.972 of the Commission's 
Rules.
    (31) This frequency band is shared with and is on secondary basis to 
the Fixed-Satellite Service and to the Government's Radiolocation, Space 
Research and Earth Exploration-Satellite Services. After January 1, 
2000, the Government's Space Research and Earth Exploration-Satellite 
Services shall operate on a co-equal secondary basis with the non-
Government Radiolocation Service, except that grandfathered space 
stations in the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System shall continue 
to be protected from harmful interference.
    (d) Other additional frequencies available. Radiolocation stations 
in this service may be authorized, on request, to use frequencies 
allocated exclusively to Federal Government stations, in those instances 
where the Commission finds, after consultation with the appropriate 
Government agency or agencies, that such assignment is necessary or 
required for coordination with Government activities.

Sec. 90.155  Time in which station must be placed in operation.

    (a) All stations authorized under this part, except as provided in 
Secs. 90.629, 90.631(f), 90.665, and 90.685, must be placed in operation 
within twelve (12) months from the date of grant or the authorization 
cancels automatically and must be returned to the Commission.
    (b) A local government entity in the Public Safety Pool, applying 
for any frequency in this part, may also seek extended implementation 
authorization pursuant to Sec. 90.629.
    (c) For purposes of this section, a base station is not considered 
to be placed in operation unless at least one associated mobile station 
is also placed in operation. See also Secs. 90.633(d) and 90.631(f).
    (d) Multilateration LMS systems authorized in accordance with 
Sec. 90.353

[[Page 328]]

must be constructed and placed in operation within twelve (12) months 
from the date of grant or the authorization cancels automatically and 
must be returned to the Commission. MTA-licensed multilateration LMS 
systems will be considered constructed and placed in operation if such 
systems construct a sufficient number of base stations that utilize 
multilateration technology (see paragraph (e) of this section) to 
provide multilateration location service to a substantial portion of at 
least one BTA in the MTA.
    (e) A multilateration LMS station will be considered constructed and 
placed in operation if it is built in accordance with its authorized 
parameters and is regularly interacting with one or more other stations 
to provide location service, using multilateration technology, to one or 
more mobile units. Specifically, LMS multilateration stations will only 
be considered constructed and placed in operation if they are part of a 
system that can interrogate a mobile, receive the response at 3 or more 
sites, compute the location from the time of arrival of the responses 
and transmit the location either back to the mobile or to a subscriber's 
fixed site.
    (f) For purposes of this section, a station licensed to provide 
commercial mobile radio service is not considered to have commenced 
service unless it provides service to at least one unaffiliated party.
    (g) Application for extension of time to commence service may be 
made on FCC Form 601. Extensions of time must be filed prior to the 
expiration of the construction period. Extensions will be granted only 
if the licensee shows that the failure to commence service is due to 
causes beyond its control. No extensions will be granted for delays 
caused by lack of financing, lack of site availability, for the 
assignment or transfer of control of an authorization, or for failure to 
timely order equipment. If the licensee orders equipment within 90 days 
of the license grant, a presumption of due diligence is created.
    (h) An application for modification of an authorization (under 
construction) at the existing location does not extend the initial 
construction period. If additional time to commence service is required, 
a request for such additional time must be submitted on FCC Form 601, 
either separately or in conjunction with the submission of the FCC Form 
601 requesting modification.

the proposed antenna or tower structure does not exceed 6.1 meters (20 
feet) above ground level or above an existing man-made structure (other 
than an antenna structure), if the antenna or tower has not been 
previously studied by the Federal Aviation Administration and cleared by 
the FCC.
    (3) The grant of the application does not require a waiver of the 
Commission's Rules.
    (4) The applicant has determined that the proposed facility will not 
significantly affect the environment as defined in Sec. 1.1307.
    (5) The applicant has determined that the proposed station affords 
the level of protection to radio SE ``quiet'' zones and monitoring 
facilities as specified in Sec. 90.177.
    (6) The applicant has submitted an application to the Commission 
stating the frequency the applicant intends to use and that the 
frequency coordination requirements specified in Sec. 90.175 for 
selection and use of this frequency have been met and a minimum of ten 
business days has passed between submission of the application to the 
Commission and the onset of operation.
    (c) An applicant proposing to operate an itinerant station or an 
applicant seeking the assignment of authorization or transfer of control 
of a license for an existing station below 470 MHz or in the 929-930 MHz 
band (other than a commercial mobile radio service applicant or licensee 
on these bands) may operate the proposed station during the pendency of 
the application for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days 
upon the filing of a properly completed formal Form 601 application that 
complies with Sec. 90.127 of this part. Conditional authority ceases 
immediately if the application is dismissed by the Commission. All other 
categories of applications listed in Sec. 90.175(i) of this part that do 
not require evidence of frequency coordination are excluded from the 
provisions of this section.
    (d) Conditional authorization does not prejudice any action the 
Commission may take on the subject application. Conditional authority is 
accepted with the express understanding that such authority may be 
modified or canceled by the Commission at any time without hearing if, 
in the Commission's discretion, the need for such action arises. 
Consistent with Sec. 90.175(g) of this part, the applicant assumes all 
risks associated with operation under conditional authority, the 
termination or modification of conditional authority, or the subsequent 
dismissal or denial of its application. Authority reverts back to the 
original licensee if an assignee or transferee's conditional authority 
is canceled.
    (e) The transmissions of new stations operating pursuant to 
conditional authority shall be identified by a temporary call sign 
consisting of the prefix ``WT'' followed by the applicant's local seven 
digit business telephone number as provided in Sec. 2.302. Transmissions 
by applicants for the modification, assignment of authorization or 
transfer of control of an existing station shall be identified by the 
station's call sign.

    Note: The following rules (Sec. 90.165 through Sec. 90.169) govern 
applications, licensing, and operation of radio facilities in the 220-
222 MHz (subpart T), Business Radio (subpart D), 929-930 MHz Paging 
(subpart P), and Specialized Mobile Radio (subpart S) services that are 
used to provide commercial mobile radio services (see Secs. 20.3 and 
20.9 of this chapter). Compliance with the rules relating to 
applications and licensing of facilities on paging-only channels in the 
Business Radio Service (see Sec. 90.75(c)(10)) and 929-930 MHz paging 
channels (see Sec. 90.494(a),(b)) is not required prior to August 10, 
1996. Compliance with Sec. 90.168 is also not required prior to August 
10, 1996 for reclassified commercial mobile radio service providers who 
are to be regulated as private carriers until August 10, 1996 as 
provided in the Second Report and Order in GN Docket No. 93-252, 9 FCC 
Rcd 2348 (1994), paras. 280-284. The licensing and operation of radio 
facilities in the 220-222 MHz (subpart T), Business Radio (subpart D), 
929-930 MHz Paging (subpart P), and Specialized Mobile Radio (subpart S) 
services that are used to provide commercial mobile radio services are 
also subject to rules elsewhere in this part that apply generally to 
Private Land Mobile Radio Services. In the case of any conflict between 
rules set forth in Secs. 90.165 through 90.169 and other rules in this 
part, Secs. 90.165 through 90.169 apply. 14-23. New Secs. 90.165 through 
90.169 are added to subpart G to read as follows:


<R05>
Sec. 90.165  Procedures for mutually exclusive applications.

    Mutually exclusive commercial mobile radio service applications are 
processed in accordance with part 1 of this chapter and with the rules 
in this section, except for mutually exclusive applications for licenses 
in the 220-222 MHz service and the 929-930 MHz Paging service, which are 
processed in accordance with the rules in subpart P and subpart T of 
this part.
    Two or more pending applications are mutually exclusive if the grant 
of one application would effectively preclude the grant of one or more 
of the others under Commission rules governing the services involved.
    (a) Separate applications. Any applicant that files an application 
knowing that it will be mutually exclusive with one or more applications 
should not include in the mutually exclusive application a request for 
other channels or facilities that would not, by themselves, render the 
application mutually exclusive with those other applications. Instead, 
the request for such other channels or facilities should be filed in a 
separate application.
    (b) Filing groups. Pending mutually exclusive applications are 
processed in filing groups. Mutually exclusive applications in a filing 
group are given concurrent consideration. The Commission may dismiss as 
defective (pursuant to Sec. 1.934 of this chapter) any mutually 
exclusive application(s) whose filing date is outside of the date range 
for inclusion in the filing group. The types of filing groups used in 
day-to-day application processing are specified in paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section. A filing group is one of the following types:
    (1) Renewal filing group. A renewal filing group comprises a timely-
filed application for renewal of an authorization and all timely-filed 
mutually exclusive competing applications (see section 1.949 of this 
chapter).
    (2) Same-day filing group. A same-day filing group comprises all 
mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is the same day, which 
is normally the filing date of the first-filed applications(s).
    (3) Thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group. A 30-day notice and 
cut-off filing group comprises mutually exclusive applications whose 
filing date is no later than thirty (30) days after the date of the 
Public Notice listing the first-filed application(s) (according to the 
filing dates) as acceptable for filing.
    (4) Window filing group. A window filing group comprises mutually 
exclusive applications whose filing date is within an announced filing 
window. An announced filing window is a period of time between and 
including two specific dates, which are the first and last dates on 
which applications (or amendments) for a particular purpose may be 
accepted for filing. In the case of a one-day filing window, the two 
dates are the same. The dates are made known to the public in advance.
    (c) Procedures. Generally, the Commission may grant one application 
in a filing group of mutually exclusive applications and dismiss the 
other application(s) in the filing group that are excluded by the grant, 
pursuant to Sec. 1.935 of this chapter.
    (1) Selection methods. In selecting the application to grant, the 
Commission

[[Page 331]]

may use competitive bidding, random selection, or comparative hearings, 
depending on the type of applications involved.
    (2) Dismissal of applications. The Commission may dismiss any 
application in a filing group that is defective or otherwise subject to 
dismissal under Sec. 1.934 of this chapter, either before or after 
employing selection procedures.
    (3) Type of filing group used. Except as otherwise provided in this 
part, the type of filing group used in processing of two or more 
mutually exclusive applications depends on the purpose(s) of the 
applications.
    (i) If one of the mutually exclusive applications is a timely-filed 
application for renewal of an authorization, a renewal filing group is 
used.
    (ii) If any mutually exclusive application filed on the earliest 
filing date is an application for modification and none of the mutually 
exclusive applications is a timely-filed application for renewal, a 
same-day filing group is used.
    (iii) If all of the mutually exclusive applications filed on the 
earliest filing date are applications for initial authorization, a 30-
day notice and cut-off filing group is used.
    (4) Disposition. If there is only one application in any type of 
filing group, the Commission may grant that application and dismiss 
without prejudice any mutually exclusive applications not in the filing 
group. If there is more than one mutually exclusive application in a 
filing group, the Commission disposes of these applications as follows:
    (i) Applications in a renewal filing group. All mutually exclusive 
applications in a renewal filing group are designated for comparative 
consideration in a hearing.
    (ii) Applications in a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group.
    (A) If all of the mutually exclusive applications in a 30-day notice 
and cut-off filing group are applications for initial authorization, the 
Commission administers competitive bidding procedures in accordance with 
subpart Q of part 1 of this chapter. After such procedures, the 
application of the successful bidder may be granted and the other 
applications may be dismissed without prejudice.
    (B) If any of the mutually exclusive applications in a 30-day notice 
and cut-off filing group is an application for modification or an 
application for facilities, the Commission may attempt to resolve the 
mutual exclusivity by facilitating a settlement between the applicants. 
If a settlement is not reached within a reasonable time, the Commission 
may designate all applications in the filing group for comparative 
consideration in a hearing. In this event, the result of the hearing 
disposes all of the applications in the filing group.
    (iii) Applications in a same-day filing group. If there are two or 
more mutually exclusive applications in a same-day filing group, the 
Commission may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating 
a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached 
within a reasonable time, the Commission may designate all applications 
in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this 
event, the result of the hearing disposes all of the applications in the 
filing group.
    (iv) Applications in a window filing group. Applications in a window 
filing group are processed in accordance with the procedures for a 30-
day notice and cut-off filing group in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this 
section.
    (d) Terminology. For the purposes of this section, terms have the 
following meanings:
    (1) The ``filing date'' of an application is the date on which that 
application was received in a condition acceptable for filing or the 
date on which the most recently filed major amendment to that 
application was received, whichever is later, excluding major amendments 
in the following circumstances:
    (i) The major amendment reflects only a change in ownership or 
control found by the Commission to be in the public interest;
    (ii) The major amendment as received is defective or otherwise found 
unacceptable for filing; or
    (iii) The application being amended has been designated for hearing 
and the Commission or the presiding officer accepts the major amendment.

[[Page 332]]

    (2) An ``application for initial authorization'' is:
    (i) Any application requesting an authorization for a new system or 
station;
    (ii) Any application requesting authorization for an existing 
station to operate on an additional channel, unless the additional 
channel is for paired two-way radiotelephone operation, is in the same 
frequency range as the existing channel(s), and will be operationally 
integrated with the existing channel(s) such as by trunking; or
    (iii) any application requesting authorization for a new transmitter 
at a location more than 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from any existing 
transmitters of the applicant licensee on the requested channel or 
channel block.

prejudice or discrimination based upon sex, race, color, religion, or 
national origin, from the licensee's personnel policies and practices 
and working conditions.
    (v) Conduct a continuing review of job structure and employment 
practices and adopt positive recruitment, training, job design and other 
measures needed in order to insure genuine equality of opportunity to 
participate fully in all organizational units, occupations and levels of 
responsibility.
    (2) The program must reasonably address specific concerns through 
policies and actions as set forth in this paragraph, to the extent that 
they are appropriate in consideration of licensee size, location and 
other factors.
    (i) To assure nondiscrimination in recruiting.
    (A) Posting notices in the licensee's offices informing applicants 
for employment of their equal employment rights and their right to 
notify the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Federal 
Communications Commission (Commission), or other appropriate agency. 
Where a substantial number of applicants are Spanish-surnamed Americans, 
such notice should be posted in both Spanish and English.
    (B) Placing a notice in bold type on the employment application 
informing prospective employees that discrimination because of sex, 
race, color, religion, or national origin is prohibited, and that they 
may notify the EEOC, the Commission, or other appropriate agency if they 
believe they have been discriminated against.

unions in the development of programs to assure qualified minority 
persons or females of equal opportunity for employment, and including an 
effective nondiscrimination clause in new or renegotiated union 
agreements.
    (C) Avoiding use of selection techniques or tests that have the 
effect of discriminating against minority groups or females.
    (iii) To assure nondiscriminatory placement and promotion.
    (A) Instructing employees of the licensee who make decisions on 
placement and promotion that minority employees and females are to be 
considered without discrimination, and that job areas in which there is 
little or no minority or female representation should be reviewed to 
determine whether this results from discrimination.
    (B) Giving minority groups and female employees equal opportunity 
for positions which lead to higher positions. Inquiring as to the 
interest and skills of all lower-paid employees with respect to any of 
the higher-paid positions, followed by assistance, counseling, and 
effective measures to enable employees with interest and potential to 
qualify themselves for such positions.
    (C) Reviewing seniority practices to insure that such practices are 
nondiscriminatory and do not have a discriminatory effect.

time employees shall file with the Commission, no later than May 31st 
following the grant of that licensee's first Commercial Mobile Radio 
Services authorization, a statement describing fully its current equal 
employment opportunity program, indicating specific practices to be 
followed in order to assure equal employment opportunity on the basis of 
sex, race, color, religion, or national origin in such aspects of 
employment practices as regards recruitment, selection, training, 
placement, promotion, pay, working conditions, demotion, layoff, and 
termination. Any licensee having sixteen (16) or more full-time 
employees that changes its existing equal employment opportunity program 
shall file with the Commission, no later than May 31st thereafter, a 
revised statement reflecting the change(s).

    Note: Commercial mobile radio service licensees having sixteen (16) 
or more full-time employees that do not have a current EEO statement on 
file with the Commission as of January 2, 1995, must file the statement 
required by this paragraph no later than May 31, 1995.

    (c) Report of complaints filed against licensees. Each licensee, 
regardless of how many employees it has, shall submit an annual report 
to the Commission no later than May 31st of each year indicating whether 
any complaints regarding violations by the licensee or equal employment 
provisions of Federal, State, Territorial, or local law have been filed 
before anybody having competent jurisdiction.
    (1) The report should state the parties involved, the date filing, 
the courts or agencies before which the matters have been heard, the 
appropriate file number (if any), and the respective disposition or 
current status of any such complaints.
    (2) Any licensee who has filed such information with the EEOC may 
file a notification of such filing with the Commission in lieu of a 
report.

[[Page 334]]

    (d) Complaints of violations of Equal Employment Programs. 
Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common carrier 
licensee are considered by the Commission in the following manner:
    (1) If a complaint raising an issue of discrimination is received 
against a licensee who is within the jurisdiction of the EEOC, it is 
submitted to that agency. The Commission maintains a liaison with that 
agency that keeps the Commission informed of the disposition of 
complaints filed against common carrier licensees.
    (2) Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common 
carrier licensee who does not fall under the jurisdiction of the EEOC 
but is covered by appropriate enforceable State law, to which penalties 
apply, may be submitted by the Commission to the respective State 
agency.
    (3) Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common 
carrier licensee who does not fall under the jurisdiction of the EEOC or 
an appropriate State law, are accorded appropriate treatment by the 
Commission.
    (4) The Commission will consult with the EEOC on all matters 
relating to the evaluation and determination of compliance by the common 
carrier licensees with the principles of equal employment as set forth 
herein.
    (5) Complaints indicating a general pattern of disregard of equal 
employment practices which are received against a licensee that is 
required to file an employment report to the Commission under 
Sec. 1.815(a) of this chapter are investigated by the Commission.
    (e) Commission records. A copy of every annual employment report, 
equal employment opportunity program statement, reports on complaints 
regarding violation of equal employment provisions of Federal, State, 
Territorial, or local law, and copies of all exhibits, letters, and 
other documents filed as part thereof, all amendments thereto, all 
correspondence between the licensee and the Commission pertaining to the 
reports after they have been filed and all documents incorporated 
therein by reference, are open for public inspection at the offices of 
the Commission.
    (f) Licensee records. Each licensee required to file annual 
employment reports (pursuant to Sec. 1.815(a) of this chapter), equal 
employment opportunity program statements, and annual reports on 
complaints regarding violations of equal employment provisions of 
Federal, State, Territorial, or local law shall maintain for public 
inspection a file containing a copy of each such report and copies of 
all exhibits, letters, and other documents filed as part thereto, all 
correspondence between the licensee and the Commission pertaining to the 
reports after they have been filed and all documents incorporated 
therein by reference. The documents must be retained for a period of two 
(2) years.


<R05>
Sec. 90.169  Construction prior to grant of application.

    Applicants may construct facilities prior to grant of their 
applications, subject to the provisions of this section, but must not 
operate such facilities until the Commission grants an authorization. If 
the conditions stated in this section are not met, applicants must not 
begin to construct facilities.
    (a) When applicants may begin construction. An applicant may begin 
construction of a facility thirty-five (35) days after the date of the 
Public Notice listing the application for that facility as acceptable 
for filing.
    (b) Notification to stop. If the Commission for any reason 
determines that construction should not be started or should be stopped 
while an application is pending, and so notifies the applicant, orally 
(followed by written confirmation) or in writing, the applicant must not 
begin construction or, if construction has begun, must stop construction 
immediately.
    (c) Assumption of risk. Applicants that begin construction pursuant 
to this section before receiving an authorization do so at their own 
risk and have no recourse against the United States for any losses 
resulting from:
    (1) Applications that are not granted;
    (2) Errors or delays in issuing Public Notices;
    (3) Having to alter, relocate, or dismantle the facility; or
    (4) Incurring whatever costs may be necessary to bring the facility 
into

[[Page 335]]

compliance with applicable laws, or Commission rules and orders.
    (d) Conditions. Except as indicated, all pre-grant construction is 
subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The application is not mutually exclusive with any other 
application;
    (2) No petitions to deny the application have been filed;
    (3) The application does not include a request for a waiver of one 
or more Commission rules;
    (4) For any construction or alteration that would exceed the 
requirements of Sec. 17.7 of this chapter, the licensee has notified the 
appropriate Regional Office of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA 
Form 7460-1), filed a request for antenna height clearance and 
obstruction marking and lighting specifications (FCC Form 854) with the 
Commission;
    (5) The applicant has indicated in the application that the proposed 
facility would not have a significant environmental effect, in 
accordance with Secs. 1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter; and,
    (6) Under applicable international agreements and rules in this 
part, individual coordination of the proposed channel assignment(s) with 
a foreign administration is not required.


<R04>
       Subpart H--Policies Governing the Assignment of Frequencies


<R05>
Sec. 90.171  Scope.

    This subpart contains detailed information concerning the policies 
under which the Commission assigns frequencies for the use of licensees 
under this part, frequency coordination procedures, and procedures under 
which licensees may cooperatively share radio facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 90.173  Policies governing the assignment of frequencies.

    (a) Except as indicated in paragraph (j) of this section, the 
frequencies which ordinarily may be assigned to stations in the services 
governed by this part are listed in subparts B, C and F of this part. 
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this part, frequencies 
assigned to land mobile stations are available on a shared basis only 
and will not be assigned for the exclusive use of any licensee.
    (b) All applicants and licensees shall cooperate in the selection 
and use of frequencies in order to reduce interference and make the most 
effective use of the authorized facilities. Licensees of stations 
suffering or causing harmful interference are expected to cooperate and 
resolve this problem by mutually satisfactory arrangements. If the 
licensees are unable to do so, the Commission may impose restrictions 
including specifying the transmitter power, antenna height, or area or 
hours of operation of the stations concerned. Further the use of any 
frequency at a given geographical location may be denied when, in the 
judgment of the Commission, its use in that location is not in the 
public interest; the use of any frequency may be restricted as to 
specified geographical areas, maximum power, or such other operating 
conditions, contained in this part or in the station authorization.
    (c) Frequencies allocated for Federal Government radio stations 
under Executive order of the President may be authorized for the use of 
stations in these services upon appropriate showing by the applicant 
that such assignment is necessary for inter-communication with 
government stations or required for coordination with activities of the 
Federal Government, and where the Commission finds, after consultation 
with the appropriate government agency or agencies, that such assignment 
is necessary.
    (d) The radio facilities authorized under this part are intended for 
use in connection with and as an adjunct to the primary governmental or 
business activities of the licensee.
    (e) Persons requesting authority to operate in the band 25-50 MHz 
should recognize that this band is shared with various services in other 
countries and that harmful interference may be caused by the propagation 
of signals in this band from distant stations. No protection from such 
harmful interference generally can be expected.
    (f) Applications for stations in the 150-174 MHz and 421-512 MHz 
bands for operation on frequencies 15 kHz or less removed from existing 
stations in the same geographic area will be granted

[[Page 336]]

based upon a recommendation from the applicable frequency coordinator as 
specified in Secs. 90.20(c)(2) and 90.35(b)(2).
    (g) In the states of Alaska and Hawaii, and in areas outside the 
continental limits of the United States and the adjacent waters, the 
frequencies above 150.8 MHz which are listed elsewhere in this part as 
available for assignment to base stations or mobile stations in the 
Industrial/Business Pool are also available for assignment to 
operational fixed stations in the Industrial/Business Pool on a 
secondary basis.
    (h) In the Public Safety Pool, base stations may be authorized to 
operate on a secondary basis on frequencies below 450 MHz which are 
available to mobile stations.
    (i) In the 450-470 MHz band, the frequencies are ordinarily assigned 
in pairs, with the mobile station transmit frequency 5 MHz above the 
paired base station transmit frequency. In the 470-512 MHz band, the 
frequencies are ordinarily assigned in pairs with the mobile station 
transmit frequency 3 MHz above the paired base station transmit 
frequency. In the Industrial/Business Pool, in the 150 MHz band, the 
frequencies subject to Sec. 90.35(c)(6) may be assigned in pairs with 
the separation between base and mobile frequencies being 5.26 MHz. A 
mobile station may be assigned the frequency which would normally be 
assigned to a base station for single-frequency operation. However, this 
single-frequency operation may be subject to interference that would not 
occur to a two-frequency system.
    (j) Frequencies other than those listed in subparts B and C of this 
part may be assigned in the 150-174 MHz, 421-430 MHz, 450-470 MHz, and 
470-512 MHz bands, provided the following conditions are met:
    (1) Such applications must be accompanied by a showing of frequency 
coordination in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 90.175;
    (2) The frequencies must not be available in any other rule part of 
this chapter; and
    (3) The authorized bandwidth of any system operating in accordance 
with this paragraph must not overlap spectrum available in other rule 
parts of this chapter unless that spectrum is also allocated in part 90.
    (k) This paragraph is only applicable to entities with Finder's 
Preference requests pending before the Commission as of July 29, 1998. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, any eligible person 
shall be given a dispositive preference for a channel assignment on an 
exclusive basis in the 220-222 MHz, 470-512 MHz, and 800/900 MHz (except 
on frequencies designated exclusively for SMR service) bands by 
submitting information that leads to the recovery of channels in these 
bands. Recovery of such channels must result from information provided 
regarding the failure of existing licensees to comply with the 
provisions of Secs. 90.155, 90.157, 90.629, 90.631 (e) or (f), or 90.633 
(c) or (d).
    (l) In the 150-174 MHz band, except where otherwise specifically 
provided, authorizations for frequencies that were available prior to 
August 18, 1995 will be granted with channel bandwidths of 25 kHz or 
less. Authorizations for all other frequencies in this band will be 
granted with channel bandwidths of 12.5 kHz or less (i.e., in the Public 
Safety Pool, frequencies subject to Secs. 90.20 (d)(27) and (d)(44), and 
in the Industrial/Business Pool, frequencies subject to Secs. 90.35 
(c)(30) and (c)(33)).
    (m) In the 421-512 MHz band, except where otherwise specifically 
provided, authorizations for frequencies that were available prior to 
August 18, 1995 will be granted with channel bandwidths of 25 kHz or 
less. New authorizations for frequencies 12.5 kHz removed from these 
frequencies will be made for channel bandwidths of 12.5 kHz or less 
(i.e., in the Public Safety Pool, frequencies subject to 
Sec. 90.20(d)(27) and in the Industrial/Business Pool, frequencies 
subject to Sec. 90.35(c)(30)). Authorizations for frequencies 6.25 kHz 
removed from these frequencies will be granted with channel bandwidths 
of 6.25 kHz or less (i.e., in the Public Safety Pool, frequencies 
subject to Sec. 90.20(d)(44), and in the Industrial/Business Pool, 
frequencies subject to Sec. 90.35(c)(33)).
    (n) Any recovered channels in the 800 MHz SMR service will revert 
automatically to the holder of the EA license

[[Page 337]]

within which such channels are included. If there is no EA licensee for 
recovered channels, such channels will be retained by the Commission for 
future licensing.

<R05>
Sec. 90.175  Frequency coordinator requirements.

    Except for applications listed in paragraph (j) of this section, 
each application for a new frequency assignment, for a change in 
existing facilities as listed in Sec. 90.135(a), or for operation at 
temporary locations in accordance with Sec. 90.137 must include a 
showing of frequency coordination as set forth further.
    (a) Frequency coordinators may request, and applicants are required 
to provide, all appropriate technical information, system requirements, 
and justification for requested station parameters when such information 
is necessary to identify and recommend the most appropriate frequency. 
Additionally, applicants bear the burden of proceeding and the burden of 
proof in requesting the Commission to overturn a coordinator's 
recommendation.
    (b) For frequencies between 25 and 470 MHz: (1) A statement is 
required from the applicable frequency coordinator as specified in 
Secs. 90.20(c)(2) and 90.35(b) recommending the most appropriate 
frequency. In addition, if the interference contour of a proposed 
station would overlap the service contour of a station on a frequency 
formerly shared prior to radio service consolidation by licensees in the 
Manufacturers Radio Service, the Forest Products Radio Service, the 
Power Radio Service, the Petroleum Radio Service, the Motor Carrier 
Radio Service, the Railroad Radio Service or the Automobile Emergency 
Radio Service, the written concurrence of the coordinator for the 
industry-specific service, or the written concurrence of the licensee 
itself, must be obtained. Requests for concurrence must be responded to 
within 20 days of receipt of the request. The written request for 
concurrence shall advise the receiving party of the maximum 20 day 
response period. The coordinator's recommendation may include comments 
on technical factors such as power, antenna height and gain, terrain and 
other factors which may serve to minimize potential interference. In 
addition:
    (2) On frequencies designated for coordination or concurrence by a 
specific frequency coordinator as specified in Secs. 90.20(c)(3) and 
90.35(b), the applicable frequency coordinator shall provide a written 
supporting statement in instances in which coordination or concurrence 
is denied. The supporting statement shall contain sufficient detail to 
permit discernment of the technical basis for the denial of concurrence. 
Concurrence may be denied only when a grant of the underlying 
application would have a demonstrable, material, adverse effect on 
safety.
    (3) In instances in which a frequency coordinator determines that an 
applicant's requested frequency or the most appropriate frequency is one 
designated for coordination or concurrence by a specific frequency 
coordinator as specified in Secs. 90.20(c)(3) or 90.35(b), that 
frequency coordinator may forward the application directly to the 
appropriate frequency coordinator. A frequency coordinator may only 
forward an application as specified above if consent is received from 
the applicant.
    (c) For frequencies above 800 MHz: When frequencies are shared by 
more than one service, concurrence must be obtained from the other 
applicable certified coordinators.
    (d) For frequencies in the 450-470 MHz band: When used for secondary 
fixed operations, frequencies shall be assigned and coordinated pursuant 
to Sec. 90.261.
    (e) For frequencies between 470 and 512 MHz, 764-776/794-806 MHz, 
806-824/851-869 MHz, and 896-901/935-940 MHz: A recommendation of the 
specific frequencies that are available for assignment in accordance 
with the loading

[[Page 338]]

standards and mileage separations applicable to the specific radio 
service, frequency pool, or category of user involved is required from 
an applicable frequency coordinator.
    (f) For frequencies in the 929-930 MHz band listed in paragraph (b) 
of Sec. 90.494: A statement is required from the coordinator 
recommending the most appropriate frequency.
    (g) For frequencies between 1427-1432 MHz: A statement is required 
from the coordinator recommending the most appropriate frequency, 
operating power and area of operation in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 90.259(b).
    (h) Any recommendation submitted in accordance with paragraphs (a), 
(c), (d), or (e) of this section is advisory in character and is not an 
assurance that the Commission will grant a license for operation on that 
frequency. Therefore, applicants are strongly advised not to purchase 
radio equipment operating on specific frequencies until a valid 
authorization has been obtained from the Commission.
    (i) Applications for facilities near the Canadian border north of 
line A or east of line C in Alaska may require coordination with the 
Canadian government. See Sec. 1.955 of this chapter.
    (j) The following applications need not be accompanied by evidence 
of frequency coordination:
    (1) Applications for frequencies below 25 MHz.
    (2) Applications for a Federal Government frequency.
    (3) Applications for frequencies in the 72-76 MHz band except for 
mobile frequencies subject to Sec. 90.35(c)(77).
    (4) Applications for a frequency to be used for developmental 
purposes.
    (5) Applications in the Industrial/Business Pool requesting a 
frequency designated for itinerant operations, and applications 
requesting operation on 154.570 MHz, 154.600 MHz, 151.820 MHz, 151.880 
MHz, and 151.940 MHz.
    (6) Applications in the Radiolocation Service.
    (7) [Reserved]
    (8) Applications for frequencies listed in the SMR tables contained 
in Secs. 90.617 and 90.619.
    (9) Applications indicating license assignments such as change in 
ownership, control or corporate structure if there is no change in 
technical parameters.
    (10) Applications for mobile stations operating in the 470-512 MHz 
band, 764-776/794-806 MHz band, or above 800 MHz if the frequency pair 
is assigned to a single system on an exclusive basis in the proposed

Sec. 90.179  Shared use of radio stations.

    Licensees of radio stations authorized under this rule part may 
share the use of their facilities. A station is shared when persons not 
licensed for the station control the station for their own purposes 
pursuant to the licensee's authorization. Shared use of a radio station 
may be either on a non-profit cost shared basis or on a for-profit 
private carrier basis. Shared use of an authorized station is subject to 
the following conditions and limitations:
    (a) Persons may share a radio station only on frequencies for which 
they would be eligible for a separate authorization.
    (b) The licensee of the shared radio station is responsible for 
assuring that the authorized facility is used only by persons and only 
for purposes consistent with the requirements of this rule part.
    (c) Participants in the sharing arrangement may obtain a license for 
their own mobile units (including control points and/or control stations 
for control of the shared facility), or they may use mobile stations, 
and control stations or control points authorized to the licensee.
    (d) If the licensee shares the land station on a non-profit, cost 
shared basis to the licensee, this shared use must be pursuant to a 
written agreement between the licensee and each participant which sets 
out (1) the method of operation, (2) the components of the system which 
are covered by the sharing arrangements, (3) the method by which costs 
are to be apportioned, and (4) acknowledgement that all shared 
transmitter use must be subject to the licensee's control. These 
agreements must be kept as part of the station records.
    (e) If the land station which is being shared is interconnected with 
the public switched telephone network, the provisions of Sec. 90.477 et 
seq. apply.
    (f) Above 800 MHz, shared use on a for-profit private carrier basis 
is permitted only by SMR, Private Carrier Paging, and LMS licensees. See 
subparts M, P, and S of this part.
    (g) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, licensees 
authorized to operate radio systems on Public Safety Pool frequencies 
designated in Sec. 90.20 may share their facilities with Federal 
Government entities on a non-profit, cost-shared basis. Such a sharing 
arrangement is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) 
of this section. State governments authorized to operate radio systems 
under Sec. 90.529 may share the use of their systems (for public safety 
services not made commercially available to the public) with any entity 
that would be eligible for licensing under Sec. 90.523 and Federal 
government entities.
    (h) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, licensees 
authorized to operate radio systems on Industrial/Business Pool 
frequencies designated in Sec. 90.35 may share their facilities with 
Public Safety Pool entities designated in Sec. 90.20 and with Federal 
Government entities on a non-profit, cost-shared basis. Such a sharing 
arrangement is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) 
of this section.
    (i) The provisions of this section do not apply to licensees 
authorized to provide commercial mobile radio service under this part, 
including licensees authorized to use channels transferred or assigned 
pursuant to Sec. 90.621(e)(2).

<R05>
Sec. 90.187  Trunking in the bands between 150 and 512 MHz.

    (a) Applicants for trunked systems operating on frequencies between 
150 and 512 MHz (except 220-222 MHz) must indicate on their applications 
(class of station code, instructions for FCC Form 601) that their system 
will be trunked. Licensees of stations that are not trunked, may trunk 
their systems only after modifying their license (see Sec. 1.927 of this 
chapter).
    (b) Trunked systems operating under this section must employ 
equipment that prevents transmission on a trunked frequency if a signal 
from another system is present on that frequency. The level of 
monitoring must be sufficient to avoid causing harmful interference to 
other systems. However, this monitoring requirement does not apply if 
the conditions in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, are met:
    (1) Where applicants for or licensees operating in the 470-512 MHz 
band meet the loading requirements of Sec. 90.313 and have exclusive use 
of their frequencies in their service area.
    (2) On frequencies where an applicant or licensee does not have an 
exclusive service area provided that all frequency coordination 
requirements are complied with and written consent is obtained from 
affected licensees using either the procedure set forth in paragraphs 
(b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section (mileage separation) or the 
procedure set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section (protected 
contours).
    (i) Affected licensees for the purposes of this section are 
licensees of stations that have assigned frequencies (base and mobile) 
that are 15 kHz or less removed from proposed stations that will operate 
with a 25 kHz channel bandwidth; stations that have assigned frequencies 
(base and mobile) that are 7.5 kHz or less removed from proposed 
stations that will operate with a 12.5 kHz bandwidth; or stations that 
have assigned frequencies (base and mobile) 3.75 kHz or less removed 
from proposed stations that will operate with a 6.25 kHz bandwidth.
    (ii) Where such stations' service areas (37 dBu contour for stations 
in the 150-174 MHz band and 39 dBu contour for stations in the 421-512 
MHz bands; see Sec. 90.205) overlap a circle with radius 113 km (70 mi.) 
from the proposed base station.
    (iii) In lieu of the mileage separation procedure set forth in 
paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section, applicants for 
trunked facilities may obtain consent only from stations that would be 
subjected to objectionable interference from the trunked facilities. 
Objectionable interference will be considered to exist when the 
interference contour (19 dBu for VHF stations, 21 dBu for UHF stations) 
of a proposed trunked station would intersect the service contour (37 
dBu for VHF stations, 39 dBu for UHF stations) of an existing station. 
The existing stations that must be considered in a contour overlap 
analysis are a function of the channel bandwidth of the proposed trunked 
station, as follows:
    (A) For trunked stations proposing 25 kHz channel bandwidth: 
Existing co-

[[Page 342]]

channel stations and existing stations that have an operating frequency 
15 kHz or less from the proposed trunked station.
    (B) For trunked stations proposing 12.5 kHz channel bandwidth: 
Existing co-channel stations and existing stations that have an 
operating frequency 7.5 kHz or less from the proposed trunked station.
    (C) For trunked stations proposing 6.25 kHz channel bandwidth: 
Existing co-channel stations and existing stations that have an 
operating frequency 3.75 kHz or less from the proposed trunked station.
    (iv) The calculation of service and interference contours referenced 
in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section shall be done using generally 
accepted engineering practices and standards which, for purposes of this 
section, shall presumptively be the practices and standards agreed to by 
a consensus of all certified frequency coordinators.
    (v) The written consent from the licensees specified in paragraphs 
(b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(2)(iii)(A), (b)(2)(iii)(B) and 
(b)(2)(iii)C of this section shall specifically state all terms agreed 
to by the parties and shall be signed by the parties. The written 
consent shall be maintained by the operator of the trunked station and 
be made available to the Commission upon request. The submission of a 
coordinated trunked application to the Commission shall include a 
certification from the applicant that written consent has been obtained 
from all licensees specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) or 
(b)(2)(iii)(A), (b)(2)(iii)(B) and (b)(2)(iii)(C) of this section that 
the written consent documents encompass the complete understandings and 
agreements of the parties as to such consent; and that the terms and 
conditions thereof are consistent with the Commission's rules. Should a 
potential applicant disagree with a certified frequency coordinator's 
determination that objectionable interference exists with respect to a 
given channel or channels, that potential applicant may request the 
Commission to overturn the certified frequency coordinator's 
determination. In that event, the burden of proving by clear and 
convincing evidence that the certified frequency coordinator's 
determination is incorrect shall rest with the potential applicant. If a 
licensee has consented to the use of trunking, but later decides against 
the use of trunking, that licensee may request that the licensee(s) of 
the trunked system(s) cease the use of trunking. Should the trunked 
station(s) decline the licensee's request, the licensee may request a 
replacement channel from the Commission. A new applicant whose 
interference contour overlaps the service contour of a trunked licensee 
will be assigned the same channel as the trunked licensee only if the 
trunked licensee consents in writing and a copy of the written consent 
is submitted to the certified frequency coordinator responsible for 
coordination of the application.
    (c) Trunking of systems licensed on paging-only channels or licensed 
in the Radiolocation Service (subpart F) is not permitted.
    (d) Potential applicants proposing trunked operation may file 
written notice with any certified frequency coordinator for the pool 
(Public Safety or Industrial/Business) in which the applicant proposes 
to operate. The notice shall specify the channels on which the potential 
trunked applicant proposes to operate and the proposed effective 
radiated power, antenna pattern, height above ground, height above 
average terrain and proposed channel bandwidth. On receipt of such a 
notice, the certified frequency coordinator shall notify all other 
certified frequency coordinators in the relevant pool within one 
business day. For a period of sixty days thereafter, no application will 
be accepted for coordination which specifies parameters that would 
result in objectionable interference to the channels specified in the 
notice. Potential applicants shall not file another notice for the same 
channels within 10 km (6.2 miles) of the same location unless six months 
shall have elapsed since the filing of the last such notice. Certified 
frequency coordinators shall return without action, any coordination 
request which violates the terms of this paragraph (d).
    (e) No more than 10 channels for trunked operation in the 
Industrial/Business Pool may be applied for in a

[[Page 343]]

single application. Subsequent applications, limited to an additional 10 
channels or fewer, must be accompanied by a certification, submitted to 
the certified frequency coordinator coordinating the application, that 
all of the applicant's existing channels authorized for trunked 
operation have been constructed and placed in operation. Certified 
frequency coordinators are authorized to require documentation in 
support of the applicant's certification that existing channels have 
been constructed and placed in operation. Applicants in the Public 
Safety Pool may request more than 10 channels at a single location 
provided that any application for more than 10 Public Safety Pool 
channels must be accompanied by a showing of sufficient need. The 
requirement for such a showing may be satisfied by submission of loading 
studies demonstrating that requested channels in excess of 10 will be 
loaded with 50 mobiles per channel within a five year period commencing 
with grant of the application.
    (f) If a licensee authorized for trunked operation discontinues 
trunked operation for a period of 30 consecutive days, the licensee, 
within 7 days of the expiration of said 30 day period, shall file a 
conforming application for modification of license with the Commission. 
Upon grant of that application, new applicants may file for the same 
channel or channels notwithstanding the interference contour of the new 
applicant's proposed channel or channels overlaps the service contour of 
the station that was previously engaged in trunked operation.

Sec. 90.205  Power and antenna height limits.

    Applicants for licenses must request and use no more power than the 
actual power necessary for satisfactory operation. Except where 
otherwise specifically provided for, the maximum power that will be 
authorized to applicants whose license applications for new stations are 
filed after August 18, 1995 is as follows:
    (a) Below 25 MHz. For single sideband operations (J3E emission), the 
maximum transmitter peak envelope power is 1000 watts.
    (b) 25-50 MHz. The maximum transmitter output power is 300 watts.
    (c) 72-76 MHz. The maximum effective radiated power (ERP) for 
stations operating on fixed frequencies is 300 watts. Stations operating 
on mobile-only frequencies are limited to one watt transmitter output 
power.
    (d) 150-174 MHz. (1) The maximum allowable station ERP is dependent 
upon the station's antenna HAAT and required service area and will be 
authorized in accordance with table 1. Applicants requesting an ERP in 
excess of that listed in table 1 must submit an engineering analysis 
based upon generally accepted engineering practices and standards that 
includes coverage contours to demonstrate that the requested station 
parameters will not produce coverage in excess of that which the 
applicant requires.
    (2) Applications for stations where special circumstances exist that 
make it necessary to deviate from the ERP and antenna heights in Table 1 
will be submitted to the frequency coordinator accompanied by a 
technical analysis, based upon generally accepted engineering practices 
and standards, that

[[Page 347]]

demonstrates that the requested station parameters will not produce a 
signal strength in excess of 37 dBu at any point along the edge of the 
requested service area. The coordinator may then recommend any ERP 
appropriate to meet this condition.
    (3) An applicant for a station with a service area radius greater 
than 40 km (25 mi) must justify the requested service area radius, which 
will be authorized only in accordance with table 1, note 4. For base 
stations with service areas greater than 80 km, all operations 80 km or 
less from the base station will be on a primary basis and all operations 
outside of 80 km from the base station will be on a secondary basis and 
will be entitled to no protection from primary operations.

Sec. 90.209  Bandwidth limitations.

    (a) Each authorization issued to a station licensed under this part 
will show an emission designator representing the class of emission 
authorized. The designator will be prefixed by a specified necessary 
bandwidth. This number does not necessarily indicate the bandwidth 
occupied by the emission at any instant. In those cases where Sec. 2.202 
of this chapter does not provide a formula for the computation of 
necessary bandwidth, the occupied bandwidth, as defined in part 2 of 
this chapter, may be used in lieu of the necessary bandwidth.
    (b) The maximum authorized single channel bandwidth of emission 
corresponding to the type of emission specified in Sec. 90.207 is as 
follows:
    (1) For A1A or A1B emissions, the maximum authorized bandwidth is 
0.25

[[Page 350]]

kHz. The maximum authorized bandwidth for type A3E emission is 8 kHz.
    (2) For operations below 25 MHz utilizing J3E emission, the 
bandwidth occupied by the emission shall not exceed 3000 Hz. The 
assigned frequency will be specified in the authorization. The 
authorized carrier frequency will be 1400 Hz lower in frequency than the 
assigned frequency. Only upper sideband emission may be used. In the 
case of regularly available double sideband radiotelephone channels, an 
assigned frequency for J3E emissions is available either 1600 Hz below 
or 1400 Hz above the double sideband radiotelephone assigned frequency.
    (3) For all other types of emissions, the maximum authorized 
bandwidth shall not be more than that normally authorized for voice 
operations.
    (4) Where a frequency is assigned exclusively to a single licensee, 
more than a single emission may be used within the authorized bandwidth. 
In such cases, the frequency stability requirements of Sec. 90.213 must 
be met for each emission.
    (5) Unless specified elsewhere, channel spacings and bandwidths that 
will be authorized in the following frequency bands are given in the 
following table.

Sec. 90.210  Emission masks.

    Except as indicated elsewhere in this part, transmitters used in the 
radio services governed by this part must comply with the emission masks 
outlined in this section. Unless otherwise stated, per paragraphs 
(d)(4), (e)(4), and (m) of this section, measurements of emission power 
can be expressed in either peak or average values provided that emission 
powers are expressed with the same parameters used to specify the 
unmodulated transmitter carrier power. For transmitters that do not 
produce a full power unmodulated carrier, reference to the unmodulated 
transmitter carrier power refers to the total power contained in the 
channel bandwidth. Unless indicated elsewhere in this part, the table in 
this section specifies the emission masks for equipment operating in the 
frequency bands governed under this part.

than 150 percent, but not more than 250 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth: At least 35 dB.
    (3) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 43 + 10 log P dB.
    (b) Emission Mask B. For transmitters that are equipped with an 
audio low-pass filter pursuant to Sec. 90.211(a), the power of any 
emission must be below the unmodulated carrier power (P) as follows:
    (1) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 50 percent, but not more than 100 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth: At least 25 dB.
    (2) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 100 percent, but not more than 250 percent of the authorized

emission must be attenuated below the unmodulated carrier output power 
(P) as follows:

peak emission of the equipment under test. In order to show compliance 
with the emissions mask up to and including 50 kHz removed from the edge 
of the authorized bandwidth, adjust the resolution bandwidth to 100 Hz 
with the measuring instrument in a peak hold mode. A sufficient number 
of sweeps must be measured to insure that the emission profile is

than the instrument resolution bandwidth. For emissions beyond 50 kHz 
from the edge of the authorized bandwidth, see paragraph (m) of this 
section. If it can be shown that use of the above instrumentation

whichever is the lesser attenuation.
    (4) The reference level for showing compliance with the emission 
mask shall be established using a resolution bandwidth sufficiently wide 
(usually two to three times the channel bandwidth) to capture the true 
peak emission of the equipment under test. In order to show compliance 
with the emissions mask up to and including 50 kHz removed from the edge 
of the authorized bandwidth, adjust the resolution bandwidth to 100 Hz 
with the measuring instrument in a peak hold mode. A sufficient number 
of sweeps must be measured to insure that the emission profile is 
developed. If video filtering is used, its bandwidth must not be less 
than the instrument resolution bandwidth. For emissions beyond 50 kHz 
from the edge of the authorized bandwidth, see paragraph (m) of this 
section. If it can be shown that use of the above instrumentation

by more than 50 percent of the authorized bandwidth, the power of 
emissions shall be attenuated below the transmitter output power, as 
specified by the following equation, but in no case less than 31 dB:

A=16+0.4 (D-50)+10 log B (attenuation greater than 66 dB is not

Where:

A = attenuation (in decibels) below the maximum permitted output power 
level
D = displacement of the center frequency of the measurement bandwidth 
from the center frequency of the authorized sub-band, expressed as a 
percentage of the authorized bandwidth B
B = authorized bandwidth in megahertz.

inside the licensee's sub-band.

[[Page 354]]

    (4) The resolution bandwidth of the instrumentation used to measure 
the emission power shall be 100 kHz, except that, in regard to paragraph 
(2) of this section, a minimum spectrum analyzer resolution bandwidth of 
300 Hz shall be used for measurement center frequencies within 1 MHz of 
the edge of the authorized subband. If a video filter is used, its 
bandwidth shall not be less than the resolution bandwidth.
    (5) Emission power shall be measured in peak values.

emissions must be attenuated are 902.00, 904.00, 909.5 and 921.75 MHz.
    (l) Other frequency bands. Transmitters designed for operation under 
this part on frequencies other than listed in this section must meet the 
emission mask requirements of Emission Mask B. Equipment operating under 
this part on frequencies allocated to but shared with the Federal 
Government, must meet the applicable Federal Government technical 
standards.
    (m) Instrumentation. The reference level for showing compliance with 
the emission mask shall be established, except as indicated in 
Secs. 90.210 (d), (e), and (k), using standard engineering practices for 
the modulation characteristic used by the equipment under test. When 
measuring emissions in the 150-174 MHz and 421-512 MHz the following 
procedures will apply. A sufficient number of sweeps must be measured to 
insure that the emission profile is developed. If video filtering is 
used, its bandwidth must not be less than the instrument resolution 
bandwidth. For frequencies more than 50 kHz removed from the edge of the 
authorized bandwidth a resolution of at least 10 kHz must be used for 
frequencies below 1000 MHz. Above 1000 MHz the resolution bandwidth of 
the instrumentation must be at least 1 MHz. If it can be shown that use 
of the above instrumentation settings do not accurately represent the 
true interference potential of the equipment under test, then an 
alternate procedure may be used provided prior Commission approval is 
obtained.

Sec. 90.215  Transmitter measurements.

    (a) The licensee of each station shall employ a suitable procedure 
to determine that the carrier frequency of each transmitter authorized 
to operate with an output power in excess of two watts is maintained 
within the tolerence prescribed in Sec. 90.213. This determination shall 
be made, and the results entered in the station records in accordance 
with the following:
    (1) When the transmitter is initially installed;
    (2) When any change is made in the transmitter which may affect the 
carrier frequency or its stability.
    (b) The licensee of each station shall employ a suitable procedure 
to determine that each transmitter authorized to operate with an output 
power in excess of two watts does not exceed the maximum figure 
specified on the current station authorization. On authorizations 
stating only the input power to the final radiofrequency stage, the 
maximum permissible output power is 75 percent for frequencies below 25 
MHz and 60 percent of the input power for frequencies above 25 MHz. If a 
non-DC final radiofrequency stage is utilized, then the output power 
shall not exceed 75 percent of the input power. This determination shall 
be made, and the results thereof entered into the station records, in 
accordance with the following:
    (1) When the transmitter is initially installed;
    (2) When any change is made in the transmitter which may increase 
the transmitter power input.
    (c) The licensee of each station shall employ a suitable procedure 
to determine that the modulation of each transmitter, which is 
authorized to operate with an output power in excess of two watts, does 
not exceed the limits specified in this part. This determination shall 
be made and the following results entered in the station records, in 
accordance with the following:
    (1) When the transmitter is initially installed;
    (2) When any change is made in the transmitter which may affect the 
modulation characteristics.
    (d) The determinations required by paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of 
this section may, at the opinion of the licensee, be made by a qualified 
engineering measurement service, in which case the required record 
entries shall show the name and address of the engineering measurement 
service as well as the name of the person making the measurements.
    (e) In the case of mobile transmitters, the determinations required 
by paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section may be made at a test or 
service bench: Provided, That the measurements are made under load 
conditions equivalent to actual operating conditions; and provided 
further, that after installation in the mobile unit the transmitter is 
given a routine check to determine that it is capable of being received 
satisfactorly by an appropriate receiver.

Sec. 90.219  Use of signal boosters.

    Licensees authorized to operate radio systems in the frequency bands 
above 150 MHz may employ signal boosters at fixed locations in 
accordance with the following criteria:
    (a) The amplified signal is retransmitted only on the exact 
frequency(ies) of the originating base, fixed, mobile, or portable 
station(s). The booster will fill in only weak signal areas and cannot 
extend the system's normal signal coverage area.
    (b) Class A narrowband signal boosters must be equipped with 
automatic gain control circuitry which will limit the total effective 
radiated power (ERP) of the unit to a maximum of 5 watts under all 
conditions. Class B broadband signal boosters are limited to 5 watts ERP 
for each authorized frequency that the booster is designed to amplify.
    (c) Class A narrowband boosters must meet the out-of-band emission 
limits of Sec. 90.209 for each narrowband channel that the booster is 
designed to amplify. Class B broadband signal boosters must meet the 
emission limits of Sec. 90.209 for frequencies outside of the booster's 
design passband.
    (d) Class B broadband signal boosters are permitted to be used only 
in confined or indoor areas such as buildings, tunnels, underground 
areas, etc., or in remote areas, i.e., areas where there is little or no 
risk of interference to other users.
    (e) The licensee is given authority to operate signal boosters 
without separate authorization from the Commission. Certificated 
equipment must be employed and the licensee must ensure that all 
applicable rule requirements are met.
    (f) Licensees employing either Class A narrowband or Class B 
broadband signal boosters as defined in Sec. 90.7 are responsible for 
correcting any harmful interference that the equipment may cause to 
other systems. Normal co-channel transmissions will not be considered as 
harmful interference. Licensees will be required to resolve interference 
problems pursuant to Sec. 90.173(b).

Sec. 90.237  Interim provisions for operation of radioteleprinter and radiofacsimile devices.

    These provisions authorize and govern the use of radioteleprinter 
and radiofacsimile devices for base station use (other than on mobile-
only or paging-only frequencies) in all radio pools and services except 
Radiolocation in this part.
    (a) Information must be submitted with an application to establish 
that the minimum separation between a proposed radioteleprinter or 
radiofacsimile base station and the nearest co-channel base station of 
another licensee operating a voice system is 120 km. (75 mi.) for a 
single frequency mode of operation, or 56 km. (35 mi.) two frequency 
mode of operation. Where this minimum mileage separation cannot be 
achieved, either agreement to the use of F1B, F2B, F3C, G1B, G2B or G3C 
emission must be received from all existing co-channel licensees using 
voice emission within the applicable mileage limits, or if agreement was 
not received, the licensee of the radioteleprinter or radiofacsimile 
system is responsible for eliminating any interference with preexisting 
voice operations. New licenses of voice operations will be expected to 
share equally any frequency occupied by established radioteleprinter or 
radiofacsimile operations.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Transmitters certificated under this part for use of G3E or F3E 
emission may also be used for F1B, F2B, F3C, G1B, G2B or G3C emission 
for radioteleprinter or radiofacsimile, provided the keying signal is 
passed through the low pass audio frequency filter required for G3E or 
F3E emission. The transmitter must be so adjusted and operated that the 
instantaneous frequency deviation does not exceed the maximum value 
allowed for G3E or F3E.
    (d) Frequencies will not be assigned exclusively for F1B, F2B, F3C, 
G1B, G2B or G3C emission for radioteleprinter or radiofacsimile (except 
where specifically provided for in the frequency limitations).
    (e) The requirements in this part applicable to the use of G3E or

eligibility requirements as set forth in Sec. 90.20(a) are extended to 
include park districts and authorities.
    (2) Each application for a station or system shall be accompanied 
by:
    (i) A statement certifying that the transmitting site of the 
Travelers Information Station will be located at least 15 km (9.3 miles) 
measured orthogonally outside the measured 0.5 mV/m daytime contour (0.1 
mV/m for Class A stations) of any AM broadcast station operating on a 
first adjacent channel or at least 130 km (80.6 miles) outside the 
measured 0.5 mV/m daytime contour (0.1 mV/m for Class A stations) of any 
AM broadcast station operating on the same channel, or, if nighttime 
operation is proposed, outside the theoretical 0.5 mV/m-50% nighttime 
skywave contour of a U.S. Class A station. If the measured contour is 
not available, then the calculated 0.5 mV/m field strength contour shall 
be acceptable. These contours are available for inspection at the 
concerned AM broadcast station and FCC offices in Washington, DC.
    (ii) In consideration of possible cross-modulation and inter-
modulation interference effects which may result from the operation of a 
Travelers Information Station in the vicinity of an AM broadcast station 
on the second or third adjacent channel, the applicant shall certify 
that he has considered

[[Page 362]]

these possible interference effects and, to the best of his knowledge, 
does not foresee interference occurring to broadcast stations operating 
on second or third adjacent channels.
    (iii) A map showing the geographical location of each transmitter 
site and an estimate of the signal strength at the contour of the 
desired coverage area. For a cable system, the contour to be shown is 
the estimated field strength at 60 meters (197 feet) from any point on 
the cable. For a conventional radiating antenna, the estimated field 
strength contour at 1.5 km (0.93 mile) shall be shown. A contour map 
comprised of actual on-the-air measurements shall be submitted to the 
Commission within 60 days after station authorization or completion of

basis to stations authorized on a primary basis in the bands 510-1715 
kHz.
    (4) A Travelers Information Station authorization may be suspended, 
modified, or withdrawn by the Commission without prior notice of right 
to hearing if necessary to resolve interference conflicts, to implement 
agreements with foreign governments, or in other circumstances 
warranting such action.
    (5) The transmitting site of each Travelers' Information Station 
shall be restricted to the immediate vicinity of the following specified 
areas: Air, train, and bus transportation terminals, public parks and 
historical sites, bridges, tunnels, and any intersection of a Federal 
Interstate Highway with any other Interstate, Federal, State, or local 
highway.
    (6) A Travelers Information Station shall normally be authorized to 
use a single transmitter. However, a system of stations, with each 
station in the system employing a separate transmitter, may be

voice information pertaining to traffic and road conditions, traffic 
hazard and travel advisories, directions, availability of lodging, rest 
stops and service stations, and descriptions of local points of 
interest. It is not permissible to identify the commercial name of any 
business establishment whose service may be available within or outside 
the coverage area of a Travelers Information Station. However, to 
facilitate announcements concerning departures/arrivals and parking 
areas at air, train, and bus terminals, the trade name identification of 
carriers is permitted.
    (b) Technical standards. (1) The use of 6K00A3E emission will be 
authorized, however N0N emission may be used for purposes of receiver 
quieting, but only for a system of stations employing ``leaky'' cable 
antennas.
    (2) A frequency tolerance of 100 Hz shall be maintained.
    (3) For a station employing a cable antenna, the following

    (2) All authorizations are subject to the condition that no harmful 
interference will be caused to television reception on Channels 4 and 5.
    (3) The applicant must agree to eliminate any harmful interference 
caused by his operation to TV reception on either Channel 4 or 5 that 
might develop by whatever means are necessary. Such action must be taken 
within 90 days of notification by the Commission. If such interference 
is not eliminated within the 90-day period, operation of the fixed 
station will be discontinued.
    (4) Vertical polarization must be used.
    (5) Whenever it is proposed to locate a 72-76 MHz fixed station less 
than 128 km (80 mi.) but more than 16 km (10 mi.) from the site of a TV 
transmitter operating on either channel 4 or 5, or from the post office 
of a community in which such channels are assigned but not in operation, 
the fixed station shall be authorized only if there are fewer than 100 
family dwelling units (as defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census), 
excluding units 112 or more km (70 mi.) distant from the TV antenna 
site, located within a circle centered at the location of the proposed 
fixed station. The radius shall be determined by use of the following 
chart entitled, ``Chart for Determining Radius From Fixed Station in 72-
76 MHz Band to Interference Contour Along Which 10 Percent of Service 
From Adjacent Channel Television Station Would Be Destroyed.'' Two 
charts are available, one for Channel 4, and one for Channel 5. The 
Commission may, however, in a particular case, authorize the location of 
a fixed station within a circle containing 100 or more family dwelling 
units upon a showing that:
    (i) The proposed site is the only suitable location.
    (ii) It is not feasible, technically or otherwise, to use other 
available frequencies.
    (iii) The applicant has a plan to control any interference that 
might develop to TV reception from his operations.
    (iv) The applicant is financially able and agrees to make such 
adjustments in the TV receivers affected as may be necessary to 
eliminate any interference caused by his operations.
    (v) All applications seeking authority to operate with a separation 
of less than 16 km (10 mi.) will be returned without action.
    (b) The following criteria governs the authorization and use of 
frequencies in the 72-76 MHz band by mobile stations in the Industrial/
Business Pool.
    (1) Mobile operation on frequencies in the 72-76 MHz band is subject 
to the condition that no interference is caused to the reception of 
television

[[Page 368]]

stations operating on Channel 4 or 5. Interference will be considered to 
occur whenever reception of a regularly used television signal is 
impaired by signals radiated by stations operating under these rules in 
the 72 to 76 MHz band regardless of the quality of such reception or the 
strength of the signal used. In order to minimize the hazard of such 
interference, it shall be the duty of the licensee to determine whether 
interference is being caused to television reception, wherever 
television receivers other than those under the control of the licensee, 
are located within 31 m. (100 ft.) of any point where the stations 
licensed under these rules may be operated. In any case, it shall be the 
responsibility of the licensee to correct, at its own expense, any such 
interference and if the interference cannot be eliminated by the 
application of suitable techniques, the operation of the offending 
transmitter shall be suspended. If the complainant refuses to permit the 
licensee to apply remedial techniques which demonstrably will eliminate 
the interference without impairment of the original reception, the 
licensee is absolved of further responsibility.
    (2) The maximum transmitter output power that will be authorized is 
1 watt; and each station authorized will be classified and licensed as a 
mobile station. Any units of such a station, however, may be used to 
provide the operational functions of a base or fixed station. The 
antennas of transmitters operating on these frequencies must be directly 
mounted or installed upon the transmitting unit: Except that when 
permanently installed aboard a vehicle, antenna and transmitter may be 
separated as required for convenience in mounting. Horizontal 
polarization will not be allowed; and the gain of antennas employed 
shall not exceed that of a halfwave dipole. The maximum bandwidth that 
will be authorized is 20 kHz. Tone control transmissions are permitted.
    (c) Radio remote control of models is permitted on frequencies 10 
kHz removed from these frequencies authorized for fixed and mobile 
operations in the 72-76 MHz band. Remote control operations are 
secondary to operation of fixed and mobile stations as provided for in 
this section.

Sec. 90.263  Substitution of frequencies below 25 MHz.

    Frequencies below 25 MHz when shown in the radio pool frequency 
listings under this part will be assigned to base or mobile stations 
only upon a satisfactory showing that, from a safety of life standpoint, 
frequencies above 25 MHz will not meet the operational requirements of 
the applicant. These frequencies are available for assignment in many 
areas; however, in individual cases such assignment may be impracticable 
due to conflicting frequency use authorized to stations in other 
services by this and other countries. In such cases, a substitute 
frequency, if found to be available, may be assigned from the following 
bands 1605-1750, 2107-2170, 2194-2495, 2506-2850, 3155-3400, or 4438-
4650 kHz. Since such assignments are in certain instances subject to 
additional technical and operation limitation, it is necessary that each 
application also include precise information concerning transmitter 
output power, type and directional characteristics, if any, of the 
antenna, and the minimum necessary hours of operation. (This section is 
not applicable to the Radiolocation Radio Service, subpart F.)

    (a) Base station authorizations in the 421-430 MHz band will be 
subject to Effective Radiated Power (ERP) and Effective Antenna Height 
(EAH) limitations as shown in the table below. ERP is defined as the 
product of the power supplied to the antenna and its gain relative to a 
half-wave dipole in a given direction. EAH is calculated by subtracting 
the Assumed Average Terrain Elevation (AATE) as listed in table 7 of 
Sec. 90.619 from the antenna height above mean sea level.

secondary fixed tone signaling and alarm operations authorized in 
Sec. 90.235.
    (b) Control stations associated with one or more mobile relay 
stations will be authorized only on the assigned frequency of the 
associated mobile station. Use of a mobile service frequency by a 
control station of a mobile relay system is subject to the condition 
that harmful interference shall not be caused to stations of licensees 
authorized to use the frequency for mobile service communications.

Sec. 90.305  Location of stations.

    (a) The transmitter site(s) for base station(s), including mobile 
relay stations, shall be located not more than 80 km. (50 mi.) from the 
geographic center of the urbanized area listed in Sec. 90.303.
    (b) Mobile units shall be operated within 48 km. (30 mi.) of their 
associated base station or stations. Such units may not be operated 
aboard aircraft in flight except as provided for in Sec. 90.315(i).
    (c) Control stations must be located within the area of operation of 
the mobile units.
    (d) Base and control stations shall be located a minimum of 1.6 km. 
(1 mi.) from local television stations operating on UHF TV channels 
separated by 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 TV channels from the television 
channel in which the base station will operate.


<R05>
Sec. 90.307  Protection criteria.

    The tables and figures listed in Sec. 90.309 shall be used to 
determine the proper power (ERP) and antenna height of the proposed land 
mobile base station and the proper power (ERP) for the associated 
control station (control station antenna height shall not exceed 31 m. 
(100 ft.) above average terrain (AAT)).
    (a) Base stations operating on the frequencies available for land 
mobile use in any listed urbanized area and having an antenna height 
(AAT) less than 152 m. (500 ft.) shall afford protection to co-channel 
and adjacent channel television stations in accordance with the values 
set out in tables A and E of this subpart, except for Channel 15 in New 
York, NY, and Cleveland, OH,

[[Page 383]]

and Channel 16 in Detroit, MI, where protection will be in accordance 
with the values set forth in tables B and E.
    (b) For base stations having antenna heights between 152-914 meters 
(500-3,000 ft.) above average terrain, the effective radiated power must 
be reduced below 1 kilowatt in accordance with the values shown in the 
power reduction graph in Figure A, except for Channel 15 in New York, 
NY, and Cleveland, OH, and Channel 16 in Detroit, MI, where the 
effective radiated power must be reduced in accordance with Figure B. 
For heights of more than 152 m. (500 ft.) above average terrain, the 
distance to the radio path horizon will be calculated assuming smooth 
earth. If the distance so determined equals or exceeds the distance to 
the Grade B contour of a co-channel TV station, (Grade B contour defined 
in Sec. 73.683(a)) an authorization will not be granted unless it can be 
shown that actual terrain considerations are such as to provide the 
desired protection at the Grade B contour, or that the effective 
radiated power will be further reduced so that, assuming free space 
attenuation, the desired protection at the Grade B contour will be 
achieved.
    (c) Mobile units and control stations operating on the frequencies 
available for land mobile use in any given urbanized area shall afford 
protection to co-channel and adjacent channel television stations in 
accordance with the values set forth in table C and paragraph (d) of 
this section except for Channel 15 in New York, NY, and Cleveland, OH, 
and Channel 16 in Detroit, MI, where protection will be in accordance 
with the values set forth in table D and paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) The minimum distance between a land mobile base station which 
has associated mobile units and a protected adjacent channel television 
station is 145 km (90 miles) .
    (e) The television stations to be protected (co-channel, adjacent 
channel, IM, and IF) in any given urbanized area, in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section, are 
identified in the commission's publication ``TV stations to be 
considered in the preparation of Applications for Land Mobile Facilities 
in the Band 470-512 MHz.'' The publication is available at the offices 
of the Federal Communications Commission at Washington, DC or upon the 
request of interested persons.

<R05>
Sec. 90.309  Tables and figures.

    (a) Directions for using the tables. (1) Using the method specified 
in Sec. 73.611 or charts or maps of suitable scale, determine the 
distances (i) between the proposed land mobile base station and the 
protected cochannel television station and (ii) between the proposed 
land mobile base station and the protected adjacent channel television 
station. If the exact mileage does not appear in table A for protected 
cochannel television stations (or table B for Channel 15 in New York and 
Cleveland and channel 16 in Detroit) or table E for protected adjacent 
channel television stations, the next lower mileage separation figure is 
to be used.
    (2) Entering the proper table at the mileage figure found in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, find opposite, a selection of powers 
that may be used for antenna heights ranging from 15 m (50 ft) to 152.5 
m (500 ft) (AAT). If the exact antenna height proposed for the land 
mobile base station does not appear in the proper table, use the power 
figure beneath the next greater antenna height.
    (3) The lowest power found using the tables mentioned in paragraphs 
(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section is the maximum power that may be 
employed by the proposed land mobile base station.
    (4) In determining the average elevation of the terrain, the 
elevations between 3.2 km (2 mi) and 16 km (10 mi) from the antenna site 
are employed. Profile graphs shall be drawn for a minimum of eight 
radials beginning at the antenna site and extending 16 km (10 mi). The 
radials should be drawn starting with true north. At least one radial 
should be constructed in the direction of the nearest cochannel and 
adjacent channel UHF television stations. The profile graph for each 
radial shall be plotted by contour intervals of from 12.2 m (40 ft) to 
30.5 m (100 ft) and, where the data permits, at least 50

[[Page 384]]

points of elevation (generally uniformly spaced) should be used for each 
radial. For very rugged terrain 61 m (200 ft) to 122 m (400 ft) contour 
intervals may be used. Where the terrain is uniform or gently sloping, 
the smallest contour interval indicated on the topographic chart may be 
used. The average elevation of the 12.8 km (8-mile) distance between 3.2 
km (2 mi) and 16 km (10 mi) from the antenna site should be determined 
from the profile graph for each radial. This may be obtained by 
averaging a large number of equally spaced points, by using a 
planimeter, or by obtaining the median elevation (that exceeded by 50 
percent of the distance) in sectors and averaging those values. In the 
preparation of the profile graphs, the elevation or contour intervals 
may be taken from U.S. Geological Survey Topographic Maps, U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers Maps, or Tennessee Valley Authority Maps. Maps with a 
scale of 1:250,000 or larger (such as 1:24,000) shall be used. Digital 
Terrain Data Tapes, provided by the National Cartographic Institute, 
U.S. Geological Survey, may be utilized in lieu of maps, but the number 
of data points must be equal to or exceed that special above. If such 
maps are not published for the area in question, the next best 
topographic information should be used.
    (5) Applicants for base stations in the Miami, FL, urbanized area 
may, in lieu of calculating the height of average terrain, use 3 m (10 
ft) as the average terrain height.

Sec. 90.313  Frequency loading criteria.

    (a) Except as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
maximum channel loading on frequencies in the 470-512 MHz band is as 
follows:
    (1) 50 units for systems eligible in the Public Safety Pool (see 
Sec. 90.20(a)).
    (2) 90 units for systems eligible in the Industrial/Business Pool 
(see Sec. 90.35(a)).
    (b) If a licensee has exclusive use of a frequency, then the loading 
standards in paragraph (a) of this section, may be exceeded. If it is a 
shared channel, the loading standards can be exceeded upon submission of 
a signed statement by all those sharing the channel agreeing to the 
increase.
    (c) A unit is defined as a mobile transmitter-receiver. Loading 
standards will be applied in terms of the number of units actually in 
use or to be placed in use within 8 months following authorization. A 
licensee will be required to show that an assigned frequency pair is at 
full capacity before it may be assigned a second or additional frequency 
pair. Channel capacity may be reached either by the requirements of a 
single licensee or by several users sharing a channel. Until a channel 
is loaded to capacity it will be available for assignment to other users 
in the same area. A frequency pair may be reassigned at distances 64 km. 
(40 mi.), 32 km. (20 mi.) for Channel 15, Chicago; Channel 20, 
Philadelphia; and Channel 17, Washington, or more from the location of 
base stations authorized on that pair without reference to loading at 
the point of original installation. Following authorization, the 
licensee shall notify the Commission either during or at the close of 
the 8 month period of the number of units in operation. In the 
Industrial Radio Services, if the base station facility is to be used by 
more than a single licensee, the frequency assigned to it will not be 
reassigned for use by another facility within 64 km. (40 mi.) or 32 km. 
(20 mi.) where applicable for a period of 12 months, Provided, That the 
facility is constructed within 90 days from the date of the first grant, 
meets the loading standards to at least 50 percent within 9 months, and 
meets all loading standards within 12 months.

Outer Continental Shelf on the south. The frequency bands from 484-485 
and 476-488 MHz will be available for assignment to stations governed by 
this part within Zone B. The boundaries of Zone B are from longitude 
87 deg.45[min] on the east to longitude 95 deg.00[min] on the west and 
from the 3-mile limit along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline on the north to 
the limit of the Outer Continental Shelf on the south. The frequency 
bands from 478-479 and 481-481 MHz will be available for assignment to 
stations governed by this part within Zone C. The boundaries of Zone C 
are from longitude 94 deg.00[min] on the east, the 3-mile limit on the 
north and west, a 281 km (175 mile) radius from the reference point at 
Linares, N.L., Mexico on the southwest, latitude 26 deg.00[min] on the 
south, and the limits of the Outer Continental Shelf on the southeast. 
These frequencies may also be assigned to fixed stations located on 
shore designed to provide communications service within the zone.
    (b) Offshore base/mobile, and offshore and shore fixed stations may 
be authorized.
    (c) F2, F3, F4, F9, and A2, A3, A4, and A9 emissions may be 
authorized.
    (d) Offshore stations shall afford cochannel protection to TV 
stations on

    Note: To determine the maximum permissible effective radiated power:
    (1) As specified in Sec. 73.611 determine the distance between the 
proposed station and the cochannel television station. If the exact 
distance does not appear in table 1 of this section, the next lower 
distance separation is to be used.

    (2) Opposite this distance figure ERPs are given that may be used 
for antenna heights of 30.5, 45 or 61 meters (100, 150 or 200 ft) ASL. 
If the exact antenna height is not shown, the ERP allowed will be that 
shown for the next higher antenna height.
    (e) Shore stations communicating point-to-point with offshore 
stations will be permitted at least the same ERP as the offshore 
station, but only in the direction of the offshore station. A 
directional antenna shall be used and the rearward radiated power from 
the antenna in a sector <plus-minus>22\1/2\ deg. from the line joining 
the shore antenna to the cochannel television station shall not exceed 
those shown in table 2 of this section.

    Note: As an example of the use of tables 1 and 2, assume an offshore 
station located 290 km (180 mi) from TV Channel 17 located in Bude, 
Miss. with an antenna height of 30.5 m (100 ft). Table 1 allows this 
station to operate with 250 W ERP. Now assume the shore station 
communicating with the offshore station is 48 km (30 mi) from the 
offshore station and 241 km (150 mi) from Bude, Miss. The shore station 
antenna height is 152.5 m (500 ft) above ground. The shore station will 
be allowed the same ERP as the offshore station (250 W) in the direction 
of the offshore station. Table 2 indicates that the effective radiated 
power in a sector <<plus-minus><ls-thn-eq> 22\1/2\ deg. from the line 
joining the shore antenna to Bude, Miss. can only be 15 W. Consequently, 
a directional antenna must be used whose minimum front-to-back ratio 
over this 45 deg. sector must be at least 12.2 dB. (250 W forward power 
to 15 W rearward power is a power ratio of 16.6 or 12.2 dB).
    (f) To provide cochannel protection to television stations, no shore 
station will be allowed closer than 193 km (120

[[Page 391]]

miles) from the cochannel television station.
    (g) To provide adjacent channel protection to television stations, 
no shore or offshore station shall be allowed within an 128 km (80 mile) 
distance of the adjacent channel television station.
    (h) Mobile stations shall not operate closer to shore than 6.4 km (4 
miles) beyond the three mile limit and shall not operate with an ERP in 
excess of 100 watts with 9.1 m (30 ft) maximum antenna height.
    (i) Mobile stations installed in aircraft shall operate 11 km (7 
miles) beyond the three mile limit and shall not operate with an ERP in 
excess of 1 watt or at heights in excess of 305 m (1000 feet) AMSL.
    (j) The following frequency bands are available for assignment in 
all services for use in the Zones as defined in paragraph (a) of this

Sec. 90.317  Fixed ancillary signaling and data transmissions.

    (a) Licensees of systems that have exclusive-use status in their 
respective geographic areas may engage in fixed ancillary signaling and 
data transmissions, subject to the following requirements:
    (1) All such ancillary operations must be on a secondary, non-
interference basis to the primary mobile operation of any other 
licensee.
    (2) The output power at the remote site shall not exceed 30 watts.
    (3) Any fixed transmitters will not count toward meeting the mobile 
loading requirements nor be considered in whole or in part as a 
justification for authorizing additional frequencies in the licensee's 
mobile system.
    (4) Automatic means must be provided to deactivate the remote 
transmitter in the event the carrier remains on for a period in excess 
of three minutes.
    (5) Operational fixed stations authorized pursuant to the provisions 
of this paragraph are exempt from the requirements of Secs. 90.425 and 
90.429.
    (6) If the system is licensed on 470-512 MHz conventional 
frequencies, and exclusivity has been achieved through the aggregate 
loading of more than a single co-channel licensee, then a licensee must 
obtain the concurrence of other co-channel licensees prior to commencing 
such ancillary operations.
    (b) Licensees of systems that do not have exclusive-use status in 
their respective geographic areas may conduct fixed ancillary signaling 
and data transmissions only in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 90.235 of this part.

Sec. 90.350  Scope.

    The Intelligent Transportation Systems radio service is for the 
purpose of integrating radio-based technologies into the nation's 
transportation infrastructure and to develop and implement the nation's 
intelligent transportation systems. It includes the Location and 
Monitoring Service (LMS) and Dedicated Short Range Communications 
Service (DSRCS). Rules as to eligibility for licensing, frequencies 
available, and any special requirements for services in the Intelligent 
Transportation Systems radio service are set forth in this subpart.

[64 FR 66410, Nov. 26, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 90.351  Location and Monitoring Service.

    These provisions authorize the licensing of systems in the Location 
and Monitoring Service (LMS). LMS systems utilize non-voice radio 
techniques to determine the location and status of mobile radio units. 
LMS licensees authorized to operate a system in the 902-928 MHz band may 
serve individuals, federal government agencies, and entities eligible 
for licensing in this part 90.
    (a) Each application to license an LMS system shall include the 
following supplemental information:
    (1) A detailed description of the manner in which the system will 
operate, including a map or diagram.
    (2) The necessary or occupied bandwidth of emission, whichever is 
greater.
    (3) The data transmission characteristics as follows:
    (i) The vehicle location update rates;
    (ii) Specific transmitter modulation techniques used;
    (iii) For codes and timing scheme: A table of bit sequences and 
their alphanumeric or indicator equivalents, and a statement of bit rise 
time, bit transmission rates, bit duration, and interval between bits;
    (iv) A statement of amplitude-versus-time of the interrogation and 
reply formats, and an example of a typical message transmission and any 
synchronizing pulses utilized.
    (4) A plan to show the implementation schedule during the initial 
license term.
    (b) LMS stations are exempted from the identification requirements 
of Sec. 90.425; however, the Commission may impose automatic station 
identification requirements when determined to be necessary for 
monitoring and enforcement purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 90.353  LMS operations in the 902-928 MHz band.

    LMS systems may be authorized within the 902-928 MHz band, subject 
to the conditions in this section. LMS licensees are required to 
maintain whatever records are necessary to demonstrate compliance with 
these provisions and must make these records available to the Commission 
upon request:
    (a) LMS operations will not cause interference to and must tolerate 
interference from industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) devices and 
radiolocation Government stations that operate in the 902-928 MHz band.
    (b) LMS systems are authorized to transmit status and instructional 
messages, either voice or non-voice, so long as they are related to the 
location or monitoring functions of the system.
    (c) LMS systems may utilize store and forward interconnection, where 
either transmissions from a vehicle or object being monitored are stored 
by the LMS provider for later transmission over the public switched 
network (PSN), or transmissions received by the LMS provider from the 
PSN are stored for later transmission to the vehicle or object being 
monitored. Real-time interconnection between vehicles or objects being 
monitored and the PSN will only be permitted to enable emergency 
communications related to a vehicle or a passenger in a vehicle. Such 
real-time, interconnected communications may only be sent to or received 
from a system dispatch point or entities eligible in the Public Safety 
or Special Emergency Radio Services. See subparts B and C of this part.
    (d) Multilateration LMS systems will be authorized on a primary 
basis within the bands 904-909.75 MHz and 921.75-927.25 MHz. 
Additionally, multilateration and non-

[[Page 393]]

multilateration systems will share the 919.75-921.75 MHz band on a co-
equal basis. Licensing will be on the basis of Economic Areas (EAs) for 
multilateration systems, with one exclusive EA license being issued for 
each of these three sub-bands. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of 
this section, multilateration EA licensees may be authorized to operate 
on only one of the three multilateration bands within a given EA. 
Additionally, EA multilateration LMS licenses will be conditioned upon 
the licensee's ability to demonstrate through actual field tests that 
their systems do not cause unacceptable levels of interference to 47 CFR 
part 15 devices.
    (e) Multilateration EA-licensed systems and grandfathered AVM 
systems (see Sec. 90.363) are authorized on a shared basis and must 
cooperate in the selection and use of frequencies in accordance with 
Section 90.173(b).
    (f) Multilateration EA licensees may be authorized to operate on 
both the 919.75-921.75 MHz and 921.75-927.25 MHz bands within a given EA 
(see Sec. 90.209(b)(10)).
    (g) Multilateration LMS systems whose primary operations involve the 
provision of vehicle location services, may provide non-vehicular 
location services.
    (h) Non-multilateration stations are authorized to operate on a 
shared, non-exclusive basis in the 902-904 MHz and 909.75-921.75 MHz 
sub-bands. Non-multilateration systems and multilateration systems will 
share the 919.75-921.75 MHz band on a co-equal basis. Non-
multilateration LMS systems may not provide non-vehicular location 
services. The maximum antenna height above ground for non-
multilateration LMS systems is 15 meters.
    (i) Non-multilateration LMS licenses will be issued on a site-by-
site basis, except that municipalities or other governmental operatives 
may file jointly for a non-multilateration license covering a given U.S. 
Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis Economic Area (EA). 
Such an application must identify all planned sites. After receiving the 
license, the non-multilateration EA licensee must notify the Commission 
if sites are deleted or if new sites are added, before those sites may 
be put into operation.

Sec. 90.355  LMS operations below 512 MHz.

    Applications requiring not more than 25 kHz bandwidth per frequency 
in the 25-50 MHz, 150-170 MHz, and 450-512 MHz bands may use either 
base-mobile frequencies currently assigned the applicant, or be assigned 
base-mobile frequencies available in the service in which eligibility 
has been established, provided that:
    (a) For transmission between vehicles and base stations, each 
frequency in a single-frequency mode of operation will provide location 
data for approximately 200 vehicles, or both frequencies in a two-
frequency mode of operation will provide location data for approximately 
400 vehicles, except that for frequencies in the 450-512 MHz band that 
are assigned in pairs in accordance with the allocation plan for the 
band, the requirement is that location data be provided for 
approximately 200 vehicles for each frequency pair; and a showing is 
made that 50 percent of the vehicles will be in operation within the 
system by the end of the second year of the initial license term, and 70 
percent will be in operation within the system by the end of the initial 
license term; except that if these vehicle loading standards will not be 
met, frequencies will be assigned only on a secondary non-interference 
basis to any authorized radiotelephony operation.
    (b) The minimum separation between a proposed LMS station and the 
nearest co-channel base station of another licensee operating a voice 
system is 75 miles (120 km) for a single frequency mode of operation or 
35 miles (56 km) for a two-frequency mode of operation. Where the 
minimum mileage separation cannot be achieved, agreement to the use of 
F1D, F2D, G1D, G2D or P0N emission must be received from all existing 
co-channel licensees using voice emissions within the applicable mileage 
limits. If there is interference with voice operations and required 
agreement was not received, or operation was authorized on a secondary 
non-interference basis, the licensee of the

[[Page 394]]

LMS system is responsible for eliminating the interference.
    (c) Frequencies additional to any assigned under paragraph (a) of 
this section will not be assigned to the same licensee at any stations 
located within 64 km (40 miles) of any station in which the licensee 
holds an interest until each of such licensee's frequencies for LMS 
operation is shown to accommodate not less than 90 percent of the 
frequency loading requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section.

governing the radio service in which their facilities are licensed; and 
licensees may not, through written or oral agreements or otherwise, 
relieve themselves of any duty or obligation imposed upon them, by law, 
as licensees.
    (c) Except for stations that have been granted exclusive channels 
under this part and that are classified as commercial mobile radio 
service providers pursuant to part 20 of this chapter, each licensee 
must restrict all transmissions to the minimum practical transmission 
time and must employ an efficient operating procedure designed to 
maximize the utilization of the spectrum.
    (d) Communications involving the imminent safety-of-life or property 
are to be afforded priority by all licensees.
    (e) Licensees shall take reasonable precautions to avoid causing 
harmful interference. This includes monitoring the transmitting 
frequency for communications in progress and such other measures as may 
be necessary to minimize the potential for causing interference.
    (f) Stations licensed in this part shall not continuously radiate an 
unmodulated carrier except where required for tests as permitted in 
Sec. 90.405, except where specifically permitted by this part, where 
specifically authorized in the station authorization, or on an as needed 
basis in the Radiolocation Radio Service.
    (g) The radiations of the transmitter shall be suspended immediately

[43 FR 54791, Nov. 22, 1978, as amended at 62 FR 18933, Apr. 17, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 90.419  Points of communication.

    Normally, operations licensed under this part are intended to 
provide intrastation mobile communications. For example, a base station 
is intended to communicate with its associated mobile stations and 
mobile stations are intended to communicate between associated mobile 
stations and associated base stations of the licensee. Accordingly, 
operations between base stations at fixed locations are permitted only 
in the following situations:
    (a) Base stations licensed under subpart T of this part and those in 
the Public Safety Pool that operate on frequencies below 450 MHz, may 
communicate on a secondary basis with other base stations, operational 
fixed stations, or fixed receivers authorized in these services or 
pools.
    (b) Base stations licensed on any frequency in the Industrial/
Business Pool and on base stations frequencies above 450 MHz in the 
Public Safety Pool may communicate on a secondary basis with other base 
stations, operational fixed stations, or fixed receivers authorized in 
these pools only when:
    (1) The messages to be transmitted are of immediate importance to 
mobile stations; or
    (2) Wireline communications facilities between such points are 
inoperative, economically impracticable, or unavailable from 
communications common carrier sources. Temporary unavailability due to a 
busy wireline

[[Page 399]]

circuit is not considered to be within the provisions of this paragraph.
    (c) Operational fixed stations may communicate with units of 
associated mobile stations only on a secondary basis.
    (d) Operational fixed stations licensed in the Industrial/Business 
Pool may communicate on a secondary basis with associated base stations 
licensed in these services when:
    (1) The messages to be transmitted are of immediate importance to 
mobile stations; or
    (2) Wireline communications facilities between such points are 
inoperative, economically impracticable, or unavailable from 
communications common carrier sources. Temporary unavailability due to a 
busy wireline circuit is not considered to be within the provisions of 
this paragraph.
    (e) Travelers' Information Stations are authorized to transmit 
certain information to members of the traveling public (see 
Sec. 90.242).
    (f) CMRS Licensees in the SMR categories of part 90, subpart S, CMRS 
providers authorized in the 220 MHz service of part 90, subpart T, CMRS 
paging operations as defined by part 90, subpart P and for-profit 
interconnected business radio services with eligibility defined by 
section 90.75 are permitted to utilize their assigned spectrum for fixed 
services on a co-primary basis with their mobile operations.

[61 FR 45356, Aug. 29, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 18933, Apr. 17, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 90.421  Operation of mobile station units not under the control of the licensee.

    Mobile stations, as defined in Sec. 90.7, include vehicular-mounted 
and hand-held units. Such units may be operated by persons other than 
the licensee, as provided for below, when necessary for the licensee to 
meet its requirements in connection with the activities for which it is 
licensed. If the number of such units, together with units operated by 
the licensee, exceeds the number of mobile units authorized to the 
licensee, license modification is required. The licensee is responsible 
for taking necessary precautions to prevent unauthorized operation of 
such units not under its control.
    (a) Public Safety Pool. (1) Mobile units licensed in the Public 
Safety Pool may be installed in any vehicle which in an emergency would 
require cooperation and coordination with the licensee, and in any 
vehicle used in the performance, under contract, of official activities 
of the licensee. This provision does not permit the installation of 
radio units in non-emergency vehicles that are not performing 
governmental functions under contract but with which the licensee might 
wish to communicate.
    (2) Mobile units licensed under Sec. 90.20(a)(2)(iii) may be 
installed in a vehicle or be hand-carried for use by any person with 
whom cooperation or coordinations is required for medical services 
activities.
    (3) On the Interoperability Channels in the 700 MHz Public Safety 
Band (See Sec. 90.531(b)(1)), hand-held and vehicular transmitters may 
be operated by any licensee holding a license in the 700 MHz Public 
Safety Band or by any licensee holding a license for any other public 
safety frequency pursuant to part 90 of the Commission's rules. 
Therefore, individual licenses are not required for hand-held and 
vehicular transmitters in the 700 MHz Band.
    (b) Industrial/Business Pool. Mobile units licensed in the 
Industrial/Business Pool may be installed in vehicles of persons 
furnishing under contract to the licensee and for the duration of the 
contract, a facility or service directly related to the activities of 
the licensee.
    (c) In addition to the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, frequencies assigned to licensees in the Private Land 
Mobile Radio Services may be installed in the facilities of those who 
assist the licensee in emergencies and with whom the licensee must 
communicate in situations involving imminent safety to life or property.

<R05>
Sec. 90.423  Operation on board aircraft.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this 
section, and except as may be provided in other sections of this part 
with respect to operation on specific frequencies, mobile stations first 
authorized after September 14, 1973, under this part may be

[[Page 400]]

operated aboard aircraft for air-to-mobile, air-to-base, air-to-air and 
air-to-ship communications subject to the following:
    (1) Operations are limited to aircraft that are regularly flown at 
altitudes below 1.6 km (1 mi) above the earth's surface;
    (2) Transmitters are to operate with an output power not to exceed 
ten watts;
    (3) Operations are secondary to land-based systems;
    (4) Such other conditions, including additonal reductions of 
altitude and power limitations, as may be required to minimize the 
interference potential to land-based systems.
    (b) Exceptions to the altitude and power limitations set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section may be authorized upon a showing of 
unusual operational requirements which justify departure from those 
standards, provided that the interference potential to regular land-
based operations would not be increased.
    (c) Mobile operations aboard aircraft in the services governed by 
this part, under licenses in effect September 14, 1973, may be continued 
without regard to provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, as 
follows:
    (1) Operations may be continued only for the balance of the term of 
such licenses if aircraft involved are regularly flown at altitudes 
greater than 1.6 km (1 mi) above the earth's surface.
    (2) Operations may be continued for one additional renewal license 
term if the aircraft involved are regularly flown at altitudes below 1.6 
km (1 mi) above the earth's surface.
    (d) Operation of radiolocation mobile stations may be authorized 
without regard to limitations and conditions set forth in paragraphs 
(a), (b), and (c) of this section.

[43 FR 54791, Nov. 22, 1978, as amended at 58 FR 44960, Aug. 25, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 90.425  Station identification.

    Stations licensed under this part shall transmit identification in 
accordance with the following provisions:
    (a) Identification procedure. Except as provided for in paragraphs 
(d) and (e) of this section, each station or system shall be identified 
by the transmission of the assigned call sign during each transmission 
or exchange of transmissions, or once each 15 minutes (30 minutes in the 
Public Safety Pool) during periods of continuous operation. The call 
sign shall be transmitted by voice in the English language or by 
International Morse Code in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section. If the station is employing either analog or digital voice 
scrambling, or non-voice emission, transmission of the required 
identification shall be in the unscrambled mode using A3E, F3E or G3E 
emission, or International Morse, with all encoding disabled. 
Permissible alternative identification procedures are as follows:
    (1) A mobile relay stations call sign may be used to identify the 
associated control and mobile stations, except in the Public Safety Pool 
where the stations operate on frequencies below 450 MHz. Alternatively, 
a base station (including a mobile relay station) which is controlled by 
radio may be identified by the transmission of the call sign of the 
station at which communications originate.
    (2) One or more fixed relay stations may be identified by the 
transmission of the call signs of the stations at which the 
communications originate.
    (3) When a mobile station transmits on a different frequency than 
its associated base station, the assigned call sign of either the mobile 
station or the base station may be transmitted. Further, a single mobile 
unit in the licensee's authorized geographic area of operation may 
transmit station identification on behalf of any other operating mobile 
units in the fleet.
    (4) Use of an identifier other than the assigned call sign. (i) In 
the Public Safety Pool, mobile units licensed to a governmental entity 
and which operate on frequencies above 30 MHz may use an identifier 
which contains, at a minimum, the name of the licensee if the licensee 
maintains at the station a list of the special identifiers to be used by 
the mobile units.
    (ii) In the Industrial/Business Pool, licensees may request the 
Commission's local Engineer-in-Charge to approve the use of special 
mobile unit identifiers in lieu of the assigned call sign. Such 
requests, however, will not

[[Page 401]]

be granted where it appears that harmful interference to international 
operations may be caused by stations below 50 MHz, or by stations 
operating in areas within 80 km (50 miles) of an international boundary, 
or where it appears that the proposed method of identification will not 
adequately distinguish the mobile units of the applicant from the mobile 
units of other licensees in the area.
    (iii) In the Industrial/Business Pool, railroad licensees (as 
defined in Sec. 90.7) may identify stations by the name of the railroad 
and the train number, caboose number, engine number, or the name of the 
fixed wayside station. If none of these forms are practicable, any 
similar name or number may be designated by the railroad concerned for 
use by its employees in the identification of fixed points or mobile 
units; Provided, That, a list of such identifiers is maintained by the 
railroad. An abbreviated name or the initials of the railroad may be 
used where such are in general usage. In those areas where it is shown 
that no difficulty would be encountered in identifying the transmission 
of a particular station (as, for example, where stations of one licensee 
are located in a yard isolated from other radio installations), approval 
may be given to a request from the licensee for permission to omit the 
station identification.
    (5) Use of identifiers in addition to assigned call signs. Nothing 
in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the transmission of 
station or unit identifiers which may be necessary or desirable for 
system operation, Provided, That, they are transmitted in addition to 
the assigned station call sign or other permissible form of 
identification.
    (b) Use of automatic Morse code identification equipment. 
Automatically activated equipment may be used to transmit station 
identification in International Morse Code pursuant to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The signal output of the automatic identification equipment 
shall be connected to the transmitter at the microphone input or any 
other manufacturer-provided signal input terminal and shall be adjusted 
to produce 40 percent <plus-minus> 10 percent of the maximum permissible 
modulation or deviation level. This adjustment shall be performed when 
all other modulating signals are absent.
    (2) The Morse code transmission rate shall be maintained between 20 
and 25 words per minute.
    (3) The frequency of the keyed tone comprising the identification 
signal shall be 1200 <plus-minus> 800 Hz. A licensee may be required to 
change the frequency in order to prevent interference to the operations 
of another co-channel licensee.
    (4) Should activation of automatic Morse code identification 
equipment interrupt the communications of another co-channel licensee, 
the Commission may require the use of equipment which will delay 
automatic station identification until such co-channel communications 
are completed.
    (c) Special provisions for identification in the Radiolocation 
Service. (1) Stations in the Radiolocation Service are not required to 
identify except upon specific instruction from the Commission or as 
required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Stations in the Radiolocation Service operating on frequencies 
above 3400 kHz that employ spread spectrum techniques shall transmit a 
two-letter manufacturer's designator, authorized by the Commission on 
the station authorization, at the beginning and ending of each 
transmission and once every 15 minutes during periods of continuing 
operation. The designator shall be transmitted in International Morse 
Code at a speed not exceeding 25 words per minute, and the spread 
spectrum mode of operation shall be maintained while the designator is 
being transmitted. The identifying signal shall be clearly receivable in 
the demodulated audio of a narrow-band FM receiver.
    (d) General exemptions. A station need not transmit identification 
if:
    (1) It is a mobile station operating on the transmitting frequency 
of the associated base station.
    (2) It is a mobile station in the Public Safety Pool using F1E or 
G1E emission.
    (3) It is transmitting for telemetering purposes or for the 
activation of devices which are employed solely as a means of attracting 
attention, or for remote control purposes, or which is

[[Page 402]]

retransmitting by self-actuating means, a radio signal received from 
another radio station or stations.
    (4) It is any type of radiopositioning or radar station authorized 
in a service other than the Radiolocation Service.
    (5) It is used solely for automatic vehicle monitoring or location.
    (6) It is a paging station authorized in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 90.20(a)(2)(v).
    (7) It is a mobile station employing non-voice emissions and the 
associated base station identifies on behalf of the mobile unit(s).
    (8) It is a base or mobile station in the 220-222 MHz band 
authorized to operate on a nationwide basis in accordance with subpart T 
of this part.
    (9) It is a wireless microphone station operating in accordance with 
the provisions of Sec. 90.265(b).
    (e) Special provisions for stations licensed under this part that 
are classified as CMRS providers under part 20 of this chapter.
    (1) Station identification will not be required for 929-930 MHz 
nationwide paging licensees or MTA or EA-based SMR licensees. All other 
CMRS stations will be required to comply with the station identification 
requirements of this paragraph.
    (2) CMRS stations subject to a station identification requirement 
will be permitted to use a single call sign for commonly owned 
facilities that are operated as part of a single system. The call sign 
must be transmitted each hour within five minutes of the hour, or upon 
completion of the first transmission after the hour.
    (3) CMRS stations granted exclusive channels may transmit their call 
signs digitally. The station licensee must provide the Commission with 
information sufficient to decode the digital transmission to ascertain 
the transmitted call sign.

when the transmitter circuits have been placed in a condition to produce 
radiation. The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to hand-
carried transmitters or transmitters installed on motorcycles. The 
control point for a transmitter utilized to activate another radio 
station may employ a single pilot lamp or meter as an indication of the 
activation of local and remote transmitters.
    (2) Facilities which will permit the person responsible for the 
operation of the transmitter either to disconnect the dispatch point 
circuits from the transmitter or to render the transmitter inoperative 
from any dispatch point under his supervision; and
    (3) Facilities which will permit the person responsible for the 
operation of the transmitter to turn the transmitter carrier on and off 
at will.
    (e) Dispatch point. A dispatch point is any position from which 
messages may be transmitted under the supervision of the person at a

methods of transmitter control and interconnection (see the definition 
in Sec. 90.7) of radio systems authorized under this part.

[44 FR 67124, Nov. 23, 1979, as amended at 62 FR 18934, Apr. 17, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 90.461  Direct and remote control of transmitters.

    (a) In general. Radio transmitters may be operated and controlled 
directly (as when the operating position for the transmitter and the 
transmitter being operated are at the same location), or remotely (as 
when the transmitter being operated and the position from which it is 
being operated are at different locations).

[[Page 405]]

    (b) Control of transmitters at remote locations. Radio transmitters 
at remote locations may be operated and controlled through the use of 
wire line or radio links; or through dial-up circuits, as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section. Such control links or circuits may be 
either those of the licensee or they may be provided by common carriers 
authorized by law to furnish such service.
    (c) Dial-up circuits. Dial-up circuits may be provided by wire line 
telephone companies under appropriate tariffs, and they may be used by 
licensees for purposes of transmitter control, provided:
    (1) The dial-up circuits serve only to link licensed transmitter 
control points and the transmitters being controlled.
    (2) The dial-up circuits are so designed that the transmitters being 
controlled cannot be operated from any fixed position other than the 
licensed control points for those transmitters.
    (3) Equipment used to provide the transmitter/dial-up-circuit 
interface is designed to preclude associated mobile units of the 
licensee from reaching any point(s) served by the wire line telephone 
facilities other than the control point(s) of the station(s) controlled.
    (4) Any direct electrical connection to the telephone network shall 
comply with applicable tariffs and with part 68 of the Commission's 
Rules (See Sec. 90.5(j)).
    (5) Interconnection, within the meaning of Secs. 90.7 and 90.477 
through 90.483, may not take place at a control point which connects to 
its associated transmitter(s) through dial-up circuits; nor may such 
dial-up transmitter control circuits be used in conjunction with (or 
shared by) interconnection equipment.

<R05>
Sec. 90.463  Transmitter control points.

    (a) A control operator is required to be stationed at the operating 
position of a transmitter control point. A control operator is any 
person designated by the licensee to exercise supervision and control 
over the operation and use of the licensee's facilities. The control 
operator may be the licensee; or an employee of the licensee; or the 
agent of the licensee, appointed by the licensee to act as the control 
operator; or a third-party contractor, engaged by the licensee to serve 
as the control operator: Provided, however, In no case, through 
appointment or designation of any person to serve as control operator, 
may the licensee delegate any of the duties and responsibilities the 
licensee may have in his capacity as licensee.
    (b) Each station or licensed system of communication shall normally 
have a control point, or control points, at which the control operator 
or operators are stationed and at or from which the licensee may 
exercise supervision and control over the authorized facilities, as 
required by the provisions of Sec. 90.461. Provided, however, Control 
point requirements may vary from one system to another, depending upon 
the nature of the radio operation; the way and by whom the facilities 
are employed; and other factors, as set out in other rule sections under 
this subpart.
    (c) A transmitter control point may be located at a fixed position 
in a system of communication at or from which the control operator 
exercises supervision and control over the operation and use of the 
licensed facilities. Each fixed transmitter control point shall have 
equipment and facilities to permit the control operator:
    (1) To determine when the transmitter or transmitters controlled are 
either radiating ``RF'' energy, or when the transmitter circuits have 
been placed in a condition to produce such radiation. This may be 
accomplished either through the use of a carrier operated device which 
provides a visual indication when the transmitter(s) are radiating or a 
pilot lamp or meter which provides a visual indication when the 
transmitter circuits have been placed in a condition to produce 
radiation. Further, where a local transmitter is used to activate a 
remote transmitter or transmitters in the licensee's system of 
communication, a single pilot lamp or meter may be employed to indicate 
the activation of both the local and the remote transmitter(s).
    (2) To turn the carrier of the transmitter on and off at will, or to 
close

[[Page 406]]

the system down completely, when circumstances warrant such action.
    (d) The licensee's transmitting facilities may be operated from 
dispatch points, the fixed control point shall have equipment to permit 
the control operator to either disconnect the dispatch point circuits 
from the transmitter(s) or to render the transmitter(s) inoperative from 
any dispatch point being supervised.
    (e) Where the system is interconnected with public communication 
facilities, as provided at Secs. 90.477 through 90.483, and where those 
rules so require, the fixed control point shall be equipped to permit 
the control operator:
    (1) To monitor co-channel facilities of other licensees sharing an 
assigned channel or channels with the licensee in the licensee's area of 
operation; and,
    (2) To terminate any transmission(s) or communication(s) between 
points in the public communications system and the private 
communications system.
    (f) In urban areas, the location of fixed transmitter control points 
will be specified, ``same as transmitter,'' unless the control point is 
at a street address which is different from that of the transmitter(s) 
controlled. In rural areas, the location of fixed control points will be 
specified, ``same as transmitter,'' unless the control point is more 
than 152.5 m (500 ft) from the transmitter(s) controlled. In the latter 
case, the approximate location of the control point will be specified in 
distance and direction from the transmitter(s) controlled in terms of 
distance and geographical quadrant, respectively. It would be assumed 
that the location of a fixed control point is the same as the location 
of the transmitter(s) controlled, unless the applicant includes a 
request for a different location described in appropriate terms as 
indicated herein.
    (g) [Reserved]
    (h) Mobile transmitters shall be assumed to be under the immediate 
control of the mobile operator; provided, however, overall supervision 
and control of the operation and use of a communication system may be 
the responsibility of a fixed control point operator. In general, mobile 
transmitters shall be equipped to permit the operator to determine when 
they are radiating ``RF'' energy or when the transmitter circuits have 
been placed in a condition to produce such radiation. This may be 
accomplished either through the use of a carrier operated device or of a 
pilot lamp or meter which will provide a visual indication when the 
transmitter is radiating or has been placed in a condition to produce 
radiation provided, however, that hand-carried or pack-carried 
transmitters and transmitters installed on motorcycles need not be so 
equipped.

<R05>
Sec. 90.465  Control of systems of communication.

    (a) Depending on design considerations, control of a system of 
communication may be exercised in varying ways. In single frequency 
simplex, base/mobile operations, control may be exercised by the control 
operator at the fixed control point. In mobile relay systems, where 
there is an associated control point or control station, control may be 
exercised by the operator at the control point or control station. In 
mobile-only systems, control may be exercised by the mobile operator. In 
communication systems involving multiple base stations or fixed relays 
control of the system may result from a combination of factors and 
considerations, including control by a fixed control point operator at 
some point within the system of communication or control by the mobile 
station operator of the licensee.
    (b) In internal systems, as defined at Sec. 90.7 control may be 
maintained by conforming the system to the requirements of Secs. 90.471 
through 90.475.
    (c) In interconnected systems, as defined at Sec. 90.7 control may 
be maintained by conforming operation and system design to that 
permitted at Secs. 90.477 through 90.483.

Sec. 90.467  Dispatch points.

    Dispatch points meeting the requirements of this section need not be 
specifically authorized; provided, however, that the licensee of any 
radio station operated from a dispatch point or points shall assume full 
responsibility for the use and operation of the authorized facilities in 
compliance with all applicable provisions of law or rule and shall 
comply with the policy:
    (a) A dispatch point may be linked to the transmitter(s) being 
operated by private or leased wire line of fixed radio circuits, 
provided the requirements of Sec. 90.463 are met.
    (b) No telephone position in the public, switched, telephone network 
will be treated as a dispatch point within the meaning or intent of this 
section.
    (c) Operation of transmitting facilities from dispatch points is 
permitted only when the control operator at a fixed control point in the 
system is on duty and at no other time.


<R05>
Sec. 90.469  Unattended operation.

    (a) Subject to the provisions of Secs. 90.243, 90.245, and 90.247, 
mobile relay, fixed relay, and mobile repeater stations are authorized 
for unattended operation; and the transmitter control point requirements 
set out at Secs. 90.463 through 90.465 shall not apply.
    (b) Self-activated transmitters may be authorized for unattended 
operation where they are activated by either electrical or mechanical 
devices, provided the licensee adopts reasonable means to guard against 
malfunctions and harmful interference to other users.

                  Internal Transmitter Control Systems


<R05>
Sec. 90.471  Points of operation in internal transmitter control systems.

    The transmitting facilities of the licensee may be operated from 
fixed positions located on premises controlled by the licensee. The 
fixed position may be part of a private telephone exchange or it may be 
any position in a closed or limited access communications facility 
intended to be used by employees of the licensee for internal 
communications and transmitter control purposes. Operating positions in 
internal transmitter control systems are not synonymous with dispatch 
points (See Sec. 90.467) nor with telephone positions which are part of 
the public, switched telephone network; and the scheme of regulation is 
to be considered and treated as being different. See Secs. 90.485 
through 90.489.

<R05>
Sec. 90.473  Operation of internal transmitter control systems through licensed fixed control points.

    An internal transmitter control system may be operated under the 
control and supervision of a control operator stationed at a fixed 
control point in the system. In such a case, the control point must be 
equipped to permit the control operator to monitor all traffic to and 
from fixed positions and mobile stations or paging units of the 
licensee; and the system shall be so designed to permit the control 
operator to either disconnect any operating position in the internal 
system from the transmitter control circuit or to close the system down 
entirely at will.

[44 FR 67125, Nov. 23, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 90.475  Operation of internal transmitter control systems in specially equipped systems.

    (a) An internal transmitter control system need not be designed to 
meet the requirements of Sec. 90.473 if it meets the following 
requirements:
    (1) All operating positions must be located on premises controlled 
by the licensee.
    (2) An internal transmitter control system may be used in 
conjunction with other approved methods of transmitter control and 
interconnection so long as the internal transmitter control system, 
itself, is neither accessed from telephone positions in the public 
switched telephone network, nor used dial-up circuits in the public 
switched telephone network. Licensees with complex communications 
systems involving fixed systems whose base stations are controlled by 
such systems may automatically access these base stations through the 
microwave or operational fixed systems from positions in the PSTN, so 
long as the base stations and mobile units meet the requirements of 
Sec. 90.483 and if a separate circuit is provided for each mode of

[[Page 408]]

transmitter operation (i.e., conventional, dial-up or internal).
    (3) The system must be designed so that upon completion of a 
transmission, the base station transmitter(s) will close down 
automatically within 3 seconds.
    (4) To guard against malfunctions, the system must also be designed 
so that the base station(s) will be deactivated by an automatic timing 
device when a modulated signal is not transmitted for a period of three 
(3) consecutive minutes.
    (5) The system must include automatic monitoring equipment, 
installed at the base station transmitter site(s), which will prevent 
the activation of the system when signals of other co-channel stations 
are present.

<R05>
Sec. 90.477  Interconnected systems.

    (a) Applicants for new land stations to be interconnected with the 
public switched telephone network must indicate on their applications 
(class of station code) that their stations will be interconnected. 
Licensees of land stations that are not interconnected may interconnect 
their stations with the public switched telephone network only after 
modifying their license. See Sec. 1.929 of this chapter. In all cases a 
detailed description of how interconnection is accomplished must be 
maintained by licensees as part of their station records. See 
Sec. 90.433 of this part.
    (b) In the frequency ranges 806-824 MHz, 851-869 MHz, 896-901 MHz, 
and 935-940 MHz, interconnection with the public switched telephone 
network is authorized under the following conditions:
    (1) Interconnected operation is on a secondary basis to dispatch 
operation. This restriction will not apply to trunked systems or on any 
channel assigned exclusively to one licensee.
    (2) Interconnection may be accomplished at any location through a 
separate or shared interconnection device. When land stations subject to 
this part are multiple licensed or shared by authorized users, 
arrangements for telephone service must be made with a duly authorized 
carrier by users, licensees, or their authorized agents on a non-profit 
cost sharing basis. When telephone service costs are shared, at least 
one licensee participating in the cost sharing arrangement must maintain 
cost sharing records and the costs must be distributed at least once a 
year. Licensees, users, or their authorized agents may also make joint 
use arrangements with a duly authorized carrier and arrange that each 
licensee or user pay the carrier directly for the licensee's or user's 
share of the joint use of the shared telephone service. A report of the 
cost distribution must be placed in the licensee's station records and 
made available to participants in the sharing and the Commission upon 
request. In all cases, arrangements with the duly authorized carrier 
must disclose the number of licensees and users and the nature of the 
use.
    (c) Interconnection of facilities in the Radiolocation Service 
(subpart F) will not be permitted.
    (d) In the frequency ranges below 800 MHz, interconnection with the 
public

[[Page 409]]

switched telephone network is authorized under the following conditions:
    (1) Interconnected operation is on a secondary basis to dispatch 
operation. This restriction will not apply to trunked systems or on any 
channel assigned exclusively to one licensee.
    (2) Interconnection may be accomplished at any location through a 
separate or shared interconnection device. When land stations subject to 
this part are multiple licensed or shared by authorized users, 
arrangements for telephone service must be made with a duly authorized 
carrier by users, licensees, or their authorized agents on a non-profit 
cost sharing basis. When telephone service costs are shared, at least 
one licensee participating in the cost sharing arrangement must maintain 
cost sharing records and the costs must be distributed at least once a 
year. Licensees, users, or their authorized agents may also make joint 
use arrangements with a duly authorized carrier and arrange that each 
licensee or user pay the carrier directly for the licensee's or user's 
share of the joint use of the shared telephone service. A report of the 
cost distribution must be placed in the licensee's station records and 
made available to participants in the sharing and the Commission upon 
request. In all cases, arrangements with the duly authorized carrier 
must disclose the number of licensees and users and the nature of the 
use.
    (3) For licensees in the Industrial/Business Pool and those 
licensees who establish eligibility pursuant to Sec. 90.20(a)(2) of this 
part, except for Secs. 90.20(a)(2)(i) and 90.20(a)(2)(ii) of this part 
and medical emergency systems in the 450-470 MHz band, interconnection 
will be permitted only where the base station site or sites proposed 
stations are located 120 km (75 mi.) or more from the designated centers 
of the urbanized areas listed below. If these licensees seek to connect 
within 120 km (75 mi.) of the 25 cities, they must obtain the consent of 
all co-channel licensees located both within 120 km (75 mi.) of the 
center of the city; and within 120 km (75 mi.) of the interconnected 
base station transmitter. The consensual agreements among the co-channel 
licensees must specifically state the terms agreed upon and a statement 
must be submitted to the Commission indicating that all co-channel 
licensees have consented to the use of interconnection. If a licensee 
has agreed to the use of interconnection on the channel, but later 
decides against the use of interconnection, the licensee may request 
that the co-channel licensees reconsider the use of interconnection. If 
the licensee is unable to reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, 
the licensee may request that the Commission consider the matter and 
assign it to another channel. If a new licensee is assigned to a 
frequency where all the co-channel licensees have agreed to the use of 
interconnection and the new licensee does not agree, the new licensee 
may request that the co-channel licensees reconsider the use of 
interconnection. If the new licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-
channel licensees it may request that the Commission reassign it to 
another channel.

<R05>
Sec. 90.483  Permissible methods and requirements of interconnecting private and public systems of communications.

    Interconnection may be accomplished by commercial mobile service 
providers licensed under this part by any technically feasible means. 
Interconnection may be accomplished by private mobile service providers 
either manually or automatically under the supervision and control of a 
transmitter control operator at a fixed position in the authorized 
system of communications or it may be accomplished under the supervision 
and control of mobile operators, and is subject to the following 
provisions:
    (a) Where a system is interconnected manually at a fixed control 
point, the control point operator must maintain the capability to turn 
the carrier of the transmitter off or to de-activate the system 
completely when circumstances warrant such action.
    (b) When the system is interconnected automatically it may be 
supervised at the control point or in mobile units.
    (1) For control point supervision, the following is required:
    (i) The control point operator must maintain the capability to turn 
the carrier of the transmitter off or to de-activate the system 
completely when circumstances warrant such action.
    (ii) When a frequency is shared by more than one system, automatic 
monitoring equipment must be installed at the base station to prevent 
activation of the transmitter when signals of co-channel stations are 
present and activation would interfere with communications in progress. 
Licensees may operate without the monitoring equipment if they have 
obtained the consent of all co-channel licensees located within a 120 km 
(75 mile) radius of the interconnected base station transmitter. A 
statement must be submitted to the Commission indicating that all co-
channel licensees have consented to operate without the monitoring 
equipment. If a licensee has agreed that the use of monitoring equipment 
is not necessary, but later decides that the monitoring equipment is 
necessary, the licensee may request that the co-channel licensees 
reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the licensee cannot reach 
an agreement with co-channel licensees, the licensee may request that 
the Commission consider the matter and assign it to another channel. If 
a new licensee is assigned to a frequency where all the co-channel 
licensees have agreed that the use of monitoring equipment is not 
necessary, and the new licensee does not agree, the new licensee may 
request the co-channel licensees to reconsider the use of monitoring 
equipment. If the new licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel 
licensees, it should request a new channel from the Commission. Systems 
on frequencies above 800 MHz are exempt from this requirement.
    (2) For mobile unit supervision, the following is required:
    (i) When a frequency is shared by more than one system, automatic 
monitoring equipment must be installed at

[[Page 411]]

each base station to prevent its activation when signals of other co-
channel stations are present and activation would interfere with 
communications in progress. Licensees may operate without this equipment 
if they have obtained the consent of all co-channel licensees located 
within a 120 km (75 mile) radius of the interconnected base station 
transmitter. A statement must be submitted to the Commission indicating 
that all co-channel licensees have consented to operate without the 
monitoring equipment. If a licensee has agreed that the use of 
monitoring equipment is not necessary, but later decides that the 
monitoring equipment is necessary, the licensee may request that the co-
channel licensees reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the 
licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, the 
licensee may request that the Commission consider the matter and assign 
it to another channel. If a new licensee is assigned to a frequency 
where all the co-channel licensees have agreed that the use of 
monitoring equipment is not necessary, and the new licensee does not 
agree, the new licensee may request the co-channel licensees to 
reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the new licensee cannot 
reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, it should request a new 
channel from the Commission. Systems above 800 MHz are exempt from this 
requirement.
    (ii) Initial access from points within the public switched telephone 
network must be limited to transmission of a 3-second tone, after which 
time the transmitter shall close down. No additional signals may be 
transmitted until acknowledgement from a mobile station of the licensee 
is received. Licensees are exempt from this requirement if they have 
obtained the consent of all co-channel licensees located within a 120 km 
(75 mile) radius of the interconnected base station transmitter. 
However, licensees may choose to set their own time limitations. A 
statement must be submitted to the Commission indicating that all co-
channel licensees have consented to operate without the monitoring 
equipment. If a licensee has agreed that the use of monitoring equipment 
is not necessary, but later decides that the monitoring equipment is 
necessary, the licensee may request that the co-channel licensees 
reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the licensee cannot reach 
an agreement with co-channel licensees, the licensee may request that 
the Commission consider the matter and assign it to another channel. If 
a new licensee is assigned to a frequency where all the co-channel 
licensees have agreed that the use of monitoring equipment is not 
necessary, and the new licensee does not agree, the new licensee may 
request the co-channel licensees to reconsider the use of monitoring 
equipment. If the new licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel 
licensees, it should request a new channel from the Commission. Systems 
above 800 MHz are exempt from this requirement.
    (c) In single frequency systems, equipment must be installed at the 
base station which will limit any single transmission from within the 
public switched telephone network to 30 seconds duration and which in 
turn will activate the base station receiver to monitor the frequency 
for a period of not less than three (3) seconds. The mobile station must 
be capable of terminating the communications during the three (3) 
seconds. Licensees are exempt from this requirement if they have 
obtained the consent of all co-channel licensees located within a 120 km 
(75 mile) radius of the interconnected base station transmitter. 
However, licensees may choose to set their own time limitations. A 
statement must be submitted to the Commission indicating that all co-
channel licensees have consented to operate without the monitoring 
equipment. If a licensee has agreed that the use of monitoring equipment 
is not necessary, but later decides that the monitoring equipment is 
necessary, the licensee may request that the co-channel licensees 
reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the licensee cannot reach 
an agreement with co-channel licensees, the licensee may request that 
the Commission consider the matter and assign it another channel. If a 
new licensee is assigned to a frequency where all the co-channel 
licensees have agreed that the use of monitoring equipment. If the

[[Page 412]]

new licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, it 
should request a new channel from the Commission.
    (d) A timer must be installed at the base station transmitter which 
limits communications to three (3) minutes. After three (3) minutes, the 
system must close down, with all circuits between the base station and 
the public switch telephone network disconnected. This provision does 
not apply to systems which establish eligibility pursuant to 
Secs. 90.20(a)(1)(i), 90.20(a)(1)(ii), and 90.20(a)(2), except 
Secs. 90.20(a)(2)(i) and 90.20(a)(2)(ii), or who are Power, Petroleum, 
or Railroad licensees (as defined in Sec. 90.7), or to systems above 800 
MHz. All systems must be equipped with a timer that closes down the 
transmitter within three minutes of the last transmission. Licensees may 
operate without these requirements if they have obtained the consent of 
all co-channel licensees located within a 120 km (75 mile) radius of the 
interconnected base station transmitter. However, licensees may choose 
to set their own time limitations. A statement must be submitted to the 
Commission indicating that all co-channel licensees have consented to 
operate without the monitoring equipment. If a licensee has agreed that 
the use of monitoring equipment is not necessary, but later decides that 
the monitoring equipment is necessary, the licensee may request that the 
co-channel licensees reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the 
licensee cannot reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, the 
licensee may request that the Commission consider the matter and assign 
it to another channel. If a new licensee is assigned to a frequency 
where all the co-channel licensees have agreed that the use of 
monitoring equipment is not necessary, and the new licensee does not 
agree, the new licensee may request the co-channel licensees to 
reconsider the use of monitoring equipment. If the new licensee cannot 
reach an agreement with co-channel licensees, it should request a new 
channel from the Commission.

                      Subpart P--Paging Operations


<R05>
Sec. 90.490  One-way paging operations in the private services.

    (a) Subject to specific prohibition or restriction by rule 
provisions governing the radio service in which a licensee's radio 
system is authorized, paging operations are permitted:
    (1) Where the signals and messages are transmitted by a control 
operator of the licensee stationed at a licensed control point in the 
licensee's system of communication.
    (2) Where the signals and messages are transmitted from an operating 
position within an internal system of communication which meets the 
tests of Secs. 90.471 through 90.475.
    (3) Where the signals and messages are transmitted from a dispatch 
point within the licensee's system of communication, as defined as 
Sec. 90.7.
    (b) Systems employing dial-up circuits (Sec. 90.461(c)) may be used 
in one-way paging operations, but only where the paging signals are 
transmitted as provided at paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (c) Paging may be initiated directly from telephone positions in the 
public switched telephone network. When land stations are multiple 
licensed or otherwise shared by authorized users, arrangements for the 
telephone service must be made with a duly authorized carrier by users, 
licensees, or their authorized agents on a non-profit, cost-shared 
basis. When telephone service costs are shared, at least one licensee 
participating in the cost sharing arrangements must maintain cost 
sharing records and the costs must be distributed at least once a year. 
Licensees, users, or their authorized agents may also make joint use 
arrangements

[[Page 413]]

with a duly authorized carrier and arrange that each licensee or user 
pay the carrier directly for the licensee's or user's share of the joint 
use of the shared telephone service. A report of the cost distribution 
must be placed in the licensee's station records and made available to 
participants in the sharing arrangement and the Commission upon request. 
In all cases, arrangements with the duly authorized carrier must 
disclose the number of licensees and users and the nature of the use.

    This subpart sets forth the regulations governing the licensing and 
operations of all systems operating in the 764-776 MHz and 794-806 MHz 
frequency bands. It includes eligibility, operational, planning and 
licensing requirements and technical standards for stations licensed in 
these bands. The rules in this subpart are to be read in conjunction 
with the applicable requirements contained elsewhere in this part; 
however, in case of conflict, the provisions of this subpart shall 
govern with respect to licensing and operation in these frequency bands.


<R05>
Sec. 90.523  Eligibility.

    This section implements the definition of public safety services 
contained in 47 U.S.C. Sec. 337(f)(1). The following are eligible to 
hold Commission authorizations for systems operating in the 764-776 MHz 
and 794-806 MHz frequency bands:

state, city, county, town, or similar State or local governmental entity 
is eligible to hold authorizations in the 764-776 MHz and 794-806 MHz 
frequency bands.
    (b) Nongovernmental organizations. A nongovernmental organization 
(NGO) that provides services, the sole or principal purpose of which is 
to protect the safety of life, health, or property, is eligible to hold 
an authorization for a system operating in the 764-776 MHz and 794-806 
MHz frequency bands for transmission or reception of communications 
essential to providing such services if (and only for so long as) the 
NGO applicant/licensee:
    (1) Has the ongoing support (to operate such system) of a state or 
local governmental entity whose mission is the oversight of or provision 
of services, the sole or principal purpose of which is to protect the 
safety of life, health, or property;

Sec. 90.525  Administration of Interoperability channels

    (a) States are responsible for administration of the 
Interoperability channels in the 764-776 MHz and 794-806 MHz frequency 
bands. Base and control stations must be licensed individually. A public 
safety entity meeting the requirements of Sec. 90.523 may operate mobile 
or portable units on the Interoperability channels in the 764-776 MHz 
and 794-806 MHz frequency bands without a specific authorization from 
the Commission provided it holds a part 90 license. All persons 
operating mobile or portable units under this authority are responsible 
for compliance with part 90 of these rules and other applicable federal 
laws.
    (b) License applications for Interoperability channels in the 764-
776 MHz and 794-806 MHz frequency bands must be approved by a state-
level agency or organization responsible for administering state 
emergency communications. States may hold the licenses for 
Interoperability channels or approve other qualified entities to hold 
such licenses. States may delegate the approval process for 
Interoperability channels to another entity, such as regional planning 
committees.

<R05>
Sec. 90.527  Regional plan requirements.

    Each regional planning committee must submit a regional plan for 
approval by the Commission.
    (a) Common elements. Regional plans must incorporate the following 
common elements:
    (1) Identification of the document as the regional plan for the 
defined region with the names, business addresses, business telephone 
numbers, and organizational affiliations of the chairpersons and all 
members of the planning committee.
    (2) A summary of the major elements of the plan and an explanation 
of how all eligible entities within the region were given an opportunity 
to participate in the planning process and to have their positions heard 
and considered fairly.
    (3) A general description of how the spectrum would be allotted 
among the various eligible users within the region with an explanation 
of how the requirements of all eligible entities within the region were 
considered and, to the degree possible, met.
    (4) An explanation as to how needs were assigned priorities in areas 
where not all eligible entities could receive licenses.
    (5) An explanation of how the plan had been coordinated with 
adjacent regions.
    (6) A detailed description of how the plan put the spectrum to the 
best possible use by requiring system design with minimum coverage 
areas, by assigning frequencies so that maximum frequency reuse and 
offset channel use may be made, by using trunking, and by requiring 
small entities with minimal requirements to join together in using a 
single system where possible.
    (7) A detailed description of the future planning process, 
including, but not limited to, amendment process, meeting announcements, 
data base maintenance, and dispute resolution.
    (8) A certification by the regional planning chairperson that all 
planning committee meetings, including subcommittee or executive 
committee meetings, were open to the public.
    (b) Modification of regional plans. Regional plans may be modified 
by submitting a written request, signed by the regional planning 
committee, to

[[Page 417]]

the Chief, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau. The request must contain 
the full text of the modification, and must certify that successful 
coordination of the modification with all adjacent regions has occurred 
and that all such regions concur with the modification.


<R05>
Sec. 90.529  State License.

    (a) Narrowband channels designated as state channels in Sec. 90.531 
are licensed to each state (as defined in Sec. 90.7) as follows:
    (1) Each state that chooses to take advantage of the spectrum 
designated as state channels must file an application for up to 2.4 
megahertz of this spectrum no later than December 31, 2001. For purposes 
of this section, the elected chief executive (Governor) of each state, 
or his or her designee, shall be deemed the person authorized to apply 
for the State License.
    (2) What ever part of this 2.4 megahertz that a state has not 
applied for by December 31, 2001, will revert to General Use and be 
administered by the relevant RPC (or RPCs in the instances of states 
that encompass multiple RPCs).
    (b) Each state license will be granted subject to the condition that 
the state certifies on or before each applicable benchmark date that it 
is:
    (1) providing or prepared to provide ``substantial service'' to one-
third of their population or territory by January 1, 2012, i.e., within 
five years of the date that incumbent broadcasters are required to 
relocate to other portions of the spectrum;
    (2) providing or prepared to provide ``substantial service'' to two-
thirds of their population or territory by January 1, 2017, i.e., within 
ten years of the date that incumbent broadcasters are required to 
relocate to other portions of the spectrum.
    (c) The Commission will deem a state ``prepared to provide 
substantial service'' if the licensee certifies that a radio system has 
been approved and funded for implementation by the deadline date. 
``Substantial service'' refers to the construction and operation of 700 
MHz facilities by public safety entities providing service which is 
sound, favorable , and substantially above a level of mediocre service 
which just might minimally warrant renewal.
    (d) If a state licensee fails to meet any condition of the grant the 
state license is modified automatically to the frequencies and 
geographic areas where the state certifies that it is providing 
substantial service.
    (e) Any recovered state license spectrum will revert to General Use. 
However, spectrum licensed to a state under a state license remains 
unavailable for reassignment to other applicants until the Commission's 
database reflects the parameters of the modified state license.

eligibles subject to Commission-approved regional planning committee 
regional plans.
    (d) Combining channels. At the discretion of the appropriate 
regional planning committee, contiguous channels may be used in 
combination in order to accommodate requirements for larger bandwidth 
emissions, in accordance with this paragraph. As an exception to this 
general rule, channels designated for nationwide interoperability use 
must not be combined with channels that are not designated for 
nationwide interoperability use.
    (1) Narrowband. Two or four contiguous narrowband (6.25 kHz) 
channels may be used in combination as 12.5 kHz or 25 kHz channels, 
respectively. The lower (in frequency) channel for two channel 
combinations must be an odd (i.e., 1, 3, 5 8 * * *) numbered channel. 
The lowest (in frequency) channel for four channel combinations must be 
a channel whose number is equal to 1+(4xn), where n = any integer 
between 0 and 479, inclusive (e.g., channel number 1, 5, * * * 1917). 
Channel combinations are designated by the lowest and highest channel 
numbers separated by a hyphen, e.g., ``1-2'' for a two channel 
combination and ``1-4'' for a four channel combination.
    (2) Wideband. Two or three contiguous wideband (50 kHz) channels may 
be used in combination as 100 kHz or 150 kHz channels, respectively. The 
lower (in frequency) channel for two channel combinations must be a 
channel whose number is equal to 1+(3xn) or 2+(3xn), where n = any 
integer between 0 and 79, inclusive (e.g., channel number 1, 2, 5, 6, * 
* * 238, 239). The lowest (in frequency) channel for three channel 
combinations must be a channel whose number is equal to 1+(3xn), where n 
= any integer between 0 and 79, inclusive (e.g., channel number 1, 5, * 
* * 238). Channel combinations are designated by the lowest and highest 
channel numbers separated by a hyphen, e.g., ``1-2'' for a two channel 
combination and ``1-3'' for a three channel combination.
    (e) Channel pairing. In general, channels must be planned and 
assigned in base/mobile pairs that are separated by 30 MHz. However, 
until December 31, 2006, channels other than those listed in paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (c)(1), may be planned and assigned in base/mobile pairs 
having a different separation, where necessary because 30 MHz base/
mobile pairing is precluded by the presence of one or more co-channel or 
adjacent channel TV/DTV broadcast stations.

channel whose number is equal to 1+(4xn), where n = any integer between 
0 and 479, inclusive (e.g., channel number 1, 5, * * * 1917). Channel 
combinations are designated by the lowest and highest channel numbers 
separated by a hyphen, e.g., ``1-2'' for a two channel combination and 
``1-4'' for a four channel combination.
    (2) Wideband. Two or three contiguous wideband (50 kHz) channels may 
be used in combination as 100 kHz or 150 kHz channels, respectively. The 
lower (in frequency) channel for two channel combinations must be a 
channel whose number is equal to 1+(3xn) or 2+(3xn), where n = any 
integer between 0 and 79, inclusive (e.g., channel number 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 
8, * * * 238, 239). The lowest (in frequency) channel for three channel 
combinations must be a channel whose number is equal to 1+(3xn), where n 
= any integer between 0 and 79, inclusive (e.g., channel number 1, 4, 7, 
10, * * * 238). Channel combinations are designated by the lowest and 
highest channel numbers separated by a hyphen, e.g., ``1-2'' for a two 
channel combination and ``1-3'' for a three channel combination.

Sec. 90.533  Transmitting sites near the U.S./Canada or U.S./Mexico border.

    This section applies to each license to operate one or more public 
safety transmitters in the 764-776 MHz and 794-806 MHz bands, at a 
location or locations North of Line A (see Sec. 90.7) or within 120 
kilometers (75 miles) of the U.S.-Mexico border, until such time as 
agreements between the government of the United States and the 
government of Canada or the government of the United States and the 
government of Mexico, as applicable, become effective governing border 
area non-broadcast use of these bands. Public safety licenses are 
granted subject to the following conditions:
    (a) Operation of public safety transmitters must not cause harmful 
interference to the reception of television broadcasts transmitted by 
UHF TV broadcast stations located in Canada or Mexico. In addition, 
public safety base, control, and mobile transmitters must comply with 
the interference protection criteria in Sec. 90.545 for TV/DTV stations 
in Canada and Mexico.
    (b) Public safety facilities must accept any interference that may 
be caused by operations of UHF television broadcast transmitters in 
Canada and Mexico.
    (c) Conditions may be added during the term of the license, if 
required by the terms of international agreements between the government 
of the United States and the government of Canada or the government of 
the United States and the government of Mexico, as applicable, regarding 
non-broadcast use of the 764-776 MHz and 794-806 MHz bands.

Sec. 90.535  Modulation and spectrum usage efficiency requirements.

    Transmitters designed to operate in 764-776 MHz and 794-806 MHz 
frequency bands must meet the following modulation standards:
    (a) All transmitters in the 764-776 MHz and 794-806 MHz frequency 
bands

[[Page 421]]

must use digital modulation. Mobile and portable transmitters may have 
analog modulation capability only as a secondary mode in addition to its 
primary digital mode. Mobile and portable transmitters that only operate 
on the low power channels designated in Secs. 90.531(b)(3), 
90.531(b)(4), are exempt from this digital modulation requirement.
    (b) Transmitters designed to operate in the narrowband segment using 
digital modulation must be capable of maintaining a minimum data rate of 
4.8 kbps per 6.25 kHz of bandwidth.
    (c) Transmitters designed to operate in the wideband segment using 
digital modulation must be capable of maintaining a minimum data rate of 
384 kbps per 150 kHz of bandwidth.

Sec. 90.537  Trunking requirement.

    (a) General use channels. All systems using six or more narrowband 
channels in the 764-776 MHz and 794-806 MHz frequency bands must be 
trunked systems, except for those described in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (b) Interoperability channels. Trunking is permitted only on 
Interoperability channels specified in Sec. 90.531(b)(1)(iii). Trunked 
use must be strictly on a secondary, non-interference basis to 
conventional operations. The licensee must monitor and immediately 
release these channels when they are needed for interoperability 
purposes.

Sec. 90.539  Frequency stability.

    Transmitters designed to operate in 764-776 MHz and 794-806 MHz 
frequency bands must meet the frequency stability requirements in this 
section.
    (a) Mobile, portable and control transmitters must normally use 
automatic frequency control (AFC) to lock on to the base station signal.
    (b) The frequency stability of base transmitters operating in the 
narrowband segment must be 100 parts per billion or better.
    (c) The frequency stability of mobile, portable, and control 
transmitters operating in the narrowband segment must be 400 parts per 
billion or better when AFC is locked to the base station. When AFC is 
not locked to the base station, the frequency stability must be at least 
1.0 ppm for 6.25 kHz, 1.5 ppm for 12.5 kHz (2 channel aggregate), and 
2.5 ppm for 25 kHz (4 channel aggregate).
    (d) The frequency stability of base transmitters operating in the 
wideband segment must be 1 part per million or better.
    (e) The frequency stability of mobile, portable and control 
transmitters operating in the wideband segment must be 1.25 parts per 
million or better when AFC is locked to a base station, and 5 parts per 
million or better when AFC is not locked.

Sec. 90.543  Emission limitations.

    Transmitters designed to operate in 764-776 MHz and 794-806 MHz 
frequency bands must meet the emission limitations in this section.
    (a) The adjacent channel coupled power (ACCP) requirements for 
transmitters designed for various channel sizes are shown in the 
following tables. Mobile station requirements apply to

[[Page 422]]

handheld, car mounted and control station units. The tables specify a 
maximum value for the ACCP relative to maximum output power as a 
function of the displacement from the channel center frequency. In 
addition, the ACCP for a mobile station transmitter at the specified 
frequency displacement must not exceed the value shown in the tables. 
For transmitters that have power control, the latter ACCP requirement 
can be met at maximum power reduction. In the following charts, ``(s)'' 
means a swept measurement is to be used.

    (b) ACCP measurement procedure. The following are procedures for 
making transmitter measurements. For time division multiple access 
(TDMA) systems, the measurements are to be made under TDMA operation 
only during time slots when the transmitter is on. All measurements must 
be made at the input to the transmitter's antenna. Measurement bandwidth 
used below implies an instrument that measures the power in many narrow 
bandwidths (e.g. 300 Hz) and integrates these powers across a larger 
band to determine power in the measurement bandwidth.
    (1) Setting reference level. Using a spectrum analyzer capable of 
ACCP measurements, set the measurement bandwidth to the channel size. 
For example, for a 6.25 kHz transmitter, set the measurement bandwidth 
to 6.25 kHz; for a 150 kHz transmitter, set the measurement bandwidth to 
150 kHz. Set the frequency offset of the measurement bandwidth to zero 
and adjust the center frequency of the spectrum analyzer to give the 
power level in the measurement bandwidth. Record this power level in dBm 
as the ``reference power level''.
    (2) Measuring the power level at frequency offsets <600kHz. Using a 
spectrum analyzer capable of ACCP measurements, set the measurement 
bandwidth as shown in the tables above. Measure the ACCP in dBm. These 
measurements should be made at maximum power. Calculate the coupled 
power by subtracting the measurements made in this step from the 
reference power measured in the previous step. The absolute ACCP values 
must be less than the values given in the table for each condition 
above.
    (3) Measuring the power level at frequency offsets 
<ls-thn-eq>600kHz. Set a spectrum analyzer to 30 kHz resolution 
bandwidth, 1 MHz video bandwidth and sample mode detection. Sweep 
<plus-minus>6 MHz from the carrier frequency. Set the reference level to 
the RMS value of the transmitter power and note the absolute power. The 
response at frequencies greater than 600 kHz must be less than the 
values in the tables above.
    (4) Upper power limit measurement. The absolute coupled power in dBm 
measured above must be compared to the table entry for each given 
frequency offset. For those mobile stations with power control, these 
measurements should be repeated with power control at maximum power 
reduction. The absolute ACCP at maximum power reduction must be less 
than the values in the tables above.
    (c) Out-of-band emission limit. On any frequency outside of the 
frequency ranges covered by the ACCP tables in this section, the power 
of any emission must be reduced below the unmodulated carrier power (P) 
by at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.
    (d) Authorized bandwidth. Provided that the ACCP requirements of 
this section are met, applicants may request any authorized bandwidth 
that does not exceed the channel size.
    (e) For operations in the 764 to 776 MHz and 794 to 806 MHz bands, 
all emissions including harmonics in the band 1559-1610 MHz shall be 
limited to -70 dBW/MHz equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) 
for wideband signals, and -80 dBW EIRP for discrete emissions of less 
than 700 Hz bandwidth. For the purpose of equipment authorization, a 
transmitter shall be tested with an antenna that is representative of 
the type that will be used with the equipment in normal operation.
    (f) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require 
greater attenuation than specified in this section.

Sec. 90.545  TV/DTV interference protection criteria.

    Public safety base, control, and mobile transmitters in the 764-776 
MHz and 794-806 MHz frequency bands must be operated only in accordance 
with the rules in this section, to reduce the potential for interference 
to public reception of the signals of existing TV and DTV broadcast 
stations transmitting on TV Channels 62, 63, 64, 65, 67, 68 or 69.
    (a) D/U ratios. Licensees of public safety stations must choose site 
locations that are a sufficient distance from co-channel and adjacent 
channel TV and DTV stations, and/or must use reduced transmitting power 
or transmitting antenna height such that the following minimum desired 
signal to undesired signal ratios (D/U ratios) are met:
    (1) The minimum D/U ratio for co-channel stations is 40 dB at the 
hypothetical Grade B contour (64 dB[mu]V/m) (88.5 kilometers or 55.0 
miles) of the TV station or 17 dB at the equivalent Grade B contour (41 
dB[mu]V/m) (88.5 kilometers or 55.0 miles) of the DTV station.
    (2) The minimum D/U ratio for adjacent channel stations is 0 dB at 
the hypothetical Grade B contour (64 dB[mu]V/m) (88.5 kilometers or 55.0 
miles) of the TV station or -23 dB at the equivalent Grade B contour (41 
dB[mu]V/m) (88.5 kilometers or 55.0 miles) of the DTV station.
    (b) Maximum ERP and HAAT. The maximum effective radiated power (ERP) 
and the antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) of the proposed land 
mobile base station, the associated control station, and the mobile 
transmitters shall be determined using the methods described in this 
section.
    (1) Each base station is limited to a maximum ERP of 1000 watts.
    (2) Each control station is limited to a maximum ERP of 200 watts 
and a maximum HAAT of 61 m. (200 ft).
    (3) Each mobile station is limited to a maximum ERP of 30 watts and 
a maximum antenna height of 6.1 m. (20 ft.).
    (4) Each portable (handheld) transmitter is limited to a maximum ERP 
of 3 watts.
    (5) All transmitters are subject to the power reductions given in 
Figure B of Sec. 90.309 of this chapter, for antenna heights higher than 
152 meters (500 ft).
    (c) Methods. The methods used to calculate TV contours and antenna 
heights above average terrain are given in Secs. 73.683 and 73.684 of 
this chapter. Tables to determine the necessary minimum distance from 
the public safety station to the TV/DTV station, assuming that the TV/
DTV station has a hypothetical or equivalent Grade B contour of 88.5 
kilometers (55.0 miles), are located in Sec. 90.309 and labeled as 
Tables B, D, and E. Values between those given in the tables may be 
determined by linear interpolation. The locations of existing and 
proposed TV/DTV stations during the transition period are given in Part 
73 of this chapter and in the final proceedings of MM Docket No. 87-268.

    The transition period is scheduled to end on December 31, 2006. 
After that time, unless otherwise directed by the Commission, public 
safety stations will no longer be required to protect reception of co-
channel or adjacent channel TV/DTV stations.

[[Page 426]]

    (1) Licensees of stations operating within the ERP and HAAT limits 
of paragraph (b) must select one of three methods to meet the TV/DTV 
protection requirements, subject to Commission approval:
    (i) utilize the geographic separation specified in the tables 
referenced below;
    (ii) submit an engineering study justifying the proposed separations 
based on the actual parameters of the land mobile station and the actual 
parameters of the TV/DTV station(s) it is trying to protect; or,
    (iii) obtain written concurrence from the applicable TV/DTV 
station(s). If this method is chosen, a copy of the agreement must be 
submitted with the application.
    (2) The following is the method for geographic separations.
    (i) Base stations having an antenna height (HAAT) less than 152 m. 
(500 ft.) shall afford protection to co-channel and adjacent channel TV/
DTV stations in accordance with the values specified in Table B (co-
channel frequencies based on 40 dB protection) and Table E (adjacent 
channel frequencies based on 0 dB protection) in Sec. 90.309 of this 
part. For base stations having an antenna height (HAAT) between 152-914 
meters (500-3,000 ft.) the effective radiated power must be reduced 
below 1 kilowatt in accordance with the values shown in the power 
reduction graph in Figure B in Sec. 90.309 of this part. For heights of 
more than 152 m. (500 ft.) above average terrain, the distance to the 
radio path horizon will be calculated assuming smooth earth. If the 
distance so determined equals or exceeds the distance to the 
hypothetical or equivalent Grade B contour of a co-channel TV/DTV 
station (i.e., it exceeds the distance from the appropriate Table in 
Sec. 90.309 to the relevant TV/DTV station) an authorization will not be 
granted unless it can be shown in an engineering study (method 2) that 
actual terrain considerations are such as to provide the desired 
protection at the actual Grade B contour (64 dB[mu]V/m for TV and 41 
dB[mu]V/m for DTV stations), or that the effective radiated power will 
be further reduced so that, assuming free space attenuation, the desired 
protection at the actual Grade B contour (64 dB[mu]V/m for TV and 41 
dB[mu]V/m coverage contour for DTV stations) will be achieved. 
Directions for calculating powers, heights, and reduction curves are 
listed in Sec. 90.309 for land mobile stations. Directions for 
calculating coverage contours are listed in Secs. 73.683-685 for TV 
stations and in Sec. 73.625 for DTV stations.
    (ii) Control and mobile stations (including portables) are limited 
in height and power and therefore shall afford protection to co-channel 
and adjacent channel TV/DTV stations in accordance with the values 
specified in Table D (co-channel frequencies based on 40 dB protection) 
in Sec. 90.309 of this part and a minimum distance of 8 kilometers (5 
miles) from all adjacent channel TV/DTV station hypothetical or 
equivalent Grade B contours (adjacent channel frequencies based on 0 dB 
protection for TV stations and--23 dB for DTV stations). Since control 
and mobile stations may affect different TV/DTV stations than the 
associated base station, particular care must be taken by applicants to 
ensure that all the appropriate TV/DTV stations are considered (e.g., a 
base station may be operating on TV Channel 64 and the mobiles on TV 
Channel 69, in which case TV Channels 63, 64, 65, 68, and 69 must be 
protected). Since mobiles and portables are able to move and communicate 
with each other, licensees or coordinators must determine the areas 
where the mobiles can and cannot roam in order to protect the TV/DTV 
stations, and advise the mobile operators of these areas and their 
restrictions.
    (iii) In order to protect certain TV/DTV stations and to ensure 
protection from these stations which may have extremely large contours 
due to unusual height situations, an additional distance factor must be 
used by all public safety base, control and mobile stations. For all co-
channel and adjacent channel TV/DTV stations which have an HAAT between 
350 and 600 meters, public safety stations must add the following 
DISTANCE FACTOR to the value obtained from the referenced Tables in 
Sec. 90.309 and to the distance for control and mobile stations on 
adjacent TV/DTV channels (96.5 km).


[[Page 427]]


    DISTANCE FACTOR = (TV/DTV HAAT-350) / 14 in kilometers, where HAAT 
is the TV or DTV station antenna height above average terrain obtained 
from its authorized or proposed facilities, whichever is greater.

    (iv) For all co-channel and adjacent channel TV/DTV stations which 
have an antenna height above average terrain greater than 600 meters, 
public safety stations must add 18 kilometers as the DISTANCE FACTOR to 
the value obtained from the referenced Tables in Sec. 90.309 and to the 
distance for control and mobile stations on adjacent TV/DTV channels 
(96.5 km).

    Note to Sec. 90.545: The 88.5 km (55.0 mi) Grade B service contour 
(64 dB[mu]V/m) is based on a hypothetical TV station operating at an 
effective radiated power of one megawatt, a transmitting antenna height 
above average terrain of 610 meters (2000 feet) and the Commission's R-
6602 F(50,50) curves. See Sec. 73.699 of this chapter. Maximum 
facilities for TV stations operating in the UHF band are 5 megawatts 
effective radiated power at an antenna HAAT of 610 meters (2,000 feet). 
See Sec. 73.614 of this chapter. The equivalent contour for DTV stations 
is based on a 41 dB[mu]V/m signal strength and the distance to the 
F(50,90) curve. See Sec. 73.625 of this chapter.

of the facility. However, the Commission may give its consent to the 
assignment or transfer of control of such a license prior to the 
completion of construction where:
    (1) The assignment or transfer does not involve a substantial change 
in ownership or control of the authorized radio facilities; or,
    (2) The assignment or transfer is involuntary due to the licensee's 
insolvency, bankruptcy, incapacity, or death.
    (c) Licensees of constructed systems in any category other than 
Spectrum Block D frequencies in the 800 MHz SMR service (formerly 
General Category) are permitted to make partial assignments of an 
authorized grant to an applicant proposing to create a new system or to 
an existing licensee that has loaded its system to 70 mobiles per 
channel and is expanding that system. An applicant authorized to expand 
an existing system or to create a new system with frequencies from any 
category other than Spectrum Block D frequencies in the 800 MHz SMR 
service obtained through partial assignment will receive the assignor's 
existing license expiration date and loading deadline for the

\1\ Offset Group 201 is available for conventional system use only.
  Offset Channel 201 is not available for use in the U.S./Mexico border
  area.

    (2) Certain channels in the 821-824/866-869 MHz band are also 
available to eligible applicants in the Public Safety Category in areas 
within 110 kilometers (68.4 miles) of the U.S./Mexico border. These 
channels will be assigned according to the policies defined in the 
Report and Order of Gen. Docket No. 87-112 (See Sec. 90.16). The 
following channels are available only for mutual aid purposes as defined 
in Gen. Docket No. 87-112: channels 601, 639, 677, 715, and 753. Certain 
channels in the 896-901/935-940 MHz band are also available in areas 
within 110 kilometers (68.4 miles) of the U.S./Mexico border. The 
specific channels that are available for licensing in the bands 821-824/
866-869 and 896-901/935-940 MHz within 110 kilometers (68.4 miles) of 
the Mexico border are listed in tables 1B, 2B, 3B, and 4B and are 
subject to Effective Radiated Power (ERP) and Antenna Height limitations 
as indicated in table 1C. In addition, all channels designated for use 
within Mexico in the 821-824/866-869 MHz and 896-901/935-940 MHz bands 
are available for assignment to U.S. stations within 110 kilometers 
(68.4 miles) of the Mexico border if the maximum power flux density 
(pfd) of the station's transmitted signal at any point at or beyond the 
border does not exceed -107 dB(W/m<SUP>2</SUP>). The spreading loss must 
be calculated using the free space formula taking into account any 
antenna discrimination in the direction of the border. Authorizations 
for stations using channels allotted to Mexico on a primary basis will 
be secondary to Mexican operations and conditioned to require that 
licensees take immediate action to eliminate any harmful interference 
resulting from the station's transmitted signal exceeding -107 dB(W/
m<SUP>2</SUP>).

    (2) Station authorizations in Regions 1-4 and Regions 6-8 will be 
subject to Effective Radiated Power (ERP) and Effective Antenna Height 
(EAH) limitations as indicated in table 6. Stations in Region 5 will be 
subject to the ERP and antenna height above mean sea level limitations 
in table 8. Effective Radiated Power (ERP) is defined as the product of 
the power supplied to the antenna and its gain relative to a half-wave 
dipole in a given direction. Effective Antenna Height is calculated by 
subtracting the Assumed Average Terrain Elevation (AATE) given in table 
7 from the antenna height above mean sea level.

    (4) Coordination with Canada will be required:
    (i) For frequencies in the 808.2625-809.7375/853.2625-854.7375 MHz 
and 817.2625-818.7375/862.2625-863.7375 MHz bands, for stations to be 
located in the geographical area in Region 1 enclosed by the United 
States border, the meridian 71 deg. W and the line beginning at the 
intersection of 44 deg.25[min]N, 71 deg. W, then running by great circle 
arc to the intersection of 45 deg. N, 70 deg. W, then North along 
meridian 70 deg. W to the intersection of 45 deg.45[min]N, then running 
West along 45 deg.45[min]N to the intersection of the United States--
Canada border.

[[Page 449]]

    (ii) For frequencies in the 808.2625-811.2375/853.2625-856.2375 MHz 
and 815.7625-818.7375/860.7625-863.7375 MHz bands, for stations to be 
located in the geographical area in Region 3 enclosed by the meridian 
81 deg. W longitude, the arc of a circle of 100 km radius centered at 
the intersection of 81 deg. W longitude and the northern shore of Lake 
Erie and drawn clockwise from the southerly intersection with 81 deg. W 
longitude to intersect the United States-Canada border, and the United 
States-Canada border.
    (5) Applicants requesting authorizations in the frequency bands in 
the geographical areas listed below shall submit documentation 
indicating compliance with the following protection criteria to the 
indicated Canadian television station. Protection to Canadian television 
assignments and allotments is based on the field strength of an 
interfering mobile radio signal at the TV station's calculated Grade B 
contour (64 dBu) not exceeding the TV field strength by more than 20 dB 
(i.e., 84 dBu). The field strength of the TV assignment or allotment is 
calculated using the R6602 [F(50,50)] propagation curves and any land 
mobile base station interfering signal is calculated using the R6602 
[F(50,10)] propagation curves at a receiving effective antenna height of 
9.1 meters (30 feet). Where the calculated field strength of the TV 
assignment or allotment exceeds the Grade B contour value of 64 dBu at 
the Canada/U.S.A. border, the land mobile radio signal may not exceed 
the actual calculated TV field strength at the border by more than 20 
dB.

following:
    (i) As shown in Sec. 90.613, mobile and control station transmitting 
frequencies will commence with Channel No. 1 at 806.0125 MHz, followed 
by Channel No. 2 at 806.0375 MHz and proceed with uniform 25 kHz spacing 
to the band end, with Channel No. 600 at 820.9875 MHz. Corresponding 
base station frequencies, separated by 45 MHz from the mobile control 
frequencies, will commence with Channel No. 1 at 851.0125 MHz and end 
with Channel No. 600 at 865.9875 MHz.
    (ii) Channels will be arranged into 5-channel groups. Because of the 
distribution and differing number of channels available for United 
States use in Regions 1-8, channel spacing between channels in a 5-
channel group vary as follows:

    (i) Channels will be chosen and assigned in accordance with 
Secs. 90.615, 90.617, or 90.619.
    (ii) A mobile station is authorized to transmit on any frequency 
assigned to its associated base station.
    (iii) There are no limitations on the number of frequencies that may 
be trunked. Authorizations for non-SMR stations may be granted for up to 
20 trunked frequency pairs at a time in accordance with the frequencies 
listed in Secs. 90.615, 90.617, and 90.619.
    (2) For conventional systems the assignment of frequencies will be 
made in accordance with applicable loading criteria. Accordingly, 
depending upon the number of mobile units to be served, an applicant may 
either be required to share a channel, or, if an applicant shows a 
sufficient number of mobile units to warrant the assignment of one or 
more channels for its exclusive use, it may be licensed to use such 
channel or channels on an unshared basis in the area of operation 
specified in its application.
    (i) Channels will be chosen and assigned in accordance with 
Secs. 90.615, 90.617, or 90.619.
    (ii) A mobile station is authorized to transmit on any frequency 
assigned to its associated base station.
    (b) Stations authorized on frequencies listed in this subpart, 
except for those stations authorized pursuant to paragraph (g) of this 
section and EA-based and MTA-based SMR systems, will be afforded 
protection solely on the basis of fixed distance separation criteria. 
For Channel Blocks A, through V, as set forth in Sec. 90.917(d), the 
separation between co-channel systems will be a minimum of 113 km (70 
mi) with one exception. For incumbent licensees in Channel Blocks D 
through V, that have received the consent of all affected parties or a 
certified frequency coordinator to utilize an 18 dB[mu]V/m signal 
strength interference contour (see Sec. 90.693), the separation between 
co-channel systems will be a minimum of

[[Page 457]]

173 km (107 mi). The following exceptions to these separations shall 
apply:
    (1) Except as indicated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, no 
station in Channel Blocks A through V shall be less than 169 km (105 mi) 
distant from a co-channel station that has been granted channel 
exclusivity and authorized 1 kW ERP on any of the following mountaintop 
sites: Santiago Peak, Sierra Peak, Mount Lukens, Mount Wilson 
(California). Except as indicated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, 
no incumbent licensee in Channel Blocks D through V that has received 
the consent of all affected parties or a certified frequency coordinator 
to utilize an 18 dB[mu]V/m signal strength interference contour shall be 
less than 229 km (142 mi) distant from a co-channel station that has 
been granted channel exclusivity and authorized 1 kW ERP on any of the 
following mountaintop sites: Santiago Peak, Sierra Peak, Mount Lukens, 
Mount Wilson (California).
    (2) The separation between co-channel stations that have been 
granted exclusivity and that are located at high sites in California 
north of 35 deg. N Latitude and west of 118 deg. W Longitude shall be 
determined as follows:
    (i) Required co-channel separations between common antenna sites are 
given by table 1. A channel group assigned to a station on a site listed 
in the vertical column may not be re-assigned to a station on a site 
listed in the horizontal column if there is an ``X'' in the box created 
by the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines. The geographic 
coordinates listed in the table represent an average for each particular 
site; all locations within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the coordinates will be 
considered to be at that site.
    (ii) Required co-channel separations involving antenna sites not 
listed in table 1 shall be determined by Commission staff on a case by 
case basis. The interference potential of proposed assignments will be 
evaluated considering parameters such as antenna height, effective 
radiated power, terrain irregularities, and market conditions.

    (3) Except as indicated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, 
stations in Channel Blocks A through V that have been granted channel 
exclusivity and are located in the State of Washington at the locations 
listed below shall be separated from co-channel stations by a minimum of 
169 km (105 mi). Except as indicated in paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section, incumbent licensees in Channel Blocks D through V that have 
received the consent of all affected parties or a certified frequency 
coordinator to utilize an 18 dB[mu]V/m signal strength interference 
contour, have been granted channel exclusivity and are located in the 
State of Washington at the locations listed below shall be separated 
from co-channel stations by a minimum of 229 km (142 mi). Locations 
within one mile of the geographical coordinates listed in the table 
below will be considered to be at that site.

    (4) Upon an applicant's specific request to the Commission or a 
frequency coordinator, co-channel stations may be separated by less than 
113 km (70 mi) by meeting certain transmitter ERP and antenna height 
criteria. The following table indicates separations assignable to such 
co-channel stations for various transmitter power and antenna height 
combinations. The minimum separation permitted is 88 km (55 mi). 
Applicants will provide the Commission with a statement that the 
application is submitted for consideration under the table, a list of 
all co-channel stations within 113 km (70 mi), and the DHAATs and ERPs 
for these stations and the applicant's proposed station. Applicants 
seeking to be licensed for stations located at distances less than those 
prescribed in the table are required to secure a waiver and must submit 
with the application, in addition to the above, an interference 
analysis, based upon any of the generally-accepted terrain-based 
propagation models, that shows that co-channel stations would receive 
the same or greater interference protection than provided in the table. 
Requests for separations less than 88 km (55 mi) must also include an 
analysis of interference potential from mobile transmitters to existing 
co-channel base station receivers. Applicants seeking a waiver must 
submit with their application a certificate of service indicating that 
concurrent with the submission of the application to the Commission or a 
coordinator, all co-channel licensees within the applicable area were 
served with a copy of the application and all attachments thereto. 
Licensees thus served may file an opposition to the application within 
30 days from the date the application is filed with the Commission.
    (i) The directional height of the antenna above average terrain 
(DHAAT) is calculated from the average of the antenna heights above 
average terrain from 3 to 16 km (2 to 10 mi) from the proposed site 
along a radial extending in the direction of the existing station and 
the radials 15 degrees to either side of that radial.
    (ii) Except for the sites listed in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and 
(b)(3) of this section, additional co-channel distance separation must 
be afforded to an existing station from an applicant wishing to locate a 
station less than 113 km (70 mi) from a co-channel station, where either 
the applicant's or the existing station is located at sites with DHAATs 
of 458 m (1500 ft) and above. The separation between short-spaced co-
channel stations shall be determined as follows:
    (A) Calculate the DHAAT in each direction between every existing co-
channel station with 113 km (70 mi) and the proposed station.
    (B) In the table, locate the approximate ERP and DHAAT values for 
the proposed and existing stations.
    (C) When DHAAT values are greater than 458 m (1500 ft), use the 
required

[[Page 460]]

separation for 305 m (1000 ft) and add 1.6 km (1 mi) for every 30.5 km 
(100 ft), or increment thereof, of DHAAT above 458 m (1500 ft) to the 
distance indicated in the table. If both the proposed existing stations 
have DHAATs of 458 m (1500 ft) or more, the additional distance is 
separately determined for each station and the combined distance is 
added to the distance obtained from the table. Protection to existing 
stations will be afforded only up to 113 km (70 mi).

\1\ Separations for stations on Santiago Peak, Sierra Peak, Mount Lukens, and Mount Wilson (CA) and the
  locations in the State of Washington listed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section are 56 km (35 mi) greater than
  those listed in the table above. In the event of conflict between this table and the table of additional
  California high elevation sites shown in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the latter will apply.
\2\ Distances shown are derived from the R-6602 curves and are based upon a non-overlap of the 22 dBu (F50,10)
  interference contour of the proposed station with the 40 dBu (F50,50) contour of the existing station(s). No
  consideration is given to the 40 dBu service contour of the proposed station and the 22 dBu contour of the
  existing station(s). The minimum separation of stations will be 88 km (55 mi).
\3\ All existing stations are assumed to operate with 1000 watts ERP. When the ERP and/or DHAAT of a proposed
  station or the DHAAT of an existing station is not indicated in the table, the next higher value(s) must be
  used.

    (5) The separation between co-channel systems may be less than the 
separations defined above if an applicant submits with its application 
letters of concurrence indicating that the applicant and each co-channel 
licensee within the specified separation agree to accept any 
interference resulting from the reduced separation between their 
systems. Each letter from a co-channel licensee must certify that the 
system of the concurring licensee is constructed and fully operational. 
The applicant must also submit with its application a certificate of 
service indicating that all concurring co-channel licensees have been 
served with an actual copy of the application.
    (6) A station located closer than the distances provided in this 
section to a

[[Page 461]]

co-channel station that was authorized as short-spaced under paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section shall be permitted to modify its facilities as 
long as the station does not extend its 22 dBu contour beyond its 
maximum 22 dBu contour (i.e., the 22 dBu contour calculated using the 
station's maximum power and antenna height at its original location) in 
the direction of the short-spaced station.
    (7) Offset frequencies in the 811-821/856-866 MHz band for use only 
within U.S./Mexico border area, as designated in Sec. 90.619(a), shall 
be considered co-channel with non-offset frequencies in this band as 
designated in Sec. 90.613. New applications for frequencies in this band 
for stations adjacent to the U.S./Mexico border area must comply with 
the co-channel separation provisions of this section.
    (c) Conventional systems authorized on frequencies in the Public 
Safety (except for those systems that have participated in a formal 
regional planning process as described in Sec. 90.16), Industrial/Land 
Transportation, Business, and Spectrum Block D frequencies in the 800 
MHz SMR service (formerly General) Categories which have not met the 
loading levels necessary for channel exclusivity will not be afforded 
co-channel protection.
    (d) UHF television translator stations using UHF output channels 
from Channels 70 through 83 operate on a secondary basis to land mobile 
stations using the UHF bands allocated under this subpart for land 
mobile use. Accordingly, such television translator stations will not be 
protected from interference from such authorized land mobile stations.
    (e) Frequencies in the 806-821/851-866 MHz bands listed as available 
for eligibles in the Public Safety, Industrial/Land Transportation, and 
Business Categories are available for inter-category sharing under the 
following conditions:
    (1) Channels in the Public Safety, Industrial/Land Transportation 
and Business categories will be available to eligible applicants in 
those categories only if there are no frequencies in their own category 
and no public safety systems are authorized on those channels under 
consideration to be shared.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(5) of this section, licensees of 
channels in the Industrial/Land Transportation and Business categories 
may request a modification of the license, see Sec. 1.947 of this part, 
to authorize use of the channels for commercial operation. The licensee 
may also, at the same time or thereafter, seek authorization to transfer 
or assign the license, see Sec. 1.948 of this part, to any person 
eligible for licensing in the General or SMR categories. Applications 
submitted pursuant to this paragraph must be filed in accordance with 
the rules governing other applications for commercial channels, and will 
be processed in accordance with those rules. Grant of requests submitted 
pursuant to this paragraph is subject to the following conditions:
    (i) A licensee that modifies its license to authorize commercial 
operations will not be authorized to obtain additional 800 MHz Business 
or Industrial/Land Transportation category channels for sites located 
within 113 km (70 mi.) of the station for which the license was 
modified, for a period of one year from the date the license is 
modified. This provision applies to the licensee, its controlling 
interests and their affiliates, as defined in Sec. 1.2110 of this 
chapter.
    (ii) With respect to licenses the initial application for which was 
filed on or after November 9, 2000, requests submitted pursuant to 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section may not be filed until five years after 
the date of the initial license grant. In the case of a license that is 
modified on or after November 9, 2000 to add 800 MHz Industrial/Land 
Transportation or Business frequencies or to add or relocate base 
stations that expand the licensee's the interference contour, requests 
submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section for these 
frequencies or base stations may not be filed until five years after 
such modification.
    (iii) Requests submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section must include a certification that written notice of the 
modification application has been provided to all Public Safety 
licensees, see Sec. 90.20(a), with base stations within 113 km (70 mi.) 
of the site

of the channel(s) for which authorization for commercial use is sought 
that operate within 25 kHz of the center of those channel(s). If, 
pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, modification and 
assignment or transfer applications are filed at different times, the 
written notice required by this paragraph must be provided each time.
    (iv) The applicant must certify that it will take reasonable 
precautions to avoid causing harmful interference to Public Safety 
licensees, see Sec. 90.20(a), and to take such action as may be 
necessary to eliminate interference to such licensees caused by its 
operations. (When an assignment or transfer application is filed 
pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, this representation is 
required only of the assignee or transferee.) Licensees of stations 
suffering or causing harmful interference are expected to cooperate and 
resolve this problem by mutually satisfactory arrangements. If the 
licensees are unable to do so, the Commission may impose restrictions 
including specifying the transmitter power, antenna height, or area or 
hours of operation.
    (3) Licensees granted authorizations pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section may at any time request modification of the license to 
authorize use of the channels consistent with the rules governing the 
category to which they are allocated, provided that the licensee meets 
the applicable eligibility requirements.
    (4) [Reserved]
    (5) The frequency coordinator must certify that frequencies are not 
available in the applicant's own category, and coordination is required 
from the applicable out-of-category coordinator.
    (6) The out-of-category licensee must operate by the rules 
applicable to the category to which the frequency is allocated.
    (f) The 896-901/935-940 MHz channels listed as available for 
eligibles in the Industrial/Land Transportation and Business categories 
will be available for inter-category sharing to all persons eligible in 
those categories under the following conditions thirty-six (36) months 
from the date the first authorization in this spectrum is issued.
    (1) The frequency coordinator must certify that frequencies are not 
available in the applicant's own category, and coordination is required 
from the applicable out-of-category coordinator.
    (2) The out-of-category licensee must operate by the rules 
applicable to the category to which the frequency is allocated.
    (g) Applications for Public Safety systems (both trunked and 
conventional) in the 821-824/866-869 MHz bands will be assigned and 
protected based on the criteria established in the appropriate regional 
plan. See Sec. 90.16 and the Report and Order in General Docket 87-112.
    (h) Channel numbers 401-410, 441-450, 481-490, 521-530, and 561-570 
are available on co-primary basis to station in Basic Exchange 
Telecommunications Radio Service as described in part 22 of the 
Commission's Rules.

Sec. 90.623  Limitations on the number of frequencies assignable for conventional systems.

    (a) The maximum number of frequency pairs that may be assigned to a 
licensee for operation in the conventional mode in a given area is five 
(5).
    (b) Where an applicant proposes to operate a conventional radio 
system to provide facilities for the use of a single person or entity 
eligible under subparts B or C of this part, the applicant may be 
assigned only the number of frequency pairs justified on the basis of 
the requirement of the proposed single user of the system.
    (c) No non-SMR licensee will be authorized an additional frequency 
pair for a conventional system within 64 kilometers (40 miles) of an 
existing conventional system, except where:
    (1) The additional frequency pair will be used to provide radio 
facilities to a single entity and the additional frequency pair is 
justified on the basis of the requirements of the proposed single user; 
or,
    (2) The licensee's existing frequency pair(s) is loaded to 
prescribed levels.
    (d) No licensee will be authorized frequencies for a conventional 
system if that licensee is operating an unloaded trunked system or has 
an application pending for a trunked system to serve multiple 
subscribers within 64 km (40 miles) of the requested conventional 
system.

    (a) Where an applicant certifies on its application that a channel 
will be loaded to 70 mobile stations, that channel will be made 
available to that applicant for its exclusive use in the area in which 
it proposes to operate. If the showing made justifies the assignment of 
more than one channel to the applicant, additional frequencies will be 
authorized.
    (b) Where an applicant proposes to furnish service to eligibles 
under subparts B or C of this part on a commercial basis using a 
conventional system of communication, the applicant will be considered 
on the same basis as that of an applicant for private or shared 
communication facilities.
    (c) No person authorized to operate any radio facility under the 
provisions of this subpart shall have a right to protest proposals on 
grounds other than violation of or inconsistency with the provisions of 
this subpart. All grants are made subject to this condition and to the 
other conditions and standards set out in this subpart.

Sec. 90.629  Extended implementation period.

    Applicants requesting frequencies for either trunked or conventional 
operations may be authorized a period of up to five (5) years for 
constructing and placing a system in operation in accordance with the 
following:
    (a) The applicant must justify an extended implementation period. 
The justification must describe the proposed system, state the amount of 
time necessary to construct and place the system in operation, identify 
the number of base stations to be constructed and placed in operation 
during each year of the extended construction period, and show that:
    (1) The proposed system will require longer than twelve (12) months 
to construct and place in operation because of its purpose, size, or 
complexity; or
    (2) The proposed system is to be part of a coordinated or integrated 
wide-area system which will require more than twelve (12) months to 
plan, approve, fund, purchase, construct, and place in operation; or
    (3) The applicant is required by law to follow a multi-year cycle 
for planning, approval, funding, and purchasing the proposed system.
    (b) Where an applicant is required by law to follow a multi-year 
cycle for planning, approval, funding and purchasing a proposed system, 
the applicant must indicate whether funding approval has been obtained 
and if not, when such funding approval is expected.
    (c) Authorizations under this section are conditioned upon the 
licensee constructing and placing its system in operation within the 
authorized implementation period and in accordance with an approved 
implementation plan of up to five years. Licensees must notify the 
Commission annually, using FCC Form 601, that they are in compliance 
with their yearly station construction commitments, but may request 
amendment to these commitments at the time they file their annual 
certification. If the Commission approves the requested amendments to a 
licensee's implementation commitments, the licensee's extended 
implementation authority will remain in effect. If, however, the 
Commission concludes, at this or any other time, that a licensee has 
failed to meet its commitments, the Commission will terminate authority 
for the extended implementation period. When the Commission terminates 
an extended implementation authority, the affected licensee will be 
given six months from the date of termination to complete system 
construction. At the end of any licensee's extended implementation 
period, authorizations for all stations not constructed and placed in 
operation will be cancelled. Trunked systems granted an extended 
implementation period must comply with the channel loading requirements 
of section 90.631(b). Conventional channels not loaded to 70 mobile 
units may be subject to shared use by the addition of other licensees.
    (d) Applicants eligible in the Industrial/Land Transportation 
Category requesting authorizations under this section may request 
frequencies in the Business Category only if the application contains a 
statement that no frequencies in the Industrial/Land Transportation 
Category are available for assignment in their geographic area.

[[Page 465]]

    (e) As of March 18, 1996, Specialized Mobile Radio systems are not 
eligible for extended implementation periods under this section. 
Additionally, all 800 MHz SMR licensees that are operating under 
extended implementation authority as of March 18, 1996 must, by May 16, 
1996, demonstrate that continuing to allow them to have an extended 
period of time to construct their facilities is warranted and furthers 
the public interest. If a licensee's extended implementation authority 
showing is approved by the Bureau, such licensee will be afforded an 
extended implementation of two years or the remainder of its current 
extended implementation period, whichever is shorter. Upon the 
termination of this period, the authorizations for those facilities that 
remain unconstructed will terminate automatically. If a licensee with a 
current extended implementation period fails to submit the showing 
mentioned above within the designated timeframe or submits an 
insufficient or incomplete showing, such licensee will have six months 
from the last day on which it could timely file such a showing or from 
the disapproval of its request to construct the remaining facilities 
covered under its implementation plan to construct any unconstructed 
facilities for which it is authorized. The authorizations for those 
facilities remaining unconstructed after this six-month period will 
terminate automatically.
    (f) Pursuant to Sec. 90.155(b), the provisions of this section shall 
apply to local government entities applying for any frequency in the 
Public Safety Pool.

FR 68969, Dec. 14, 1998; 65 FR 60877, Oct. 13, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 90.631  Trunked systems loading, construction and authorization requirements.

    (a) Non-SMR trunked systems will be authorized on the basis of a 
loading criteria of one hundred (100) mobile stations per channel. For 
purposes of determining compliance with trunked system loading 
requirements under this subpart, the term ``mobile station'' includes 
vehicular and portable mobile units and control stations.
    (b) Each applicant for a non-SMR trunked system must certify that a 
minimum of seventy (70) mobiles for each channel authorized will be 
placed into operation within five (5) years of the initial license 
grant. Except for SMR systems licensed in the 806-821/851-866 MHz band 
and as indicated in paragraph (i) of this section, if at the end of five 
(5) years a trunked system is not loaded to the prescribed levels and 
all channels in the licensee's category are assigned in the system's 
geographic area, authorizations for trunked channels not loaded to 
seventy (70) mobile stations cancels automatically at a rate that allows 
the licensee to retain one channel for every one hundred (100) mobiles 
loaded, plus one additional channel. If a trunked system has channels 
from more than one category, Spectrum Block D frequencies in the 800 MHz 
SMR service (formerly General Category) channels are the first channels 
considered to cancel automatically. All non-SMR licensees initially 
authorized before June 1, 1993, that are within their original license 
term, or SMR licensees that are within the term of a two-year 
authorization granted in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section, 
are subject to this condition. A licensee that has authorized channels 
cancelled due to failure to meet the above loading requirements will not 
be authorized additional channels to expand that same system for a 
period of six (6) months from the date of cancellation.
    (c) Except for SMR applicants and as provided in paragraph (d) of 
this section, an applicant seeking to expand a trunked system by 
requesting additional channels from the Commission, or through 
intercategory sharing, or through an assignment, must have a loading 
level of seventy (70) mobiles per channel on the existing system that is 
the subject of the expansion request.
    (d) In rural areas, a licensee of a trunked system may request to 
increase its system capacity by five more channels than it has 
constructed without meeting the loading requirements specified in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. A rural area is defined for

[[Page 466]]

purposes of this section as being beyond a 100-mile radius of the 
designated centers of the following urbanized areas, as well as those 
areas that have a waiting list. (Rural areas may be different for 800 
and 900 MHz channels since the Commission maintains separate waiting 
lists for these frequency bands.) The identified urbanized areas are: 
New York, NY; Los Angeles, CA; Chicago, IL; Philadelphia, PA: San 
Francisco, CA; Detroit, MI; Boston, MA; Houston, TX; Washington, DC; 
Dallas-Fort Worth, TX; Miami, FL; Cleveland, OH; St. Louis, MO; Atlanta, 
GA; Pittsburgh, PA; Baltimore, MD; Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN; Seattle, 
WA; San Diego, CA; and Tampa-St. Petersburg, FL. The coordinates for the 
centers of these areas are those referenced in Sec. 90.635, except that 
the coordinates (referenced to North American Datum 1983 (NAD83)) for 
Tampa-St. Petersburg are latitude 28 deg. 00[min] 01.1[sec] N, longitude 
82 deg. 26[min] 59.3[sec] W. Where waiting lists determine whether an 
area is rural, the designated centers of those areas will be identified 
on the actual waiting lists released by the Commission. If a waiting 
list is later established in a rural area, licensees who have acquired 
additional channels pursuant to this paragraph will be subject to the 
automatic cancellation provisions in paragraph (b) of this section at 
the end of one year from the date the area first appears on a Commission 
waiting list, or at the end of their license term, whichever is longer.
    (e) Except as provided in Sec. 90.629, licensees of trunked 
facilities must complete construction within one year.
    (f) If a station is not placed in permanent operation, in accordance 
with the technical parameters of the station authorization, within one 
year, except as provided in Sec. 90.629, its license cancels 
automatically. For purposes of this section, a base station is not 
considered to be placed in operation unless at least two associated 
mobile stations, or one control station and one mobile station, are also 
placed in operation. An SMR licensee with facilities that have 
discontinued operations for 90 continuous days is presumed to have 
permanently discontinued operations, unless the licensee notifies the 
Commission otherwise, using FCC Form 601, prior to the end of the 90 day 
period and provides a date on which operation will resume, which date 
must not be in excess of 30 additional days.
    (g) Wide area systems may be authorized to persons eligible for 
licensing under subparts B or C of this part upon an appropriate showing 
of need. Remote or satellite stations of wide area systems in the Public 
Safety, Special Emergency, Telephone Maintenance, and Power Radio 
Services may be authorized on a primary basis if such stations are the 
first to be authorized in their area of operation on the frequency or 
group of frequencies. Remote or satellite stations of wide area systems 
in all other services will be authorized only on a secondary, non-
interference basis to cochannel licensees. To determine system loading, 
the total number of mobile units and control stations operating in the 
wide-area system shall be counted with respect to the total number of 
base station frequencies assigned to the system.
    (h) Regional, statewide, or ribbon configuration systems may be 
authorized to persons eligible for licensing under subparts B or C of 
this part upon an appropriate showing of need. In a ribbon, regional or 
statewide system, a mobile station will be counted for channel loading 
purposes only for the base station facility in the geographic area in 
which it primarily operates. If this cannot be determined, it will be 
counted fractionally over the number of base station facilities with 
which it communicates regularly.
    (i) For SMRS category trunked systems licensed in the 896-901/935-
940 MHz band (other than MTA-licensed systems), if at the end of the 
initial five-year license term the licensee of such a trunked system has 
not satisfied the loading requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, 
the licensee requesting renewal of its license will be granted a renewal 
for only a two-year period. Regardless of the date of grant of the two-
year renewal, the licensee will be required to comply fully with the 
minimum requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section at the 
end of

[[Page 467]]

the two-year renewal term. As an exception to this requirement, if the 
licensee obtains the MTA license covering its assigned spectrum in 
accordance with Secs. 90.661 through 90.671, these loading requirements 
will no longer be applicable and the coverage requirements of 
Sec. 90.665 will govern.

    (a) Non-SMR conventional systems of communication will be authorized 
on the basis of a minimum loading criteria of seventy (70) mobile 
stations for each channel authorized.
    (b) A channel will not be assigned to additional licensees when it 
is loaded to 70 mobile stations. Where a licensee does not load a 
channel to 70 mobiles the channel will be available for assignment to 
other licensees. All authorizations for conventional systems are issued 
subject to this potential channel sharing condition.
    (c) Except as provided in Sec. 90.629 of this part, licensees of 
conventional systems must place their authorized stations in operation 
not later than one year after the date of grant of the system license.
    (d) If a station is not placed in operation within one year, except 
as provided in Section 90.629 of this part, the license cancels 
automatically. For purposes of this section, a base station is not 
considered to be in operation unless at least one associated mobile 
station is also in operation.
    (e) A non-SMR licensee may apply for additional frequency pairs if 
its authorized conventional channel(s) is loaded to seventy (70) 
mobiles. Applications may be considered for additional channels in areas 
where spectrum is still available and not applied for, even if the 
already authorized channel(s) is not loaded to 70 mobile units, upon an 
appropriate demonstration of need.
    (f) Wide area systems may be authorized to persons eligible for 
licensing under subparts B or C of this part upon an appropriate showing 
of need. For loading purposes, if the total number of mobile stations 
justifies the total number of authorized based frequencies in a given 
area, the system will be construed to be loaded.
    (g) Regional, statewide, or ribbon configuration systems may be 
authorized to persons eligible for licensing under subparts B or C of 
this part upon an appropriate showing of need. In a ribbon, regional or 
statewide system, a mobile station will be counted for channel loading 
purposes only for the base station facility in the geographic area in 
which it primarily operates. If this cannot be determined, it will be 
counted fractionally over the number of base station facilities with 
which it communicates regularly.

Sec. 90.635  Limitations on power and antenna height.

    (a) Systems to be located within 24 km. (15 mi.) of the geographic 
center of the 50 urbanized areas detailed in table 1 will be considered 
``urban'' systems. All others will be considered ``suburban'' systems.
    (b) The effective radiated power and antenna height, for base 
stations used in suburban-conventional systems of communications, shall 
be no greater than 500 watts (27 dBw) and 152 m. (500 ft.) above average 
terrain (AAT), respectively, or the equivalent as determined from table 
2. These are maximum values, and applicants are required to justify 
power levels and antenna heights requested. For service area 
requirements less than 32 km. (20 mi.) in radius, see table 3.
    (c) The effective radiated power and antenna height for base 
stations used in trunked and urban-conventional systems may not exceed 1 
kilowatt (30 dBw) and 304 m. (1,000 ft.) above average terrain (AAT), 
respectively, or the equivalent thereof as determined from table 2. 
These are maximum values,

[[Page 468]]

and applicants will be required to justify power levels and antenna 
heights requested. For service area requirements less than 32 km (20 
mi.) in radius, see table 4.
    (d) The maximum output power of the transmitter for mobile stations 
is 100 watts (20 dBw).

Sec. 90.637  Restrictions on operational fixed stations.

    (a) Except for control stations, operational fixed operations will 
not be authorized in the 806-824 MHz, 851-869 MHz, 896-901 MHz, or 935-
940 MHz bands. This does not preclude secondary fixed tone signaling and 
alarm operations authorized in Sec. 90.235 or in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (b) Control stations associated with one or more mobile relay 
stations will be authorized only on the assigned frequency of the 
associated mobile station. Use of a mobile service frequency by a 
control station of a mobile relay system is subject to the condition 
that harmful interference shall not be caused to stations of licensees 
authorized to use the frequency for mobile service communications.
    (c) Trunked and conventional systems that have exclusive-use status 
in their respective geographic areas may conduct fixed ancillary 
signaling and data transmissions subject to the following requirements:
    (1) All operations must be on a secondary, non-interference basis to 
the primary mobile operation of any other licensee.
    (2) The output power at the remote site must not exceed 30 watts.
    (3) Any fixed transmitters will not count toward meeting the mobile 
loading requirements nor be considered in whole or in part as a 
justification for authorizing additional frequencies in the licensee's 
mobile system.
    (4) Automatic means must be provided to deactivate the remote 
transmitter in the event the carrier remains on for a period in excess 
of three minutes.
    (5) Operational fixed stations authorized pursuant to the provisions 
of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are exempt from the 
requirements of Secs. 90.425 and 90.429.
    (d) Conventional systems that do not have exclusive-use status in 
their respective geographic areas may conduct fixed ancillary signaling 
and data transmissions only in accordance with all the provisions of 
Sec. 90.235.

Sec. 90.645  Permissible operations.

    Conventional and trunked radio systems may be used:
    (a) Only for purposes expressly allowed under this part.
    (b) Only persons who are eligible for facilities, either under this 
subpart or in the radio service included under subparts B or C of this 
part.
    (c) Except for licensees classified as CMRS providers under part 20 
of this

[[Page 471]]

chapter, only for the transmission of messages or signals permitted in 
the services is which the participants are eligible.
    (d) For digital or analog transmissions.
    (e) An SMRS licensee or a licensee who has been authorized a 
channel(s) on an exclusive basis, may use the system for the 
transmission of any base/mobile message, page or signal permitted in the 
service in which the participants are eligible.
    (f) Where the channel(s) is assigned to an SMRS licensee or 
exclusively to a single licensee, or where all users of a system agree, 
more than a single emission may be utilized within the authorized 
bandwidth. In such cases, the frequency stability requirements of 
Sec. 90.213 shall not apply, but out-of-band emission limits of 
Sec. 90.209 shall be met.
    (g) Up to five (5) contiguous 806-821/851-866 band channels as 
listed in Secs. 90.615, 90.617, and 90.619 may be authorized after 
justification for systems requiring more than the normal single channel 
bandwidth. If necessary, licensees may trade channels amongst themselves 
in order to obtain contiguous frequencies. Notification of such proposed 
exchanges shall be made to the appropriate frequency coordinator(s) and 
to the Commission by filing an application for license modification.
    (h) Up to 10 contiguous 896-901/935-940 MHz band channels as listed 
in Sec. 90.617 may be combined for systems requiring more than the 
normal single channel bandwidth. If necessary, licensees may trade 
channels amongst themselves in order to obtain contiguous frequencies. 
Notification of such proposed exchanges shall be made to the appropriate 
frequency coordinator(s) and to the Commission by filing an application 
for license modification.
    (i) Paging operations may be utilized on multiple licensed 
facilities (community repeaters) only when all licensees of the facility 
agree to such use.

Sec. 90.647  Station identification.

    (a) Conventional systems of communication shall be identified in 
accordance with existing regulations governing such matters.
    (b) Trunked systems of communication, except as noted in paragraph 
(c) of this section, shall be identified through the use of an automatic 
device which transmits the call sign of the base station facility at 30 
minute intervals. Such station identification shall be made on the 
lowest frequency in the base station trunk group assigned the licensee. 
Should this frequency be in use at the time station identification is 
required, such identification may be made at the termination of the 
communication in progress on this frequency. Identification may be made 
by voice or International Morse Code. When the call sign is transmitted 
in International Morse Code, it must be at a rate of between 15 to 20 
words per minute and by means of tone modulation of the transmitter, the 
tone frequency being between 800 and 1000 hertz.
    (c) Stations operating in either the 806-824/851-869 MHz or 896-901/
935-940 MHz bands that are licensed on an exclusive basis, and normally 
employ digital signals for the transmission of data, text, control 
codes, or digitized voice may also be identified by digital transmission 
of the call sign. A licensee that identifies its station in this manner 
must provide the Commission, upon its request, information sufficient to 
decode the digital transmission and ascertain the call sign transmitted.
    (d) Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in this paragraph, 
systems operated by geographic area CMRS licensees are subject only to 
the station identification requirements of Sec. 90.425(e).

systems that have control stations that require FAA clearance, as 
specified in Secs. 17.7 through 17.17 of this chapter, or that may have 
a significant environmental effect, as defined by Sec. 1.1307, or that 
are located in a ``quiet zone'', as defined by Sec. 1.924 of this 
chapter must be individually licensed for such control stations prior to 
construction or operation. All other end users' operations will be 
within the scope of the base station licensee. All end users, however, 
continue to be responsible to comply with 47 CFR part 90 and other 
federal laws.

Sec. 90.656  Responsibilities of base station licensees of Specialized Mobile Radio systems.

    (a) The licensees of base stations that provide Specialized Mobile 
Radio service on a commercial basis of the use of individuals, Federal 
government agencies, or persons eligible for licensing under either 
subparts B or C of this part will be responsible for exercising 
effective operational control over all mobile and control stations that 
communicate with the base station. The base station licensee will be 
responsible for assuring that its system is operated in compliance with 
all applicable rules and regulations.
    (b) Customers that operate mobile units on a particular Specialized 
Mobile Radio system will be licensed to that system. A customer that 
operates temporarily on more than one system will be deemed, when 
communicating with the other system, to be temporarily licensed to the 
other system and for that temporary period, the licensee of the other 
system will assume the same licensee responsibility for the customer's 
mobile station(s) as if the customer's stations were licensed to that 
other system.

Sec. 90.658  Loading data required for base station licensees of trunked Specialized Mobile Radio systems to acquire additional channels or to renew trunked 
          systems licensed before June 1, 1993.

    (a) A base station licensee of a trunked system applying for its 
first renewal in a waiting list area for a system licensed before June 
1, 1993 must identify, using FCC Form 601, the number of mobiles and 
control stations loaded on its system as calculated in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) The number described in paragraph (a) of this section must be 
calculated by averaging the number of mobiles and control stations 
operating on a licensee's system on the first business day of each of 
the six months immediately preceding the filing of an application and 
must be based on the licensee's business records for that period. 
Alternative calculations will be

[[Page 473]]

permitted upon good cause showings of special circumstances.
    (c) Business records may constitute invoices, customer service 
agreements, customer lists or any other type of record kept in the 
ordinary course of business.
    (d) The FCC will use the loading data required by this section to 
determine whether the licensee's existing system has a sufficient number 
of mobiles as required by 47 CFR chapter I to qualify for additional 
channels or for the first renewal of trunked systems licensed before 
June 1, 1993.

Sec. 90.661  MTA-based SMR service areas.

    MTA licenses for SMR spectrum blocks in the 896-901/935-940 MHz band 
listed in table 4B of Sec. 90.617(d) are available in 51 Major Trading 
Areas (MTAs) as defined in Sec. 90.7. Within these MTAs, licenses will 
be authorized in ten channel blocks as specified in table 4B of 
Sec. 90.617(d) through the competitive bidding procedures described in 
subpart U of this part.

[60 FR 21991, May 4, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 90.663  MTA-based SMR system operations.

    (a) MTA-based licensees authorized in the 896-901/935-940 MHz band 
pursuant to Sec. 90.661 may construct and operate base stations using 
any frequency identified in their spectrum block anywhere within their 
authorized MTA, provided that:
    (1) The MTA licensee affords protection, in accordance with 
Sec. 90.621(b), to all sites for which applications were filed on or 
prior to August 9, 1994.
    (2) The MTA licensee complies with any rules and international 
agreements that restrict use of frequencies identified in their spectrum 
block, including the provisions of Sec. 90.619 relating to U.S./Canadian 
and U.S./Mexican border areas.
    (3) The MTA licensee limits its field strength at any location on 
the border of the MTA service area in accordance with Sec. 90.671 and 
masks its emissions in accordance with Sec. 90.669.
    (b) In the event that the authorization for a previously authorized 
co-channel station within the MTA licensee's authorized spectrum block 
is terminated or revoked, the MTA licensee's co-channel obligations to 
such station will cease upon deletion of the facility from the 
Commission's licensing record. The MTA licensee then will be able to 
construct and operate base stations using such frequency.

<R05>
Sec. 90.665  Authorization, construction and implementation of MTA licenses.

    (a) MTA licenses in the 896-901/935-940 MHz band will be issued for 
a term not to exceed ten years.
    (b) MTA licensees in the 896-901/935-940 MHz band will be permitted 
five years to construct their stations. This five-year period will 
commence with the issuance of the MTA-wide authorization and will apply 
to all of the licensee's stations within the MTA spectrum block, 
including any stations that may have been subject to an earlier 
construction deadline arising from a pre-existing authorization.
    (c) Each MTA licensee in the 896-901/935-940 MHz band must, three 
years from the date of license grant, construct and place into operation 
a sufficient number of base stations to provide coverage to at least 
one-third of the population of the MTA; further, each MTA licensee must 
provide coverage to at least two-thirds of the population of the MTA 
five years from the date of license grant. Alternatively, an MTA 
licensee must demonstrate, through a showing to the Commission five 
years from the date of license grant, that it is providing substantial 
service. An MTA licensee must, three years from license grant, either 
show that the \1/3\ population coverage standard has been satisfied, or 
provide written notification that it has elected to show substantial 
service to the MTA five years from license grant. In addition, as part 
of the election to provide a substantial service showing, each MTA 
licensee must, three years from license grant, indicate how it expects 
to demonstrate substantial service at

[[Page 474]]

five years. The MTA licensee must meet the population coverage 
benchmarks regardless of the extent to which incumbent licensees are 
present within the MTA block.
    (d) MTA licensees who fail to meet the coverage requirements imposed 
at either the third or fifth years of their license term, or to make a 
convincing showing of substantial service, will forfeit the portion of 
the MTA license that exceeds licensed facilities constructed and 
operating on the date of the MTA license grant.

Sec. 90.667  Grandfathering provisions for incumbent licensees.

    (a) These provisions apply to all 900 MHz SMR licensees who obtained 
licenses or filed applications for secondary sites on or before August 
9, 1994 (``incumbent licensees''), as well as to all 900 MHz SMR 
licensees who obtained authorizations pursuant to Sec. 90.173(k). An 
incumbent licensee's service area shall be defined by its originally-
licensed 40 dBu field strength contour. Incumbent licensees are 
permitted to add new or modify transmit sites in this existing service 
area without prior notification to the Commission so long as their 
original 40 dBu field strength contour is not expanded.
    (b) Incumbent licensees operating at multiple sites may, after grant 
of MTA licenses has been completed, exchange multiple site licenses for 
a single license, authorizing operations throughout the contiguous and 
overlapping 40 dBu field strength contours of the multiple sites. 
Incumbents exercising this license exchange option must submit specific 
information for each of their external base sites after the close of the 
900 MHz SMR auction.
    (c) Applications in the 900 MHz SMR service for secondary sites 
filed after August 9, 1994 shall be authorized on a secondary, non-
interference basis to MTA licensee operations. No secondary sites shall 
be granted on this basis in an MTA once the MTA licensee has been 
selected.

<R05>
Sec. 90.669  Emission limits.

    (a) On any frequency in an MTA licensee's spectrum block that is 
adjacent to a non-MTA frequency, the power of any emission shall be 
attenuated below the transmitter power (P) by at least 43 plus 10 
log<INF>10</INF>(P) decibels or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser 
attenuation.
    Note: The measurements of emission power can be expressed in peak or 
average values, provided they are expressed in the same parameters as 
the transmitter power.
    (b) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require 
greater attenuation than specified in this section.

[60 FR 21992, May 4, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 90.671  Field strength limits.

    The predicted or measured field strength at any location on the 
border of the MTA service area for MTA licensees shall not exceed 40 
dBuV/m unless all bordering MTA licensees agree to a higher field 
strength. MTA licensees are also required to coordinate their frequency 
usage with so-channel adjacent MTA licensees and all other affected 
parties. To the extent that a single entity obtains licenses for 
adjacent MTAs on the same channel block, it will not be required to 
coordinate its operations in this manner. In the event that this 
standard conflicts with the MTA licensee's obligation to provide co-
channel protection to incumbent licensees under Sec. 90.621(b), the 
requirements of Sec. 90.621(b) shall prevail.

Sec. 90.683  EA-based SMR system operations.

    (a) EA-based licensees authorized in the 806-821/851-866 MHz band 
pursuant to Sec. 90.681 may construct and operate base stations using 
any of the base station frequencies identified in their spectrum block 
anywhere within their authorized EA, provided that:
    (1) The EA licensee affords protection, in accordance with 
Sec. 90.621(b), to all previously authorized co-channel stations that 
are not associated with another EA license;
    (2) The EA licensee complies with any rules and international 
agreements that restrict use of frequencies identified in their spectrum 
block, including the provisions of Sec. 90.619 relating to U.S./Canadian 
and U.S./Mexican border areas;
    (3) The EA licensee limits the field strength of its base stations 
at any location on the border of the EA service area in accordance with 
Sec. 90.689;
    (4) Upon request by an incumbent licensee or the Commission, the EA 
licensees shall furnish the technical parameters, location and 
coordinates of the completion of the addition, removal, relocation or 
modification of any of its facilities within the EA. The EA licensee 
must provide such information within ten (10) days of receiving a 
written request.
    (5) For any construction or alteration that would exceed the 
requirements of Sec. 17.7 of this chapter, licensees must notify the 
appropriate Regional Office of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA 
Form 7460-1) and file a request for antenna height clearance and 
obstruction marking and lighting specifications (FCC Forn 854) with the 
FCC, WTB, Support Services Branch, Gettysburg, PA 17325.
    (6) Any additional transmitters placed in operation must not have a 
significant environmental effect as defined by Secs. 1.1301 through 
1.1319 of this chapter.
    (b) In the event that the authorization for a previously authorized 
co-channel station within the EA licensee's spectrum block is terminated 
or revoked, the EA licensee's co-channel obligations to such station 
will cease upon deletion of the facility from the Commission's official 
licensing records, and the EA licensee then will be able to construct 
and operate without regard to that previous authorization.

Sec. 90.685  Authorization, construction and implementation of EA licenses.

    (a) EA licenses in the 806-821/851-866 MHz band will be issued for a 
term not to exceed ten years. Additionally, EA licensees generally will 
be afforded a renewal expectancy only for those stations put into 
service after August 10, 1996.
    (b) EA licensees in the 806-821/851-866 MHz band must, within three 
years of the grant of their initial license, construct and place into 
operation a sufficient number of base stations to provide coverage to at 
least one-third of the population of its EA-based service area. Further, 
each EA licensee must provide coverage to at least two-thirds of the 
population of the EA-based service area within five years of the grant 
of their initial license. Alternatively, EA licensees in Channel blocks 
D through V in the 806-821/851-866 MHz band must provide substantial 
service to their markets within five years of the grant of their initial 
license. Substantial service shall be defined as: ``Service which is 
sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service.''
    (c) Channel use requirement. In addition to the population coverage 
requirements described in this section, we will require EA licensees in 
Channel blocks A, B and C in the 816-821/861-866 MHz band to construct 
50 percent of the total channels included in their spectrum block in at 
least one location in their respective EA-based service area within 
three years of initial license grant and to retain such channel usage 
for the remainder of the construction period.

[[Page 476]]

    (d) An EA licensee's failure to meet the population coverage 
requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, will result in 
forfeiture of the entire EA license. Forfeiture of the EA license, 
however, would not result in the loss of any constructed facilities 
authorized to the licensee prior to the date of the commencement of the 
auction for the EA licenses.

Sec. 90.687  Special provisions regarding assignments and transfers of authorizations for incumbent SMR licensees in the 806-821/851-866 MHz band.

    An SMR license initially authorized on any of the channels listed in 
Table 4A of Sec. 90.617 of this part may transfer or assign its 
channel(s) to another entity subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.948 of 
this chapter and Sec. 90.609(b) of this part. If the proposed transferee 
or assignee is the EA licensee for the spectrum block to which the 
channel is allocated, such transfer or assignment presumptively will be 
deemed to be in the public interest. However, such presumption will be 
rebuttable.

Sec. 90.689  Field strength limits.

    (a) For purposes of implementing Secs. 90.689 through 90.699, 
predicted 36 and 40 dB[mu]V/m contours shall be calculated using Figure 
10 of Sec. 73.699 of this chapter with a correction factor of -9 dB, and 
predicted 18 and 22 dB[mu]V/m contours shall be calculated using Figure 
10a of Sec. 73.699 of this chapter with a correction factor of -9 dB.
    (b) The predicted or measured field strength at any location on the 
border of the EA-based service area for EA licensees must not exceed 40 
dBuV/m unless all bordering EA licensees agree to a higher field 
strength. In the event that this standard conflicts with the EA 
licensee's obligation to provide co-channel protection to incumbent 
licensees pursuant to Sec. 90.621(b), the requirements of Sec. 90.621(b) 
shall prevail.

Sec. 90.691  Emission mask requirements for EA-based systems.

    (a) Out-of-band emission requirement shall apply only to the 
``outer'' channels included in an EA license and to spectrum adjacent to 
interior channels used by incumbent licensees. The emission limits are 
as follows:
    (1) For any frequency removed from the EA licensee's frequency block 
by up to and including 37.5 kHz, the power of any emission shall be 
attenuated below the transmitter power (P) in watts by at least 116 
Log<INF>10</INF>(f/6.1) decibels or 50 + 10 Log<INF>10</INF>(P) decibels 
or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation, where f is the 
frequency removed from the center of the outer channel in the block in 
kilohertz and where f is greater than 12.5 kHz.
    (2) For any frequency removed from the EA licensee's frequency block 
greater than 37.5 kHz, the power of any emission shall be attenuated 
below the transmitter power (P) in watts by at least 43 + 
10Log<INF>10</INF>(P) decibels or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser 
attenuation, where f is the frequency removed from the center of the 
outer channel in the block in kilohertz and where f is greater than 37.5 
kHz.
    (b) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require 
greater attenuation than specified in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 90.693  Grandfathering provisions for incumbent licensees.

    (a) General provisions. These provisions apply to ``incumbent 
licensees'', all 800 MHz licensees authorized in the 806-821/851-866 MHz 
band who obtained licenses or filed applications on or before December 
15, 1995.
    (b) Spectrum blocks A through V. An incumbent licensee's service 
area shall be defined by its originally licensed 40 dB[mu]V/m field 
strength contour and its interference contour shall be defined as its 
originally-licensed 22 dB[mu]V/m field strength contour. The 
``originally-licensed'' contour shall be calculated using the maximum 
ERP and the actual height of the antenna above average terrain (HAAT) 
along each radial. Incumbent licensees are permitted to add, remove or 
modify transmitter sites within their original 22 dB[mu]V/m

[[Page 477]]

field strength contour without prior notification to the Commission so 
long as their original 22 dB[mu]V/m field strength contour is not 
expanded and the station complies with the Commission's short-spacing 
criteria in Secs. 90.621(b)(4) through 90.621(b)(6). Incumbent licensee 
protection extends only to its 40 dB[mu]V/m signal strength contour. 
Pursuant to the minor modification notification procedure set forth in 
1.947(b), the incumbent licensee must notify the Commission within 30 
days of any changes in technical parameters or additional stations 
constructed that fall within the short-spacing criteria. See 47 CFR 
90.621(b).
    (c) Special provisions for spectrum blocks D through V. Incumbent 
licensees that have received the consent of all affected parties or a 
certified frequency coordinator to utilize an 18 dB[mu]V/m signal 
strength interference contour shall have their service area defined by 
their originally-licensed 36 dB[mu]V/m field strength contour and their 
interference contour shall be defined as their originally-licensed 18 
dB[mu]V/m field strength contour. The ``originally-licensed'' contour 
shall be calculated using the maximum ERP and the actual HAAT along each 
radial. Incumbent licensees seeking to utilize an 18 dB[mu]V/m signal 
strength interference contour shall first seek to obtain the consent of 
affected co-channel incumbents. When the consent of a co-channel 
licensee is withheld, an incumbent licensee may submit to any certified 
frequency coordinator an engineering study showing that interference 
will not occur, together with proof that the incumbent licensee has 
sought consent. Incumbent licensees are permitted to add, remove or 
modify transmitter sites within their original 18 dB[mu]V/m field 
strength contour without prior notification to the Commission so long as 
their original 18 dB[mu]V/m field strength contour is not expanded and 
the station complies with the Commission's short-spacing criteria in 
Secs. 90.621(b)(4) through 90.621(b)(6). Incumbent licensee protection 
extends only to its 36 dB[mu]V/m signal strength contour. Pursuant to 
the minor modification notification procedure set forth in 1.947(b), the 
incumbent licensee must notify the Commission within 30 days of any 
changes in technical parameters or additional stations constructed that 
fall within the short-spacing criteria. See 47 CFR 90.621(b).
    (d) Consolidated license--(1) Spectrum blocks A through V. Incumbent 
licensees operating at multiple sites may, after grant of EA licenses 
has been completed, exchange multiple site licenses for a single 
license, authorizing operations throughout the contiguous and 
overlapping 40 dB[mu]V/m field strength contours of the multiple sites. 
Incumbents exercising this license exchange option must submit specific 
information on Form 601 for each of their external base sites after the 
close of the 800 MHz SMR auction. The incumbent's geographic license 
area is defined by the contiguous and overlapping 22 dB[mu]V/m contours 
of its constructed and operational external base stations and interior 
sites that are constructed within the construction period applicable to 
the incumbent. Once the geographic license is issued, facilities that 
are added within an incumbent's existing footprint and that are not 
subject to prior approval by the Commission will not be subject to 
construction requirements.
    (2) Special Provisions for Spectrum Blocks D through V. Incumbent 
licensees that have received the consent of all affected parties or a 
certified frequency coordinator to utilize an 18 dB[mu]V/m signal 
strength interference contour operating at multiple sites may, after 
grant of EA licenses has been completed, exchange multiple site licenses 
for a single license. This single site license will authorize operations 
throughout the contiguous and overlapping 36 dB[mu]V/m field strength 
contours of the multiple sites. Incumbents exercising this license 
exchange option must submit specific information on Form 601 for each of 
their external base sites after the close of the 800 SMR auction. The 
incumbent's geographic license area is defined by the contiguous and 
overlapping 18 dB[mu]V/m contours of its constructed and operational 
external base stations and interior sites that are constructed within 
the construction period applicable to the incumbent. Once the geographic 
license is issued, facilities that are added within an incumbent's 
existing

[[Page 478]]

footprint and that are not subject to prior approval by the Commission 
will not be subject to construction requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 90.699  Transition of the upper 200 channels in the 800 MHz band to EA licensing.

    In order to facilitate provision of service throughout an EA, an EA 
licensee may relocate incumbent licensees in its EA by providing 
``comparable facilities'' on other frequencies in the 800 MHz band. Such 
relocation is subject to the following provisions:
    (a) EA licensees may negotiate with incumbent licensees as defined 
in Sec. 90.693 operating on frequencies in Spectrum Blocks A, B, and C 
for the purpose of agreeing to terms under which the incumbents would 
relocate their operations to other frequencies in the 800 MHz band, or 
alternatively, would accept a sharing arrangement with the EA licensee 
that may result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to 
the incumbent licensee's operations. EA licensees may also negotiate 
agreements for relocation of the incumbents' facilities within Spectrum 
Blocks A, B or C in which all interested parties agree to the relocation 
of the incumbent's facilities elsewhere within these bands. ``All 
interested parties'' includes the incumbent licensee, the EA licensee 
requesting and paying for the relocation, and any EA licensee of the 
spectrum to which the incumbent's facilities are to be relocated.
    (b) The relocation mechanism consists of two phases that must be 
completed before an EA licensee may proceed to request the involuntary 
relocation of an incumbent licensee.
    (1) Voluntary negotiations. There is a one year voluntary period 
during which an EA licensee and an incumbent may negotiate any mutually 
agreeable relocation agreement. The Commission will announce the 
commencement of the first phase voluntary period by Public Notice. EA 
licensees must notify incumbents operating on frequencies included in 
their spectrum block of their intention to relocate such incumbents 
within 90 days of the release of the Public Notice that commences the 
voluntary negotiation period. Failure on the part of the EA licensee to 
notify the incumbent licensee during this 90 period of its intention to 
relocate the incumbent will result in the forfeiture of the EA 
licensee's right to request involuntary relocation of the incumbent at 
any time in the future.
    (2) Mandatory negotiations. If no agreement is reached by the end of 
the voluntary period, a one-year mandatory negotiation period will begin 
during which both the EA licensee and the incumbent must negotiate in 
``good faith.'' Failure on the part of the EA licensee to negotiate in 
good faith during this mandatory period will result in the forfeiture of 
the EA licensee's right to request involuntary relocation of the 
incumbent at any time in the future.
    (c) Involuntary relocation procedures. If no agreement is reached 
during either the voluntary or mandatory negotiating periods, the EA 
licensee may request involuntary relocation of the incumbent's system. 
In such a situation, the EA licensee must:
    (1) Guarantee payment of relocation costs, including all 
engineering, equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any legitimate and 
prudent transaction expenses incurred by the incumbent licensee that are 
directly attributable to an involuntary relocation, subject to a cap of 
two percent of the hard costs involved. Hard costs are defined as the 
actual costs associated with providing a replacement system, such as 
equipment and engineering expenses. EA licensees are not required to pay 
incumbent licensees for internal resources devoted to the relocation 
process. EA licensees are not required to pay for transaction costs 
incurred by incumbent licensees during the voluntary or mandatory 
periods once the involuntary period is initiated, or for fees that 
cannot be legitimately tied to the provision of comparable facilities;
    (2) Complete all activities necessary for implementing the 
replacement facilities, including engineering and cost analysis of the 
relocation procedure and, if radio facilities are used, identifying and 
obtaining, on the incumbents' behalf, new frequencies and frequency 
coordination; and

[[Page 479]]

    (3) Build the replacement system and test it for comparability with 
the existing 800 MHz system.
    (d) Comparable facilities. The replacement system provided to an 
incumbent during an involuntary relocation must be at least equivalent 
to the existing 800 MHz system with respect to the following four 
factors:
    (1) System. System is defined functionally from the end user's point 
of view (i.e., a system is comprised of base station facilities that 
operate on an integrated basis to provide service to a common end user, 
and all mobile units associated with those base stations). A system may 
include multiple-licensed facilities that share a common switch or are 
otherwise operated as a unitary system, provided that the end user has 
the ability to access all such facilities. A system may cover more than 
one EA if its existing geographic coverage extends beyond the EA 
borders.
    (2) Capacity. To meet the comparable facilities requirement, an EA 
licensee must relocate the incumbent to facilities that provide 
equivalent channel capacity. We define channel capacity as the same 
number of channels with the same bandwidth that is currently available 
to the end user. For example, if an incumbent's system consists of five 
50 kHz (two 25 kHz paired frequencies) channels, the replacement system 
must also have five 50 kHz channels. If a different channel 
configuration is used, it must have the same overall capacity as the 
original configuration. Comparable channel capacity requires equivalent 
signaling capability, baud rate, and access time. In addition, the 
geographic coverage of the channels must be coextensive with that of the 
original system.
    (3) Quality of service. Comparable facilities must provide the same 
quality of service as the facilities being replaced. Quality of service 
is defined to mean that the end user enjoys the same level of 
interference protection on the new system as on the old system. In 
addition, where voice service is provided, the voice quality on the new 
system must be equal to the current system. Finally, reliability of 
service is considered to be integral to defining quality of service. 
Reliability is the degree to which information is transferred accurately 
within the system. Reliability is a function of equipment failures 
(e.g., transmitters, feed lines, antennas, receivers, battery back-up 
power, etc.) and the availability of the frequency channel due to 
propagation characteristics (e.g., frequency, terrain, atmospheric 
conditions, radio-frequency noise, etc.) For digital data systems, this 
will be measured by the percent of time the bit error rate exceeds the 
desired value. For analog or digital voice transmissions, this will be 
measured by the percent of time that audio signal quality meets an 
established threshold. If analog voice system is replaced with a digital 
voice system the resulting frequency response, harmonic distortion, 
signal-to-noise ratio, and reliability will be considered.
    (4) Operating costs. Operating costs are those costs that affect the 
delivery of services to the end user. If the EA licensee provides 
facilities that entail higher operating cost than the incumbent's 
previous system, and the cost increase is a direct result of the 
relocation, the EA licensee must compensate the incumbent for the 
difference. Costs associated with the relocation process can fall into 
several categories. First, the incumbent must be compensated for any 
increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilitates 
(e.g., additional rental payments, increased utility fees). Second, 
increased maintenance costs must be taken into consideration when 
determining whether operating costs are comparable. For example, 
maintenance costs associated with analog systems may be higher than the 
costs of digital equipment because manufacturers are producing mostly 
digital equipment and analog replacement parts can be difficult to find. 
An EA licensee's obligation to pay increased operating costs will end 
five years after relocation has occurred.
    (e) If an EA licensee cannot provide comparable facilities to an 
incumbent licensee as defined in this section, the incumbent licensee 
may continue to operate its system on a primary basis in accordance with 
the provisions of this rule part.
    (f) Cost-sharing plan for 800 MHz SMR EA licensees. EA licensees are 
required to relocate the existing 800 MHz SMR

[[Page 480]]

licensee in these bands if interference to the existing incumbent 
operations would occur. All EA licensees who benefit from the spectrum 
clearing by other EA licensees must contribute, on a pro rata basis to 
such relocation costs. EA licensees may satisfy this requirement by 
entering into private cost-sharing agreements or agreeing to terms other 
than those specified in this section. However, EA licensees are required 
to reimburse other EA licensees that incur relocation costs and are not 
parties to the alternative agreement as defined in this section.
    (1) Pro rata formula. EA licensees who benefit from the relocation 
of the incumbent must share the relocation costs on a pro rata basis. 
For purposes of determining whether an EA licensee benefits from the 
relocation of an incumbent, benefitted will be defined as any EA 
licensee that:
    (i) Notifies incumbents operating on frequencies included in their 
spectrum block of their intention to relocate such incumbents within 90 
days of the release of the Public Notice that commences the voluntary 
negotiation period; or
    (ii) Fails to notify incumbents operating on frequencies included in 
their spectrum block of their intention to relocate such incumbents 
within 90 days of the release of the Public Notice that commences the 
voluntary negotiation period, but subsequently decides to use the 
frequencies included in their spectrum block. EA licensees who do not 
participate in the relocation process will be prohibited from invoking 
mandatory negotiations or any of the provisions of the Commission's 
mandatory relocation guidelines. EA licensees who do not provide notice 
to the incumbent, but subsequently decide to use the frequencies in 
their EA will be required to reimburse, outside of the Commission's 
mandatory relocation guidelines, those EA licensees who have established 
a reimbursement right pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
    (2) Triggering a reimbursement obligation. An EA licensees 
reimbursement obligation is triggered by:
    (i) Notification (i.e., files a copy of the relocation notice and 
proof of the incumbent's receipt of the notice to the Commission within 
ten days of receipt), to the incumbent within 90 days of the release of 
the Public Notice commencing the voluntary negotiation period of its 
intention to relocate the incumbent; or
    (ii) An EA licensee who does not provide notification within 90 days 
of the release of the Public Notice commencing the voluntary negotiation 
period, but subsequently decides to use the channels that were relocated 
by other EA licensees.
    (3) Triggering a reimbursement right. In order for the EA licensee 
to trigger a reimbursement right, the EA licensee must notify (i.e., 
files a copy of the relocation notice and proof of the incumbent's 
receipt of the notice to the Commission within ten days of receipt), the 
incumbent of its intention to relocate the incumbent within 90 days of 
the release of the Public Notice commencing the voluntary negotiation 
period, and subsequently negotiate and sign a relocation agreement with 
the incumbent. An EA licensee who relocates a channel outside of its 
licensed EA (i.e., one that is in another frequency block or outside of 
its market area), is entitled to pro rata reimbursement from non-
notifying EA licensees who subsequently exercise their right to the 
channels based on the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31JY97.002

Ci  equals the amount of reimbursement
Tc  equals the actual cost of relocating the incumbent
TCh  equals the total number of channels that are being relocated
Chj  equals the number of channels that each respective EA licensee will 
benefit from

    (4) Payment issues. EA licensees who benefit from the relocation of 
the incumbent will be required to submit their pro rata share of the 
relocation expense to EA licensees who have triggered a reimbursement 
right and have incurred relocation costs as follows:
    (i) For an EA licensee who, within 90 days of the release of the 
Public Notice announcing the commencement of the voluntary negotiation 
period, provides notice of its intention to relocate the incumbent, but 
does not participate or incur relocation costs in the relocation

[[Page 481]]

process, will be required to reimburse those EA licensees who have 
triggered a reimbursement right and have incurred relocation costs 
during the relocation process, its pro rata share when the channels of 
the incumbent have been cleared (i.e., the incumbent has been fully 
relocated and the channels are free and clear).
    (ii) For an EA licensee who does not, within 90 days of the release 
of the Public Notice announcing the commencement of the voluntary 
negotiation period, provide notice to the incumbent of its intention to 
relocate and does not incur relocation costs during the relocation 
process, but subsequently decides to use the channels in its EA, will be 
required to submit its pro rata share payment to those EA licensees who 
have triggered a reimbursement right and have incurred relocation costs 
during the relocation process prior to commencing testing of its system.
    (5) Sunset of reimbursement rights. EA licensees who do not trigger 
a reimbursement obligation as set forth in paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section, shall not be required to reimburse EA licensees who have 
triggered a reimbursement right as set forth in paragraph (f)(3) of this 
section ten (10) years after the voluntary negotiation period begins for 
EA licensees (i.e., ten (10) years after the Commission releases the 
Public Notice commencing the voluntary negotiation period).
    (6) Resolution of disputes that arise during relocation. Disputes 
arising out of the costs of relocation, such as disputes over the amount 
of reimbursement required, will be encouraged to use expedited ADR 
procedures. ADR procedures provide several alternative methods such as 
binding arbitration, mediation, or other ADR techniques.
    (7) Administration of the cost-sharing plan. We will allow for an 
industry supported, not-for-profit clearinghouse to be established for 
purposes of administering the cost-sharing plan adopted for the 800 MHz 
SMR relocation procedures.

Sec. 90.709  Special limitations on amendment of applications and on assignment or transfer of authorizations licensed under this subpart.

    (a) Except as indicated in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
Commission will not consent to the following:
    (1) Any request to amend an application so as to substitute a new 
entity as the applicant;
    (2) Any application to assign or transfer a license for a Phase I, 
non-nationwide system prior to the completion of construction of 
facilities; or
    (3) Any application to transfer or assign a license for a Phase I 
nationwide system before the licensee has constructed at least 40 
percent of the proposed system pursuant to the provisions of 
Sec. 90.725(a) or Sec. 90.725(h), as applicable.
    (b) The Commission will grant the applications described in 
paragrpah (a) of this section if:
    (1) the request to amend an application or to transfer or assign a 
license does not involve a substantial change in the ownership or 
control or the applicant; or
    (2) The changes in the ownership or control of the applciant are 
involuntary due to the original applicant's insolvency, bankruptcy, 
incapacity, or death.
    (c) The assignee or transferee of a Phase I nationwide system is 
subject to the construction benchmarks and reporting requirements of 
Sec. 90.725. The assignee or transferee of a Phase I nationwide system

Sec. 90.711  Processing of Phase II applications.

    (a) Phase II applications for authorizations on Channels 166 through 
170 and Channels 181 through 185 will be processed on a first-come, 
first-served basis. When multiple applications are filed on the same day 
for these frequencies in the same geographic area, and insufficient 
frequencies are available to grant all applications (i.e., if all 
applications were granted, violation of the station separation 
provisions of Sec. 90.723(k) of this part would result), these 
applications will be considered mutually exclusive.

[[Page 483]]

    (1) All applications will first be considered to determine whether 
they are substantially complete and acceptable for filing. If so, they 
will be assigned a file number and put in pending status. If not, they 
will be dismissed.
    (2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all applications 
in pending status will be processed in the order in which they are 
received, determined by the date on which the application was received 
by the Commission in its Gettysburg, Pennsylvania office (or the address 
set forth at Sec. 1.1102 of this chapter for applications requiring the 
fees established by part 1, subpart G of this chapter).
    (3) Each application that is accepted for filing will then be 
reviewed to determine whether it can be granted. Frequencies will be 
assigned by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 90.723.
    (4) An application which is dismissed will lose its place in the 
processing line.
    (b) All applications for Channels 161 through 165 that comply with 
the applicable rules of this part shall be granted. Licensees operating 
on such channels shall cooperate in the selection and use of frequencies 
and resolve any instances of interference in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 90.173.
    (c) Phase II applications for authorization on all non-Government 
channels other than Channels 161 through 170 and 181 through 185 shall 
be processed in accordance with the provisions of subpart W of this 
part.

Sec. 90.713  Entry criteria.

    (a) As set forth in Sec. 90.717, four 5-channel blocks are available 
for nationwide, commercial use to non-Government, Phase I applicants. 
Applicants for these nationwide channel blocks must comply with 
paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
    (b)(1) An applicant must include certification that, within ten 
years of receiving a license, it will construct a minimum of one base 
station in at least 70 different geographic areas designated in the 
application; that base stations will be located in a minimum of 28 of 
the 100 urban areas listed in Sec. 90.741; and that each base station 
will have all five assigned nationwide channels constructed and placed 
in operation (regularly interacting with mobile and/or portable units).
    (2) An applicant must include certification that it will meet the 
construction requirements set forth in Sec. 90.725.
    (3) An applicant must include a ten-year schedule detailing plans 
for construction of the proposed system.
    (4) An applicant must include an itemized estimate of the cost of 
constructing 40 percent of the system and operating the system during 
the first four years of the license term.
    (5) An applicant must include proof that the applicant has 
sufficient financial resources to construct 40 percent of the system and 
operate the proposed land mobile system for the first four years of the 
license term; i.e., that the applicant has net current assets sufficient 
to cover estimated costs or a firm financial commitment sufficient to 
cover estimated costs.
    (c) An applicant relying on personal or internal resources for the 
showing required in paragraph (b) of this section must submit 
independently audited financial statements certified within one year of 
the date of the application showing net current assets sufficient to 
meet estimated construction and operating costs. An applicant must also 
submit an unaudited balance sheet, current within 60 days of the date of 
submission, that clearly shows the continued availability of sufficient 
net current assets to construct and operate the proposed system, and a 
certification by the applicant or an officer of the applicant 
organization attesting to the validity of the balance sheet.
    (d) An applicant submitting evidence of a firm financial commitment 
for the showing required in paragraph (b) of this section must obtain 
the commitment from a bona fide commercially acceptable source, e.g., a 
state or federally chartered bank or savings and loan institution, other 
recognized financial institution, the financial arm of a capital 
equipment supplier, or an investment banking house. If the lender is not 
a state or federally chartered bank or savings and loan institution, 
other

[[Page 484]]

recognized financial institution, the financial arm of a capital 
equipment supplier, or an investment banking house, the lender must also 
demonstrate that it has funds available to cover the total commitments 
it has made. The lender's commitment shall contain a statement that the 
lender:
    (1) Has examined the financial condition of the applicant including 
an audited financial statement, and has determined that the applicant is 
creditworthy;
    (2) Has examined the financial viability of the proposed system for 
which the applicant intends to use the commitment; and
    (3) Is willing, if the applicant is seeking a Phase I, commercial 
nationwide license, to provide a sum to the applicant sufficient to 
cover the realistic and prudent estimated costs of construction of 40 
percent of the system and operation of the system for the first four 
years of the license term.
    (e) A Phase II applicant for authorization in a geographic area for 
Channels 166 through 170 in the public safety/mutual aid category may 
not have any interest in another pending application in the same 
geographic area for Channels 166 through 170 in the public safety/mutual 
aid category, and a Phase II applicant for authorization in a geographic 
area for channels in the emergency medical category may not have any 
interest in another pending application in the same geographic area for 
channels in the emergency medical category.

Sec. 90.733  Permissible operations.

    (a) Systems authorized in the 220-222 MHz band may be used:
    (1)(i) For government and non-government land mobile operations, 
i.e., for base/mobile and mobile relay transmissions, on a primary 
basis; or
    (ii) For the following operations instead of or in addition to a 
licensee's land mobile operations: One-way or two-way paging operations 
on a primary basis by all non-Government Phase II licensees, fixed 
operations on a primary basis by all non-Government Phase II licensees 
and all Government licensees, one-way or two-way paging or fixed 
operations on a primary basis by all non-Government Phase I licensees, 
except that before a non-Government Phase I licensee may operate one-way 
or two-way paging or fixed systems on a primary basis instead of or in 
addition to its land mobile operations, it must meet the following 
requirements:
    (A) A nationwide Phase I licensee must;
    (1) Meet its two-year benchmark for the construction of its land 
mobile system base stations as prescribed in Sec. 90.725(a); and
    (2) Provide a new 10-year schedule, as required in 
Sec. 90.713(b)(3), for the construction of the fixed and/or paging 
system it intends to construct instead of, or in addition to, its 
nationwide land mobile system; and
    (3) Certify that the financial showings and all other certifications 
provided in demonstrating its ability to construct and operate its 
nationwide land mobile system, as required in Secs. 90.713 (b), (c) and 
(d), remain applicable to the nationwide system it intends to construct 
consisting of fixed and/or paging operations on a primary basis instead 
of, or in addition to, its land mobile operations; or
    (4) In lieu of providing the requirements of paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii)(A)(3) of this section, provide the financial showings and all 
other certifications required in Secs. 90.713 (b), (c) and (d) to 
demonstrate its ability to construct and operate a nationwide system 
consisting of fixed and/or paging operations on a primary basis instead 
of, or in addition to, its land mobile operations.
    (B) A non-nationwide Phase I licensee must first meet the 
requirement to construct its land mobile base station and place it in 
operation, or commence service (in accordance with Sec. 90.167) as 
prescribed in Sec. 90.725(f) or Sec. 90.727, as applicable.
    (2) Only by persons who are eligible for facilities under either 
this subpart or in the pools included in subpart B or C of this part.
    (3) Except for licensees classified as CMRS providers under part 20 
of this chapter, only for the transmission of messages or signals 
permitted in the services in which the participants are eligible.
    (b) See Sec. 90.720 of this part for permissible operations on 
mutual aid channels.
    (c) For operations requiring less than a 4 kHz bandwidth, more than 
a single emission may be utilized within the authorized bandwidth. In 
such cases, the frequency stability requirements of Sec. 90.213 do not 
apply, but the out-of-band emission limits of Sec. 90.210(f) must be 
met.
    (d) Licensees, except for licensees authorized on Channels 161 
through 170 and 181 through 185, may combine any number of their 
authorized, contiguous channels (including channels derived from 
multiple authorizations) to form channels wider than 5 kHz.

[[Page 492]]

    (e) In combining authorized, contiguous channels (including channels 
derived from multiple authorizations) to form channels wider than 5 kHz, 
the emission limits in Sec. 90.210(f) must be met only at the outermost 
edges of the contiguous channels. Transmitters shall be tested to 
confirm compliance with this requirement with the transmission located 
as close to the band edges as permitted by the design of the 
transmitter. The frequency stability requirements in Sec. 90.213 shall 
apply only to the outermost of the contiguous channels authorized to the 
licensee. However, the frequency stability employed for transmissions 
operating inside the outermost contiguous channels must be such that the 
emission limits in Sec. 90.210(f) are met over the temperature and 
voltage variations prescribed in Sec. 2.995 of this chapter.
    (f) A Phase I non-nationwide licensee operating a paging base 
station, or a fixed station transmitting on frequencies in the 220-221 
MHz band, may only operate such stations at the coordinates of the 
licensee's authorized land mobile base station.
    (g) The transmissions of a Phase I non-nationwide licensee's paging 
base station, or fixed station transmitting on frequencies in the 220-
221 MHz band, must meet the requirements of Secs. 90.723(d), (g), (h), 
and (k), and 90.729, and such a station must operate at the effective 
radiated power and antenna height-above-average-terrain prescribed in 
the licensee's land mobile base station authorization.
    (h) Licensees using 220-222 MHz spectrum for geophysical telemetry 
operations are authorized to operate fixed stations on a secondary, non-
interference basis to licensees operating in the 220-222 MHz band on a 
primary basis under the conditions that such licensees:
    (1) Provide notification of their operations to co-channel non-
nationwide Phase I licensees with an authorized base station, or fixed 
station transmitting on frequencies in the 220-221 MHz band, located 
within 45 km of the secondary licensee's station, to co-channel, Phase 
II EA or Regional licensee authorized to operate in the EA or REAG in 
which the secondary licensee's station is located, and to co-channel 
Phase I or Phase II nationwide licensees;
    (2) Operate only at temporary locations in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1.931 of this chapter;
    (3) Not transmit at a power level greater than one watt ERP;
    (4) Not transmit from an antenna higher than 2 meters (6.6 feet) 
above ground; and
    (5) Not operate on Channels 111 through 120, 161 through 170, or 181 
through 185.
    (i) All licensees constructing and operating base stations or fixed 
stations on frequencies in the 220-222 MHz band must:

Sec. 90.743  Renewal expectancy.

    (a) All licensees seeking renewal of their authorizations at the end 
of their license term must file a renewal application in accordance with 
the provisions of Sec. 90.149. Licensees must demonstrate, in their 
application, that:
    (1) They have provided ``substantial'' service during their past 
license term. ``Substantial'' service is defined in this rule as service 
that is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre 
service that just might minimally warrant renewal; and
    (2) They have substantially complied with applicable FCC rules, 
policies, and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
    (b) In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, a 
renewal applicant must submit a showing explaining why it should receive 
a renewal expectancy. At a minimum, this showing must include:
    (1) A description of its current service in terms of geographic 
coverage and population served;
    (2) For an EA, Regional, or nationwide licensee, an explanation of 
its record of expansion, including a timetable of the construction of 
new stations to meet changes in demand for service;
    (3) A description of its investments in its system;
    (4) Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated 
the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and
    (5) A list of any pending proceedings that relate to any matter 
described in this paragraph.
    (c) Phase I non-nationwide licensees have license terms of 5 years, 
and therefore must meet these requirements 5 years from the date of 
initial authorization in order to receive a renewal expectancy. Phase I 
nationwide licensees and all Phase II licensees have license terms of 10 
years, and therefore must meet these requirements 10 years from the date 
of initial authorization in order to receive a renewal expectancy.

Sec. 90.745  Phase I licensee service areas.

    (a) A Phase I licensee's service area shall be defined by the 
predicted 38 dBu service contour of its authorized base station or fixed 
station transmitting on frequencies in the 220-221 MHz band at its 
initially authorized location or at the location authorized in 
accordance with Secs. 90.751, 90.753, 90.755 and 90.757 if the licensee 
has sought modification of its license to relocate its initially 
authorized base station. The Phase I licensee's predicted 38 dBu service 
contour is calculated using the F(50,50) field strength chart for 
Channels 7-13 in Sec. 73.699 (Fig. 10) of this chapter, with a 9 dB 
correction factor for antenna height differential, and is based on the 
authorized effective radiated power (ERP) and antenna height-above-
average-terrain of the licensee's base station or fixed station. Phase I 
licensees are permitted to add, remove, or modify transmitter sites 
within their existing service area without prior notification to the 
Commission so long as their predicted 38 dBu service contour is not 
expanded. The incumbent licensee must, however, notify the Commission 
within 30 days of the completion of any changes in technical parameters 
or additional stations constructed through a minor modification of its 
license. Such notification must be made by submitting the appropriate 
FCC form and must include the appropriate filing fee, if any. These 
minor modification applications are not subject to public notice and 
petition to deny requirements or mutually exclusive applications.
    (b) Phase I licensees holding authorizations for service areas that 
are contiguous and overlapping may exchange these authorizations for a 
single license, authorizing operations throughout the contiguous and 
overlapping service areas. Phase I licensees exercising this license 
exchange option must submit specific information for

[[Page 496]]

each of their external base station sites.

Sec. 90.751  Minor modifications of Phase I, non-nationwide licenses.

    Phase I non-nationwide licensees will be given an opportunity to 
seek modification of their license to relocate their initially 
authorized base station, i.e., locate their base station at a site other 
than its initially authorized location. The conditions under which 
modifications will be granted and the procedures for applying for 
license modifications are described in Secs. 90.753, 90.757 and 1.929 of 
this chapter. For CMRS licensees, these modifications will be treated as 
minor modifications in accordance with Sec. 1.929 of this chapter.

[63 FR 68973, Dec. 14, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 90.753  Conditions of license modification.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), and (c) of this section, a 
Phase I non nationwide licensee may modify its authorization to relocate 
its authorized base station up to one-half the distance over 120 km 
toward any co-channel licensee's initially authorized base station, to a 
maximum distance of 8 km.
    (b) A Phase I non-nationwide licensee with an authorized base 
station located outside a Designated Filing Area (DFA) (see Public 
Notice, DA 86-173, 52 FR 1302 (January 12, 1987)) may modify its 
authorization to relocate its authorized base station up to one-half the 
distance over 120 km toward any co-channel licensee's initially 
authorized base station, to a maximum distance of 25 km, so long as the 
base station is relocated no more than 8 km inside of any DFA (i.e., no 
more than 8 km from the nearest DFA boundary line).
    (c) A Phase I non-nationwide licensee that has been granted Special 
Temporary Authority (STA) to operate at an alternative base station 
location may modify its authorization to seek permanent authorization at 
that location, regardless of whether locating the station at the STA 
site is in strict conformance with the provisions of paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section, if the licensee certifies that such a modification 
is in conformance with Secs. 90.723 and 90.729 and:
    (1) It has constructed its base station and has placed it in 
operation, or commenced service, at the STA site on or before January 
26, 1996; or
    (2) It has taken delivery of its base station transceiver on or 
before January 26, 1996.
    (d) The application for a Phase I non-nationwide licensee proposing 
a base station modification resulting in less than 120 km separation 
from a co-channel licensee's initially authorized base station will be 
accepted by the Commission only with the consent of that co-channel 
licensee, as evidenced in a statement submitted concurrently with the 
licensee's application submission on FCC Form 601.
    (e) The application of a Phase I non-nationwide licensee proposing a 
base station modification resulting in at least a 120 km separation from 
each co-channel licensee's initially authorized base station but more 
than one-half the distance over 120 km toward any co-channel licensee's 
initially authorized base station will be accepted by the Commission 
only with the consent of that co-channel licensee, as evidenced in a 
statement submitted concurrently with the licensee's submission on FCC 
Form 601.

Sec. 90.757  Construction requirements.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a Phase I 
non-nationwide licensee that is granted modification of its 
authorization to relocate its base station must construct its base 
station and place it in operation, or commence service, on all 
authorized channels on or before August 15, 1996, or within 12 months of 
initial grant date, whichever is later. The authorization of a licensee 
that does not construct its base station and place it in operation, or 
commence service, by this date, cancels automatically and must be 
returned to the Commission.
    (b) A Phase I non-nationwide licensee with a base station authorized 
at a location north of Line A must construct its base station and place 
it in operation, or commence service, on all authorized channels within 
12 months of

[[Page 497]]

initial grant date, or within 12 months of the date of the release of 
the terms of an agreement between the United States and Canadian 
governments on the sharing of 220-222 MHz spectrum between the two

not construct its base station and place it in operation, or commence 
service, by this date, cancels automatically and must be returned to the 
Commission.

Sec. 90.763  EA, Regional and nationwide system operations.

    (a) A nationwide licensee authorized pursuant to Sec. 90.717(a) may 
construct and operate any number of land mobile or paging base stations, 
or fixed stations, anywhere in the Nation, and transmit on any of its 
authorized channels, provided that the licensee complies with the 
requirements of Sec. 90.733(i).
    (b) An EA or Regional licensee authorized pursuant to Sec. 90.761 
may construct and operate any number of land mobile or paging base 
stations, or fixed stations, anywhere within its authorized EA or REAG, 
and transmit on any of its authorized channels, provided that:
    (1) The licensee affords protection to all authorized co-channel 
Phase I non-nationwide base stations as follows:
    (i) The EA or Regional licensee must locate its land mobile or 
paging base stations, or fixed stations transmitting on base station 
transmit frequencies, at least 120 km from the land mobile or paging 
base stations, or fixed stations transmitting on base station transmit 
frequencies, of co-channel Phase I licensees, except that separations of 
less than 120 km shall be considered on a case-by-case basis upon 
submission by the EA or Regional licensee of:
    (A) A technical analysis demonstrating at least 10 dB protection to 
the predicted 38 dBu service contour of the co-channel Phase I licensee, 
i.e., demonstrating that the predicted 28 dBu interfering contour of the 
EA or Regional licensee's base station or fixed station does not overlap 
the predicted 38 dBu service contour of the co-channel Phase I 
licensee's base station or fixed station; or
    (B) A written letter from the co-channel Phase I licensee consenting 
to a separation of less than 120 km, or to less than 10 dB protection to 
the predicted 38 dBu service contour of the licensee's base station or 
fixed station.
    (ii) The Phase I licensee's predicted 38 dBu service contour 
referred to in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is calculated using 
the F(50,50) field strength chart for Channels 7-13 in Sec. 73.699 (Fig. 
10) of this chapter, with a 9 dB correction factor for antenna height 
differential, and is based on the licensee's authorized effective 
radiated power and antenna height-above-average-terrain. The EA or 
Regional licensee's predicted 28 dBu interfering contour referred to in 
paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is calculated using the F(50,10) 
field strength chart for Channels 7-13 in Sec. 73.699 (Fig. 10a) of this 
chapter, with a 9 dB correction factor for antenna height differential.
    (2) The licensee complies with the requirements of Sec. 90.733(i).
    (3) The licensee limits the field strength of its base stations, or 
fixed stations operating on base station transmit frequencies, in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 90.771.
    (4) Upon request by a licensee or the Commission, an EA or regional 
licensee shall furnish the technical parameters, location and 
coordinates of the completion of the addition, removal, relocation or 
modification of any of its facilities within the EA or region. The EA or 
regional licensee must provide such information within

[[Page 498]]

ten (10) days of receiving written notification.
    (c) In the event that the authorization for a co-channel Phase I 
base station, or fixed station transmitting on base station transmit 
frequencies, within an EA or Regional licensee's border is terminated or 
revoked, the EA or Regional licensee's channel obligations to such 
stations will cease upon deletion of the facility from the Commission's 
official licensing records, and the EA or Regional licensee then will be 
able to construct and operate without regard to the previous 
authorization.

Sec. 90.813  Partitioned licenses and disaggregated spectrum.

    (a) Eligibility. Parties seeking approval for partitioning and 
disaggregation shall request an authorization for partial assignment of 
a license pursuant to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter.
    (b) Technical standards--(1) Partitioning. In the case of 
partitioning, requests for authorization for partial assignment of a 
license must include, as attachments, a description of the partitioned 
service area and a calculation of the population of the partitioned 
service area and the licensed geographic service area. The partitioned 
service area shall be defined by coordinate points at every 3 degrees 
along the partitioned service area unless an FCC recognized service area 
is utilized (i.e., Major Trading Area, Basic Trading Area, Metropolitan 
Service Area, Rural Service Area or Economic Area) or county lines are 
followed. The geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, 
minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude and 
must be based upon the 1927 North American Datum (NAD27). Applicants may 
supply geographical coordinates based on 1983 North American Datum 
(NAD83) in addition to those required (NAD27). In the case where an FCC 
recognized service area or county lines are utilized, applicants need 
only list the specific area(s) (through use of FCC designations or 
county names) that constitute the partitioned area.
    (2) Disaggregation. Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.
    (3) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. The Commission will 
consider requests for partial assignment of licenses that propose 
combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.
    (c) Installment payments--(1) Apportioning the balance on 
installment payment plans. When a winning bidder elects to pay for its 
license through an installment payment plan pursuant to Sec. 90.812, and 
partitions its licensed area or disaggregates spectrum to another party, 
the outstanding balance owed by the licensee on its installment payment 
plan (including accrued and unpaid interest) shall be apportioned 
between the licensee and partitionee or disaggregatee. Both parties will 
be responsible for paying their proportionate share of the outstanding 
balance to the U.S. Treasury. In the case of partitioning, the balance 
shall be apportioned based upon the ratio of the population of the 
partitioned area to the population of the entire original license area 
calculated based upon the most recent census data. In the case of 
disaggregation, the balance shall be apportioned based upon the ratio of 
the amount of spectrum disaggregated to the amount of spectrum allocated 
to the licensed area.
    (2) Parties not qualified for installment payment plans.
    (i) The partitionee or disaggregatee shall, as a condition of the 
approval of the partial assignment application, pay its entire pro rata 
amount within 30 days of Public Notice conditionally granting the 
partial assignment application. Failure to meet this condition will 
result in a rescission of the grant of the partial assignment 
application.
    (ii) The licensee shall be permitted to continue to pay its pro rata 
share of the outstanding balance and shall receive new financing 
documents (promissory note, security agreement)

[[Page 501]]

with a revised payment obligation, based on the remaining amount of time 
on the original installment payment schedule. These financing documents 
will replace the licensee's existing financing documents which shall be 
marked ``superseded'' and returned to the licensee upon receipt of the 
new financing documents. The original interest rate, established 
pursuant to Sec. 1.2110(g)(3)(i) of this chapter at the time of the 
grant of the initial license in the market, shall continue to be applied 
to the licensee's portion of the remaining government obligation. The 
Bureau will require, as a further condition to approval of the partial 
assignment application, that the licensee execute and return to the U.S. 
Treasury the new financing documents within 30 days of the Public Notice 
conditionally granting the partial assignment application. Failure to 
meet this condition will result in the automatic cancellation of the 
grant of the partial assignment application.
    (iii) A default on the licensee's payment obligation will only 
affect the licensee's portion of the market.
    (3) Parties qualified for installment payment plans.
    (i) Where both parties to a partitioning or disaggregation agreement 
qualify for installment payments, the partitionee or disaggregatee will 
be permitted to make installment payments on its portion of the 
remaining government obligation, as calculated according to paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Each party will be required, as a condition to approval of the 
partial assignment application, to execute separate financing documents 
(promissory note, security agreement) agreeing to pay their pro rata 
portion of the balance due (including accrued and unpaid interest) based 
upon the installment payment terms for which they qualify under the 
rules. The financing documents must be returned to the U.S. Treasury 
within thirty (30) days of the Public Notice conditionally granting the 
partial assignment application. Failure by either party to meet this 
condition will result in the automatic cancellation of the grant of the 
partial assignment application. The interest rate, established pursuant 
to Sec. 1.2110(g)(3)(i) of this chapter at the time of the grant of the 
initial license in the market, shall continue to be applied to both 
parties' portion of the balance due. Each party will receive a license 
for their portion of the partitioned market or disaggregated spectrum.
    (iii) A default on an obligation will only affect that portion of 
the market area held by the defaulting party.
    (iv) Partitionees and disaggregatees that qualify for installment 
payment plans may elect to pay some of their pro rata portion of the 
balance due in a lump sum payment to the U.S. Treasury and to pay the 
remaining portion of the balance due pursuant to an installment payment 
plan.
    (d) License term. The license term for a partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. 90.665(a).
    (e) Construction requirements--(1) Requirements for partitioning. 
Parties seeking authority to partition must meet one of the following 
construction requirements:
    (i) The partitionee may certify that it will satisfy the applicable 
construction requirements set forth in Sec. 90.665 for the partitioned 
license area; or
    (ii) The original licensee may certify that it has or will meet the 
construction requirements set forth in Sec. 90.665 for the entire 
market. In that case, the partitionee must only meet the requirements 
for renewal of its license for the partitioned license area.
    (iii) Applications requesting partial assignments of license for 
partitioning must include a certification by each geographic area 800 
MHz SMR licenses in the lower 230 channels will be awarded to small 
entities, as that term is defined by the SBA.
    (iv) Partitionees must submit supporting documents showing 
compliance with the respective construction requirements within the 
appropriate time frames set forth in Sec. 90.665.
    (v) Failure by any partitionee to meet its respective performance 
requirements will result in the automatic cancellation of the 
partitioned or disaggregated license without further Commission action.

[[Page 502]]

    (2) Requirements for disaggregation. Parties seeking authority to 
disaggregate must submit with their partial assignment application a 
certification signed by both parties stating which of the parties will 
be responsible for meeting the construction requirements for the market 
as set forth in Sec. 90.665. Parties may agree to share responsibility 
for meeting the construction requirements. Parties that accept 
responsibility for meeting the construction requirements and later fail 
to do so will be subject to license forfeiture without further 
Commission action.

Sec. 90.816  Criteria for comparative 900 MHz SMR renewal proceedings.

    (a) Ultimate issue. The ultimate issue in comparative renewal 
proceedings will be to determine, in light of the evidence adduced in 
the proceeding, what disposition of the applications would best serve 
the public interest, convenience and necessity.
    (b) Renewal expectancies. The most important comparative factor to 
be considered in a comparative 900 MHz SMR renewal proceeding is a major 
preference, commonly referred to as a ``renewal expectancy''.
    (1) The 900 MHz SMR renewal applicant involved in a comparative 
renewal proceeding will receive a renewal expectancy, if its past record 
for the relevant license period demonstrates that:
    (i) The renewal applicant has provided ``substantial'' service 
during its past license term. ``Substantial'' service is defined as 
service which is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of 
mediocre service which just might minimally warrant renewal; and

[[Page 503]]

    (ii) The renewal applicant has substantially complied with 
applicable FCC rules, policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended.
    (2) In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, a 900 
MHz renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding must 
submit a showing explaining why it should receive a renewal expectancy. 
At a minimum, this showing must include:
    (i) A description of its current service in terms of geographic 
coverage and population served;
    (ii) An explanation of its record of expansion, including a 
timetable of the construction of new base sites to meet changes in 
demand for SMR service;
    (iii) A description of its investments in its 900 MHz SMR system; 
and
    (iv) Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated 
the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and a list of any 
pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (3) In making its showing of entitlement to a renewal expectancy, a 
renewal applicant may claim credit for any system modification 
applications that were pending on the date it filed its renewal 
application. Such credit will not be allowed if the modification 
application is dismissed or denied.

provisions in Sec. 90.725(f) of this part.
    (2) Phase I nationwide licensees may apply to partition their 
licensed geographic service area or disaggregate their licensed spectrum 
after constructing at least 40 percent of the geographic areas 
designated in their applications in accordance with the provisions in 
Sec. 90.725(a) of this part.
    (3) Phase II licensees may apply to partition their licensed 
geographic service area or disaggregate their licensed spectrum at any 
time following the grant of their licenses.
    (4) Phase I and Phase II licensees authorized to operate on Channels 
161 through 170 or Channels 181 through 185 are not eligible to 
partition their geographic service area or disaggregate their licensed 
spectrum.
    (b) Partitioning. In the case of partitioning, applicants and 
licensees must file FCC Form 603 pursuant to Sec. 1.948 and list the 
partitioned service area on a schedule to the application. The 
geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and 
seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude and must be 
based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83). In the case where an 
FCC-recognized service area or county lines are utilized, applicants 
need only list the specific area(s) through use of FCC designations or 
county names that constitute the partitioned area.
    (c) License term. The license term for a partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's license term.
    (d) Construction requirements. (1) Requirements for partitioning. 
Parties seeking authority to partition must meet one of the following 
construction requirements:
    (i) The partitionee may certify that it will satisfy the applicable 
construction requirements set forth in Secs. 90.767 or 90.769 of this 
part, as applicable, for the partitioned license area; or
    (ii) The original licensee may certify that it has or will meet its 
five-year construction requirement and will meet the ten-year 
construction requirement, as set forth in Secs. 90.767 or 90.769 of this 
part, as applicable, for the entire license area. In that case, the 
partitionee must only satisfy the requirements for ``substantial 
service,'' as set forth in Sec. 90.743(a)(1) of this part, for the 
partitioned license area by the end of the original ten-year license 
term of the licensee.
    (iii) Failure by any partitionee to meet its respective construction 
requirements will result in the automatic cancellation of the 
partitioned license without further Commission action (see Sec. 1.946).
    (2) Requirements for disaggregation. Parties seeking authority to 
disaggregate spectrum must certify in FCC Form 601 which of the parties 
will be responsible for meeting the five-year and ten-year construction 
requirements for the particular market as set forth in Sec. 90.767 or 
Sec. 90.769, as applicable. Parties may agree to share responsibility 
for meeting the construction requirements. If one party accepts 
responsibility for meeting the construction requirements and later fails 
to do so, then its license will cancel automatically without further 
Commission action. If both parties accept responsibility for meeting the 
construction requirements and later fail to do so, then both their 
licenses will cancel automatically without further Commission action.

<R05>
Sec. 95.208  (R/C Rule 8) How high may I put my antenna?

    (a) Antenna means the radiating system (for transmitting, receiving 
or both) and the structure holding it up (tower, pole or mast). It also 
means everything else attached to the radiating system and the 
structure.
    (b) If your antenna is mounted on a hand-held portable unit, none of 
the following limitations apply.
    (c) If your antenna is installed at a fixed location, it (whether 
receiving, transmitting or both) must comply with either one of the 
following:
    (1) The highest point must not be more than 6.10 meters (20 feet) 
higher than the highest point of the building or tree on which it is 
mounted; or

[[Page 522]]

    (2) The highest point must not be more than 18.3 meters (60 feet) 
above the ground.
    (d) If your R/C station is located near an airport, and if you 
antenna structure is more than 6.1 meters (20 feet) high, your may have 
to obey additional restrictions. The highest point of your antenna must 
not exceed one meter above the airport elevation for every hundred 
meters of distance from the nearest point of the nearest airport runway. 
Differences in ground elevation between your antenna and the airport 
runway may complicate this formula. If your R/C station is near an 
airport, you may contact the nearest FCC field office for a worksheet to 
help you figure the maximum allowable height of your antenna. Consult 
part 17 of the FCC's Rules for more information.

    Warning: Installation and removal of R/C station antennas near 
powerlines is dangerous. For your safety, follow the installation 
directions included with your antenna.

<R05>
Sec. 95.209  (R/C Rule 9) What equipment may I use at my R/C station?

    (a) Your R/C station may transmit only with:
    (1) An FCC certificated R/C transmitter (certificated means the FCC 
has determined that certain radio equipment is capable of meeting 
recommended standards for operation); or
    (2) A non-certificated R/C transmitter on Channels 26.995-27.255 MHz 
if it complies with the technical standards (see part 95, subpart E).
    (3) Use of a transmitter outside of the band 26.955-27.255 MHz which 
is not certificated voids your authority to operate the station. Use of 
a transmitter in the band 26.995-27.255 MHz which does not comply with 
the technical standards voids your authority to operate the station.
    (b) You may examine a list of certificated transmitters at any FCC 
field office.
    (c) Your R/C station may transmit with a transmitter assembled from 
a kit.
    (d) You must not make, or have made, any internal modification to a 
certificated transmitter. (See R/C Rule 22.) Any internal modification 
to a certificated transmitter cancels the certification, and use of such 
a transmitter voids your authority to operate the station.

paid for that service, as long as you are paid only for the service and 
not for the actual use of the R/C station.


<R05>
Sec. 95.214  (R/C Rule 14) Who is responsible for R/C communications I make?

    You are responsible for all communications which are made by you 
from an R/C station.

[[Page 524]]


<R05>
Sec. 95.215  (R/C Rule 15) Do I have to limit the length of my communications?

    (a) You must limit your R/C communications to the minimum practical 
time.
    (b) The only time your R/C communications may be a continuous signal 
for more than 3 minutes is when operation of the device requires at 
least one or more changes during each minute of the communications.
    (c) Your R/C station may transmit a continuous signal without 
modulation only if:
    (1) You are using it to operate a model aircraft device; and
    (2) The presence or absence of the signal operates the device.
    (d) If you show that you need a continuous signal to insure the 
immediate safety of life of property, the FCC may make an exception to 
the limitations in this rule.


<R05>
Sec. 95.216  (R/C Rule 16) Do I identify my R/C communications?

    You need not identify your R/C communications.


<R05>
Sec. 95.217  (R/C Rule 17) May I operate my R/C station transmitter by remote control?

    (a) You may not operate an R/C transmitter by radio remote control. 
(See R/C Rule 12, Sec. 95.212.)
    (b) You may operate an R/C transmitter by wireline remote control if 
you obtain specific approval in writing from the FCC. To obtain FCC 
approval, you must show why you need to operate your station by wireline 
remote control. If you receive FCC approval, you must keep the approval 
as part of your station records. See R/C Rule 24, Sec. 95.224.
    (c) Remote control means operation of an R/C transmitter from any 
place other than the location of the R/C transmitter. Direct mechanical 
control or direct electrical control by wire from some point on the same 
premises, craft or vehicles as the R/C transmitter is not considered 
remote control.

Sec. 95.408  (CB Rule 8) How high may I put my antenna?

    (a) Antenna means the radiating system (for transmitting, receiving 
or both) and the structure holding it up (tower, pole or mast). It also 
means everything else attached to the radiating system and the 
structure.
    (b) If your antenna is mounted on a hand-held portable unit, none of 
the following limitations apply.
    (c) If your antenna is installed at a fixed location, it (whether 
receiving, transmitting or both) must comply with either one of the 
following:
    (1) The highest point must not be more than 6.10 meters (20 feet) 
higher than the highest point of the building or tree on which it is 
mounted; or
    (2) The highest point must not be more than 18.3 meters (60 feet) 
above the ground.
    (d) If your CB station is located near an airport, and if you 
antenna structure is more than 6.1 meters (20 feet) high, you may have 
to obey additional restrictions. The highest point of your antenna must 
not exceed one meter above the airport elevation for every hundred 
meters of distance from the nearest point of the nearest airport runway. 
Differences in ground elevation between your antenna and the airport 
runway may complicate this formula. If your CB station is near an 
airport, you may contact the nearest

[[Page 529]]

FCC field office for a worksheet to help you figure the maximum 
allowable height of your antenna. Consult part 17 of the FCC's Rules for

technical rules in subpart E of part 95.
    (c) Use of a transmitter which has carrier or peak envelope power in 
excess of that authorized voids your authority to operate the station.


<R05>
Sec. 95.411  (CB Rule 11) May I use power amplifiers?

    (a) You may not attach the following items (power amplifiers) to 
your certificated CB transmitter in any way:
    (1) External radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (sometimes called 
linears or linear amplifiers); or
    (2) Any other devices which, when used with a radio transmitter as a 
signal source, are capable of amplifying the signal.
    (b) There are no exceptions to this rule and use of a power 
amplifier voids your authority to operate the station.
    (c) The FCC will presume you have used a linear or other external RF 
power amplifier if--
    (1) It is in your possession or on your premises; and
    (2) There is other evidence that you have operated your CB station 
with more power than allowed by CB Rule 10, Sec. 95.410.
    (d) Paragraph (c) of this section does not apply if you hold a 
license in another radio service which allows you to operate an external 
RF power amplifier.

Sec. 95.628  MICS transmitter.

    (a) Frequency monitoring. Medical implant programmer/control 
transmitters must incorporate a mechanism for monitoring the channel or 
channels that the MICS system devices intend to occupy. The monitoring 
system antenna shall be the antenna normally used by the programmer/
control transmitter for a communications session. Before a medical 
implant programmer/control transmitter initiates a MICS communications 
session, the following access criteria must be met:
    (1) The monitoring system bandwidth measured at its 20 dB down 
points must be equal to or greater than the emission bandwidth of the 
intended transmission.
    (2) Within 5 seconds prior to initiating a communications session, 
circuitry associated with a medical implant programmer/control 
transmitter must monitor the channel or channels the MICS system devices 
intend to occupy for a minimum of 10 milliseconds per channel.
    (3) Based on use of an isotropic monitoring system antenna, the 
monitoring threshold power level must not be more than 10logB(Hz) - 150 
(dBm/Hz) + G(dBi) where B is the emission bandwidth of the MICS 
communication session transmitter having the widest emission and G is 
the medical implant programmer/control transmitter monitoring system 
antenna gain relative to an isotropic antenna. For purposes of showing 
compliance with the above provision, the above calculated threshold 
power level must be increased or decreased by an amount equal to the 
monitoring system antenna gain above or below the gain of an isotropic 
antenna, respectively.
    (4) If no signal in a MICS channel above the monitoring threshold 
power level is detected, the medical implant programmer/control 
transmitter may initiate a MICS communications session involving 
transmissions to and from a medical implant device on that channel. The 
MICS communications session may continue as long as any silent period 
between consecutive data transmission bursts does not exceed 5 seconds. 
If a channel meeting the criteria in paragraph (a)(3) of this section is 
unavailable, the channel with the lowest ambient power level may be 
accessed.
    (5) When a channel is selected prior to a MICS communications 
session, it is permissible to select an alternate channel for use if 
communications is interrupted, provided that the alternate channel 
selected is the next best choice using the above criteria. The alternate 
channel may be accessed in the event a communications session is 
interrupted by interference. The following criteria must be met:
    (i) Before transmitting on the alternate channel, the channel must 
be monitored for a period of at least 10 milliseconds.
    (ii) The detected power level during this 10 millisecond or greater 
monitoring period must be no higher than 6 dB above the power level 
detected when the channel was chosen as the alternate channel.
    (iii) In the event that this alternate channel provision is not used 
by the MICS system or if the criteria in (i) and (ii) are not met, a 
channel must be selected using the access criteria specified in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section.
    (6) As used in this section, the following definitions apply:
    (i) Emission bandwidth--Measured as the width of the signal between 
the points on either side of carrier center frequency that are 20 dB 
down relative

[[Page 537]]

to the maximum level of the modulated carrier. Compliance will be 
determined using instrumentation employing a peak detector function and 
a resolution bandwidth approximately equal to 1% of the emission 
bandwidth of the device under test.
    (ii) MICS channel--Any continuous segment of spectrum that is equal 
to the emission bandwidth of the device with the largest bandwidth that 
is to participate in a MICS communications session. (Note: The rules do 
not specify a channeling scheme for use by MICS systems.)
    (iii) MICS communications session--A collection of transmissions, 
that may or may not be continuous, between MICS system devices.
    (b) MICS communications sessions initiated by a medical implant 
event are not required to use the access criteria set forth in paragraph 
(a) of this section.
    (c) Stations may operate on any of the frequencies in the band 402-
405 MHz, provided that the out-of-band emissions are attenuated in 
accordance with Sec. 95.635.
    (d) The authorized bandwidth of the emission from a MICS station 
shall not exceed 300 kHz, and no communications session involving MICS 
stations shall use more than a total of 300 kHz of bandwidth during such 
a session. Note: This provision does not preclude full duplex or half 
duplex communications provided that the total amount of bandwidth 
utilized by all of the MICS channels employed in such a MICS 
communications session does not exceed 300 kHz.
    (e) Each transmitter in the MICS service must maintain a frequency 
stability of +/-100 ppm of the operating frequency over the range:
    (1) 25 deg.C to 45 deg.C in the case of medical implant 
transmitters; and
    (2) 0 deg.C to 55 deg.C in the case of medical implant programmer/
control transmitters.
    (f) The provisions of this section shall not be used to extend the 
range of spectrum occupied over space or time for the purpose denying 
fair access to spectrum for other MICS systems.

Sec. 95.629  LPRS transmitter frequencies.

    (a) LPRS transmitters may operate on any frequency listed in 
paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. Channels 19, 20, 50, and 
151-160 are available exclusively for law enforcement tracking purposes. 
AMTS transmissions are limited to the 216.750-217.000 MHz band for low 
power point-to-point network control communications by AMTS coast 
stations. Other AMTS transmissions in the 216-217 MHz band are 
prohibited.
    (b) Standard band channels. (1) The following table indicates 
standard band frequencies. The channel bandwidth is 25 kHz.

Sec. 95.633  Emission bandwidth.

    (a) The authorized bandwidth (maximum permissible bandwidth of a 
transmission) for emission type H1D, J1D, R1D, H3E, J3E or R3E is 4 kHz. 
The authorized bandwidth for emission type A1D or A3E is 8 kHz. The 
authorized bandwidth for emission type F1D, G1D, F3E or G3E is 20 kHz.
    (b) The authorized bandwidth for any emission type transmitted by an 
R/C transmitter is 8 kHz.
    (c) The authorized bandwidth for emission type F3E transmitted by a 
FRS unit is 12.5 kHz.
    (d) For transmitters in the LPRS:
    (1) The authorized bandwidth for narrowband frequencies is 4 kHz and 
the channel bandwidth is 5 kHz
    (2) The channel bandwidth for standard band frequencies is 25 kHz.
    (3) The channel bandwidth for extra band frequencies is 50 kHz.
    (4) AMTS stations may use the 216.750-217.000 MHz band as a single 
250 kHz channel so long as the signal is attenuated as specified in 
Sec. 95.635(c).
    (e) For transmitters in the MICS:
    (1) The maximum authorized emission bandwidth is 300 kHz.
    (2) Lesser authorized emission bandwidths may be employed, provided 
that the unwanted emissions are attenuated as provided in Sec. 95.635 
and that the power radiated in any 300 kHz bandwidth does not exceed 25 
microwatts EIRP. See Secs. 95.605 and 95.639(g) regarding power 
measurement procedures.
    (3) Emission bandwidth will be determined by measuring the width of 
the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency 
and one above the carrier center frequency, that are 20 dB down relative 
to the maximum level of the modulated carrier. Compliance with the 
emission bandwidth limit is based on the use of measurement 
instrumentation employing a peak detector function with an instrument 
resolution bandwidth approximately equal to 1.0 percent of the emission 
bandwidth of the device under measurement.
    (f) The authorized bandwidth for any emission type transmitted by a 
MURS transmitter is specified in Sec. 90.209 of this chapter.

Sec. 95.637  Modulation standards.

    (a) A GMRS transmitter that transmits emission types F1D, G1D, or 
G3E must not exceed a peak frequency deviation of plus or minus 5 kHz. A 
GMRS transmitter that transmits emission type F3E must not exceed a peak 
frequency deviation of plus or minus 5 kHz. A FRS unit that transmits 
emission type F3E must not exceed a peak frequency deviation of plus or 
minus 2.5 kHz, and the audio frequency response must not exceed 3.125 
kHz .
    (b) Each GMRS transmitter, except a mobile station transmitter with 
a power output of 2.5 W or less, must automatically prevent a greater 
than normal audio level from causing overmodulation. The transmitter 
also must include audio frequency low pass filtering, unless it complies 
with the applicable paragraphs of Sec. 95.631 (without filtering.) The 
filter must be between the modulation limiter and the modulated stage of 
the transmitter. At any frequency (f in kHz) between 3 and 20 kHz, the 
filter must have an attenuation of at least 60 log<INF>10</INF> (f/3) dB 
greater than the attenuation at 1 kHz. Above 20 kHz, it must have an 
attenuation of at least 50 dB greater than the attenuation at 1 kHz.
    (c) When emission type A3E is transmitted, the modulation must be 
greater than 85% but must not exceed 100%. Simultaneous amplitude 
modulation and frequency or phase modulation of a transmitter are not 
permitted.
    (d) When emission type A3E is transmitted by a CB transmitter having 
a TP of greater than 2.5 W, the CB transmitter must automatically 
prevent the modulation from exceeding 100%.
    (e) Each CB transmitter that transmits emission type H3E, J3E or R3E 
must be capable of transmitting the upper sideband. The capability of 
also transmitting the lower sideband is permitted.

Sec. 95.639  Maximum transmitter power.

    (a) No GMRS transmitter, under any condition of modulation, shall 
exceed:
    (1) 50 W Carrier power (average TP during one unmodulated RF cycle) 
when transmitting emission type A1D, F1D, G1D, A3E, F3E or G3E.
    (2) 50 W peak envelope TP when transmitting emission type H1D, J1D, 
R1D, H3E, J3E or R3E.
    (b) No R/C transmitter, under any condition of modulation, shall 
exceed a carrier power or peak envelope TP (single-sideband only) of:
    (1) 4 W in the 26-27 MHz frequency band, except on channel frequency 
27.255 MHz;
    (2) 25 W on channel frequency 27.255 MHz;
    (3) 0.75 W in the 72-76 MHz frequency band.
    (c) No CB transmitter, under any condition of modulation, shall 
exceed:
    (1) 4 W Carrier power when transmitting emission type A1D or A3E;
    (2) 12 W peak envelope TP when transmitting emission type H1D, J1D, 
R1D, H3E, J3E or R3E. Each CB transmitter which transmits emission type 
H3E, J3E or R3E must automatically prevent the TP from exceeding 12 W 
peak envelope TP or the manufacturer's rated peak envelope TP, whichever 
is less.
    (d) No FRS unit, under any condition of modulation, shall exceed 
0.500 W effective radiated power (ERP).
    (e) The maximum transmitter output power authorized for LPRS 
stations is 100 mW.
    (f) In the MICS the following limits apply:
    (1) The maximum EIRP for MICS transmitter stations is 25 microwatts. 
The antenna associated with any MICS transmitter must be supplied with 
the transmitter and shall be considered part of the transmitter subject 
to equipment authorization. Compliance of any MICS transmitter with the 
25 microwatts EIRP limit may be determined by measuring the radiated 
field

[[Page 544]]

from the equipment under test at 3 meters and calculating the EIRP. The 
equivalent radiated field strength at 3 meters for 25 microwatts EIRP is 
18.2 mV/meter when measured on an open area test site, or 9.1 mV/meter 
when measured on a test site equivalent to free space such as a fully 
anechoic test chamber. In either case, compliance is based on 
measurements using a peak detector function and measured over an 
interval of time when transmission is continuous and at its maximum 
power level. In lieu of using a peak detector function, instrumentation 
techniques set forth in ANSI C63.17-1998, Section 6.1.2.2.1 or Section 
6.1.2.2.2 may be used in determining compliance with the above 
specifications.
    (2) For a transmitter intended to be implanted in a human body, the 
following test fixture must be used to simulate operation of the implant 
under actual operating conditions. See Sec. 95.605.
    (i) For measurement purposes to determine compliance with emission 
limits, the radiating characteristics of an implant transmitter placed 
in a test fixture should approximate those of an implant transmitter 
placed in a human body. An appropriate human torso simulator for testing 
medical implant transmitters consists of a cylindrical Plexiglas 
container with a size of 30 cm by 76 cm with a sidewall thickness of 
0.635 cm. It must be completely filled with a material that is 
sufficiently fluidic that it will flow around the implant without any 
voids. The dielectric and conductivity properties of this material must 
match the dielectric and conductivity properties of human muscle tissue 
at 403.5 MHz. All emissions measurements will be made using the above 
specification at a nominal temperature of 20-25 deg.C. Simple saline 
solutions do not meet the above criteria. A mounting grid for the 
implant inside the container must be provided that permits the radiating 
element or elements of the implant to be positioned vertically and 
horizontally. The grid should also support any additional implant leads 
associated with the therapeutic function in a fixed repeatable manner. 
The implant must be mounted 6 cm from the sidewall and centered 
vertically within the container. The above fixture shall be placed on a 
turntable such that the implant transmitter will be located at a nominal 
1.5-meter height above ground and at a 3-meter distance from the 
measurement antenna. Radiated emissions measurements shall then be 
performed to insure compliance with the applicable technical 
specifications.
    (ii) A formula for a suitable tissue substitute material is defined 
in the paper ``Simulated Biological Materials for Electromagnetic 
Radiation Absorption Studies'' by G. Hartsgrove, A. Kraszewski, and A. 
Surowiec as published in ``Bioelectromagnetics 8:29-36 (1987)''.
    (3) The power radiated in any 300 kHz bandwidth shall not exceed 25 
microwatts EIRP. See Secs. 95.633(e) and 95.639(g).
    (g) The maximum field strength authorized for WMTS stations in the 
608-614 MHz band is 200 mV/m, measured at 3 meters. For stations in the 
1395-1400 MHz and 1427-1429.5 MHz bands, the maximum field strength is 
740 mV/m, measured at 3 meters.
    (h) No MURS unit, under any condition of modulation, shall exceed 2 
W effective radiated power (ERP).

license must include, as attachments, a description of the partitioned 
service area and a calculation of the population of the partitioned 
service area and the licensed geographic service area. The partitioned 
service area shall be defined by coordinate points at every 3 seconds 
along the partitioned service area unless an FCC-recognized service area 
(i.e. Economic Areas) is utilized or county lines are followed. The 
geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and 
seconds, to the nearest second of latitude and longitude, and must be 
based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83). In the case where an 
FCC-recognized service area or county lines are utilized, applicants 
need only list the specific area(s) (through use of FCC designations or 
county names) that constitute the partitioned area.
    (2) Disaggregation. Spectrum maybe disaggregated in any amount.
    (3) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. The Commission will 
consider requests for partial assignments of licenses that propose 
combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.
    (c) Provisions applicable to designated entities--(1) Parties not 
qualified for installment payment plans. (i) When a winning bidder 
(partitionor or disaggregator) that elected to pay for its license 
through an installment payment plan partitions its license or 
disaggregates spectrum to another party (partitionee or disaggregatee) 
that would not qualify for an installment payment plan, or elects not to 
pay for its share of the license through installment payments, the 
outstanding principal balance owed by the partitionor or disaggregator 
shall be apportioned according to Sec. 1.2111(e)(3) of this chapter. The 
partitionor or disaggregator is responsible for accrued and unpaid 
interest through and including the consummation date.
    (ii) The partitionee or disaggregatee shall, as a condition of the 
approval of the partial assignment application, pay its entire pro rata 
amount of the outstanding principal balance on or before the 
consummation date. Failure to meet this condition will result in 
cancellation of the grant of the partial assignment application.
    (iii) The partitionor or disaggregator shall be permitted to 
continue to pay its pro rata share of the outstanding balance and, if 
applicable, shall receive loan documents evidencing the partitioning and 
disaggregation. The original interest rate, established pursuant to 
Sec. 1.2110(g)(3)(i) of this chapter at the time of the grant of the 
initial license in the market, shall continue to be applied to the 
partitionor's or

[[Page 551]]

disaggregator's portion of the remaining government obligation.
    (iv) A default on the partitionor's or disaggregator's payment 
obligation will affect only the partitionor's or disaggregator's portion 
of the market.
    (2) Parties qualified for installment payment plans.
    (i) Where both parties to a partitioning or disaggregation agreement 
qualify for installment payments, the partitionee or disaggregatee will 
be permitted to make installment payments on its portion of the 
remaining government obligation.
    (ii) Each party may be required, as a condition to approval of the 
partial assignment application, to execute loan documents agreeing to 
pay its pro rata portion of the outstanding principal balance due, as 
apportioned according to Sec. 1.2111(e)(3) of this chapter, based upon 
the installment payment terms for which it qualifies under the rules. 
Failure by either party to meet this condition will result in the 
automatic cancellation of the grant of the partial assignment 
application. The interest rate, established pursuant to 
Sec. 1.2110(f)(3)(i) of this chapter at the time of the grant of the 
initial license in the market, shall continue to be applied to both 
parties' portion of the balance due. Each party will receive a license 
for its portion of the partitioned market.
    (iii) A default on an obligation will affect only that portion of 
the market area held by the defaulting party.
    (d) Construction requirements--(1) Partitioning. Partial assignors 
and assignees for license partitioning have two options to meet 
construction requirements. Under the first option, the partitionor and 
partitionee would each certify that they will independently satisfy the 
applicable construction requirements set forth in Sec. 95.833 of this 
part for their respective partitioned areas. If either licensee failed 
to meet its requirement in Sec. 95.833 of this part, only the non-
performing licensee's renewal application would be subject to dismissal. 
Under the second option, the partitionor certifies that it has met or 
will meet the requirement in Sec. 95.833 of this part for the entire 
market. If the partitionor fails to meet the requirement in Sec. 95.833 
of this part, however, only its renewal application would be subject to 
forfeiture at renewal.
    (2) Disaggregation. Partial assignors and assignees for license 
disaggregation have two options to meet construction requirements. Under 
the first option, the disaggregator and disaggregatee would certify that 
they each will share responsibility for meeting the applicable 
construction requirements set forth in Sec. 95.833 of this part for the 
geographic service area. If parties choose this option and either party 
fails to do so, both licenses would be subject to forfeiture at renewal. 
The second option would allow the parties to agree that either the 
disaggregator or the disaggregatee would be responsible for meeting the 
requirement in Sec. 95.833 of this part for the geographic service area. 
If parties choose this option, and the party responsible for meeting the 
construction requirement fails to do so, only the license of the non-
performing party would be subject to forfeiture at renewal.
    (3) All applications requesting partial assignments of license for 
partitioning or disaggregation must include the above-referenced 
certification as to which of the construction options is selected.
    (4) Responsible parties must submit supporting documents showing 
compliance with the respective construction requirements within the 
appropriate construction benchmarks set forth in Sec. 95.833 of this 
part.

the station in accordance with the FCC Rules. When the control operator 
is a different amateur operator than the station licensee, both persons 
are equally

[[Page 572]]

responsible for proper operation of the station.
    (b) The station licensee must designate the station control 
operator. The FCC will presume that the station licensee is also the 
control operator, unless documentation to the contrary is in the station 
records.
    (c) The station licensee must make the station and the station 
records available for inspection upon request by an FCC representative. 
When deemed necessary by an EIC to assure compliance with the FCC Rules, 
the station licensee must maintain a record of station operations 
containing such items of information as the EIC may require in accord 
with Sec. 0.314(x) of the FCC Rules.


<R05>
Sec. 97.105  Control operator duties.

    (a) The control operator must ensure the immediate proper operation 
of the station, regardless of the type of control.
    (b) A station may only be operated in the manner and to the extent 
permitted by the privileges authorized for the class of operator license 
held by the control operator.


<R05>
Sec. 97.107  Reciprocal operating authority.

    A non-citizen of the United States (``alien'') holding an amateur 
service authorization granted by the alien's government is authorized to 
be the control operator of an amateur station located at places where 
the amateur service is regulated by the FCC, provided there is in effect 
a multilateral or bilateral reciprocal operating arrangement, to which 
the United States and the alien's government are parties, for amateur 
service operation on a reciprocal basis. The FCC will issue public 
announcements listing the countries with which the United States has 
such an arrangement. No citizen of the United States or person holding 
an FCC amateur operator/primary station license grant is eligible for 
the reciprocal operating authority granted by this section. The 
privileges granted to a control operator under this authorization are:
    (a) For an amateur service license granted by the Government of 
Canada:
    (1) The terms of the Convention Between the United States and Canada 
(TIAS No. 2508) Relating to the Operation by Citizens of Either Country 
of Certain Radio Equipment or Stations in the Other Country;
    (2) The operating terms and conditions of the amateur service 
license issued by the Government of Canada; and
    (3) The applicable rules of this part, but not to exceed the control 
operator privileges of an FCC-granted Amateur Extra Class operator 
license.
    (b) For an amateur service license granted by any country, other 
than Canada, with which the United States has a multilateral or 
bilateral agreement:
    (1) The terms of the agreement between the alien's government and 
the United States;
    (2) The operating terms and conditions of the amateur service 
license granted by the alien's government;
    (3) The applicable rules of this part, but not to exceed the control 
operator privileges of an FCC-granted Amateur Extra Class operator 
license; and
    (c) At any time the FCC may, in its discretion, modify, suspend or 
cancel the reciprocal operating authority granted to any person by this 
section.

    (b) When a station is being locally controlled, the control operator 
must be at the control point. Any station may be locally controlled.
    (c) When a station is being remotely controlled, the control 
operator must be at the control point. Any station may be remotely 
controlled.
    (d) When a station is being automatically controlled, the control 
operator need not be at the control point. Only stations specifically 
designated elsewhere in this part may be automatically controlled. 
Automatic control must cease upon notification by an EIC that the 
station is transmitting improperly or causing harmful interference to 
other stations. Automatic control must not be resumed without prior 
approval of the EIC.

[[Page 573]]

    (e) No station may be automatically controlled while transmitting 
third party communications, except a station transmitting a RTTY or data 
emission. All messages that are retransmitted must originate at a 
station that is being locally or remotely controlled.

identification;
    (5) Communications, on a regular basis, which could reasonably be 
furnished alternatively through other radio services.
    (b) An amateur station shall not engage in any form of broadcasting, 
nor may an amateur station transmit one-way communications except as 
specifically provided in these rules; nor shall an amateur station 
engage in any activity related to program production or news gathering 
for broadcasting purposes, except that communications directly related 
to the immediate safety of human life or the protection of property may 
be provided by amateur stations to broadcasters for dissemination to the 
public where no other means of communication is reasonably available 
before or at the time of the event.
    (c) A control operator may accept compensation as an incident of a 
teaching position during periods of time when an amateur station is used 
by that teacher as a part of classroom instruction at an educational 
institution.

[[Page 574]]

    (d) The control operator of a club station may accept compensation 
for the periods of time when the station is transmitting telegraphy 
practice or information bulletins, provided that the station transmits 
such telegraphy practice and bulletins for at least 40 hours per week; 
schedules operations on at least six amateur service MF and HF bands 
using reasonable measures to maximize coverage; where the schedule of 
normal operating times and frequencies is published at least 30 days in 
advance of the actual transmissions; and where the control operator does 
not accept any direct or indirect compensation for any other service as 
a control operator.
    (e) No station shall retransmit programs or signals emanating from 
any type of radio station other than an amateur station, except 
propagation and weather forecast information intended for use by the 
general public and originated from United States Government stations and 
communications, including incidental music, originating on United States 
Government frequencies between a space shuttle and its associated Earth 
stations. Prior approval for shuttle retransmissions must be obtained 
from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Such 
retransmissions must be for the exclusive use of amateur operators. 
Propagation, weather forecasts, and shuttle retransmissions may not be 
conducted on a regular basis, but only occasionally, as an incident of 
normal amateur radio communications.
    (f) No amateur station, except an auxiliary, repeater, or space 
station, may automatically retransmit the radio signals of other amateur 
station.

<R05>
Sec. 97.115  Third party communications.

    (a) An amateur station may transmit messages for a third party to:
    (1) Any station within the jurisdiction of the United States.
    (2) Any station within the jurisdiction of any foreign government 
whose administration has made arrangements with the United States to 
allow amateur stations to be used for transmitting international 
communications on behalf of third parties. No station shall transmit 
messages for a third party to any station within the jurisdiction of any 
foreign government whose administration has not made such an 
arrangement. This prohibition does not apply to a message for any third 
party who is eligible to be a control operator of the station.
    (b) The third party may participate in stating the message where:
    (1) The control operator is present at the control point and is 
continuously monitoring and supervising the third party's participation; 
and
    (2) The third party is not a prior amateur service licensee whose 
license was revoked; suspended for less than the balance of the license 
term and the suspension is still in effect; suspended for the balance of 
the license term and relicensing has not taken place; or surrendered for 
cancellation following notice of revocation, suspension or monetary 
forfeiture proceedings. The third party may not be the subject of a 
cease and desist order which relates to amateur service operation and 
which is still in effect.
    (c) At the end of an exchange of international third party 
communications, the station must also transmit in the station 
identification procedure the call sign of the station with which a third 
party message was exchanged.

<R05>
Sec. 97.117  International communications.

    Transmissions to a different country, where permitted, shall be made 
in plain language and shall be limited to messages of a technical nature 
relating to tests, and, to remarks of a personal character for which, by 
reason of their unimportance, recourse to the public telecommunications 
service is not justified.


<R05>
Sec. 97.119  Station identification.

    (a) Each amateur station, except a space station or telecommand 
station, must transmit its assigned call sign on its transmitting 
channel at the end of each communication, and at least every 10 minutes 
during a communication, for the purpose of clearly making the source of 
the transmissions from the station known to those receiving

[[Page 575]]

the transmissions. No station may transmit unidentified communications 
or signals, or transmit as the station call sign, any call sign not 
authorized to the station.
    (b) The call sign must be transmitted with an emission authorized 
for the transmitting channel in one of the following ways:
    (1) By a CW emission. When keyed by an automatic device used only 
for identification, the speed must not exceed 20 words per minute;
    (2) By a phone emission in the English language. Use of a phonetic 
alphabet as an aid for correct station identification is encouraged;
    (3) By a RTTY emission using a specified digital code when all or 
part of the communications are transmitted by a RTTY or data emission;
    (4) By an image emission conforming to the applicable transmission 
standards, either color or monochrome, of Sec. 73.682(a) of the FCC 
Rules when all or part of the communications are transmitted in the same 
image emission
    (c) One or more indicators may be included with the call sign. Each 
indicator must be separated from the call sign by the slant mark (/) or 
by any suitable word that denotes the slant mark. If an indicator is 
self-assigned, it must be included before, after, or both before and 
after, the call sign. No self-assigned indicator may conflict with any 
other indicator specified by the FCC Rules or with any prefix assigned 
to another country.
    (d) When transmitting in conjunction with an event of special 
significance, a station may substitute for its assigned call sign a 
special event call sign as shown for that station for that period of 
time on the common data base coordinated, maintained and disseminated by 
the special event call sign data base coordinators. Additionally, the 
station must transmit its assigned call sign at least once per hour 
during such transmissions.
    (e) When the operator license class held by the control operator 
exceeds that of the station licensee, an indicator consisting of the 
call sign assigned to the control operator's station must be included 
after the call sign.
    (f) When the control operator is a person who is exercising the 
rights and privileges authorized by Sec. 97.9(b) of this part, an 
indicator must be included after the call sign as follows:
    (1) For a control operator who has requested a license modification 
from Novice Class to Technical Class: KT;
    (2) For a control operator who has requested a license modification 
from Novice, Technician, or Technician Plus Class to General Class: AG;
    (3) For a control operator who has requested a license modification 
from Novice, Technician, Technician Plus, General, or Advanced Class to 
Amateur Extra Class: AE.
    (g) When the station is transmitting under the authority of 
Sec. 97.107 of this part, an indicator consisting of the appropriate 
letter-numeral designating the station location must be included before 
the call sign that was issued to the station by the country granting the 
license. For an amateur service license granted by the Government of 
Canada, however, the indicator must be included after the call sign. At 
least once during each intercommunication, the identification 
announcement must include the geographical location as nearly as 
possible by city and state, commonwealth or possession.

Sec. 97.303  Frequency sharing requirements.

    The following is a summary of the frequency sharing requirements 
that apply to amateur station transmissions on the frequency bands 
specified in Sec. 97.301 of this part. (For each ITU Region, each 
frequency band allocated to the amateur service is designated as either 
a secondary service or a primary service. A station in a secondary 
service must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept 
interference from, stations in a primary service. See Secs. 2.105 and 
2.106 of the FCC Rules, United States Table of Frequency Allocations for 
complete requirements.)
    (a) Where, in adjacent ITU Regions or Subregions, a band of 
frequencies is allocated to different services of the same category, the 
basic principle is the equality of right to operate. The stations of 
each service in one region must operate so as not to cause harmful 
interference to services in the other Regions or Subregions. (See ITU 
Radio Regulations, No. 346 (Geneva, 1979).)
    (b) No amateur station transmitting in the 1900-2000 kHz segment, 
the 70 cm band, the 33 cm band, the 13 cm band, the 9 cm band, the 5 cm 
band, the 3 cm band, the 24.05-24.25 GHz segment, the 77.0-77.5 GHz 
segment, the 78-81 GHz segment, the 144-149 GHz segment, and the 241-248 
GHz segment shall cause harmful interference to, nor is protected from 
interference due to the operation of, the Government radiolocation 
service.
    (c) No amateur station transmitting in the 1900-2000 kHz segment, 
the 3 cm band, the 77.0-77.5 GHz segment, the 78-81 GHz segment, the 
144-149 GHz segment, and the 241-248 GHz segment shall cause harmful 
interference to, nor is protected from interference due to the operation 
of, stations in the non-Government radiolocation service.
    (d) No amateur station transmitting in the 30 meter band shall cause 
harmful interference to stations authorized by other nations in the 
fixed service. The licensee of the amateur station must make all 
necessary adjustments, including termination of transmissions, if 
harmful interference is caused.
    (e) In the 1.25 m band:
    (1) Use of the 219-220 MHz segment is limited to amateur stations 
participating, as forwarding stations, in point-to-point fixed digital 
message forwarding systems, including intercity packet backbone 
networks. It is not available for other purposes.
    (2) No amateur station transmitting in the 219-220 MHz segment shall 
cause harmful interference to, nor is protected from interference due to 
operation of Automated Maritime Telecommunications Systems (AMTS), 
television broadcasting on channels 11 and 13, 218-219 MHz Service 
systems, Land Mobile Services systems, or any other service having a 
primary allocation in or adjacent to the band.
    (3) No amateur station may transmit in the 219-220 MHz segment 
unless the licensee has given written notification of the station's 
specific geographic location for such transmissions in order to be 
incorporated into a data base that has been made available to the 
public. The notification must be given at least 30 days prior to making 
such transmissions. The notification must be given to: The American 
Radio Relay, Inc., 225 Main Street, Newington, CT 06111-1494.
    (4) No amateur station may transmit in the 219-220 MHz segment from 
a location that is within 640 km of an AMTS Coast Station that uses 
frequencies in the 217-218/219-220 MHz AMTS bands unless the amateur 
station licensee has given written notification of the station's 
specific geographic location for such transmissions to the AMTS 
licensee. The notification must be given at least 30 days prior to 
making such transmissions. The location of AMTS Coast Stations using the 
217-218/219-220 MHz channels may be obtained from either:

The American Radio Relay League, Inc., 225 Main Street, Newington, CT 
06111-1494;


or

Interactive Systems, Inc., Suite 1103, 1601 North Kent Street, 
Arlington, VA 22209; Fax: (703) 812-8275; Phone: (703) 812-8270.

    (5) No amateur station may transmit in the 219-220 MHz segment from 
a location that is within 80 km of an AMTS Coast Station that uses 
frequencies in the 217-218/219-220 MHz

[[Page 584]]

AMTS bands unless that amateur station licensee holds written approval 
from that AMTS licensee. The location of AMTS Coast Stations using the 
217-218/219-220 MHz channels may be obtained as noted in paragraph 
(e)(4) of this section.
    (f) In the 70 cm band:
    (1) No amateur station shall transmit from north of Line A in the 
420-430 MHz segment.
    (2) The 420-430 MHz segment is allocated to the amateur service in 
the United States on a secondary basis, and is allocated in the fixed 
and mobile (except aeronautical mobile) services in the International 
Table of allocations on a primary basis. No amateur station transmitting 
in this band shall cause harmful interference to, nor is protected from 
interference due to the operation of, stations authorized by other 
nations in the fixed and mobile (except aeronautical mobile) services.
    (3) The 430-440 MHz segment is allocated to the amateur service on a 
secondary basis in ITU Regions 2 and 3. No amateur station transmitting 
in this band in ITU Regions 2 and 3 shall cause harmful interference to, 
nor is protected from interference due to the operation of, stations 
authorized by other nations in the radiolocation service. In ITU Region 
1, the 430-440 MHz segment is allocated to the amateur service on a co-
primary basis with the radiolocation service. As between these two 
services in this band in ITU Region 1, the basic principle that applies 
is the equality of right to operate. Amateur stations authorized by the 
United States and radiolocation stations authorized by other nations in 
ITU Region 1 shall operate so as not to cause harmful interference to 
each other.
    (4) No amateur station transmitting in the 449.75-450.25 MHz segment 
shall cause interference to, nor is protected from itnerference due to 
the operation of stations in, the space operation service and the space 
research service or Government or non-Government stations for space 
telecommand.
    (g) In the 33 cm band:
    (1) No amateur station shall transmit from within the States of 
Colorado and Wyoming, bounded on the south by latitude 39 deg. N., on 
the north by latitude 42 deg. N., on the east by longitude 105 deg. W.,

Sec. 97.307  Emission standards.

    (a) No amateur station transmission shall occupy more bandwidth than 
necessary for the information rate and emission type being transmitted, 
in accordance with good amateur practice.
    (b) Emissions resulting from modulation must be confined to the band 
or segment available to the control operator. Emissions outside the 
necessary bandwidth must not cause splatter or keyclick interference to 
operations on adjacent frequencies.
    (c) All spurious emissions from a station transmitter must be 
reduced to the greatest extent practicable. If any spurious emission, 
including chassis or power line radiation, causes harmful interference 
to the reception of another radio station, the licensee of the 
interfering amateur station is required to take steps to eliminate the 
interference, in accordance with good engineering practice.
    (d) The mean power of any spurious emission from a station 
transmitter or external RF power amplifier transmitting on a frequency 
below 30 MHz must not exceed 50 mW and must be at least 40 dB below the 
mean power of the fundamental emission. For a transmitter of mean power 
less than 5 W, the attenuation must be at least 30 dB. A transmitter 
built before April 15, 1977, or first marketed before January 1, 1978, 
is exempt from this requirement.
    (e) The mean power of any spurious emission from a station 
transmitter or external RF power amplifier transmitting on a frequency 
between 30-225 MHz must be at least 60 dB below the mean power of the 
fundamental. For a transmitter having a mean power of 25 W or less, the 
mean power of any spurious emission supplied to the antenna transmission 
line must not exceed 25 [mu]W and must be at least 40 dB below the mean 
power of the fundamental emission, but need not be reduced below the 
power of 10 [mu]W. A transmitter built before April 15, 1977, or first 
marketed before January 1, 1978, is exempt from this requirement.
    (f) The following standards and limitations apply to transmissions 
on the frequencies specified in Sec. 97.305(c) of this part.
    (1) No angle-modulated emission may have a modulation index greater 
than 1 at the highest modulation frequency.
    (2) No non-phone emission shall exceed the bandwidth of a 
communications quality phone emission of the same modulation type. The 
total bandwidth of an independent sideband emission (having B as the 
first symbol), or a multiplexed image and phone emission, shall not 
exceed that of a communications quality A3E emission.
    (3) Only a RTTY or data emission using a specified digital code 
listed in Sec. 97.309(a) of this part may be transmitted. The symbol 
rate must not exceed 300 bauds, or for frequency-shift keying, the 
frequency shift between mark and space must not exceed 1 kHz.
    (4) Only a RTTY or data emission using a specified digital code 
listed in Sec. 97.309(a) of this part may be transmitted. The symbol 
rate must not exceed 1200 bauds, or for frequency-shift keying, the 
frequency shift between mark and space must not exceed 1 kHz.

[[Page 588]]

    (5) A RTTY, data or multiplexed emission using a specified digital 
code listed in Sec. 97.309(a) of this part may be transmitted. The 
symbol rate must not exceed 19.6 kilobauds. A RTTY, data or multiplexed 
emission using an unspecified digital code under the limitations listed 
in Sec. 97.309(b) of this part also may be transmitted. The authorized 
bandwidth is 20 kHz.
    (6) A RTTY, data or multiplexed emission using a specified digital 
code listed in Sec. 97.309(a) of this part may be transmitted. The 
symbol rate must not exceed 56 kilobauds. A RTTY, data or multiplexed 
emission using an unspecified digital code under the limitations listed 
in Sec. 97.309(b) of this part also may be transmitted. The authorized 
bandwidth is 100 kHz.
    (7) A RTTY, data or multiplexed emission using a specified digital 
code listed in Sec. 97.309(a) of this part or an unspecified digital 
code under the limitations listed in Sec. 97.309(b) of this part may be 
transmitted.
    (8) A RTTY or data emission having designators with A, B, C, D, E, 
F, G, H, J or R as the first symbol; 1, 2, 7 or 9 as the second symbol; 
and D or W as the third symbol is also authorized.
    (9) A station having a control operator holding a Novice or 
Technician Class operator license may only transmit a CW emission using 
the international Morse code.
    (10) A station having a control operator holding a Novice Class 
operator license or a Technician Class operator license and who has 
received credit for proficiency in telegraphy in accordance with the 
international requirements may only transmit a CW emission using the 
international Morse code or phone emissions J3E and R3E.
    (11) Phone and image emissions may be transmitted only by stations 
located in ITU Regions 1 and 3, and by stations located within ITU 
Region 2 that are west of 130 deg. West longitude or south of 20 deg. 
North latitude.
    (12) Emission F8E may be transmitted.
    (13) A data emission using an unspecified digital code under the 
limitations listed in Sec. 97.309(b) also may be transmitted. The 
authorized bandwidth is 100 kHz.

Sec. 97.309  RTTY and data emission codes.

    (a) Where authorized by Secs. 97.305(c) and 97.307(f) of the part, 
an amateur station may transmit a RTTY or data emission using the 
following specified digital codes:
    (1) The 5-unit, start-stop, International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2, 
code defined in International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative 
Committee Recommendation F.1, Division C (commonly known as Baudot).
    (2) The 7-unit code specified in International Radio Consultative 
Committee Recommendation CCIR 476-2 (1978), 476-3 (1982), 476-4 (1986) 
or 625 (1986) (commonly known as AMTOR).
    (3) The 7-unit code defined in American National Standards Institute 
X3.4-1977 or International Alphabet No. 5 defined in International 
Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee Recommendation T.50 or in 
International Organization for Standardization, International Standard 
ISO 646 (1983), and extensions as provided for in CCITT Recommendation 
T.61 (Malaga-Torremolinos, 1984) (commonly known as ASCII).
    (4) An amateur station transmitting a RTTY or data emission using a 
digital code specified in this paragraph may use any technique whose 
technical characteristics have been documented publicly, such as CLOVER, 
G-TOR, or PacTOR, for the purpose of facilitating communications.
    (b) Where authorized by Secs. 97.305(c) and 97.307(f) of this part, 
a station may transmit a RTTY or data emission using an unspecified 
digital code, except to a station in a country with which the United 
States does not have an agreement permitting the code to be used. RTTY 
and data emissions using unspecified digital codes must not be 
transmitted for the purpose of obscuring the meaning of any 
communication. When deemed necessary by an EIC to assure compliance with 
the FCC Rules, a station must:

[[Page 589]]

    (1) Cease the transmission using the unspecified digital code;
    (2) Restrict transmissions of any digital code to the extent 
instructed;
    (3) Maintain a record, convertible to the original information, of 
all digital communications transmitted.

Sec. 97.311  SS emission types.

    (a) SS emission transmissions by an amateur station are authorized 
only for communications between points within areas where the amateur 
service is regulated by the FCC and between an area where the amateur 
service is regulated by the FCC and an amateur station in another 
country that permits such communications. SS emission transmissions must 
not be used for the purpose of obscuring the meaning of any 
communication.
    (b) A station transmitting SS emissions must not cause harmful 
interference to stations employing other authorized emissions, and must 
accept all interference caused by stations employing other authorized 
emissions.
    (c) When deemed necessary by a District Director to assure 
compliance with this part, a station licensee must:
    (1) Cease SS emission transmissions;
    (2) Restrict SS emission transmissions to the extent instructed; and
    (3) Maintain a record, convertible to the original information 
(voice, text, image, etc.) of all spread spectrum communications 
transmitted.
    (d) The transmitter power must not exceed 100 W under any 
circumstances. If more than 1 W is used, automatic transmitter control 
shall limit output power to that which is required for the 
communication. This shall be determined by the use of the ratio, 
measured at the receiver, of the received energy per user data bit (Eb) 
to the sum of the received power spectral densities of noise 
(N<INF>0</INF>) and co-channel interference (I<INF>0</INF>). Average 
transmitter power over 1 W shall be automatically adjusted to maintain 
an Eb/ (N<INF>0</INF> + I<INF>0</INF>) ratio of no more than 23 dB at 
the intended receiver.

Sec. 97.313  Transmitter power standards.

    (a) An amateur station must use the minimum transmitter power 
necessary to carry out the desired communications.
    (b) No station may transmit with a transmitter power exceeding 1.5 
kW PEP.
    (c) No station may transmit with a transmitter power exceeding 200 W 
PEP on:
    (1) The 3.675-3.725 MHz, 7.10-7.15 MHz, 10.10-10.15 MHz, and 21.1-
21.2 MHz segments;
    (2) The 28.1-28.5 MHz segment when the control operator is a Novice 
Class operator or a Technician Class operator who has received credit 
for proficiency in telegraphy in accordance with the international 
requirements; or
    (3) The 7.050-7.075 MHz segment when the station is within ITU 
Regions 1 or 3.
    (d) No station may transmit with a transmitter power exceeding 25 W 
PEP on the VHF 1.25 m band when the control operator is a Novice 
operator.
    (e) No station may transmit with a transmitter power exceeding 5 W 
PEP on the UHF 23 cm band when the control operator is a Novice 
operator.
    (f) No station may transmit with a transmitter power exceeding 50 W 
PEP on the UHF 70 cm band from an area specified in footnote US7 to 
Sec. 2.106 of part 2, unless expressly authorized by the FCC after 
mutual agreement, on a case-by-case basis, between the District Director 
of the applicable field facility and the military area frequency 
coordinator at the applicable military base. An Earth station or 
telecommand station, however, may transmit on the 435-438 MHz segment 
with a maximum of 611 W effective radiated power (1 kW equivalent 
isotropically radiated power) without the authorization otherwise 
required. The transmitting antenna elevation angle between the lower 
half-power (-3 dB relative to the peak or antenna bore sight) point and

Sec. 97.315  Certification of external RF power amplifiers.

    (a) No more than 1 unit of 1 model of an external RF power amplifier 
capable of operation below 144 MHz may be constructed or modified during 
any calendar year by an amateur operator for use at a station without a 
grant of certification. No amplifier capable of operation below 144 MHz 
may be constructed or modified by a non-amateur operator without a grant 
of certification from the FCC.
    (b) Any external RF power amplifier or external RF power amplifier 
kit (see Sec. 2.815 of the FCC Rules), manufactured, imported or 
modified for use in a station or attached at any station must be 
certificated for use in the amateur service in accordance with subpart J 
of part 2 of the FCC Rules. This requirement does not apply if one or 
more of the following conditions are met:
    (1) The amplifier is not capable of operation on frequencies below 
144 MHz. For the purpose of this part, an amplifier will be deemed to be 
incapable of operation below 144 MHz if it is not capable of being 
easily modified to increase its amplification characteristics below 120 
MHz and either:
    (i) The mean output power of the amplifier decreases, as frequency 
decreases from 144 MHz, to a point where 0 dB or less gain is exhibited 
at 120 MHz; or
    (ii) The amplifier is not capable of amplifying signals below 120 
MHz even for brief periods without sustaining permanent damage to its 
amplification circuitry.
    (2) The amplifier was manufactured before April 28, 1978, and has 
been issued a marketing waiver by the FCC, or the amplifier was 
purchased before April 28, 1978, by an amateur operator for use at that 
amateur operator's station.
    (3) The amplifier was:
    (i) Constructed by the licensee, not from an external RF power 
amplifier kit, for use at the licensee's station; or
    (ii) Modified by the licensee for use at the licensee's station.
    (4) The amplifier is sold by an amateur operator to another amateur 
operator or to a dealer.
    (5) The amplifier is purchased in used condition by an equipment 
dealer from an amateur operator and the amplifier is further sold to 
another amateur operator for use at that operator's station.
    (c) Any external RF power amplifier appearing in the Commission's 
database as certificated for use in the amateur service may be marketed 
for use in the amateur service.

<R05>
Sec. 97.317  Standards for certification of external RF power amplifiers.

    (a) To receive a grant of certification, the amplifier must satisfy 
the spurious emission standards of Sec. 97.307(d) or (e) of this part, 
as applicable, when the amplifier is:
    (1) Operated at its full output power;
    (2) Placed in the ``standby'' or ``off'' positions, but still 
connected to the transmitter; and
    (3) Driven with at least 50 W mean RF input power (unless higher 
drive level is specified.)
    (b) To receive a grant of certification, the amplifier must not be 
capable of operation on any frequency or frequencies between 24 MHz and 
35 MHz. The amplifier will be deemed incapable of such operation if it:
    (1) Exhibits no more than 6 dB gain between 24 MHz and 26 MHz and 
between 28 MHz and 35 MHz. (This gain will be determined by the ratio of 
the input RF driving signal (mean power measurement) to the mean RF 
output power of the amplifier); and
    (2) Exhibits no amplification (0 dB gain) between 26 MHz and 28 MHz.
    (c) Certification may be denied when denial would prevent the use of 
these amplifiers in services other than the

[[Page 591]]

amateur service. The following features will result in dismissal or 
denial of an application for certification:
    (1) Any accessible wiring which, when altered, would permit 
operation of the amplifier in a manner contrary to the FCC Rules;
    (2) Circuit boards or similar circuitry to facilitate the addition 
of components to change the amplifier's operating characteristics in a 
manner contrary to the FCC Rules;
    (3) Instructions for operation or modification of the amplifier in a 
manner contrary to FCC Rules;
    (4) Any internal or external controls or adjustments to facilitate 
operation of the amplifier in a manner contrary to the FCC Rules;
    (5) Any internal RF sensing circuitry or any external switch, the 
purpose of which is to place the amplifier in the transmit mode;
    (6) The incorporation of more gain in the amplifier than is 
necessary to operate in the amateur service; for purposes of this 
paragraph, the amplifer must:
    (i) Not be capable of achieving designed output power when driven 
with less than 50 W mean RF input power;
    (ii) Not be capable of amplifying the input RF driving signal by 
more than 15 dB, unless the amplifier has a designed transmitter power 
of less than 1.5 kW (in such a case, gain must be reduced by the same 
number of dB as the transmitter power relationship to 1.5 kW; This gain 
limitation is determined by the ratio of the input RF driving signal to 
the RF output power of the amplifier where both signals are expressed in 
peak envelope power or mean power);
    (iii) Not exhibit more gain than permitted by paragraph (c)(6)(ii) 
of this section when driven by an RF input signal of less than 50 W mean 
power; and
    (iv) Be capable of sustained operation at its designed power level;
    (7) Any attenuation in the input of the amplifier which, when 
removed or modified, would permit the amplifier to function at its 
designed transmitter power when driven by an RF frequency input signal 
of less than 50 W mean power; or
    (8) Any other features designed to facilitate operation in a 
telecommunication service other than the Amateur Radio Services, such as 
the Citizens Band (CB) Radio Service.

              Subpart E--Providing Emergency Communications


<R05>
Sec. 97.401  Operation during a disaster.

    (a) When normal communication systems are overloaded, damaged or 
disrupted because a disaster has occurred, or is likely to occur, in an 
area where the amateur service is regulated by the FCC, an amateur 
station may make transmissions necessary to meet essential communication 
needs and facilitate relief actions.
    (b) When normal communication systems are overloaded, damaged or 
disrupted because a natural disaster has occurred, or is likely to 
occur, in an area where the amateur service is not regulated by the FCC, 
a station assisting in meeting essential communication needs and 
facilitating relief actions may do so only in accord with ITU Resolution 
No. 640 (Geneva, 1979). The 80 m, 75 m, 40 m, 30 m, 20 m, 17 m, 15 m, 12 
m, and 2 m bands may be used for these purposes.
    (c) When a disaster disrupts normal communication systems in a 
particular area, the FCC may declare a temporary state of communication 
emergency. The declaration will set forth any special conditions and 
special rules to be observed by stations during the communication 
emergency. A request for a declaration of a temporary state of emergency 
should be directed to the EIC in the area concerned.
    (d) A station in, or within 92.6 km of, Alaska may transmit 
emissions J3E and R3E on the channel at 5.1675 Mhz for emergency 
communications. The channel must be shared with stations licensed in the

power. ATPC allows the transmitter to operate at less than maximum power 
for most of the time. In a radio employing ATPC, the transmit power is 
reduced during normal operation conditions. When the receiver detects a 
reduction in signal level, a control signal is sent to the far end 
transmitter, instructing it to increase the power output to compensate 
for the signal reduction. The power output is limited to the licensed 
(maximum) transmit power. Guidelines for use of ATPC are set forth in 
the TIA Telecommunications Systems Bulletin TSB 10, ``Interference 
Criteria for Microwave Systems (TSB 10).''

    Applications, except FCC Form 175, must contain all technical 
information required by the application form and any additional 
information necessary

[[Page 607]]

to fully describe the proposed facilities and to demonstrate compliance 
with all technical requirements of the rules governing the radio service 
involved (see subparts C, F, G, I, J, and L of this part, as 
appropriate). The following paragraphs describe a number of technical 
requirements.
    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) Each application for a developmental authorization must be 
accompanied by pertinent supplemental information as required by 
Sec. 101.411 of this part in addition to such information as may be 
specifically required by this section.
    (c)-(d) [Reserved]
    (e) Each application in the Private Operational Fixed Point-to-Point 
Microwave Service and the Common Carrier Fixed Point-to-Point Microwave 
Service must include the following information:

Applicant's name and address.
Transmitting station name.
Transmitting station coordinates.
Frequencies and polarizations to be added, changed or deleted.
Transmitting equipment, its stability, effective isotropic radiated 
power, emission designator, and type of modulation (digital).
Transmitting antenna(s), model, gain, and, if required, a radiation 
pattern provided or certified by the manufacturer.
Transmitting antenna center line height(s) above ground level and ground 
elevation above mean sea level.
Receiving station name.
Receiving station coordinates.
Receiving antenna(s), model, gain, and, if required, a radiation pattern 
provided or certified by the manufacturer.
Receiving antenna center line height(s) above ground level and ground 
elevation above mean sea level.
Path azimuth and distance.

    Note: The position location of antenna sites shall be determined to 
an accuracy of no less than <plus-minus>1 second in the horizontal 
dimensions (latitude and longitude) and <plus-minus>1 meter in the 
vertical dimension (ground elevation) with respect to the National 
Spacial Reference System.

    (f) All applicants for regular authorization must, before filing an 
application, major amendments to a pending application, or modifications 
to a license, prior coordinate the proposed frequency usage with 
existing users in the area and other applicants with previously filed 
applications in accordance with the procedures in Sec. 101.103. In those 
frequency bands shared with the communication-satellite service, an 
applicant for a new station, for new points of communication, for the 
initial frequency assignment in a shared band for which coordination has 
not been previously effected, or for authority to modify the emission or 
radiation characteristics of an existing station in a manner that may 
increase the likelihood of harmful interference, must ascertain in 
advance whether the station(s) involved lie within the great circle 
coordination distance contours of an existing Earth station or one for 
which an application has been accepted for filing, and must coordinate 
his proposal with each such Earth station operator or applicant. For 
each potential interference path, the applicant must perform the 
computations required to determine that the expected level of 
interference to or from the terrestrial station does not exceed the 
maximum permissible interference power level in accordance with the 
technical standards and requirements of Sec. 25.251 of this chapter. The 
Commission may, in the course of examining any application, require the 
submission of additional showings, complete with pertinent data and 
calculations in accordance with part 25 of this chapter, showing that 
harmful interference will not likely result from the proposed operation. 
(Technical characteristics of the Earth stations on file and 
coordination contour maps for those Earth stations will be kept on file 
for public inspection in the offices of the Commission's International 
Bureau in Washington, DC.)
    (g) Each application in the Local Multipoint Distribution Service 
and 24 GHz Service must contain all technical information required by 
FCC Form 601 and any other applicable form or associated Public Notices 
and by any applicable rules in this part.

                       Processing of Applications


<R05>
Sec. 101.45  Mutually exclusive applications.

    (a) The Commission will consider applications to be mutually 
exclusive if their conflicts are such that the grant of one application 
would effectively preclude by reason of harmful electrical interference, 
or other practical reason, the grant of one or more of the other 
applications. The Commission will presume ``harmful electrical 
interference'' exists when the levels of Sec. 101.105 are exceeded, or 
when there is a material impairment to service rendered to the public 
despite full cooperation in good faith by all applicants or parties to 
achieve reasonable technical adjustments which would avoid electrical 
conflict.
    (b) A common carrier application, except in the Local Multipoint 
Distribution Service and in the 24 GHz Service, will be entitled to 
comparative consideration with one or more conflicting applications only 
if:
    (1) The application is mutually exclusive with the other 
application; and
    (2) The application is received by the Commission in a condition 
acceptable for filing by whichever ``cut-off'' date is earlier:
    (i) Sixty (60) days after the date of the public notice listing the 
first of the conflicting applications as accepted for filing; or
    (ii) One (1) business day preceding the day on which the Commission 
takes final action on the previously filed application (should the 
Commission act upon such application in the interval between thirty (30) 
and sixty (60) days after the date of its public notice).
    (c) Whenever three or more applications are mutually exclusive, but 
not uniformly so, the earliest filed application established the date 
prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, regardless of whether or 
not subsequently filed applications are directly mutually exclusive with 
the first filed application. (For example, applications A, B, and C are 
filed in that order. A and B are directly mutually exclusive, B and C 
are directly mutually exclusive. In order to be considered comparatively 
with B, C must be filed within the ``cut-off'' period established by A 
even though C is not directly mutually exclusive with A.)
    (d) Private operational fixed point-to-point microwave applications 
for authorization under this part will be entitled to comparative 
consideration with one or more conflicting applications in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 1.227(b)(4) of this chapter.
    (e) An application otherwise mutually exclusive with one or more 
previously filed applications, but filed after the appropriate date 
prescribed in paragraphs (b) or (d) of this section, will be returned 
without prejudice and will be eligible for refiling only after final 
action is taken by the Commission with respect to the previously filed 
application (or applications).
    (f) For purposes of this section, any application (whether mutually 
exclusive or not) will be considered to be a newly filed application if 
it is amended by a major amendment (as defined by Sec. 1.929 of this 
chapter), except under any of the following circumstances:
    (1) The application has been designated for comparative hearing, or 
for comparative evaluation (pursuant to Sec. 101.51 of this part), and 
the Commission or the presiding officer accepts the amendment pursuant 
to Sec. 1.927 of this chapter;
    (2) The amendment resolves frequency conflicts with authorized 
stations or other pending applications which would otherwise require 
resolution by hearing or by comparative evaluation pursuant to 
Sec. 101.51 provided that the amendment does not create new or 
additional frequency conflicts;
    (3) The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control 
found by the Commission to be in the public interest, and for which a 
requested exemption from the ``cut-off'' requirements of this section is 
granted;
    (4) The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control 
which results from an agreement under Sec. 1.935 of this chapter whereby 
two or more

[[Page 611]]

applicants entitled to comparative consideration of their applications 
join in one (or more) of the existing applications and request dismissal 
of their other application (or applications) to avoid the delay and cost 
of comparative consideration;
    (5) The amendment corrects typographical, transcription, or similar 
clerical errors which are clearly demonstrated to be mistakes by 
reference to other parts of the application, and whose discovery does 
not create new or increased frequency conflicts; or
    (6) The amendment does not create new or increased frequency 
conflicts, and is demonstrably necessitated by events which the 
applicant could not have reasonably foreseen at the time of filing, such 
as, for example:
    (i) The loss of a transmitter or receiver site by condemnation, 
natural causes, or loss of lease or option;
    (ii) Obstruction of a proposed transmission path caused by the 
erection of a new building or other structure; or
    (iii) The discontinuance or substantial technological obsolescence 
of specified equipment, whenever the application has been pending before 
the Commission for two or more years from the date of its filing.
    (g) Applicants for the 932.5-935/941.5-944 MHz bands shall select a 
frequency pair. Applicants for these bands may select an unpaired 
frequency only upon a showing that spectrum efficiency will not be 
impaired and that unpaired spectrum is not available in other bands. 
During the initial filing window, frequency coordination is not 
required, except that an application for a frequency in the 942-944 MHz 
band must be coordinated to ensure that it does not affect an existing 
broadcast auxiliary service licensee. After the initial filing window, 
an applicant must submit evidence that frequency coordination has been 
performed with all licensees affected by the application. All frequency 
coordination must be performed in accordance with Sec. 101.103. In the 
event of mutually exclusive applications occurring during the initial 
filing window for the 932.5-935/941.5-944 MHz bands, applicants shall be 
given the opportunity to resolve these situations by applying for an 
alternative frequency pair, if one is available. To the extent that 
there are no other available frequencies or to the extent that mutually 
exclusive applications remain after this process is concluded, lotteries 
shall be conducted for each frequency pair among all remaining mutually 
exclusive applications, assuming appropriate coordination with existing 
broadcast auxiliary stations can be concluded, where necessary. In the 
event of mutually exclusive applications being received for these bands 
on the same day after the initial filing window has closed and a 
subsequent filing window opened, lotteries shall be conducted for each 
frequency pair among all mutually exclusive applications.

Sec. 101.51  Comparative evaluation of mutually exclusive applications.

    (a) In order to expedite action on mutually exclusive applications 
in services under this rules part where neither competitive bidding nor 
the random selection processes apply, the applicants may request the 
Commission to consider their applications without a formal hearing in 
accordance with the summary procedure outlined in paragraph (b) in this 
section if:
    (1) The applications are entitled to comparative consideration 
pursuant to Sec. 101.45;
    (2) The applications have not been designated for formal evidentiary 
hearing; and
    (3) The Commission determines, initially or at any time during the 
procedure outline in paragraph (b) of this section, that such procedure 
is appropriate, and that, from the information submitted and 
consideration of such other matters as may be officially noticed, there 
are no substantial and material questions of fact, presented (Other than 
those relating to the comparative merits of the applications) which 
would preclude a grant under Sec. 1.915 of this chapter.
    (b) Provided that the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section 
are satisfied, applicants may request the Commission to act upon their 
mutually exclusive applications without a formal

[[Page 612]]

hearing pursuant to the summary procedure outlined below:
    (1) To initiate the procedure, each applicant will submit to the 
Commission a written statement containing:
    (i) A waiver of the applicant's right to a formal hearing;
    (ii) A request and agreement that, in order to avoid the delay and 
expense of a comparative formal hearing, the Commission should exercise 
its judgment to select from among the mutually exclusive applications 
that proposal (or proposals) which would best serve the public interest; 
and
    (iii) The signature of a principal (and the principal's attorney if 
represented).
    (2) After receipt of the written requests of all of the applicants 
the Commission (if it deems this procedure appropriate) will issue a 
notice designating the comparative criteria upon which the applications 
are to be evaluated and will request each applicant to submit, within a 
specified period of time, additional information concerning the 
applicant's proposal relative to the comparative criteria.
    (3) Within thirty (30) days following the due date for filing this 
information, the Commission will accept concise and factual argument on 
the competing proposals from the rival applicants, potential customers, 
and other knowledgeable parties in interest.
    (4) Within fifteen (15) days following the due date for the filing 
of comments, the Commission will accept concise and factual replies from 
the rival applicants.
    (5) From time to time during the course of this procedure the 
Commission may request additional information from the applicants and 
hold informal conferences at which all competing applicants will have 
the right to be represented.
    (6) Upon evaluation of the applications, the information submitted, 
and such other matters as may be officially noticed the Commission will 
issue a decision granting one (or more) of the proposals which it 
concludes would best serve the public interest, convenience and 
necessity. The decision will report briefly and concisely the reasons 
for the Commission's selection and will deny the other application(s). 
This decision will be considered final.

Sec. 101.55  Considerations involving transfer or assignment applications.

    (a) Except as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section, 
licenses may not be assigned or transferred prior to the completion of 
construction of the facility. However, consent to the assignment or 
transfer of control of such a license may be given prior to the 
completion of construction where:
    (1) The assignment or transfer does not involve a substantial change 
in or ownership or control of the authorized facilities; or
    (2) The assignment or transfer of control is involuntary due to the 
licensee's bankruptcy, death, or legal disability.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) At its discretion, the Commission may require the submission of 
an affirmative, factual showing (supported by affidavits of a person or 
persons with personal knowledge thereof) to demonstrate that the 
proposed assignor or transferor has not acquired an authorization or 
operated a station for the principal purpose of profitable sale rather 
than public service. This showing may include, for example, a 
demonstration that the proposed assignment or transfer is due to changed 
circumstances (described in detail) affecting the licensee subsequent to 
the acquisition of the license, or that the proposed transfer of radio 
facilities is incidental to a sale of other facilities or merger of 
interests.
    (d) If a proposed transfer of radio facilities is incidental to a 
sale or other facilities or merger of interests, the showing specified 
under paragraph (c) of this section shall be submitted and include an 
additional exhibit that:
    (1) Discloses complete details as to the sale of facilities or 
merger of interests;
    (2) Segregates clearly by an itemized accounting, the amount of 
consideration involved in the sale of facilities or merger of interests; 
and

[[Page 613]]

    (3) Demonstrates that the amount of consideration assignable to the 
facilities or business interests involved represents their fair market 
value at the time of the transaction.
    (e) For the purposes of this section, the one year period is 
calculated using the following dates (as appropriate):
    (1) The initial date of grant of the license, excluding subsequent 
modifications;
    (2) The date of consummation of an assignment or transfer, if the 
station is acquired as the result of an assignment of license, or 
transfer of control of corporate licensee; or
    (3) The median date of the applicable commencement dates (determined 
pursuant to paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section) if the 
transaction involves a system (such as a Private Operational Fixed 
Point-to-Point Microwave system) of two or more stations. (The median 
date is that date so selected such that fifty percent of the 
commencement dates of the total number of stations, when arranged in 
chronological order, lie below it and fifty percent lie above it. When 
the number of stations is an even number, the median date will be a 
value half way between the two dates closest to the theoretical median.)

Sec. 101.56  Partitioned service areas (PSAs) and disaggregated spectrum.

    (a)(1) The holder of an EA authorization to provide service pursuant 
to the competitive bidding process and any incumbent licensee of 
rectangular service areas in the 38.6-40.0 GHz band may enter into 
agreements with eligible parties to partition any portion of its service 
area as defined by the partitioner and partitionee. Alternatively, 
licensees may enter into agreements or contracts to disaggregate any 
portion of spectrum, provided acquired spectrum is disaggregated 
according to frequency pairs.
    (2)(i) Contracts must be filed with the Commission within 30 days of 
the date that such agreements are reached.
    (ii) The contracts must include descriptions of the areas being 
partitioned or spectrum disaggregated. The partitioned service area 
shall be defined by coordinate points at every 3 seconds along the 
partitioned service area unless an FCC recognized service area is 
utilized (i.e., Metropolitan Service Area or Rural Service Area) or 
county lines are followed. If geographic coordinate points are used, 
they must be specified in degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest 
second of latitude and longitude and must be based upon the 1983 North 
American Datum (NAD83). In the case where an FCC recognized service area 
or county lines are utilized, applicants need only list the specific 
area(s) (through use of FCC designations or county names) that 
constitute the partitioned area.
    (b) The eligibility requirements applicable to EA authorization 
holders also apply to those individuals and entities seeking partitioned 
or disaggregated spectrum authorizations.
    (c) Subsequent to issuance of the authorization for a partitioned 
service area, the partitioned area will be treated as a separate 
protected service area.
    (d)(1) When any area within an EA becomes a partitioned service 
area, the remaining counties and geopolitical subdivision within that EA 
will be subsequently treated and classified as a partitioned service 
area.
    (2) At the time an EA is partitioned, the Commission shall cancel 
the EA authorization initially issued and issue a partitioned service 
area authorization to the former EA authorization holder.
    (e) At the time a BTA is partitioned, the Commission shall cancel 
the BTA authorization initially issued and issue a partitioned service 
area authorization to the former BTA authorization holder.
    (f) The duties and responsibilities imposed upon EA authorization 
holders in this part, apply to those licensees obtaining authorizations 
by partitioning or spectrum disaggregation.
    (g) The build-out requirements for the partitioned service area or 
disaggregated spectrum shall be the same as applied to the EA 
authorization holder.
    (h) The license term for the partitioned service area or 
disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the

[[Page 614]]

period that would apply to the EA authorization holder.
    (i) Licensees, including those using bidding credits in a 
competitive bidding procedure, shall have the authority to partition 
service areas or disaggregate spectrum.

Policies Governing Microwave Relocation From the 1850-1990 and 2110-2200 
                                MHz Bands


<R05>
Sec. 101.69  Transition of the 1850-1990 MHz, 2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz bands from the fixed microwave services to personal communications services and 
          emerging technologies.

    Fixed Microwave Services (FMS) frequencies in the 1850-1990 MHz, 
2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz bands listed in Secs. 101.147(c), (d) 
and (e) have been allocated for use by emerging technology (ET) 
services, including Personal Communications Services (PCS). The rules in 
this section provide for a transition period during which ET licensees 
may relocate existing FMS licensees using these frequencies to other 
media or other fixed channels, including those in other microwave bands.
    (a) ET licensees may negotiate with FMS licensees authorized to use 
frequencies in the 1850-1990 MHz, 2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz 
bands, for the purpose of agreeing to terms under which the FMS 
licensees would:
    (1) Relocate their operations to other fixed microwave bands or 
other media; or alternatively
    (2) Accept a sharing arrangement with the ET licensee that may 
result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the FMS 
operations.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, FMS 
operations in the 1850-1990 MHz, 2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz bands, 
with the exception of public safety facilities defined in Sec. 101.77, 
will continue to be co-primary with other users of this spectrum until 
two years after the FCC commences acceptance of applications for ET 
services (voluntary negotiation period), and until one year after an ET 
licensee initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed microwave 
licensee's operations (mandatory negotiation period). In the 1910-1930 
MHz band allocated for unlicensed PCS, FMS operations will continue to 
be co-primary until one year after UTAM, Inc. initiates negotiations for 
relocation of the fixed microwave licensee's operations. Except as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, public safety facilities 
defined in Sec. 101.77 will continue to be co-primary in these bands 
until three years after the Commission commences acceptance of 
applications for an emerging technology service (voluntary negotiation 
period), and until two years after an emerging technology service 
licensee or an emerging technology unlicensed equipment supplier or 
representative initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed 
microwave licensee's operations (mandatory negotiation period). If no 
agreement is reached during either the voluntary or mandatory 
negotiation periods, an ET licensee may initiate involuntary relocation 
procedures. Under involuntary relocation, the incumbent is required to 
relocate, provided that the ET licensee meets the conditions of 
Sec. 101.75.
    (c) Voluntary and mandatory negotiation periods for PCS C, D, E, and 
F blocks are defined as follows:
    (1) Non-public safety incumbents will have a one-year voluntary 
negotiation period and a one-year mandatory negotiation period; and
    (2) Public safety incumbents will have a three-year voluntary 
negotiation period and a two-year mandatory negotiation period.
    (d) Relocation of FMS licensees in the 2165-2200 MHz band by Mobile-
Satellite Service (MSS) licensees will be subject to mandatory 
negotiations only. Mandatory negotiation periods are defined as follows:
    (1) Non-public safety incumbents will have a two-year mandatory 
negotiation period; and
    (2) Public safety incumbents will have a three-year mandatory 
negotiation period.

<R05>
Sec. 101.71  Voluntary negotiations.

    During the voluntary negotiation period, negotiations are strictly 
voluntary and are not defined by any parameters. However, if the parties 
have not reached an agreement within one year after the commencement of 
the voluntary period for non-public safety entities, or within three 
years after the commencement of the voluntary period for public safety 
entities, the FMS licensee must allow the ET licensee if it so chooses 
to gain access to the existing facilities to be relocated so that an 
independent third party can examine the FMS licensee's 2 GHz system and 
prepare an estimate of the cost and the time needed to relocate the FMS 
licensee to comparable facilities. The ET licensee must pay for any such 
estimate.

[62 FR 12758, Mar. 18, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 101.73  Mandatory negotiations.

    (a) If a relocation agreement is not reached during the voluntary 
period, the ET licensee may initiate a mandatory negotiation period. 
This mandatory period is triggered at the option of the ET licensee, but 
ET licensees may not invoke their right to mandatory negotiation until 
the voluntary negotiation period has expired.
    (b) Once mandatory negotiations have begun, an FMS licensee may not 
refuse to negotiate and all parties are required to negotiate in good 
faith. Good faith requires each party to provide information to the 
other that is reasonably necessary to facilitate the relocation process. 
In evaluating claims that a party has not negotiated in good faith, the 
FCC will consider, inter alia, the following factors:
    (1) Whether the ET licensee has made a bona fide offer to relocate 
the FMS licensee to comparable facilities in accordance with Section 
101.75(b);
    (2) If the FMS licensee has demanded a premium, the type of premium 
requested (e.g., whether the premium is directly related to relocation, 
such as system-wide relocations and analog-to-digital conversions, 
versus other types of premiums), and whether the value of the premium as 
compared to the cost of providing comparable facilities is 
disproportionate (i.e., whether there is a lack of proportion or 
relation between the two);
    (3) What steps the parties have taken to determine the actual cost 
of relocation to comparable facilities;
    (4) Whether either party has withheld information requested by the 
other party that is necessary to estimate relocation costs or to 
facilitate the relocation process.
    (c) Any party alleging a violation of our good faith requirement 
must attach an independent estimate of the relocation costs in question 
to any documentation filed with the Commission in support of its claim. 
An independent cost estimate must include a specification for the 
comparable facility and a statement of the costs associated with 
providing that facility to the incumbent licensee.
    (d) Provisions for Relocation of Fixed Microwave Licensees in the 
2165-2200 MHz band. Mandatory negotiations will commence when the 
Mobile-Satellite Service (MSS) licensee informs the fixed microwave 
licensee in writing of its desire to negotiate. Mandatory negotiations 
will be conducted with the goal of providing the fixed microwave 
licensee with comparable facilities, defined as facilities possessing 
the following characteristics:
    (1) Throughput. Communications throughput is the amount of 
information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. If 
analog facilities are being replaced with analog, comparable facilities 
provide an equivalent number of 4 kHz voice channels. If digital 
facilities are being replaced with digital, comparable facilities 
provide equivalent data loading bits per second (bps).
    (2) Reliability. System reliability is the degree to which 
information is transferred accurately within a system. Comparable 
facilities provide reliability equal to the overall reliability of the 
FMS system. For digital systems, reliability is measured by the percent 
of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value, and for analog 
or digital voice transmission, it is measured by the percent of time 
that audio signal quality meets an established threshold. If an analog 
system is replaced with a digital system, only

[[Page 617]]

the resulting frequency response, harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise 
and its reliability will be considered in determining comparable 
reliability.
    (3) Operating Costs. Operating costs are the cost to operate and 
maintain the FMS system. MSS licensees would compensate FMS licensees 
for any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement 
facilities (e.g., additional rental payments, and increased utility 
fees) for five years after relocation. MSS licensees could satisfy this 
obligation by making a lump-sum payment based on present value using 
current interest rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the FMS 
licensee would be equivalent to the 2 GHz system in order for the 
replacement system to be comparable.

<R05>
Sec. 101.75  Involuntary relocation procedures.

    (a) If no agreement is reached during either the voluntary or 
mandatory negotiation period, an ET licensee may initiate involuntary 
relocation procedures under the Commission's rules. ET licensees are 
obligated to pay to relocate only the specific microwave links to which 
their systems pose an interference problem. Under involuntary 
relocation, the FMS licensee is required to relocate, provided that the 
ET licensee:
    (1) Guarantees payment of relocation costs, including all 
engineering, equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any legitimate and 
prudent transaction expenses incurred by the FMS licensee that are 
directly attributable to an involuntary relocation, subject to a cap of 
two percent of the hard costs involved. Hard costs are defined as the 
actual costs associated with providing a replacement system, such as 
equipment and engineering expenses. ET licensees are not required to pay 
FMS licensees for internal resources devoted to the relocation process. 
ET licensees are not required to pay for transaction costs incurred by 
FMS licensees during the voluntary or mandatory periods once the 
involuntary period is initiated, or for fees that cannot be legitimately 
tied to the provision of comparable facilities;
    (2) Completes all activities necessary for implementing the 
replacement facilities, including engineering and cost analysis of the 
relocation procedure and, if radio facilities are used, identifying and 
obtaining, on the incumbents' behalf, new microwave frequencies and 
frequency coordination; and
    (3) Builds the replacement system and tests it for comparability 
with the existing 2 GHz system.
    (b) Comparable facilities. The replacement system provided to an 
incumbent during an involuntary relocation must be at least equivalent 
to the existing FMS system with respect to the following three factors:
    (1) Throughput. Communications throughput is the amount of 
information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. If 
analog facilities are being replaced with analog, the ET licensee is 
required to provide the FMS licensee with an equivalent number of 4 kHz 
voice channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital, 
the ET licensee must provide the FMS licensee with equivalent data 
loading bits per second (bps). ET licensees must provide FMS licensees 
with enough throughput to satisfy the FMS licensee's system use at the 
time of relocation, not match the total capacity of the FMS system.
    (2) Reliability. System reliability is the degree to which 
information is transferred accurately within a system. ET licensees must 
provide FMS licensees with reliability equal to the overall reliability 
of their system. For digital data systems, reliability is measured by 
the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value, 
and for analog or digital voice transmissions, it is measured by the 
percent of time that audio signal quality meets an established 
threshold. If an analog voice system is replaced with a digital voice 
system, only the resulting frequency response, harmonic distortion, 
signal-to-noise ratio and its reliability will be considered in 
determining comparable reliability.
    (3) Operating costs. Operating costs are the cost to operate and 
maintain the FMS system. ET licensees must

[[Page 618]]

compensate FMS licensees for any increased recurring costs associated 
with the replacement facilities (e.g., additional rental payments, 
increased utility fees) for five years after relocation. ET licensees 
may satisfy this obligation by making a lump-sum payment based on 
present value using current interest rates. Additionally, the 
maintenance costs to the FMS licensee must be equivalent to the 2 GHz 
system in order for the replacement system to be considered comparable.
    (c) The FMS licensee is not required to relocate until the 
alternative facilities are available to it for a reasonable time to make 
adjustments, determine comparability, and ensure a seamless handoff.
    (d) Twelve-month trial period. If, within one year after the 
relocation to new facilities, the FMS licensee demonstrates that the new 
facilities are not comparable to the former facilities, the ET licensee 
must remedy the defects or pay to relocate the microwave licensee to one 
of the following: its former or equivalent 2 GHz channels, another 
comparable frequency band, a land-line system, or any other facility 
that satisfies the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section. This trial period commences on the date that the FMS licensee 
begins full operation of the replacement link. If the FMS licensee has 
retained its 2 GHz authorization during the trial period, it must return 
the license to the Commission at the end of the twelve months. FMS 
licensees relocated from the 2165-2200 MHz band may not be returned to 
their former 2 GHz channels. All other remedies specified in this 
paragraph (d) are available to FMS licensees relocated from the 2165-
2200 MHz band, and may be invoked whenever the FMS licensee demonstrates 
that its replacement facility is not comparable, subject to no time 
limit.

and two-year mandatory negotiation period, except as otherwise defined 
in paragraph 101.69(c). In order for public safety licensees to qualify 
for extended negotiation periods, the department head responsible for 
system oversight must certify to the ET licensee requesting relocation 
that:
    (1) The agency is a Police licensee, a Fire Licensee, or an 
Emergency Medical Licensee as defined in Sec. 90.7 of this chapter, or 
meets the eligibility requirements of Sec. 90.20(a)(2) of this chapter, 
except for Sec. 90.20(a)(2)(ii) of this chapter, or that it is a 
licensee of other part 101 facilities licensed on a primary basis under 
the eligibility requirements of part 90, subpart B of this chapter; and
    (2) The majority of communications carried on the facilities at 
issue involve safety of life and property.
    (b) A public safety licensee must provide certification within 
thirty (30) days of a request from a ET licensee, or the ET licensee may 
presume that special treatment is inapplicable. If a public safety 
licensee falsely certifies to an ET licensee that it qualifies for the 
extended time periods, this licensee will be in violation of the 
Commission's rules and will subject to appropriate penalties, as well as 
immediately subject to the non-public safety time periods.

Sec. 101.79  Sunset provisions for licensees in the 1850-1990 MHz, 2110-2150 MHz, and 2150-2160 MHz bands.

    (a) FMS licensees will maintain primary status in the 1850-1990 MHz, 
2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz bands unless and until an ET licensee 
requires use of the spectrum. ET licensees are not required to pay 
relocation costs after the relocation rules sunset (i.e. ten years after 
the voluntary period begins for the first ET licensees in the service). 
Once the relocation rules sunset, an ET licensee may require the 
incumbent to cease operations, provided that the ET licensee intends to 
turn on a system within interference range of the incumbent, as 
determined by TIA Bulletin 10-F of any standard successor. ET licensee 
notification to the affected FMS licensee must be in writing and must 
provide the incumbent

[[Page 619]]

with no less than six months to vacate the spectrum. After the six-month 
notice period has expired, the FMS licensee must turn its license back 
into the Commission, unless the parties have entered into an agreement 
which allows the FMS licensee to continue to operate on a mutually 
agreed upon basis.
    (b) If the parties cannot agree on a schedule or an alternative 
arrangement, requests for extension will be accepted and reviewed on a 
case-by-case basis. The Commission will grant such extensions only if 
the incumbent can demonstrate that:
    (1) It cannot relocate within the six-month period (e.g., because no 
alternative spectrum or other reasonable option is available), and;
    (2) The public interest would be harmed if the incumbent is forced 
to terminate operations (e.g., if public safety communications services 
would be disrupted).

Sec. 101.81  Future licensing in the 1850-1990 MHz, 2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 MHz bands.

    After April 25, 1996, all major modifications and extensions to 
existing FMS systems in the 1850-1990 MHz, 2110-2150 MHz, and 2160-2200 
MHz bands will be authorized on a secondary basis to ET systems. All 
other modifications will render the modified FMS license secondary to ET 
operations, unless the incumbent affirmatively justifies primary status 
and the incumbent FMS licensee establishes that the modification would 
not add to the relocation costs of ET licensees. Incumbent FMS licensees 
will maintain primary status for the following technical changes:
    (a) Decreases in power;
    (b) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in antenna height;
    (c) Minor location changes (up to two seconds);
    (d) Any data correction which does not involve a change in the 
location of an existing facility;
    (e) Reductions in authorized bandwidth;
    (f) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in structure height;
    (g) Changes (increases or decreases) in ground elevation that do not 
affect centerline height;
    (h) Minor equipment changes.

  Policies Governing Fixed Service Relocation From the 18.58-19.30 GHz 
                                  Band

    Source: 65 FR 54173, Sept. 7, 2000, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 101.83  Modification of station license.

    Permissible changes in equipment operating in the band 18.58-19.3 
GHz: Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, stations that 
remain co-primary under the provisions of Sec. 101.147(r) may not make 
modifications to their systems that increase interference to satellite 
earth stations, or result in a facility that would be more costly to 
relocate.


<R05>
Sec. 101.85  Transition of the 18.58-19.3 GHz band from the terrestrial fixed services to the fixed-satellite service (FSS).

    Fixed services (FS) frequencies in the 18.58-19.3 GHz bands listed 
in Secs. 21.901(e), 74.502(c), 74.602(g), and 78.18(a)(4) of this 
chapter, and Sec. 101.147(a) and (r) have been allocated for use by the 
fixed-satellite service (FSS). The rules in this section provide for a 
transition period during which FSS licensees may relocate existing FS 
licensees using these frequencies to other microwave bands.
    (a) FSS licensees may negotiate with FS licensees authorized to use 
frequencies in the 18.58-19.30 GHz band for the purpose of agreeing to 
terms under which the FS licensees would:
    (1) Relocate their operations to other fixed microwave bands or 
other media; or alternatively
    (2) Accept a sharing arrangement with the FSS licensee that may 
result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the FSS 
operations.
    (b) FS operations in the 18.58-19.30 GHz band that remain co-primary 
under the provisions of Secs. 21.901(e), 74.502(c), 74.602(d), 
78.18(a)(4) of this chapter, and Sec. 101.147(r) will continue to

[[Page 620]]

be co-primary with the FSS users of this spectrum until June 8, 2010 or 
until the relocation of the fixed service operations, whichever occurs 
sooner, except for operations in the band 19.26-19.3 GHz and low power 
systems operating pursuant to Sec. 101.47(r) (10), which shall operate 
on a co-primary basis until October 31, 2011. If no agreement is reached 
during the negotiations, an FSS licensee may initiate relocation 
procedures. Under the relocation procedures, the incumbent is required 
to relocate, provided that the FSS licensee meets the conditions of 
Sec. 101.91.
    (c) Negotiation periods are defined as follows:
    (1) Non-public safety incumbents will have a two-year negotiation 
period.
    (2) Public safety incumbents will have a three-year negotiation 
period.

[65 FR 54173, Sept. 7, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 63516, Dec. 7, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 101.89  Negotiations.

    (a) The negotiation is triggered by the fixed-satellite service 
(FSS) licensee, who must contact the fixed services (FS) licensee and 
request that negotiations begin.
    (b) Once negotiations have begun, an FS licensee may not refuse to 
negotiate and all parties are required to negotiate in good faith. Good 
faith requires each party to provide information to the other that is 
reasonably necessary to facilitate the relocation process. In evaluating 
claims that a party has not negotiated in good faith, the FCC will 
consider, inter alia, the following factors:
    (1) Whether the FSS licensee has made a bona fide offer to relocate 
the FS licensee to comparable facilities in accordance with 
Sec. 101.91(b);
    (2) If the FS licensee has demanded a premium, the type of premium 
requested (e.g., whether the premium is directly related to relocation, 
such as system-wide relocations and analog-to-digital conversions, 
versus other types of premiums), and whether the value of the premium as 
compared to the cost of providing comparable facilities is 
disproportionate (i.e., whether there is a lack of proportion or 
relation between the two);
    (3) What steps the parties have taken to determine the actual cost 
of relocation to comparable facilities;
    (4) Whether either party has withheld information requested by the 
other party that is necessary to estimate relocation costs or to 
facilitate the relocation process.
    (c) Any party alleging a violation of our good faith requirement 
must attach an independent estimate of the relocation costs in question 
to any documentation filed with the Commission in support of its claim. 
An independent cost estimate must include a specification for the 
comparable facility and a statement of the costs associated with 
providing that facility to the incumbent licensee.
    (d) Negotiations will commence when the FSS licensee informs the FS 
licensee in writing of its desire to negotiate. Negotiations will be 
conducted with the goal of providing the FS licensee with comparable 
facilities, defined as facilities possessing the following 
characteristics:
    (1) Throughput. Communications throughput is the amount of 
information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. If 
analog facilities are being replaced with analog, the FSS licensee is 
required to provide the FS licensee with an equivalent number of 4 kHz 
voice channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital, 
the FSS licensee must provide the FS licensee with equivalent data 
loading bits per second (bps). FSS licensees must provide FS licensees 
with enough throughput to satisfy the FS licensee's system use at the 
time of relocation, not match the total capacity of the FS system.
    (2) Reliability. System reliability is the degree to which 
information is transferred accurately within a system. FSS licensees 
must provide FS licensees with reliability equal to the overall 
reliability of their system. For digital data systems, reliability is 
measured by the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a 
desired value, and for analog or digital voice transmissions, it is 
measured by the percent of time that audio signal quality meets an 
established threshold. If an analog voice system is replaced with

[[Page 621]]

a digital voice system, only the resulting frequency response, harmonic 
distortion, signal-to-noise ratio and its reliability will be considered 
in determining comparable reliability.
    (3) Operating costs. Operating costs are the cost to operate and 
maintain the FS system. FSS licensees must compensate FS licensees for 
any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities 
(e.g., additional rental payments, increased utility fees) for five 
years after relocation. FSS licensees may satisfy this obligation by 
making a lump-sum payment based on present value using current interest 
rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the FS licensee must be 
equivalent to the 18 GHz system in order for the replacement system to 
be considered comparable.


<R05>
Sec. 101.91  Involuntary relocation procedures.

    (a) If no agreement is reached during the negotiations period, an 
FSS licensee may initiate relocation procedures under the Commission's 
rules. FSS licensees are obligated to pay to relocate only the specific 
microwave links from which their systems may receive interference. Under 
these procedures, the FS licensee is required to relocate, provided that 
the FSS licensee:
    (1) Guarantees payment of relocation costs, including all 
engineering, equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any legitimate and 
prudent transaction expenses incurred by the FS licensee that are 
directly attributable to the relocation, subject to a cap of two percent 
of the hard costs involved. Hard costs are defined as the actual costs 
associated with providing a replacement system, such as equipment and 
engineering expenses. FSS licensees are not required to pay FS licensees 
for internal resources devoted to the relocation process. FSS licensees 
are not required to pay for transaction costs incurred by FS licensees 
during the negotiations once the negotiation is initiated, or for fees 
that cannot be legitimately tied to the provision of comparable 
facilities;
    (2) Completes all activities necessary for implementing the 
replacement facilities, including engineering and cost analysis of the 
relocation procedure and, if radio facilities are used, identifying and 
obtaining, on the incumbents' behalf, new microwave frequencies and 
frequency coordination; and
    (3) Builds the replacement system and tests it for comparability 
with the existing 18 GHz system.
    (b) Comparable facilities. The replacement system provided to an 
incumbent during a relocation must be at least equivalent to the 
existing FS system with respect to the following three factors:
    (1) Throughput. Communications throughput is the amount of 
information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. If 
analog facilities are being replaced with analog, the FSS licensee is 
required to provide the FS licensee with an equivalent number of 4 kHz 
voice channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital, 
the FSS licensee must provide the FS licensee with equivalent data 
loading bits per second (bps). FSS licensees must provide FS licensees 
with enough throughput to satisfy the FS licensee's system use at the 
time of relocation, not match the total capacity of the FS system.
    (2) Reliability. System reliability is the degree to which 
information is transferred accurately within a system. FSS licensees 
must provide FS licensees with reliability equal to the overall 
reliability of their system. For digital data systems, reliability is 
measured by the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a 
desired value, and for analog or digital voice transmissions, it is 
measured by the percent of time that audio signal quality meets an 
established threshold. If an analog voice system is replaced with a 
digital voice system, only the resulting frequency response, harmonic 
distortion, signal-to-noise ratio and its reliability will be considered 
in determining comparable reliability.
    (3) Operating costs. Operating costs are the cost to operate and 
maintain the FS system. FSS licensees must compensate FS licensees for 
any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities 
(e.g., additional rental payments, increased utility fees) for five 
years after relocation. FSS licensees may satisfy this obligation by 
making a lump-sum payment

[[Page 622]]

based on present value using current interest rates. Additionally, the 
maintenance costs to the FS licensee must be equivalent to the 18 GHz 
system in order for the replacement system to be considered comparable.
    (c) The FS licensee is not required to relocate until the 
alternative facilities are available to it for a reasonable time to make 
adjustments, determine comparability, and ensure a seamless handoff. The 
FS licensee may take up to 12 months to make such adjustments and 
perform such testing.
    (d) If the FS licensee demonstrates to the Commission that the new 
facilities are not comparable to the former facilities, the Commission 
may require the FSS licensee to further modify or replace the FS 
licensee's equipment.

<R05>
Sec. 101.95  Sunset provisions for licensees in the 18.58-19.30 GHz band.

    (a) FSS licensees are not required to pay relocation costs after the 
relocation rules sunset (see Secs. 74.502(c), 74.602(g), and 78.18(a)(4) 
of this chapter, and Sec. 101.147 (a) and (r)). Once the relocation 
rules sunset, an FSS licensee may require the incumbent to cease 
operations, provided that the FSS licensee intends to turn on a system 
within interference range of the incumbent, as determined by TIA 
Bulletin 10-F or any standard successor. FSS licensee notification to 
the affected FS licensee must be in writing and must provide the 
incumbent with no less than six months to vacate the spectrum. After the 
six-month notice period has expired, the FS licensee must turn its 
license back into the Commission, unless the parties have entered into 
an agreement which allows the FS licensee to continue to operate on a 
mutually agreed upon basis.
    (b) If the parties cannot agree on a schedule or an alternative 
arrangement, requests for extension will be accepted and reviewed on a 
case-by-case basis. The Commission will grant such extensions only if 
the incumbent can demonstrate that:
    (1) It cannot relocate within the six-month period (e.g., because no 
alternative spectrum or other reasonable option is available); and
    (2) The public interest would be harmed if the incumbent is forced 
to terminate operations (e.g., if public safety communications services 
would be disrupted).


<R05>
Sec. 101.97  Future licensing in the 18.58-19.30 GHz band.

    (a) After June 8, 2000, all major modifications and extensions to 
existing FS systems in the 18.58-19.30 band (with the exception of 
certain low power operations authorized under Sec. 101.147(r)(10)) will 
be authorized on a secondary basis to FSS systems. All other 
modifications will render the modified FS license secondary to FSS 
operations, unless the incumbent affirmatively justifies primary status 
and the incumbent FS licensee establishes that the modification would 
not add to the relocation costs for FSS licensees. Incumbent FS 
licensees will maintain primary status for the following technical 
changes:
    (1) Decreases in power;
    (2) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in antenna height;
    (3) Minor location changes (up to two seconds);
    (4) Any data correction which does not involve a change in the 
location of an existing facility;
    (5) Reductions in authorized bandwidth;
    (6) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in structure height;
    (7) Changes (increases or decreases) in ground elevation that do not 
affect centerline height;
    (8) Minor equipment changes.
    (9) Changes in ownership or control.
    (b) The provisions of Sec. 101.83 are applicable, notwithstanding 
any other provisions of this section.

[65 FR 54173, Sept. 7, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 63516, Dec. 7, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 101.99  Reimbursement of relocation expenses in the 2115-2150 MHz and 2165-2200 MHz bands.

    (a) Whenever an ET licensee (including Mobile-Satellite Service 
licensees) in the 2115-2150 MHz or 2165-2200 MHz bands relocates an 
incumbent paired microwave link with one path in the 2115-2150 MHz band, 
and the paired path in the 2165-2200 MHz band, the ET licensee is 
entitled to reimbursement

[[Page 623]]

of 50% of its relocation costs from any subsequently entering ET 
licensee which would have been required to relocate the same fixed 
microwave link.
    (b) The subsequently entering ET licensee must reimburse the 
relocating ET licensee before the subsequently entering licensee may 
begin operations in these bands, unless the subsequently entering ET 
licensee can demonstrate that, according to established interference 
criteria, it would not have interfered with the microwave link in 
question.
    (c) The total costs of which 50% is to be reimbursed will not exceed 
$250,000 per paired fixed microwave link relocated, nor $150,000 if a 
new or modified tower is required.

    (a) Assignment of frequencies will be made only in such a manner as 
to facilitate the rendition of communication service on an interference-
free basis in each service area. Unless otherwise indicated, each 
frequency available for use by stations in these services will be 
assigned exclusively to a single applicant in any service area. All 
applicants for, and licensees of, stations in these services must 
cooperate in the selection and use of the frequencies assigned in order 
to minimize interference and thereby obtain the most effective use of 
the authorized facilities. In the event harmful interference occurs or 
appears likely to occur between two or more radio systems and such 
interference cannot be resolved between the licensees thereof, the 
Commission may specify a time sharing arrangement for the stations 
involved or may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, require the 
licensees to make such changes in operating techniques or equipment as 
it may deem necessary to avoid such interference.
    (b)(1) Operations in the bands 31,000-31,075 MHz and 31,225-31,300 
MHz licensed prior to March 11, 1997, were licensed on an unprotected 
basis and are subject to harmful interference from similarly licensed 
operations in that band.
    (i) Operations licensed in the Local Mulitpoint Distribution Service 
and those operations licensed prior to March 11, 1997, except in the 
Local Television Transmission Service, operating in these bands are 
equally protected against harmful interference from each other.
    (ii) In the case of operations licensed prior to March 11, 1997, 
except in the Local Television Transmission Service, that are licensed 
on a point-to-radius basis, LMDS licensees shall be subject to the 
protection requirement established in this section in the case of 
existing links operated by such licensees, and in the case of links 
added by such licensees in the future in accordance with the terms of 
their point-to-radius licenses.
    (iii) An LMDS licensee may not initiate operations within the point-
to-radius area licensed to an operator (other than an operator in the 
Local Television Transmission Service) prior to March 11, 1997, even if 
such operator has not initiated operations to the fullest extent of the 
license. An LMDS licensee, however, may initiate operations at the 
border of such operator's license area without prior coordination if the 
LMDS licensee's operations would not cause harmful interference to the 
other operator's existing operations.
    (iv) An operator (other than an operator in the Local Television 
Transmission Service) licensed on a point-to-radius basis prior to March 
11, 1997, may add additional stations within its license area. Such 
operator shall coordinate with any affected LMDS licensee if its new 
operations might cause harmful interference to the existing operations 
of such LMDS licensee.
    (v) Operations licensed prior to March 11, 1997, on a point-to-point 
basis may not be extended or otherwise modified through the addition of 
point-to-point links. Such operations shall be limited to the use of 
frequency pairs licensed as of March 11, 1997. Operations licensed in 
the Local Television Transmission Service as of March 11, 1997, may 
continue to operate, but such operators may not expand existing 
operations nor initiate new operations.

[[Page 625]]

    (2) Operations in the 31,075-31,225 MHz band licensed prior to March 
11, 1997, shall receive no protection against harmful interference from 
authorized operations in the Local Multipoint Distribution Service in 
that band.
    (3) Non-LMDS operations in the entire 31,000-31,300 MHz band 
licensed after March 11, 1997, based on applications refiled no later 
than June 26, 1998 are unprotected with respect to each other and 
subject to harmful interference from each other.
    (i) Such operations and any operations licensed prior to March 11, 
1997, in the band are unprotected with respect to each other and subject 
to harmful interference from each other.
    (ii) Such operations are licensed on a secondary basis to LMDS 
operations licensed in the band, may not cause interference to LMDS 
operations, and are not protected from interference from LMDS 
operations.
    (iii) Such operations licensed on a point-to-point basis may not be 
extended or otherwise modified through the addition of point-to-point 
links. Such operations licensed on a point-to-radius basis may add 
additional stations within the licensed area.
    (c) Frequency diversity transmission will not be authorized in these 
services in the absence of a factual showing that the required 
communications cannot practically be achieved by other means. Where 
frequency diversity is deemed to be justified on a protection channel 
basis, it will be limited to one protection channel for the bands 3,700-
4,200, 5925-6425, and 6525-6875 MHz, and a ratio of one protection 
channel for three working channels for the bands 10,550-10,680 and 
10,700-11,700 MHz. In the bands 3,700-4,200, 5,925-6,425, and 6525-6875 
MHz, no frequency diversity protection channel will be authorized unless 
there is a minimum of three working channels, except that where a 
substantial showing is made that a total of three working channels will 
be required within three years, a protection channel may be authorized 
simultaneously with the first working channel. A protection channel 
authorized under such exception will be subject to termination if 
applications for the third working channel are not filed within three 
years of the grant date of the applications for the first working 
channel. Where equipment employing digital modulation techniques with 
cross-polarized operation on the same frequency is used, the protection 
channel authorized under the above conditions may be considered to 
consist of both polarizations of the protection frequency where such is 
shown to be necessary.
    (d) Frequency coordination. For each frequency authorized under this 
part, the following frequency usage coordination procedures will apply:
    (1) General requirements. Proposed frequency usage must be prior 
coordinated with existing licensees, permittees and applicants in the 
area, and other applicants with previously filed applications, whose 
facilities could affect or be affected by the new proposal in terms of 
frequency interference on active channels, applied-for channels, or 
channels coordinated for future growth. Coordination must be completed 
prior to filing an application for regular authorization, or a major 
amendment to a pending application, or any major modification to a 
license. In coordinating frequency usage with stations in the fixed 
satellite service, applicants must also comply with the requirements of 
Sec. 101.21(f). In engineering a system or modification thereto, the 
applicant must, by appropriate studies and analyses, select sites, 
transmitters, antennas and frequencies that will avoid interference in 
excess of permissible levels to other users. All applicants and 
licensees must cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to resolve 
technical problems and conflicts that may inhibit the most effective and 
efficient use of the radio spectrum; however, the party being 
coordinated with is not obligated to suggest changes or re-engineer a 
proposal in cases involving conflicts. Applicants should make every 
reasonable effort to avoid blocking the growth of systems as prior 
coordinated. The applicant must identify in the application all entities 
with which the technical proposal was coordinated. In the event that 
technical problems are not resolved, an explanation must be submitted 
with the application. Where technical problems are resolved by an 
agreement or operating arrangement

[[Page 626]]

between the parties that would require special procedures be taken to 
reduce the likelihood of interference in excess of permissible levels 
(such as the use of artificial site shielding) or would result in a 
reduction of quality or capacity of either system, the details thereof 
may be contained in the application.
    (2) Coordination procedure guidelines are as follows:
    (i) Coordination involves two separate elements: notification and 
response. Both or either may be oral or in written form. To be 
acceptable for filing, all applications and major technical amendments 
must certify that coordination, including response, has been completed. 
The names of the licensees, permittees and applicants with which 
coordination was accomplished must be specified. If such notice and/or 
response is oral, the party providing such notice or response must 
supply written documentation of the communication upon request;
    (ii) Notification must include relevant technical details of the 
proposal. At minimum, this should include, as applicable, the following:

    Applicant's name and address.
    Transmitting station name.
    Transmitting station coordinates.
    Frequencies and polarizations to be added, changed or deleted.
    Transmitting equipment type, its stability, actual output power, 
emission designator, and type of modulation (loading).
    Transmitting antenna type(s), model, gain and, if required, a 
radiation pattern provided or certified by the manufacturer.
    Transmitting antenna center line height(s) above ground level and 
ground elevation above mean sea level.
    Receiving station name.
    Receiving station coordinates.
    Receiving antenna type(s), model, gain, and, if required, a 
radiation pattern provided or certified by the manufacturer.
    Receiving antenna center line height(s) above ground level and 
ground elevation above mean sea level.
    Path azimuth and distance.
    Estimated transmitter transmission line loss expressed in dB.
    Estimated receiver transmission line loss expressed in dB.
    For a system utilizing ATPC, maximum transmit power, coordinated 
transmit power, and nominal transmit power.

    Note: The position location of antenna sites shall be determined to 
an accuracy of no less than <plus-minus>1 second in the horizontal 
dimensions (latitude and longitude) and <plus-minus>1 meter in the 
vertical dimension (ground elevation) with respect to the National 
Spacial Reference System.

    (iii) For transmitters employing digital modulation techniques, the 
notification should clearly identify the type of modulation. Upon 
request, additional details of the operating characteristics of the 
equipment must also be furnished;
    (iv) Response to notification should be made as quickly as possible, 
even if no technical problems are anticipated. Any response to 
notification indicating potential interference must specify the 
technical details and must be provided to the applicant, in writing, 
within the 30-day notification period. Every reasonable effort should be 
made by all applicants, permittees and licensees to eliminate all 
problems and conflicts. If no response to notification is received 
within 30 days, the applicant will be deemed to have made reasonable 
efforts to coordinate and may file its application without a response;
    (v) The 30-day notification period is calculated from the date of 
receipt by the applicant, permittee, or licensee being notified. If 
notification is by mail, this date may be ascertained by:
    (A) The return receipt on certified mail;
    (B) The enclosure of a card to be dated and returned by the 
recipient; or
    (C) A conservative estimate of the time required for the mail to 
reach its destination. In the last case, the estimated date when the 30-
day period would expire should be stated in the notification.
    (vi) An expedited prior coordination period (less than 30 days) may 
be requested when deemed necessary by a notifying party. The 
coordination notice should be identified as ``expedited'' and the 
requested response date should be clearly indicated. However, 
circumstances preventing a timely response from the receiving party 
should be accommodated accordingly. It is the responsibility of the 
notifying party to receive written concurrence (or verbal, with written 
to follow) from affected parties or their coordination representatives.
    (vii) All technical problems that come to light during coordination 
must

[[Page 627]]

be resolved unless a statement is included with the application to the 
effect that the applicant is unable or unwilling to resolve the conflict 
and briefly the reason therefor;
    (viii) Where a number of technical changes become necessary for a 
system during the course of coordination, an attempt should be made to 
minimize the number of separate notifications for these changes. Where 
the changes are incorporated into a completely revised notice, the items 
that were changed from the previous notice should be identified. When 
changes are not numerous or complex, the party receiving the changed 
notification should make an effort to respond in less than 30 days. When 
the notifying party believes a shorter response time is reasonable and 
appropriate, it may be helpful for that party to so indicate in the 
notice and perhaps suggest a response date;
    (ix) If, after coordination is successfully completed, it is 
determined that a subsequent change could have no impact on some parties 
receiving the original notification, these parties must be notified of 
the change and of the coordinator's opinion that no response is 
required;
    (x) Applicants, permittees and licensees should supply to all other 
applicants, permittees and licensees within their areas of operations, 
the name, address and telephone number of their coordination 
representatives. Upon request from coordinating applicants, permittees 
and licensees, data and information concerning existing or proposed 
facilities and future growth plans in the area of interest should be 
furnished unless such request is unreasonable or would impose a 
significant burden in compilation;
    (xi) Parties should keep other parties with whom they are 
coordinating advised of changes in plans for facilities previously 
coordinated. If applications have not been filed 6 months after 
coordination was initiated, parties may assume that such frequency use 
is no longer desired unless a second notification has been received 
within 10 days of the end of the 6 month period. Renewal notifications 
are to be sent to all originally notified parties, even if coordination 
has not been successfully completed with those parties; and
    (xii) Any frequency reserved by a licensee for future use in the 
bands subject to this part must be released for use by another licensee, 
permittee or applicant upon a showing by the latter that it requires an 
additional frequency and cannot coordinate one that is not reserved for 
future use.
    (e) Where frequency conflicts arise between co-pending applications 
in the Private Operational Fixed Point-to-Point Microwave, Common 
Carrier Fixed Point-to-Point Microwave and Local Television Transmission 
Services, it is the obligation of the later filing applicant to amend 
his application to remove the conflict, unless it can make a showing 
that the conflict cannot be reasonably eliminated. Where a frequency 
conflict is not resolved and no showing is submitted as to why the 
conflict cannot be resolved, the Commission may grant the first filed 
application and dismiss the later filed application(s) after giving the 
later filing applicant(s) 30 days to respond to the proposed action.
    (f) (1) Coordination and information sharing between MVDDS and NGSO 
FSS licensees in the 12.2 GHz to 12.7 GHz band. Prior to the 
construction or addition of an MVDDS transmitting antenna in this 
frequency band, the MVDDS licensee shall provide notice of intent to 
construct the proposed antenna site to NGSO FSS licensees operating in 
the 12.2-12.7 GHz frequency band and maintain an Internet web site of 
all existing transmitting sites and transmitting antennas that are 
scheduled for operation within one year including the ``in service'' 
dates. In addition to the location of a proposed new transmitting 
antenna, MVDDS licensees shall provide to the NGSO FSS licensees a 
technical description of the operating characteristics of the proposed 
transmission facility. At a minimum, the following information must be 
included in each notification:
    (i) Name of MVDDS licensee;
    (ii) Geographic location (including NAD83 coordinates) of proposed 
MVDDS transmitting antenna;
    (iii) Maximum EIRP per 24 MHz;
    (iv) Height above average terrain of the transmitting antenna;

[[Page 628]]

    (v) Type of antenna to be utilized;
    (vi) Main beam azimuth and altitude orientation for the proposed 
transmitting antenna;
    (vii) Theoretically modeled antenna radiation pattern;
    (viii) Type(s) of emissions, and;
    (ix) Description of the proposed service area.
    (2) If the proposed MVDDS antenna site does not meet the minimum 
spacing requirements on the date of original notification or on 
subsequent annual anniversary dates of non-operation as set forth in 
Sec. 101.129, then the MVDDS licensee shall not construct the proposed 
transmission facility unless all NGSO FSS licensees having active 
subscribers within the minimum separation distance agree to a shorter 
spacing. Nothing in this section shall preclude MVDDS and NGSO FSS 
licensees from agreeing to accept the siting of new MVDDS transmitting 
antennas that do no meet the minimum distance set forth in Sec. 101.129. 
Incumbent point-to-point licensees' (those not licensed as MVDDS) 
facilities are to be operated in the band 12,200-12,700 MHz following 
the procedures, technical standards, and requirements of Sec. 101.105 in 
order to protect stations providing Direct Broadcast Satellite Service.
    (g) Licensees operating in Basic Trading Areas authorized in the 
Local Multipoint Distribution Service. (1) When the transmitting 
facilities in a Basic Trading Area (BTA) are to be operated in the bands 
27,500-28,350 MHz; 29,100-29,250 MHz; and 31,000-31,300 MHz and the 
facilities are located within 20 kilometers of the boundaries of a BTA, 
each licensee must complete the frequency coordination process of 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section with respect to neighboring BTA 
licensees that may be affected by its operations prior to initiating 
service. In addition, all licensed transmitting facilities operating in 
the bands 31,000-31,075 MHz and 31,225-31,300 MHz and located within 20 
kilometers of neighboring facilities must complete the frequency 
coordination process of paragraph (d)(2) of this section with respect to 
such authorized operations before initiating service.
    (2) Response to notification should be made as quickly as possible, 
even if no technical problems are anticipated. Any response to 
notification indicating potential interference must specify the 
technical details and must be provided to the applicant, either 
electronically or in writing, within the 30-day notification period. 
Every reasonable effort should be made by all licensees to eliminate all 
problems and conflicts. If no response to notification is received 
within 30 days, the licensee will be deemed to have made reasonable 
efforts to coordinate and commence operation without a response. The 
beginning of the 30-day period is determined pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(2)(v) of this section.
    (h) Special requirements for operations in the band 29,100-29,250 
MHz. (1)(i) Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) receive 
stations operating on frequencies in the 29,100-29,250 MHz band within a 
radius of 75 nautical miles of the geographic coordinates provided by a 
non-GSO-MSS licensee pursuant to Sec. 101.113(c)(2) or (c)(3)(i) (the 
``feeder link earth station complex protection zone'') shall accept any 
interference caused to them by such earth station complexes and shall 
not claim protection from such earth station complexes.
    (ii) LMDS licensees operating on frequencies in the 29,100-29,250 
MHz band outside a feeder link earth station complex protection zone 
shall cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to resolve technical 
problems with the non-GSO MSS licensee to the extent that transmissions 
from the non-GSO MSS operator's feeder link earth station complex 
interfere with an LMDS receive station.
    (2) No more than 15 days after the release of a public notice 
announcing the commencement of LMDS auctions, feeder link earth station 
complexes to be licensed pursuant to Sec. 25.257 of this chapter shall 
be specified by a set of geographic coordinates in accordance with the 
following requirements: no feeder link earth station complex may be 
located in the top eight (8) metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), 
ranked by population, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget 
as of June 1993, using estimated populations as of December 1992; two 
(2) complexes may be located in MSAs 9 through 25,

[[Page 629]]

one of which must be Phoenix, AZ (for a complex at Chandler, AZ); two 
(2) complexes may be located in MSAs 26 to 50; three (3) complexes may 
be located in MSAs 51 to 100, one of which must be Honolulu, Hawaii (for 
a complex at Waimea); and the three (3) remaining complexes must be 
located at least 75 nautical miles from the borders of the 100 largest 
MSAs or in any MSA not included in the 100 largest MSAs. Any location 
allotted for one range of MSAs may be taken from an MSA below that 
range.
    (3)(i) Any non-GSO MSS licensee may at any time specify sets of 
geographic coordinates for feeder link earth station complexes with each 
earth station contained therein to be located at least 75 nautical miles 
from the border of the 100 largest MSAs.
    (ii) For purposes of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, non-GSO 
MSS feeder link earth station complexes shall be entitled to 
accommodation only if the affected non-GSO MSS licensee preapplies to 
the Commission for a feeder link earth station complex or certifies to 
the Commission within sixty days of receiving a copy of an LMDS 
application that it intends to file an application for a feeder link 
earth station complex within six months of the date of receipt of the 
LMDS application.
    (iii) If said non-GSO MSS licensee application is filed later than 
six months after certification of the Commission, the LMDS and non-GSO 
MSS entities shall still cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to 
resolve technical problems, but the LMDS licensee shall not be obligated 
to re-engineer its proposal or make changes to its system.
    (4) LMDS licensees or applicants proposing to operate hub stations 
on frequencies in the 29,100-29,250 MHz band at locations outside of the 
100 largest MSAs or within a distance of 150 nautical miles from a set 
of geographic coordinates specified under paragraphs (h)(2) or (h)(3)(i) 
of this section shall serve copies of their applications on all non-GSO 
MSS applicants, permittees or licensees meeting the criteria specified 
in Sec. 25.257(a). Non-GSO MSS licensees or applicants shall serve 
copies of their feeder link earth station applications, after the LMDS 
auction, on any LMDS applicant or licensee within a distance of 150 
nautical miles from the geographic coordinates that it specified under 
Sec. 101.113(c)(2) or (c)(3)(i). Any necessary coordination shall 
commence upon notification by the party receiving an application to the 
party who filed the application. The results of any such coordination 
shall be reported to the Commission within sixty days. The non-GSO MSS 
earth station licensee shall also provide all such LMDS licensees with a 
copy of its channel plan.
    (i)(1) When the licensed facilities are to be operated in the band 
38,600 MHz to 40,000 MHz and the facilities are located within 16 
kilometers of the boundaries of an Economic Area, each licensee must 
complete the frequency coordination process of subsection 101.103(d) 
with respect to neighboring EA licensees and existing licensees within 
its EA service area that may be affected by its operation prior to 
initiating service. In addition to the technical parameters listed in 
subsection 101.103(d), the coordinating licensee must also provide 
potentially affected parties technical information related to its 
subchannelization plan and system geometry.
    (2) Response to notification should be made as quickly as possible, 
even if no technical problems are anticipated. Any response to 
notification indicating potential interference must specify the 
technical details and must be provided to the licensee, either 
electronically or in writing, within 10 days of notification. Every 
reasonable effort should be made by all licensees to eliminate all 
problems and conflicts. If no response to notification is received 
within 10 days, the licensee will be deemed to have made reasonable 
efforts to coordinate and may commence operation without a response. The 
beginning of the 10-day period is determined pursuant to 
Sec. 101.103(d)(v).

<R05>
Sec. 101.105  Interference protection criteria.

    (a) The interference protection criteria for fixed stations subject 
to this part are as follows:
    (1) To long-haul analog systems, employing frequency modulated radio 
and frequency division multiplexing to provide multiple voice channels, 
the allowable interference level per exposure:
    (i) Due to co-channel sideband-to-sideband interference must not 
exceed 5 pwpO (Picowatts of absolute noise power psophometrically 
weighted (pwpO), appearing in an equivalent voice band channel of 300-
3400 Hz); or
    (ii) Due to co-channel carrier-beat interference must not exceed 50 
pwpO.
    (2) To short-haul analog systems employing frequency modulated radio 
and frequency division multiplexing to provide multiple voice channels, 
the allowable interference level per exposure:
    (i) Due to co-channel sideband-to-sideband interference must not 
exceed 25 pwpO except in the 952-960 MHz band interference into single 
link fixed relay and control stations must not exceed 250 pwpO per 
exposure; or
    (ii) Due to co-channel carrier-beat interference must not exceed 50 
pwpO except in the 952-960 MHz band interference into single link fixed 
relay and control stations must not exceed 1000 pwpO per exposure.
    (3) FM-TV. In analog systems employing frequency modulated radio 
that is modulated by a standard, television (visual) signal, the 
allowable interference level per exposure may not exceed the levels 
which would apply to long-haul or short-haul FM-FDM systems, as outlined 
in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, having a 600-1200 voice 
channel capacity.
    (4) 12.2-12.7 GHz band. (i) To accommodate co-primary NGSO FSS earth 
stations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, the PFD of an MVDDS transmitting 
system must not exceed -135 dBW/m\2\ in any 4 kHz band at a reference 
point at the surface of the earth at a distance of 3 kilometers from the 
MVDDS transmitting antenna.
    (ii) To accommodate co-primary Direct Broadcast Satellite Service 
earth stations, an MVDDS transmitting system must not exceed the EPFD 
levels specified in the appropriate region below at any DBS subscriber 
location in accordance with the procedures listed in Sec. 101.1440.
    (A) 168.4 dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP>/4kHz in the Eastern region consisting of 
the following states: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, 
Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, 
Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, 
South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Florida.
    (B) 169.8 dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP>/4kHz in the Midwestern region consisting 
of the following states: Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, 
Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, 
Oklahoma, and Texas.
    (C) 171.0 dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP>/4kHz in the Southwestern region 
consisting of the following states: Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, 
Arizona, Nevada, and California (south of 37 deg. North Latitude).
    (D) 172.1 dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP>/4kHz in the Northwestern region 
consisting of the following states: Washington, Oregon, California 
(north of 37 deg. North Latitude), Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Alaska, 
and Hawaii.
    (iii) Except for public safety entities, harmful interference 
protection from MVDDS stations to incumbent point-to-point 12 GHz fixed 
stations is not required. Incumbent point-to-point private operational 
fixed 12 GHz stations, except for public safety entities, are required 
to protect MVDDS stations under the process described in 
Sec. 101.103(d).
    (5) All stations operating under this part must protect the radio 
quiet zones as required by Sec. 1.924 of this chapter. Stations 
authorized by competitive bidding are cautioned that they must receive 
the appropriate approvals directly from the relevant quiet zone entity 
prior to operating.
    (b) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section 
the adjacent channel interference protection criteria to be afforded, 
regardless of system length, or type of modulation,

[[Page 631]]

multiplexing, or frequency band, must be such that the interfering 
signal does not produce more than 1.0 dB degradation of the practical 
threshold of the protected receiver. The ``practical threshold'' of the 
protected receiver can be based upon the definition in TSB 10, 
referenced in paragraph (c) of this section, or upon alternative 
generally acceptable good engineering standards.
    (c) Applying the criteria. (1) Guidelines for applying the 
interference protection criteria for fixed stations subject to this part 
are specified in the Telecommunications Industry Association's 
Telecommunications Systems Bulletin TSB 10, ``Interference Criteria for 
Microwave Systems'' (TSB 10). Other procedures that follow generally 
acceptable good engineering practices are also acceptable to the 
Commission.
    (2) If TSB 10 guidelines cannot be used, the following interference 
protection criteria may be used by calculating the ratio in dB between 
the desired (carrier signal) and the undesired (interfering) signal (C/I 
ratio) appearing at the input to the receiver under investigation 
(victim receiver). Except as provided in Sec. 101.147 where the 
applicant's proposed facilities are of a type not included in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section or where the development of the carrier-to-
interference (C/I) ratio is not covered by generally acceptable 
procedures, or where the applicant does not wish to develop the carrier-
to-interference ratio, the applicant must, in the absence of criteria or 
a developed C/I ratio, employ the following C/I protection ratios:
    (i) Co-channel interference. Both sideband and carrier-beat, 
applicable to all bands; the existing or previously authorized system 
must be afforded a carrier to interfering signal protection ratio of at 
least 90 dB except in the 952-960 MHz band where it must be 75 dB; or
    (ii) Adjacent channel interference. Applicable to all bands; the 
existing or previously authorized system must be afforded a carrier to 
interfering signal protection ratio of at least 56 dB.
    (3) Applicants for frequencies listed in Sec. 101.147(b)(1) through 
(4) must make the following showings that protection criteria have been 
met over the entire service area of existing systems. Such showings may 
be made by the applicant or may be satisfied by a statement from a 
frequency coordinator.
    (i) For site-based multiple address stations in the 928-929/952-960 
MHz and the 932-932.5/941-941.5 MHz bands, a statement that the proposed 
system complies with the following co-channel separations from all 
existing stations and pending applications:


Fixed-to-fixed--145 km;

Fixed-to-mobile--113 km;

Mobile-to-mobile--81 km
    Note to paragraph (c)(3)(i):
    Multiple address systems employing only remote stations will be 
treated as mobile for the purposes of determining the appropriate 
separation. For mobile operation, the mileage is measured from the 
reference point specified on the license application. For fixed 
operation on subfrequencies in accordance with Sec. 101.147 the mileage 
also is measured from the reference point specified on the license 
application.
    (ii) In cases where the geographic separation standard in paragraph 
(c)(3)(i) of this section is not followed, an engineering analysis must 
be submitted to show the coordination of the proposed assignment with 
existing systems located closer than those standards. The engineering 
analyses will include:
    (A) Specification of the interference criteria and system parameters 
used in the interference study;
    (B) Nominal service areas of each system included in the 
interference analysis;
    (C) Modified service areas resulting from the proposed system. The 
propagation models used to establish the service boundary limits must be 
specified and any special terrain features considered in computing the 
interference impact should be described; and
    (D) A statement that all parties affected have agreed to the 
engineering analysis and will accept the calculated levels of 
interference.
    (iii) MAS EA licensees shall provide protection in accordance with 
Sec. 101.1333.
    (4) Multiple address systems operating on subfrequencies in 
accordance with Sec. 101.147 that propose to operate master stations at 
unspecified locations must define the operating area by

[[Page 632]]

a radius about a geographical coordinate and describe how interference 
to co-channel users will be controlled.
    (5) Multiple address frequencies in the 956.25-956.45 MHz bands may 
be assigned for use by mobile master stations on a primary basis. 
Multiple address frequencies in the 941.0-941.5 MHz bands that are 
licensed on a site-by-site basis and the 952 MHz bands may be assigned 
for use by primary mobile master stations on a case-by-case basis if the 
956.25-956.45 MHz frequencies are unavailable. Multiple address mobile 
(master and remote) operation is permitted on frequencies licensed by 
geographic area subject to the interference protection criteria set 
forth in Sec. 101.1333, i.e., adjacent channel site-based licensees and 
co-channel operations in adjacent EAs. Mobile operation in the 959.85-
960 MHz band is not permitted.
    (6) Each application for new or modified nodal station on channels 
numbered 4A, 4B, 7, 9, and 19/20 in the 10.6 GHz band must demonstrate 
that all existing co-channel stations are at least 56 kilometers from 
the proposed nodal station site. Applicants for these channels must 
certify that all licensees and applicants for stations on the adjacent 
channels within 56 kilometers of the proposed nodal station have been 
notified of the proposed station and do not object. Alternatively, or if 
one of the affected adjacent channel interests does object, the 
applicant may show that all affected adjacent channel parties are 
provided a C/I protection ratio of 0 dB. An applicant proposing to 
operate at an AAT greater than 91 meters must reduce its EIRP in 
accordance with the following table; however, in no case may EIRP exceed 
70 dBm on the 10.6 GHz channels:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         AAT (meters)                           EIRP dBm

101 to 150...................................................         55
100 and below................................................         85
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (7) Each application for new or modified nodal station on channels 
numbered 21, 22, 23, and 24 in the 10.6 GHz band must include an 
analysis of the potential for harmful interference to all other licensed 
and previously applied for co-channel and adjacent channel stations 
located within 80 kilometers of the location of the proposed station. 
The criteria contained in Sec. 101.103(d)(2) must be used in this 
analysis. Applicants must certify that copies of this analysis have been 
served on all parties which might reasonably be expected to receive 
interference above the levels set out in Sec. 101.103(d)(2) within 5 
days of the date the subject application is filed with the Commission.
    (8) If the potential interference will exceed the prescribed limits, 
a statement shall be submitted with the application for new or modified 
stations to the effect that all parties have agreed to accept the higher 
level of interference.
    (d) Effective August 1, 1985, when a fixed station that conforms to 
the technical standards of this subpart (or, in the case of the 12,200-
12,700 MHz band, a direct broadcast satellite station) receives or will 
receive interference in excess of the levels specified in this section 
as a result of an existing licensee's use of non-conforming equipment 
authorized between July 20, 1961 and July 1, 1976, and the interference 
would not result if the interfering station's equipment complied with 
the current technical standards, the licensee of the non-conforming 
station must take whatever steps are necessary to correct the situation 
up to the point of installing equipment which fully conforms to the 
technical standards of this subpart. In such cases, if the engineering 
analysis demonstrates that:
    (1) The conforming station would receive interference from a non-
conforming station in excess of the levels specified in this section; 
and
    (2) The interference would be eliminated if the non-conforming 
equipment were replaced with equipment which complies with the standards 
of this subpart, the licensee (or prospective licensee) of the station 
which would receive interference must provide written notice of the 
potential interference to both the non-conforming licensee and the 
Commission's office in Gettysburg, PA. The non-conforming licensee must 
make all required equipment changes within 180 days from the date

[[Page 633]]

of official Commission notice informing the licensee that it must 
upgrade its equipment, unless an alternative solution has been agreed to 
by all parties involved in the interference situation. If a non-
conforming licensee fails to make all required changes within the 
specified period of time, the Commission may require the licensee to 
suspend operation until the changes are completed.
    (e) Interference dispute resolution procedures. Should a licensee 
licensed under this part receive harmful interference from another 
licensee licensed under this chapter, the parties involved shall comply 
with the dispute resolution procedures set forth herein:
    (1) The licensee experiencing the harmful interference shall notify 
the licensee believed to be causing the harmful interference and shall 
supply information describing its problem and supporting its claim;
    (2) Upon receipt of the harmful interference notice, the licensee 
alleged to be causing the harmful interference shall respond immediately 
and make every reasonable effort to identify and resolve the conflict; 
and
    (3) Licensees are encouraged to resolve the harmful interference 
prior to contacting the Commission.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Applicable only to common carrier LTTS stations. Beginning Aug. 9,
  1975, this tolerance will govern the marketing of LTTS equipment and
  the issuance of all such authorizations for new radio equipment. Until
  that date new equipment may be authorized with a frequency tolerance
  of .03 percent in the frequency range 2,200 to 10,500 MHz and .05
  percent in the range 10,500 MHz to 12,200 MHz, and equipment so
  authorized may continue to be used for its life provided that it does
  not cause interference to the operation of any other licensee.
\2\ Equipment authorized to be operated on frequencies between 890 and
  940 MHz as of Oct. 15, 1956, must maintain a frequency tolerance
  within 0.03 percent subject to the condition that no harmful
  interference is caused to any other radio station.
\3\ See subpart G of this part for the stability requirements for
  transmitters used in the Digital Electronic Message Service.
\4\ Existing authorized equipment with a frequency tolerance of <plus-
  minus>0.03% may be marketed until December 1, 1988. Equipment
  installed and operated prior to December 1, 1988 may continue to
  operate after that date with a minimum frequency tolerance of <plus-
  minus>0.03%. However, the replacement of equipment requires that the
  <plus-minus>0.003% tolerance be met.
(5) Used for remote stations. For remotes with 12.5 KHz bandwidth or
  less, the tolerance is <plus-minus>0.00015%. Remote mobiles are only
  allowed in the portion of the 932-932.5 MHz band that is licensed by
  geographic area.
\6\ Applicable to private operations fixed point-to-point microwave
  stations and stations providing MVDDS service.
(7) For private operational fixed point-to-point microwave systems, with
  a channel greater than or equal to 50 KHz bandwidth, <plus-
  minus>0.0005%; for multiple address master stations, regardless of
  bandwidth, <plus-minus>0.00015%; for multiple address remote stations
  with 12.5 KHz bandwidths or less, <plus-minus>0.00015%; for multiple
  address remote stations with channels greater than 12.5 KHz bandwidth,
  <plus-minus>0.0005%.
\8\ For stations authorized prior to March 11, 1997, and for non-Local
  Multipoint Distribution Service stations authorized pursuant to
  applications refiled no later than June 26, 1998, the transmitter
  frequency tolerance shall not exceed 0.030 percent.
\9\ Equipment authorized to be operated in the 38,600-40,000 MHz band is
  exempt from the frequency tolerance requirement noted in the above
  table.

    (b) Heterodyne microwave radio systems may be authorized at a 
somewhat less restrictive frequency tolerance (up to .01 percent) to 
compensate for frequency shift caused by numerous repeaters between base 
band signal insertion. Where such relaxation is sought,

[[Page 634]]

applicant must provide all calculations and indicate the desired 
tolerance over each path. In such instances the radio transmitters and 
receivers used must individually be capable of complying with the 
tolerance specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Heterodyne 
operation is restricted to channel bandwidth of 10 MHz or greater.
    (c) As an additional requirement in any band where the Commission 
makes assignments according to a specified channel plan, provisions must 
be made to prevent the emission included within the occupied bandwidth 
from radiating outside the assigned channel at a level greater than that 
specified in Sec. 101.111.

Sec. 101.109  Bandwidth.

    (a) Each authorization issued pursuant to these rules will show, as 
the emission designator, a symbol representing the class of emission 
which must be prefixed by a number specifying the necessary bandwidth. 
This figure does not necessarily indicate the bandwidth actually 
occupied by the emission at any instant. In those cases where part 2 of 
this chapter does not provide a formula for the computation of the 
necessary bandwidth, the occupied bandwidth may be used in the emission 
designator.
    (b) Stations in this service will be authorized any type of 
emission, method of modulation, and transmission characteristic, 
consistent with efficient use of the spectrum and good engineering 
practice, except that Type B, damped-wave emission will not be 
authorized.
    (c) The maximum bandwidth which will be authorized per frequency 
assigned is set out in the table that follows. Regardless of the maximum 
authorized bandwidth specified for each frequency band, the Commission 
reserves the right to issue a license for less than the maximum 
bandwidth if it appears that a lesser bandwidth would be sufficient to 
support an applicant's intended communications.

Sec. 101.111  Emission limitations.

    (a) The mean power of emissions must be attenuated below the mean 
output power of the transmitter in accordance with the following 
schedule:
    (1) When using transmissions other than those employing digital 
modulation techniques:
    (i) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 50 percent up to and including 100 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth: At least 25 decibels;
    (ii) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 100 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth: At least 35 decibels;
    (iii) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 43+10 
Log<INF>10</INF> (mean output power in watts) decibels, or 80 decibels, 
whichever is the lesser attenuation.
    (2) When using transmissions employing digital modulation techniques 
(see Sec. 101.141(b)) in situations not covered in this section:
    (i) For operating frequencies below 15 GHz, in any 4 KHz band, the 
center frequency of which is removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 50 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth: As specified by the following equation but in no event less 
than 50 decibels:

A = 35 + 0.8(P - 50) + 10 Log<INF>10</INF> B. (Attenuation greater than 
    80 decibels is not required.)

where:

A = Attenuation (in decibels) below the mean output power level.
P = Percent removed from the carrier frequency.
B = Authorized bandwidth in MHz. MVDDS operations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz 
band shall use 24 megahertz for the value of B in the emission mask 
equation set forth in this section.

    (ii) For operating frequencies above 15 GHz, in any 1 MHz band, the 
center frequency of which is removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 50 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth: As specified by the following equation but in no event less 
than 11 decibels:

A = 11 + 0.4(P - 50) + 10 Log<INF>10</INF> B. (Attenuation greater than 
    56 decibels is not required.)

from the assigned frequency by more than 250 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth: At least 43+10 Log<INF>10</INF> (mean output power in watts)

    (iv) The emission mask for 24 GHz Service used the equation in 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section applies only to the edge of each 
channel, but not to subchannels established by licensees. The value of P 
in the equation is for the percentage removed from the carrier frequency 
and assumes that the carrier frequency is the center of the actual 
bandwidth used. The emission mask can be satisfied by locating a carrier 
of the subchannel sufficiently far from the channel edges so that the 
emission levels of the mask are satisfied. The 24 GHz emission mask 
shall use a value B (bandwidth) of 40 MHz, for all cases even in the 
case where a narrower subchannel is used (for instance the actual 
bandwidth is 10 MHz) and the mean output power used in the calculation 
is the sum of the output power of a fully populated channel.

Electronic Message Service (DEMS) operating in the 10,550-10,680 MHz

the edge of the DEMS channel by up to and including 1.125 times the DEMS 
subchannel bandwidth: As specified by the following equation may in no 
event be less than 50+10 log<INF>10</INF> N decibels:

A = 50 + 0.0333(F - 0.5B) + 10 log<INF>10</INF> N decibels

Where:

A = Attenuation (in decibels) below means output power level contained 
within the DEMS channel for a given polarization.
B = Bandwidth of DEMS channel (in KHz).
F = Absolute value of the difference between the center frequency of the 
4 KHz band measured and the center frequency of the DEMS channel (in

equation but in no event less than 80 decibels:

A = 80 + 10 log<INF>10</INF> N decibels

    (iii) In any 4 KHz band the center frequency of which is outside the 
authorized DEMS band: At least 43+10 log<INF>10</INF> (mean output power 
in watts) decibels.
    (4) For DEMS channels in the 17,700-19,700 MHz band:

the frequency of the center of the DEMS channel by more than 50 percent 
of the DEMS channel bandwidth up to and including 50 percent plus 500 
KHz: As specified by the following equation but in no event be less than 
50+10 log<INF>10</INF> N decibels:

A = Attenuation (in decibels) below means output power level contained 
within the DEMS channel for a given polarization.
B = Bandwidth of DEMS channel (in KHz).
F = Absolute value of the difference between the center frequency of the 
4 KHz band measured and the center frequency of the DEMS channel (in 
KHz).
N = Number of active subchannels of the given polarization within the 
DEMS channel.

    (ii) In any 4 KHz band within the authorized DEMS band, the center 
frequency of which is removed from the center frequency of the DEMS 
channel by more than the sum of 50 percent of the channel bandwidth plus 
500 KHz: As specified by the following equation but in no event less 
than 80 decibels:

A=80+10 log<INF>10</INF> N decibels

    (iii) In any 4 KHz band the center frequency of which is outside the 
authorized Digital Message Service band: At least 43+10 log<INF>10</INF> 
(mean output power in watts) decibels.
    (5) When using transmissions employing digital modulation techniques 
on the 900 MHz multiple address frequencies with a 12.5 KHz bandwidth, 
the power of any emission must be attenuated below the unmodulated

Sec. 101.113  Transmitter power limitations.

    (a) On any authorized frequency, the average power delivered to an 
antenna in this service must be the minimum amount of power necessary to 
carry out the communications desired. Application of this principle 
includes, but is not to be limited to, requiring a licensee who replaces 
one or more of its antennas with larger antennas to reduce its antenna 
input power by an amount appropriate to compensate for the increased 
primary lobe gain of the replacement antenna(s). In no event shall the 
average equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP), as referenced to 
an isotropic radiator, exceed the values specified below. In cases of 
harmful interference, the Commission may, after notice and opportunity 
for hearing, order a change in the effective radiated power of this 
station. Further, the output power of a transmitter on any authorized 
frequency in this service may not exceed the following:

Sec. 101.115  Directional antennas.

    (a) Unless otherwise authorized upon specific request by the 
applicant, each station authorized under the rules of this part must 
employ a directional antenna adjusted with the center of the major lobe 
of radiation in the horizontal plane directed toward the receiving 
station with which it communicates: provided, however, where a station 
communicates with more than one point, a multi- or omni-directional 
antenna may be authorized if necessary. New Periscope antenna systems 
will not, under ordinary circumstances, be authorized.
    (b) Stations operating below 932.5 MHz that are required to use 
directional antennas must employ antennas meeting the standards 
indicated below. (Maximum beamwidth is for the major lobe of radiation 
at the half power points. Suppression is the minimum attenuation 
required for any secondary lobe signal and is referenced to the maximum 
signal in the main lobe.)

nodal stations) operating at 932.5 MHz or higher must employ 
transmitting and receiving antennas (excluding second receiving antennas 
for operations such as space diversity) meeting the appropriate 
performance Standard A indicated below, except that in areas not subject 
to frequency congestion, antennas meeting performance Standard B may be 
used, subject to the requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this 
section. Licensees shall comply with the antenna standards table shown 
in this paragraph in the following manner:
    (1) With either the maximum beamwidth to 3 dB points requirement or 
with the minimum antenna gain requirement; and
    (2) With the minimum radiation suppression to angle requirement.

\1\ If a licensee chooses to show compliance using maximum beamwidth to 3 dB points, the beamwidth limit shall apply in both the azimuth and the
  elevation planes.
\2\ Except for Multiple Address System frequencies listed in Secs.  101.147(b)(1) through (b)(4), where omnidirectional antennas may be used.
\3\ Antennas used at outlying stations as part of a central protection alarm system need conform to only the following 2 standards:
(i) The minimum on-beam forward gain must be at least 10 dBi, and
(ii) The minimum front-to-back ratio must be at least 20 dB.
\4\ Omnidirectional antennas may be authorized in the band 2150-2160 MHz.
\5\ These antenna standards apply to all point-to-point stations authorized after June 1, 1997. Existing licensees and pending applicants on that date
  are grandfathered and need not comply with these standards.
\6\ These antenna standards apply to all point-to-point stations authorized on or before June 1, 1997.
\7\ Except for antennas between 140 deg. and 180 deg. authorized or pending on January 1, 1989, in the band 10,550 to 10,565 MHz for which minimum
  radiation suppression to angle (in degrees) from centerline of main beam is 36 decibels.
\8\ These antenna standards apply only to DEMS User Stations licensed, in operation, or applied for prior to July 15, 1993.
\9\ Except for Temporary-fixed operations in the band 13200-13250 MHz with output powers less than 250 mW and as provided in Sec.  101.147(q), and
  except for antennas in the MVDDS service in the band 12.2-12.7 GHz.
\10\ DEMS User Station antennas in this band must meet performance Standard B and have a minimum antenna gain of 34 dBi. The maximum beamwidth
  requirement does not apply to DEMS User Stations. DEMS Nodal Stations need not comply with these standards. Stations authorized to operate in the
  24,250-25,250 MHz band do not have to meet these standards, however, the Commission may require the use of higher performance antennas where
  interference problems can be resolved by the use of such antennas.
\11\ Except as provided in Sec.  101.147(s).
\12\ The minimum front-to-back ratio shall be 38 dBi.
\13\ Mobile, except aeronautical mobile, stations need not comply with these standards.
\14\ Stations authorized to operate in the 38,600-40,000 MHz band may use antennas other than those meeting the Category A standard. However, the
  Commission may require the use of higher performance antennas where interference problems can be resolved by the use of such antennas.

    (d) The Commission shall require the replacement of any antenna or 
periscope antenna system of a permanent fixed station operating at 932.5 
MHz or

[[Page 641]]

higher that does not meet performance Standard A specified in paragraph 
(c) of this section, at the expense of the licensee operating such 
antenna, upon a showing that said antenna causes or is likely to cause 
interference to (or receive interference from) any other authorized or 
applied for station whereas a higher performance antenna is not likely 
to involve such interference. Antenna performance is expected to meet 
the standards of paragraph (c) of this section for parallel 
polarization. For cases of potential interference, an antenna will not 
be considered to meet Standard A unless the parallel polarization 
performance for the discrimination angle involved meets the 
requirements, even if the cross-polarization performance controls the 
interference.
    (e) In cases where passive reflectors are employed in conjunction 
with transmitting antenna systems, the foregoing paragraphs of this 
section also will be applicable. However, in such instances, the center 
of the major lobe of radiation from the antenna normally must be 
directed at the passive reflector, and the center of the major lobe of 
radiation from the passive reflector directed toward the receiving 
station with which it communicates.
    (f) Periscope antennas used at an electric power facility plant area 
will be excluded from the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section 
on a case-by-case basis where technical considerations or safety 
preclude the use of other types of antenna systems.
    (g) In the event harmful interference is caused to the operation of 
other stations, the Commission may, after notice and opportunity for 
hearing, order changes to be made in the height, orientation, gain and 
radiation pattern of the antenna system.

Sec. 101.117  Antenna polarization.

    Except as set forth herein, stations operating in the radio services 
included in this part are not limited as to the type of polarization of 
the radiated signal, provided, however, that in the event interference 
in excess of permissible levels is caused to the operation of other 
stations the Commission may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, 
order the licensee to change the polarization of the radiated signal. No 
change in polarization may be made without prior authorization from the 
Commission. Unless otherwise allowed, only linear polarization 
(horizontal or vertical) shall be used.


<R05>
Sec. 101.119  Simultaneous use of common antenna structures.

    The simultaneous use of common antenna structures by more than one 
radio station, or by one of more domestic public radio stations and one 
or more stations of any other class or service, may be authorized: 
provided, however, that each licensee or user of any such structure is 
responsible for maintaining the structure, and for painting and 
illuminating the structure when obstruction marking is required by the 
Commission. (See Sec. 101.21(a).)


<R05>
Sec. 101.125  Temporary fixed antenna height restrictions.

    The overall antenna structure heights employed by mobile stations in 
the Local Television Transmission Service and by stations authorized to 
operate at temporary fixed locations may not exceed the height criteria 
set forth in Sec. 17.7 of this chapter, unless in each instance, 
authorization for use of a specific maximum antenna height (above ground 
and above mean sea level) for each location has been obtained from the 
Commission prior to erection of the antenna. Requests for such 
authorization must show the inclusive dates of the proposed operation. 
(Complete information as to rules concerning the construction, marking 
and lighting of antenna structures is contained in part 17 of this 
chapter.)

Sec. 101.129  Transmitter location.

    (a) The applicant must determine, prior to filing an application for 
a radio station authorization, that the antenna site specified therein 
is adequate to render the service proposed. In

cases of questionable antenna locations, it is desirable to conduct 
propagation tests to indicate the field intensity which may be expected 
in the principal areas or at the fixed points of communication to be 
served, particularly where severe shadow problems may be expected. In 
considering applications proposing the use of such locations, the 
Commission may require site survey tests to be made pursuant to a 
developmental authorization in the particular service concerned. In such 
cases, propagation tests should be conducted in accordance with 
recognized engineering methods and should be made with a transmitting 
antenna simulating, as near as possible, the proposed antenna 
installation. Full data obtained from such surveys and its analysis, 
including a description of the methods used and the name, address and 
qualifications of the engineer making the survey, must be supplied to 
the Commission.
    (b) In the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, licensees must not locate MVDDS 
transmitting antennas within 10 km of any qualifying NGSO FSS receiver 
unless mutual agreement is obtained between the MVDDS and NGSO FSS 
licensees. Such agreements must be retained by the licensees and made 
available for inspection by interested parties upon request.
    (1) A qualifying NGSO FSS receiver, for the purposes of this 
section, is deemed to be one that is in regular use by an NGSO FSS 
subscriber for normal reception purposes in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band and 
not one for monitoring or testing purposes. In addition, qualifying 
receivers must either be in operation on the date or already be under 
construction and then operating within thirty days of the date that the 
MVDDS licensee notifies the NGSO FSS licensee of its intent to construct 
a new MVDDS transmitting antenna at a specified location.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the 10 
kilometer spacing requirement for each MVDDS transmitting antenna site 
shall not apply with respect to NGSO FSS receivers that might be 
installed or become operational (except for those under construction and 
operating within thirty days as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section) subsequent to the original date that the MVDDS licensee 
provided notice of its intention to construct a given transmission 
facility.
    (3) In the event that a proposed MVDDS transmitting antenna for 
which notice has been duly given to the NGSO FSS licensees has not been 
placed in normal operation within one calendar year of the date of 
notice, then the MVDDS licensee loses the benefit of the original 
notice. Upon such anniversary, the MVDDS licensee must re-determine 
compliance with the minimum 10 kilometer spacing requirement based upon 
locations of qualifying NGSO FSS receivers on that anniversary date. A 
new determination of compliance with the spacing requirement shall be 
made for each succeeding anniversary of non-operation for each proposed 
MVDDS transmission site or additional antenna. This provision 
contemplates that failure to commence normal operation at a given MVDDS 
transmitting antenna site within one year of the date of NGSO FSS 
notification may require successive relocations of the proposed 
transmitter site in order to meet the minimum spacing distance as 
determined on each anniversary of non-operation.

Sec. 101.131  Transmitter construction and installation.

    (a) The equipment at the operating and transmitting positions must 
be so installed and protected that it is not accessible to, or capable 
of being operated by, persons other than those duly authorized by the 
licensee.
    (b) In any case where the maximum modulating frequency of a 
transmitter is prescribed by the Commission, the transmitter must be 
equipped with a low-pass or band-pass modulation filter of suitable 
performance characteristics. In those cases where a modulation limiter 
is employed, the modulation filter must be installed between the 
transmitter stage in which limiting is effected and the modulated stage 
of the transmitter.
    (c) Each transmitter employed in these services must be equipped 
with an appropriately labeled pilot lamp or

[[Page 643]]

meter which will provide continuous visual indication at the transmitter 
when its control circuits have been placed in a condition to activate 
the transmitter. In addition, facilities must be provided at each 
transmitter to permit the transmitter to be turned on and off 
independently of any remote control circuits associated therewith.
    (d) At each transmitter control point the following facilities must 
be installed:
    (1) A carrier operated device which will provide continuous visual 
indication when the transmitter is radiating, or, in lieu thereof, a 
pilot lamp or meter which will provide continuous visual indication when 
the transmitter control circuits have been placed in a condition to 
activate the transmitter; and
    (2) Facilities which will permit the operator to turn transmitter 
carrier on and off at will.
    (e) Transmitter control circuits from any control point must be so 
installed that grounding or shorting any line in the control circuit 
will not cause the transmitter to radiate: provided, however, That this 
provision will not be applicable to control circuits of stations which 
normally operate with continuous radiation or to control circuits which 
are under the effective operational control of responsible operating 
personnel 24 hours per day.


<R05>
Sec. 101.133  Limitations on use of transmitters.

    (a) Transmitters licensed for operation in Common Carrier services 
may be concurrently licensed or used for non-common carrier 
communication purposes. Mobile units may be concurrently licensed or 
used for non-common carrier communication purposes provided that the 
transmitter is certificated for use in each service.
    (b) Private operational fixed point-to-point microwave stations 
authorized in this service may communicate with associated operational-
fixed stations and fixed receivers and with units of associated stations 
in the mobile service licensed under Private Radio Service rule parts. 
In addition, intercommunication is permitted with other licensed 
stations and with U.S. Government stations in those cases which require 
cooperation or coordination of activities or when cooperative use 
arrangements in accordance with Sec. 101.135 are contemplated; provided, 
however, that where communication is desired with stations authorized to 
operate under the authority of a foreign jurisdiction, prior approval of 
this Commission must be obtained; And provided further, That the 
authority under which such other stations operate does not prohibit the 
intercommunication.
    (c) Two or more persons or governmental entities eligible for 
private operational fixed point-to-point microwave licenses may use the 
same transmitting equipment under the following terms and conditions:
    (1) Each licensee complies with the general operating requirements 
set out in this part;
    (2) Each licensee is eligible for the frequency(ies) on which the 
facility operates; and
    (3) Each licensee must have the ability to access the transmitter(s) 
that it is authorized to operate under the multiple licensing 
arrangement.
    (d) LMDS subscriber transmissions. LMDS licensees shall not operate 
transmitters from subscriber locations in the 29.1-29.25 GHz band.

Sec. 101.135  Shared use of radio stations and the offering of private carrier service.

    Licensees of Private Operational Fixed Point-to-Point Microwave 
radio stations may share the use of their facilities on a non-profit 
basis or may offer service on a for-profit private carrier basis, 
subject to the following conditions and limitations:
    (a) Persons or governmental entities licensed to operate radio 
systems on any of the private radio frequencies set out in Sec. 101.101 
may share such systems with, or provide private carrier service to, any 
eligible entity for licensing under this part, regardless of individual 
eligibility restrictions, provided that the communications being carried 
are permissible under Sec. 101.603. In addition, persons or governmental 
entities licensed to operate low power systems under the provisions of 
Sec. 101.147(r)(10)

[[Page 644]]

may share such systems with, or provide private carrier services to, 
Federal Government entities, provided the communications carried are 
permissible under Sec. 101.603;
    (b) The licensee must maintain access to and control over all 
facilities authorized under its license;
    (c) All sharing and private carrier arrangements must be conducted 
pursuant to a written agreement to be kept as part of the station 
records; and
    (d) The licensee must keep an up-to-date list of system sharers and 
private carrier subscribers and the basis of their eligibility under 
this part. Such records must be kept current and must be made available 
upon request for inspection by the Commission.
    (e) Applicants licensed in the MAS frequencies after June 2, 2000, 
shall not provide service to others on a for-profit private carrier 
basis in the 928-928.85/952-952.85/956.25-956.45 MHz bands and the 
932.25-932.5/941.25-941.5 MHz bands.

Sec. 101.137  Interconnection of private operational fixed point-to-point microwave stations.

    Private operational fixed point-to-point microwave stations may be 
interconnected with facilities of common carriers subject to applicable 
tariffs.


<R05>
Sec. 101.139  Authorization of transmitters.

    (a) Except for transmitters used at developmental stations or for 
fixed point-to-point operation pursuant to subparts H and I of this 
part, each transmitter must be a type which has been certificated by the 
Commission for use under the applicable rules of this part. Transmitters 
used in the private operational fixed and common carrier fixed point-to-
point microwave services under subparts H and I of this part must be of 
a type that has been verified for compliance. Transmitters designed for 
use in the 31.0-31.3 GHz band and transmitters designed for MVDDS use in 
the 12,200-12,700 MHz band will be authorized under the verification 
procedure.
    (b) Any manufacturer of a transmitter to be produced for use under 
the rules of this part may request certification or obtain verification 
by following the applicable procedures set forth in part 2 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Certification for an individual transmitter may also be 
requested by an applicant for a station authorization, pursuant to the 
procedures set forth in part 2 of this chapter.
    (d) A transmitter presently shown on an instrument of authorization, 
which operates on an assigned frequency in the 890-940 MHz band and has 
not been certificated, may continue to be used by the licensee without 
certification provided such transmitter continues otherwise to comply 
with the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission.
    (e) Certification or verification is not required for portable 
transmitters operating with peak output power not greater than 250 mW. 
If operation of such equipment causes harmful interference the FCC may, 
at its discretion, require the licensee to take such corrective action 
as is necessary to eliminate the interference.
    (f) After July 15, 1996, the manufacturer (except for export) or 
importation of equipment employing digital modulation techniques in the 
3700-4200, 5925-6425, 6525-6875, 10,550-10,680 and 10,700-11,700 MHz 
bands must meet the minimum payload capacity requirements of 
Sec. 101.141.
    (g) After January 1, 2001, a transmitter operating on the 24,250-
24,450 MHz and 25,050-25,250 MHz bands must meet the emission limitation 
set forth in Sec. 101.111(a)(2)(ii).

FR 43038, June 26, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 101.141  Microwave modulation.

    (a) Microwave transmitters employing digital modulation techniques 
and operating below 19.7 GHz (except for MVDDS stations in the 12,200-
12,700 MHz band) must, with appropriate multiplex equipment, comply with 
the following additional requirements:
    (1) The bit rate, in bits per second, must be equal to or greater 
than the bandwidth specified by the emission designator in Hertz (e.g., 
to be acceptable, equipment transmitting at a 20 Mb/s rate must not 
require a bandwidth

[[Page 645]]

of greater than 20 MHz), except the bandwidth used to calculate the 
minimum rate may not include any authorized guard band.

    Note to (a)(1):
    Systems authorized prior to December 1, 1988, may install equipment 
after that date with no minimum bit rate.

    (2) Equipment to be used for voice transmission placed in service, 
authorized, or applied for on or before June 1, 1997 in the 2110 to 2130 
and 2160 to 2180 MHz bands must be capable of satisfactory operation 
within the authorized bandwidth to encode at least 96 voice channels. 
Equipment placed in service, authorized, or applied for on or before 
June 1, 1997 in the 3700-4200, 5925-6425 (30 MHz bandwidth), and 10,700-
11,700 MHz (30 and 40 MHz bandwidths) bands must be capable of 
satisfactory operation within the authorized bandwidth to encode at 
least 1152 voice channels. These required loading levels may be reduced 
by a factor of 1/N provided that N transmitters may be operated 
satisfactorily, over the same radio path, within an authorized bandwidth 
less than, or equal to, the maximum authorizable bandwidth (e.g., the 
1152 channel requirement may be reduced to 576 if two transmitters can 
be satisfactorily operated over the same path within the maximum 
bandwidth). Where certificated equipment is designed to operate on the 
same frequency in a cross polarized configuration to meet the above 
capacity requirements, the Commission will require, at the time 
additional transmitters are authorized, that both polarizations of a 
frequency be used before a new frequency assignment is made, unless a 
single transmitter installation was found to be justified by the 
Commission at the time it authorized the first transmitter.
    (3) The following capacity and loading requirements must be met for 
equipment applied for, authorized, and placed in service after June 1, 
1997 in the 3700-4200 MHz (4 GHz), 5925-6425 and 6525-6875 MHz (6 GHz), 
10,550-10,680 MHz (10 GHz), and 10,700-11,700 MHz (11 GHz) bands:

  DS-3/STS-1 = 2016.
\3\ This loading requirement must be met within 30 months of licensing.
  If two transmitters simultaneously operate on the same frequency over
  the same path, the requirement is reduced to 25 percent.

    (4) If a transmitter is authorized to operate in a bandwidth that is 
not listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, it must meet the minimum 
payload capacity and traffic loading requirements of the next largest 
channel bandwidth listed in the table; e.g., if the authorized bandwidth 
is 3.5 MHz, the minimum payload capacity must be 12.3 Mbits/s.
    (5) Transmitters carrying digital motion video motion material are 
exempt from the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) 
of this section, provided that at least 50 percent of the payload is 
digital video motion material and the minimum bit rate specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section is met. In the 6, 10, and 11 GHz bands, 
concatenation of multiple contiguous channels is permitted for channels 
of equal bandwidth on center frequencies, provided no other channels are 
available and the minimum payload capacity requirements are met.
    (6) Digital systems using bandwidths of 10 MHz or larger will be 
considered 50 percent loaded when the following condition is met: at 
least 50 percent of their total DS-1 capacity is being used. A DS-1 
channel is being used when it has been connected to a DS-0/DS-1 
multiplexer. For non-DS-0 services, such as, but not limited to, video 
or broadband data transmission, the next

[[Page 646]]

largest DS-1 equivalent will be considered for the computation of a 
loading percentage.
    (7) For digital systems, minimum payload capacities shall be 
expressed in numbers of DS-1s, DS-3s or STS-1s. The payload capacity 
required by the Commission shall correspond to commercially available 
equipment.
    (b) For purposes of compliance with the emission limitation 
requirements of Sec. 101.111(a)(2) and the requirements of paragraph (a) 
of this section, digital modulation techniques are considered as being 
employed when digital modulation occupies 50 percent or more to the 
total peak frequency deviation of a transmitted radio frequency carrier. 
The total peak frequency deviation will be determined by adding the 
deviation produced by the digital modulation signal and the deviation 
produced by any frequency division multiplex (FDM) modulation used. The 
deviation (D) produced by the FDM signal must be determined in 
accordance with Sec. 2.202(f) of this chapter.
    (c) Analog Modulation. Except for video transmission, an application 
for an initial working channel for a given route will not be accepted 
for filing where the anticipated loading (within five years for voice, 
or other period subject to reasonable projection) is less than the 
minimum specified for the following frequency bands. Absent 
extraordinary circumstances, applications proposing additional 
frequencies over existing routes will not be granted unless it is shown 
that the traffic load will shortly exhaust the capacity of the existing 
equipment. Where no construction of radio facilities is requested, 
licensees must submit this evidence with their filing of any necessary 
authority required pursuant to section 214 of the Communications Act and 
part 63 of this chapter.

Sec. 101.145  Interference to geostationary-satellites.

    These limitations are necessary to minimize the probability of 
harmful interference to reception in the bands 2655-2690 MHz, 5925-6875 
MHz, and 12.7-12.75 GHz on board geostationary-space stations in the 
fixed-satellite service.
    (a) Stations authorized prior to July 1, 1976 in the band 2655-2690 
MHz, which exceed the power levels in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section are permitted to operate indefinitely, provided that the 
operation of such stations does not result in harmful interference to 
reception in these bands on board geostationary space stations.
    (b) 2655 to 2690 MHz and 5925 to 6875 MHz. No directional 
transmitting antenna utilized by a fixed station operating in these 
bands may be aimed within 2 degrees of the geostationary-satellite 
orbit, taking into account atmospheric refraction. However, exception 
may be made in unusual circumstances upon a showing that there is no 
reasonable alternative to the transmission path proposed. If there is no 
evidence that such exception would cause possible harmful interference 
to an authorized satellite system, said transmission path may be 
authorized on waiver basis where the maximum value of the equivalent 
isotropically radiated power (EIRP) does not exceed:
    (1) +47 dBW for any antenna beam directed within 0.5 degrees of the 
stationary satellite orbit; or
    (2) +47 to +55 dBW, on a linear decibel scale (8 dB per degree) for 
any antenna beam directed between 0.5 degrees and 1.5 degrees of the 
stationary orbit.
    (c) 12.7 to 12.75 GHz. No directional transmitting antenna utilized 
by a fixed station operating in this band may be aimed within 1.5 
degrees of the geostationary-satellite orbit, taking into account 
atmospheric refraction. However, exception may be made in unusual 
circumstances upon a showing that there is no reasonable alternative to 
the transmission path proposed. If there is no evidence that such

site-by-site basis.
    (28) Licensees that obtain authorizations in the 928/952/956 MHz MAS 
bands subsequent to July 1, 1999 are limited to private internal 
services, as defined in Sec. 101.1305. Incumbent operations in the 928/
952/956 MHz MAS bands, as defined in Sec. 101.1331(a), are subject to 
grandfather rights pursuant to Sec. 101.1331. The 928.85-929.0 MHz and 
959.85-960.0 MHz bands are licensed on a geographic area basis with no 
eligibility restrictions. The 928.0-928.85 MHz band paired with the 
952.0-952.85 MHz band, in addition to unpaired frequencies in the 
956.25-956.45 MHz band, are licensed on a site-by-site basis and used 
for terrestrial point-to-point and point-to-multipoint fixed and limited 
mobile operations. The 928.85-929.0 MHz band paired with the 959.85-
960.0 MHz band is licensed by Economic Area and used for terrestrial 
point-to-point and point-to-multipoint fixed operations.
    (29) Frequencies in this band are shared with stations in the 
Multipoint Distribution Service (Part 21). These frequencies may be used 
for the transmission of the licensee's products and information 
services, excluding video entertainment material to the licensee's 
customers.
    (30) The frequency band 18,580-19,300 GHz is not available for new 
licensees after June 8, 2000, except for low power indoor stations in

    (31) This frequency band can be used for Multichannel Video 
Distribution and Data Service (MVDDS) shared with Direct Broadcast 
Satellite (DBS) Services on a co-primary non-harmful interference basis 
and on a co-primary basis with NGSO FSS satellite earth stations. 
Incumbent private operational fixed point-to-point licensees can also 
use these frequencies on a site by site basis.

    (b) Frequencies normally available for assignment in this service 
are set forth with applicable limitations in the following tables: 928-
960 MHz Multiple address system (MAS) frequencies are available for the 
point-to-multipoint and point-to-point transmission of a licensee's 
products or services, excluding video entertainment material, to a 
licensee's customer or for its own internal communications. The paired 
frequencies listed in this section are used for two-way communications 
between a master station and remote stations. Ancillary one-way 
communications on paired frequencies are permitted on a case-by-case 
basis. Ancillary communications between interrelated master stations are 
permitted on a secondary basis. The normal channel bandwidth assigned 
will be 12.5 kHz. EA licensees, however, may combine contiguous channels 
without limit or justification. Site-based licensees may combine 
contiguous channels up to 50 kHz, and more than 50 kHz only upon a 
showing of adequate justification. Any bandwidth (12.5 kHz, 25 kHz or 
greater) authorized in accordance with this section may be subdivided 
into narrower bandwidths to create additional (or sub) frequencies 
without the need to specify each discrete frequency within the specific 
bandwidth. Equipment that is used to create additional frequencies by 
narrowing bandwidth (whether authorized for a 12.5 kHz, 25 kHz or 
greater bandwidth) will be required to meet, at a minimum, the 
<plus-minus> 0.00015 percent tolerance requirement so that all 
subfrequencies will be within the emission mask. Systems licensed for 
frequencies in these MAS bands prior to August 1, 1975, may continue to 
operate as authorized until June 11, 1996, at which time they must 
comply with current MAS operations based on the 12.5 kHz channelization 
set forth in this paragraph. Systems licensed between August 1, 1975, 
and January 1, 1981, inclusive, are required to comply with the 
grandfathered 25 kHz standard bandwidth and channelization requirements 
set forth in this paragraph. Systems originally licensed after January 
1, 1981, and on or before May 11, 1988, with bandwidths of 25 kHz and 
above, will be grandfathered indefinitely.
    (1) Frequencies listed in this paragraph are designated for private 
internal use and are subject to site-based licensing.

    (p) 12,000-12,700 MHz. The Commission has allocated the 12.2-12.7 
GHz band for use by the Direct Broadcast Satellite Service (DBS), the 
Multichannel Video Distribution and Data Service (MVDDS), and the Non-
Geostationary Satellite Orbit Fixed Satellite Service (NGSO FSS). MVDDS 
shall be licensed on a non-harmful interference co-primary basis to 
existing DBS operations and on a co-primary basis with NGSO FSS stations 
in this band. MVDDS use can be on a common carrier and/or non-common 
carrier basis and can use channels of any desired bandwidth up to the 
maximum of 500 MHz provided the EIRP does not exceed 14 dBm per 24 
megahertz. Private operational fixed point-to-point microwave stations 
authorized after September 9, 1983, are licensed on a non-harmful 
interference basis to DBS and are required to make any and all 
adjustments necessary to prevent harmful interference to operating 
domestic DBS receivers. Incumbent public safety licensees shall be 
afforded protection from MVDDS and NGSO FSS licensees, however all other 
private operational fixed licensees shall be secondary to DBS, MVDDS and 
NGSO FSS licensees. As of May 23, 2002, the Commission no longer accepts 
applications for new licenses for point-to-point private operational 
fixed stations in this band, however, incumbent licensees and previously 
filed applicants may file applications for minor modifications and 
amendments (as defined in Sec. 1.929 of this chapter) thereto, renewals, 
transfer of control, or assignment of license. Notwithstanding any other 
provisions, no private operational fixed point-to-point microwave 
stations are permitted to cause harmful interference to broadcasting-
satellite stations of other countries operating in accordance with the 
Region 2 plan for the Broadcasting-Satellite Service established at the 
1983 WARC.
    (q) Special provisions for incumbent low power, limited coverage 
systems in the band segments 12.2-12.7 GHz.
    (1) As of May 23, 2002, the Commission no longer accepts 
applications for new stations in this service and incumbent stations may 
remain in service provided they do not cause harmful interference to any 
other primary services licensed in this band as described in paragraph 
(p) of this section. However, incumbent licensees and previously filed 
applicants may file applications for minor modifications and amendments 
(as defined in Sec. 1.929 of this chapter) thereto, renewals, transfer 
of control, or assignment of license.
    (2) Prior to December 8, 2000, notwithstanding any contrary 
provisions in this part, the frequency pairs 12.220/12.460 GHz, 12.260/
12.500 GHz, 12.300/12.540 GHz and 12.340/12.580 GHz, were authorized for 
low power, limited coverage systems subject to the following provisions:
    (i) Maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) shall be 
55 dBm;
    (ii) The rated transmitter output power shall not exceed 0.5 watts;
    (iii) Frequency tolerance shall be maintained to within 0.01 percent 
of the assigned frequency;
    (iv) Maximum beamwidth shall not exceed 4 degrees. However, the 
sidelobe suppression criteria contained in Sec. 101.115 shall not apply, 
except that a minimum front-to-back ratio of 38 dB shall apply;
    (v) Upon showing of need, a maximum bandwidth of 12 MHz may be 
authorized per frequency assigned;
    (vi) Radio systems authorized under the provisions of this section 
shall have no more than three hops in tandem, except upon showing of 
need, but in any event the maximum tandem length shall not exceed 40 km 
(25 miles);
    (vii) Interfering signals at the receiver antenna terminals of 
stations authorized under this section shall not exceed -90 dBm and -70 
dBm respectively, for co-channel and adjacent channel interfering 
signals, and
    (viii) Stations authorized under the provisions of this section 
shall provide

[[Page 663]]

the protection from interference specified in Sec. 101.105 to stations 
operating in accordance with the provisions of this part.
    (r) 17,700 to 19,700 and 24,250 to 25,250 MHz: Stations operating on 
the following frequencies in the band 18.58-18.8 GHz that were licensed 
or had applications pending before the Commission as of June 8, 2010 may 
continue those operations on a shared co-primary basis with other 
services under parts 21, 25, and 74 of the Commission's rules until June 
8, 2010, except for operations in the band 19.26-19.3 GHz and low power 
systems operating pursuant to paragraph (r)(10) of this section, which 
shall operate on a co-primary basis until October 31, 2011. Those 
stations operating on the following frequencies in the band 18.8-19.3 
GHz that were licensed or had applications pending before the Commission 
as of September 18, 1998 may continue those operations on a shared co-
primary basis with other services under parts 21, 25, and 74 of the 
Commission's rules until June 8, 2010. After this date, operations in 
the 18.58-19.30 GHz band are not entitled to protection from fixed-
satellite service operations and must not cause unacceptable 
interference to fixed-satellite service station operations. No new part 
101 licenses will be granted in the 18.58-19.3 GHz band after June 8, 
2010, except for certain low power operations authorized under paragraph 
(r)(10) of this section, which may continue to be licensed until April 
1, 2002. Licensees may use either a two-way link or one frequency of a 
frequency pair for a one-way link and must coordinate proposed 
operations pursuant to the procedures required in Sec. 101.103. (Note, 
however, that stations authorized as of September 9, 1983, to use 
frequencies in the band 17.7-19.7 GHz may, upon proper application, 
continue to be authorized for such operations, consistent with the 
conditions related to the 18.58-19.3 GHz band.)

indoor of the coordinates 38 deg.48[min] N/76 deg.52[min] W and 
39 deg.43[min] N/104 deg.46[min] W. The service area will be a 28 
kilometer omnidirectional radius originating from specified center 
reference coordinates. The specified center coordinates must be no 
closer than 56 kilometers from any co-channel nodal station or the 
specified center coordinates of another co-channel system. Applicants/
licensees do not need to specify the location of each individual 
transmitting device operating within their defined service areas. Such 
operations are subject to the following requirements on the low power 
transmitting devices:
    (i) Power must not exceed one watt EIRP and 100 milliwatts 
transmitter output power,
    (ii) A frequency tolerance of 0.001% must be maintained; and
    (iii) The mean power of emissions shall be attenuated in accordance 
with the following schedule:
    (A) In any 4 kHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from 
the

[[Page 666]]

center frequency of the assigned channel by more than 50 percent of the 
channel bandwidth and is within the bands 18,820-18870 MHz or 19,19160-
19,210 MHz:

A = 35 + .003(F - 0.5B) dB

or,

80 dB (whichever is the lesser attenuation).

Where
A = Attenuation (in decibels) below output power level contained within 
the channel for a given polarization.
B = Bandwidth of channel in kHz.
F = Absolute value of the difference between the center frequency of the 
4 kHz band measured at the center frequency of the channel in kHz.

    (B) In any 4 kHz band the center frequency of which is outside the 
bands 18.820-18.870 GHz: At least 43+10log<INF>10</INF>(mean output 
power in watts) decibels.
    (iv) Low power stations authorized in the band 18.8-19.3 GHz after 
June 8, 2000 are restricted to indoor use only. No new licenses will be 
authorized for applications received after April 1, 2002.
    (s) Special provisions for low power, limited coverage systems in 
the band segments 21.8-22.0 GHz and 23.0-23.2 GHz. Notwithstanding any 
contrary provisions in this part the frequency pairs 21.825/23.025 GHz,

authorized for low power, limited coverage systems subject to the 
following provisions:
    (1) Maximum effective radiated power (ERP) shall be 55 dBm;
    (2) The rated transmitter output power shall not exceed 0.100 watts;
    (3) Frequency tolerance shall be maintained to within 0.05 percent 
of the assigned frequency;
    (4) Maximum beamwidth not to exceed 4 degrees. However, the sidelobe 
suppression criteria contained in Sec. 101.115 shall not apply, except 
that a minimum front-to-back ratio of 38 dB shall apply;
    (5) Upon showing of need, a maximum bandwidth of 50 MHz may be 
authorized per frequency assigned;
    (6) Radio systems authorized under the provisions of this section 
shall have no more than five hops in tandem, except upon showing of 
need, but in any event the maximum tandem length shall not exceed 40 km 
(25 miles);
    (7) Interfering signals at the antenna terminals of stations 
authorized under this section shall not exceed -90 dBm and -70 dBm 
respectively, for co-channel and adjacent channel interfering signals; 
and
    (8) Stations authorized under the provisions of this section shall 
provide the protection from interference specified in Sec. 101.105 to 
stations operating in accordance with the provisions of this part.
    (t) 27,500-28,350; 29,100-29,250; 31,000-31,300 MHz. These 
frequencies are available for LMDS systems. Each assignment will be made 
on a BTA service area basis, and the assigned spectrum may be subdivided 
as desired by the licensee.
    (u) 31,000-31,300 MHz. Stations licensed in this band prior to March 
11, 1997, may continue their authorized operations, subject to license 
renewal, on the condition that harmful interference will not be caused 
to LMDS operations licensed in this band after June 30, 1997. Non-LMDS 
stations licensed after March 11, 1997, based on applications refiled no 
later than June 26, 1998 are unprotected and subject to harmful 
interference from each other and from stations licensed prior to March 
11, 1997, and are licensed on a secondary basis to LMDS. In the sub-

year, or such shorter term as the Commission may deem appropriate in any 
particular case, and will be subject to cancellation without hearing by 
the Commission at any time upon notice to the licensee.
    (b) Where some phases of the developmental program are not covered 
by the general rules of the Commission or by the rules of this part, the 
Commission may specify supplemental or additional requirements or 
conditions in each case as it may deem necessary in the public interest, 
convenience or necessity.
    (c) Frequencies allocated to the service toward which such 
development is directed will be assigned for developmental operation on 
the basis that no

[[Page 674]]

interference will be caused to the regular services of stations 
operating in accordance with the Commission's Table of Frequency 
Allocations (Sec. 2.106 of this chapter).
    (d) The rendition of communication service for hire is not permitted 
under any developmental authorizations unless specifically authorized by 
the Commission.
    (e) The grant of a developmental authorization carries with it no 
assurance that the developmental program, if successful, will be 
authorized on a permanent basis either as to the service involved or the 
use of the frequencies assigned or any other frequencies.

<R05>
Sec. 101.509  Interference protection criteria.

    (a) As a condition for use of frequencies in this service each 
licensee is required to:
    (1) Engineer the system to be reasonably compatible with adjacent 
and co-channel operations in the same or adjacent areas on all 
frequencies; and
    (2) Cooperate fully and in good faith to resolve whatever potential 
interference and transmission security problems may be present in 
adjacent and co-channel operations.
    (b) All harmful interference to other users of co-channel and 
adjacent channel use in the same or adjacent geographical area are 
prohibited. In areas where Economic Areas are in close proximity, 
careful consideration should be given to minimum power requirements and 
to the location, height, and radiation pattern of the transmitting and 
receiving antennas. Licensees are expected to cooperate fully in 
attempting to resolve problems of potential interference before bringing 
the matter to the attention of the Commission.
    (c) Licensee shall coordinate their facilities whenever the 
facilities have optical line-of-sight into other licensees' areas or are 
within the same geographic area. Licensees are encouraged to develop 
operational agreements with relevant licensees in the same or adjacent 
areas. Incumbent SMSA licensee(s) shall retain exclusive rights to its 
channel(s) within its SMSA and must be protected.
    (d) Licensees shall comply with the appropriate coordination 
agreements between the United States and Canada and the United States 
and Mexico concerning cross-border sharing and use of the 24 GHz bands 
which may require using channels pairs in accordance with the table in 
Sec. 101.147(r)(9).
    (e) The Commission recommends that coordination is not necessary if 
the power flux density (pfd) at the boundary of the relevant adjacent 
area is lower than -14 dBW/m\2\ in any 1 MHz. This value can be changed 
and agreed upon by both coordinating parties. Licensees should be able 
to deploy with a pfd up to -94 dBW/m\2\ in any 1 MHz at the boundary of 
the relevant adjacent area without negatively affecting the successful 
operations of the adjacent area licensee.

are initially known to be of longer than 6 months' duration may not be 
provided under a temporary fixed authorization but rendered pursuant to 
a regular license.
    (2) When a fixed station authorized to operate at temporary 
locations is installed and it subsequently becomes necessary for the 
station to operate from such location for more than six months, an 
application for a station authorization to specify the permanent 
location must be filed at least thirty days prior to the expiration of 
the six month period.
    (3) The station must be used only for rendition of communication 
service at a remote point where the provision of wire facilities is not 
practicable.
    (4) The antenna structure height employed at any location may not 
exceed the criteria set forth in Sec. 17.7 of this chapter unless, in 
each instance, authorization for use of a specific maximum antenna 
structure height for each location has been obtained from the Commission 
prior to erection of the antenna. See Sec. 101.125.
    (5) Applications for such stations must comply with the provisions 
of Sec. 101.21(f).
    (b) Applications for authorizations to operate stations at temporary

<R05>
Sec. 101.1011  Construction requirements and criteria for renewal expectancy.

    (a) LMDS licensees must make a showing of ``substantial service'' in 
their license area within ten years of being licensed. ``Substantial'' 
service is defined as service which is sound, favorable, and 
substantially above a level of mediocre service which might minimally 
warrant renewal. Failure by any licensee to meet this requirement will 
result in forfeiture of the license and the licensee will be ineligible 
to regain it.
    (b) A renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding 
shall receive a preference, commonly referred to as a renewal 
expectancy, that is the most important comparative factor to be 
considered in the proceeding as long as the applicant's past record for 
the relevant license period demonstrates that:
    (1) The renewal applicant has provided ``substantial'' service 
during its past license term; and
    (2) The renewal applicant has substantially complied with applicable 
FCC rules, policies, and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
    (c) In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, an LMDS 
renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding must 
submit a showing explaining why it should receive a renewal expectancy. 
At a minimum, this showing must include:
    (1) A description of its current service in terms of geographic 
coverage and population served:
    (2) An explanation of its record of expansion, including a timetable 
of new construction to meet changes in demand for service:
    (3) A description of its investments in its LMDS system; and
    (4) Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated 
the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and a list of any 
pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in this 
paragraph.
    (d) In making its showing of entitlement to a renewal expectancy, a 
renewal applicant may claim credit for any system modification 
applications that were pending on the date it filed its renewal 
application. Such credit will not be allowed if the modification 
application is dismissed or denied.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1013  Permissible communications services.

    (a) Authorizations for stations in the Local Multipoint Distribution

consistent with the Commission's rules and the regulatory status of the 
station to provide services on a common carrier or non-common carrier 
basis.
    (c) An applicant or licensee may submit a petition at any time 
requesting clarification of the regulatory status required to provide a 
specific communications service.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1017  Requesting regulatory status.

Sec. 101.1111  Partitioning and disaggregation.

    (a) Definitions.--Disaggregation. The assignment of discrete 
portions or ``blocks'' of spectrum licensed to a geographic licensee or 
qualifying entity.
    Partitioning. The assignment of geographic portions of a licensee's 
authorized service area along geopolitical or other boundaries.
    (b) Eligibility. (1) Parties seeking approval for partitioning and 
disaggregation shall request an authorization for partial assignment of 
a license pursuant to Sec. 101.53. Parties shall submit the forms set 
forth in Sec. 101.15(e).
    (2) Licensees may apply to partition their licensed geographic 
service area or disaggregate their licensed spectrum at any time 
following the grant of their licenses.
    (c) Technical Standards.--(1) Partitioning. In the case of 
partitioning, requests for authorization for partial assignment of a 
license must include, as an attachment, a description of the partitioned 
service area. The partitioned service area shall be defined by 
coordinate points at every 3 degrees

[[Page 688]]

along the partitioned service area unless an FCC recognized service area 
is utilized (i.e., Major Trading Area, Basic Trading Area, Metropolitan 
Service Area, Rural Service Area or Economic Area) or county lines are 
followed. The geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, 
minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude and 
must be based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83). In the case 
where an FCC recognized service area or county lines are utilized, 
applicants need only list the specific area(s) (through use of FCC 
designations or county names) that constitute the partitioned area. In 
such partitioning cases where an unjust enrichment payment is owed the 
Commission, the request for authorization for partial assignment of a 
license must include, as an attachment, a calculation of the population 
of the partitioned service area and the licensed geographic service 
area.
    (2) Disaggregation. Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.
    (3) Combined Partitioning and Disaggregation. The Commission will 
consider requests for partial assignment of licenses that propose 
combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.
    (d) License Term. The license term for a partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. 101.67 of this chapter.
    (e) Construction Requirements. Applications requesting approval for 
partitioning or disaggregation must include a certification by each 
party that it will satisfy the construction requirement set forth in 
Sec. 101.1011 of this chapter. Failure by a party to meet its respective 
construction requirement will result in the automatic cancellation of 
its license without further Commission action.

<R05>
Sec. 101.1321  License transfers.

    (a) An MAS system license acquired through competitive bidding 
procedures (including licenses obtained in cases of no mutual 
exclusivity), together with all appurtenances may be transferred, 
assigned, sold, or given away only in accordance with the provisions and 
procedures set forth in Sec. 1.2111 of this chapter.
    (b) An MAS system license obtained through site-based licensing 
procedures, together with all appurtenances may be transferred, 
assigned, sold, or given away, to any other entity in accordance with 
the provisions and procedures set forth in Sec. 1.948 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1323  Spectrum aggregation, disaggregation, and partitioning.

    (a) Eligibility. (1) Parties seeking approval for partitioning and 
disaggregation shall request from the Commission an authorization for 
partial assignment of license. Geographic area licensees may participate 
in aggregation, disaggregation, and partitioning within the bands 
licensed on a

[[Page 691]]

geographic area basis. Site-based licensees may aggregate spectrum in 
any MAS bands, but may not disaggregate their licensed spectrum or 
partition their licensed sites.
    (2) Eligible MAS licensees may apply to the Commission to partition 
their licensed geographic service areas to eligible entities and are 
free to determine the portion of their service areas to be partitioned. 
Eligible MAS licensees may aggregate or disaggregate their licensed 
spectrum at any time following the grant of a license.
    (b) Technical standards--(1) Aggregation. (i) There is no limitation 
on the amount of spectrum that an MAS licensee may aggregate.
    (ii) Spectrum licensed to MAS licensees does not count toward the 
CMRS spectrum cap discussed in Sec. 20.6 of this chapter.
    (2) Disaggregation. Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount. A 
licensee need not retain a minimum amount of spectrum.
    (3) Partitioning. In the case of partitioning, applicants and 
licensees must file FCC Form 603 pursuant to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter 
and list the partitioned service area on a schedule to the application. 
The geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and 
seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude, and must be 
based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83).
    (4) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. The Commission will 
consider requests from geographic area licensees for partial assignment 
of licenses that propose combinations of partitioning and 
disaggregation.
    (c) Construction requirements--(1) Disaggregation. Partial assignors 
and assignees for license disaggregation have two options to meet 
construction requirements. Under the first option, the disaggregator and 
disaggregatee would certify that they each will share responsibility for 
meeting the applicable construction requirements set forth in 
Sec. 101.1325 for the geographic service area. If parties choose this 
option and either party fails to meet the applicable construction 
requirements, both licenses would be subject to forfeiture at renewal. 
The second option allows the parties to agree that either the 
disaggregator or disaggregatee would be responsible for meeting the 
requirements in Sec. 101.1325 for the geographic service area. If 
parties choose this option, and the party responsible for meeting the 
construction requirement fails to do so, only the license of the non-
performing party would be subject to forfeiture at renewal.
    (2) Partitioning. Partial assignors and assignees for license 
partitioning have two options to meet construction requirements. Under 
the first option, the partitionor and partitionee would each certify 
that they will independently satisfy the applicable construction 
requirements set forth in Sec. 101.1325 for their respective partitioned 
areas. If either licensee fails to meet its requirement in 
Sec. 101.1325, only the non-performing licensee's renewal application 
would be subject to dismissal. Under the second option, the partitionor 
certifies that it has met or will meet the requirement in Sec. 101.1325 
for the entire market. If the partitionor fails to meet the requirement 
in Sec. 101.1325, however, only its license would be subject to 
forfeiture at renewal.
    (3) All applications requesting partial assignments of license for 
partitioning or disaggregation must certify in the appropriate portion 
of the application which construction option is selected.
    (4) Responsible parties must submit supporting documents showing 
compliance with the respective construction requirements within the 
appropriate construction benchmarks set forth in Sec. 101.1325.
    (d) License term. The license term for a partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. 101.1313.

<R05>
Sec. 101.1325  Construction requirements.

    (a) Incumbent site-based licensees are subject to the construction 
requirements set forth in Sec. 101.63 of subpart B (Applications and 
Licenses).
    (b) Each MAS EA licensee must provide service to at least one-fifth 
of the population in its service area or ``substantial service'' within 
five years

[[Page 692]]

of the license grant. In addition, MAS EA licensees must make a showing 
of continued ``substantial service'' within ten years of the license 
grant. Licensees must file maps and other supporting documents showing 
compliance with the respective construction requirements within the 
appropriate five- and ten-year benchmarks of the date of their initial 
licenses.
    (c) Failure by any licensee to meet these requirements will result 
in forfeiture or non-renewal of the initial license, and the licensee 
will be ineligible to regain it.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1327  Renewal expectancy for EA licensees.

    (a) A renewal applicant shall receive a renewal expectancy at the 
end of the license period as long as the applicant:
    (1) Demonstrates that the licensee has provided continued 
``substantial service,'' i.e., service which is sound, favorable, and 
substantially above a level of mediocre service which just might 
minimally warrant renewal, during its past license term;
    (2) Demonstrates that the licensee has substantially complied with 
applicable Commission Rules, policies, and the Communications Act of 
1934, as amended;
    (3) Provides an explanation of the licensee's record of expansion, 
including a timetable of the construction of new facilities to meet 
changes in demand for services provided by the licensee; and (4) 
Provides a description of investments made by the licensee in its 
system.
    (b) In determining whether a renewal applicant has complied with the 
``substantial service'' requirement by the end of the ten-year initial 
license term, the Commission may consider factors such as:
    (1) Whether the licensee is offering a specialized or 
technologically sophisticated service that does not require a high level 
of coverage to be of benefit to customers; and
    (2) Whether the licensee's operations service niche markets or focus 
on serving populations outside of areas served by other licensees. The 
``substantial service'' requirement can, however, be met in other ways, 
and the Commission will review each licensee's showing on a case-by-case 
basis.
    (c) A ``substantial service'' assessment will be made at renewal 
pursuant to the procedures contained in Sec. 1.949 of this chapter.

    Effective Date Note: At 65 FR 17450, Apr. 3, 2000, subpart O,

    EA licensees may construct master and remote stations anywhere 
inside the area authorized in their licenses, without prior approval, so 
long as the Commission's technical and other Rules are complied with, 
except that individual licenses are required for any master station 
that:
    (a) Requires the submission of an environmental assessment under 
Sec. 1.1307 of this chapter;
    (b) Requires international coordination; or
    (c) Would affect the radio frequency quiet zones described in

inconsistent with this part. Refer to Sec. 101.147 for designated uses.
    (2) Incumbent operators in the 928.0-928.85 MHz/952.0-952.85 MHz/
956.25-956.45 MHz bands will include incumbents as defined in 
Sec. 101.1331(a), as well as, their transferees and/or assignees and the 
successors of the transferees and/or assignees and retain their 
grandfathered status, provided that the use of the MAS frequencies 
remains unchanged from that of the transferor and/or assignor of the 
license.

[65 FR 17450, Apr. 3, 2000 as amended at 66 FR 35111, July 3, 2001]
    (c) Incumbent operators in the 928.85-929.0/959.85-960.0 MHz bands 
are grandfathered as of January 19, 2000, and may expand their systems 
provided that the signal level of the additional transmitter(s) does not 
increase the composite contour that occurs at a 40.2 kilometer (25-mile) 
radius from the center of each master station transmitter site. 
Incumbent operators and geographic area licensees may negotiate 
alternative criteria.
    (d) The frequencies associated with incumbent authorizations in the 
928/959 MHz bands that have cancelled automatically or otherwise been 
recovered by the Commission will automatically revert to the applicable 
EA licensee.
    (e) The frequencies associated with incumbent authorizations in the

    (1) Canada--932.0-932.25 MHz and 941.0-941.25 MHz:
    (i) Within Lines A, B, C, and D, as defined in Sec. 1.928(e) of this 
chapter, along the U.S./Canada border, U.S. stations operating in the 
932.0-932.25 MHz and 941.0-941.25 MHz bands are on a secondary basis and 
may operate provided that they shall not transmit a power flux density 
(PFD) at the border greater than -100 dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP> nor -94 dBW/
m<SUP>2</SUP>, respectively. The U.S. has full use of the frequencies in 
these regions up to the border in the bands 932.25-932.50 MHz and 
941.25-941.50 MHz, and Canadian stations may operate on a secondary 
basis provided they do not exceed the respective PFDs shown above. PFD 
can be determined using the following formula: PFD (dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP>) = 
10 log [EIRP/4[pi](D<SUP>2</SUP>], where EIRP is in watts, D is in 
meters, and the power is relative to an isotropic radiator. The 
technical parameters are also limited by tables 1 and 2:

    Note to Table 2: This information is from the Arrangement between 
the Federal Communications Commission and the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration of the United States 
of America, and Industry Canada concerning the use of the bands 932 to 
935 MHz and 941 to 944 MHz along the United States-Canada border signed 
in 1994. This agreement also lists grandfathered stations that must be 
protected.

    (2) Canada--928-929 MHz and 952-960 MHz:
    Between Lines A and B and between Lines C and D, as defined in 
Sec. 1.928(e) of this chapter, along the U.S./Canada border, U.S. 
stations operating in the 928.50-928.75 MHz and 952.50-952.75 MHz bands 
are on an unprotected basis and may operate provided that they shall not 
transmit a power flux density (PFD) at or beyond the border greater than 
-100 dBW/m\2\. The U.S. has full use of the frequencies in these regions 
up to the border in the bands 928.25-928.50 MHz and 952.25-952.50 MHz, 
and Canadian stations may operate on an unprotected basis provided they 
do not exceed the PFD above. Frequencies in the bands 928.00-928.25 MHz, 
928.75-929.00 MHz, 952.00-952.25 MHz, and 952.75-952.85 MHz are 
available for use on a coordinated, first-in-time, shared basis subject 
to protecting grandfathered stations. New stations must provide a 
minimum of 145 km (90 miles) separation or alternatively limit the 
actual PFD of the proposed station to -100 dBW/m\2\, at the existing co-
channel master stations of the other country, or as mutually agreed upon 
on a case-by-case basis. Coordination is not required if the PFD at the 
border is lower than -100 dBW/m\2\. The technical criteria are also 
limited by the following:

Maximum EIRP for master stations in the MHz band: 1000 watts (30 dBW) 
    952-953
Maximum EIRP for fixed remote stations or stations in the 928-929 MHz 
    band: 50 watts (17 dBW) master
Maximum EIRP for mobile master stations: 25 watts (14 dBW)
Maximum antenna height above average master or control stations: 152 m

1991. This agreement also lists grandfathered stations that must be 
protected.

    (3) Mexico:
    Within 113 kilometers of the U.S./Mexico border, U.S. stations 
operating in the 932.0-932.25 MHz and 941.0-941.25 MHz bands are on a 
secondary basis (non-interference to Mexican primary licensees) and may 
operate provided that they shall not transmit a power flux density (PFD) 
at or beyond the

[[Page 695]]

border greater than -100 dBW/m\2\. Upon notification from the 
Commission, U.S. licensees must take proper measures to eliminate any 
harmful interference caused to Mexican primary assignments. The U.S. has 
full use of the frequencies in these regions up to the border in the 
bands 932.25-932.50 MHz and 941.25-941.50 MHz, and Mexican stations may 
operate on a secondary basis (non-interference to U.S. primary 
licensees) provided they do not exceed the PFD shown above. Stations 
using the 932-932.5 MHz band shall be limited to the maximum effective 
isotropic radiated power of 50 watts (17 dBW). Stations using the 941-
941.5 MHz band shall meet the limits in the following table:

 Subpart P--Multichannel Video Distribution and Data Service Rules for 
                         the 12.2-12.7 GHz Band

    Source: 67 FR 43040, June 26, 2002, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1401  Service areas.

    Multichannel Video Distribution and Data Service (MVDDS) is licensed 
on the basis of Component Economic Areas (CEAs). CEAs are based on 
Economic Areas delineated by the United States Department of Commerce. 
Each CEA consists of a single economic node and the surrounding counties 
that are economically related to the node. The United States has a total 
of 348 CEAs, and each CEA shall be licensed by auction to one licensee.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1403  Broadcast carriage Requirements.

    MVDDS licensees are not required to provide all local television 
channels to subscribers within its area and thus are not required to 
comply with the must-carry rules, nor the local signal carriage 
requirements of the Rural Local Broadcast Signal Act. See Multichannel 
Video and Cable Television Service Rules, Subpart D (Carriage of 
Television Broadcast Signals), 47 CFR 76.51-76.70. If an MVDDS licensee 
meets the statutory definition of Multiple Video Programming Distributor 
(MVPD), the retransmission consent requirement of section 325(b)(1) of 
the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 325(b)(1)) shall 
apply to that MVDDS licensee. Any MVDDS licensee that is an MVPD must 
obtain the prior express authority of a broadcast station before 
retransmitting that station's signal, subject to the exceptions 
contained in section 325(b)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended (47 U.S.C. 325(b)(2)). Network nonduplication, syndicated 
exclusivity, sports blackout, and leased access rules shall not be 
imposed on MVDDS licensees.

    Effective Date Note: At 67 FR 43040, June 26, 2002, Sec. 101.1403 
was added. This section contains information collection and 
recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until approval 
has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1405  Channeling plan.

    Each license shall have one spectrum block of 500 megahertz per 
geographic area that can be divided into any size channels. 
Disaggregation is not allowed.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1407  Permissible operations for MVDDS.

    MVDDS licensees must use spectrum in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band for any 
digital fixed non-broadcast service (broadcast services are intended for 
reception of the general public and not on a subscribership basis) 
including one-way direct-to-home/office wireless service. Mobile and 
aeronautical services are not authorized. Two-way services may

[[Page 696]]

be provided by using other spectrum or media for the return or upstream 
path.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1409  Treatment of incumbent licensees.

    Terrestrial private operational fixed point-to-point licensees in 
the 12.2-12.7 GHz band which were licensed prior to MVDDS or NGSO FSS 
satellite stations are incumbent point-to-point stations and are not 
entitled to protection from harmful interference caused by later MVDDS 
or NGSO FSS entrants in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, except for public safety 
stations which must be protected. MVDDS and NGSO FSS operators have the 
responsibility of resolving any harmful interference problems that their 
operations may cause to these public safety incumbent point-to-point 
operations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band. Incumbent public safety 
terrestrial point-to-point licensees may only make minor changes to 
their stations without losing this protection. This does not relieve 
current point-to-point licensees of their obligation to protect BSS 
operations in the subject frequency band. All point-to-point 
applications, including low-power operations, for new licenses, major 
amendments to pending applications, or major modifications to existing 
licenses for the 12.2-12.7 GHz band are no longer accepted except for 
renewals and changes in ownership. See Sec. 1.929 of this chapter for 
definitions of major and minor changes.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1411  Regulatory status and eligibility.

    (a) MVDDS licensees are permitted to provide one-way video 
programming and data services on a non-common carrier and/or on a common 
carrier basis. MVDDS is not required to be treated as a common carrier 
service unless it is providing non-Internet voice and data services 
through the public switched network.
    (b) MVDDS licensees in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band are subject to the 
requirements set forth in Sec. 101.7.
    (c) Any entity, other than one precluded by Secs. 101.7 and 
101.1412, is eligible for authorization to provide MVDDS under this 
part. Authorization will be granted upon proper application filing in 
accordance with the Commission's rules.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1412  MVDDS eligibility restrictions for cable operators.

    (a) Eligibility for MVDDS license. No cable operator, nor any entity 
owning an attributable interest in a cable operator, shall have an 
attributable interest in an MVDDS license whose geographic service area 
significantly overlaps such cable operator's service area, as defined in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Definition of cable operator. For the purposes of paragraph (a) 
of this section, the term ``cable operator'' means a company that is 
franchised to provide cable service.
    (c) Waiver of restriction. Upon completion of the initial award of 
MVDDS licenses, a cable operator may petition for a waiver of the 
restriction on eligibility based upon a showing that the petitioner no 
longer has market power in its service area as the result of the entry 
of new competitors, other than an MVDDS licensee, into such service 
area.
    (d) Significant overlap with service area. For purposes of paragraph 
(a) of this section, significant overlap occurs when cable operator's 
subscribers in a CEA make up thirty-five percent or more of the 
households in that CEA.
    (e) Definition of attributable interest. For purposes of paragraph 
(a) of this section, an entity shall be considered to have an 
attributable interest in a cable operator or MVDDS licensee pursuant to 
the following criteria:
    (1) A controlling interest shall constitute an attributable 
interest. Controlling interest means majority voting equity ownership, 
any general partnership interest, or any means of actual working control 
(including negative control) over the operation of the entity, in 
whatever manner exercised.
    (2) Any general partnership interest in a partnership;
    (3) Partnership and similar ownership interests (including limited 
partnership interests) amounting to 20 percent or more of the total 
partnership interests, calculated according to both the percentage of 
equity paid in and the percentage of distribution of profits and losses;

[[Page 697]]

    (4) Any stock interest amounting to 20 percent or more of the 
outstanding voting stock of an entity;
    (5) Any stock interest, (including non-voting stock) amounting to 20 
percent or more of the total outstanding stock of an entity;
    (6) Stock interests held in trust that exceed the limit set forth in 
paragraph (e) of this section shall constitute an attributable interest 
of any person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, of any 
person who has the sole power to sell such stock, and, in the case of 
stock held in trust, of any person who has the right to revoke the trust 
at will or to replace the trustee at will. If the trustee has a 
familial, personal, or extra-trust business relationship to the grantor 
or the beneficiary, the stock interests held in trust shall constitute 
an attributable interest of such grantor or beneficiary, as appropriate.
    (7) Debt and interests such as warrants and convertible debentures, 
options, or other interests (except non-voting stock) with rights of 
conversion to voting interests shall not constitute attributable 
interests unless and until conversion is effected.
    (8) An interest in a Limited Liability Company (LLC) or Registered 
Limited Liability Partnership (RLLP) amounting to 20 percent or more, 
shall constitute an attributable interest of each such limited partner.
    (9) Officers and directors of a cable operator, an MVDDS licensee, 
or an entity that controls such cable operator or MVDDS licensee, shall 
be considered to have an attributable interest in such cable operator or 
MVDDS licensee.
    (10) Ownership interests that are held indirectly by any party 
through one or more intervening corporations or other entities shall be 
determined by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for 
each link in the vertical ownership chain and application of the 
relevant attribution benchmark to the resulting product, except that, if 
the ownership for any interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 
percent or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were 
a 100 percent interest.
    (11) Any person who manages the operations of a cable operator or an 
MVDDS licensee pursuant to a management agreement shall be considered to 
have an attributable interest in such cable operator or MVDDS licensee, 
if such person or its affiliate has authority to make decisions or 
otherwise engage in practices or activities that determine, or 
significantly influence:
    (i) The nature or types of services offered by such entity;
    (ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (iii) The prices charged for such services.
    (12) Any person or its affiliate who enters into a joint marketing 
arrangement with a cable operator, an MVDDS licensee, or an affiliate of 
such entity, shall be considered to have an attributable interest in 
such cable operator, MVDDS licensee, or affiliate, if such person or its 
affiliate has authority to make decisions or otherwise engage in 
practices or activities that determine:
    (i) The nature or types of services offered by such entity;
    (ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (iii) The prices charged for such services.
    (f) Divestiture. Any cable operator, or any entity owning an 
attributable interest in a cable operator, that would otherwise be 
barred from acquiring an attributable interest in an MVDDS license by 
the eligibility restriction in paragraph (a) of this section, may be a 
party to an MVDDS application (i.e., have an attributable interest in 
the applicant), and such applicant will be eligible for an MVDDS 
license, pursuant to the divestiture procedures set forth in paragraphs 
(f)(1) through (f)(6) of this section.
    (1) Divestiture shall be limited to the following prescribed means:
    (i) An MVDDS applicant holding an attributable interest in a cable 
operator may divest such interest in the cable company.
    (ii) Other MVDDS applicants disqualified under paragraph (a) of this 
section, will be permitted to:
    (A) Partition and divest that portion of the existing service area 
that causes it to exceed the overlap restriction in paragraph (a) of 
this section, subject to applicable regulations of state and local 
governments; or

[[Page 698]]

    (B) Partition and divest that portion of the MVDDS geographic 
service area that exceeds the overlap restriction in paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (iii) Divestiture may be to an interim trustee if a buyer has not 
been secured in the required period of time, as long as the MVDDS 
applicant has no interest in or control of the trustee and the trustee 
may dispose of the license as it sees fit.
    (2) The MVDDS applicant shall certify as an exhibit to its short 
form application that it and all parties to the application will come 
into compliance with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) If such MVDDS applicant is a successful bidder in an auction, it 
must submit with its long-form application a signed statement describing 
its efforts to date and future plans to come into compliance with the 
eligibility restrictions in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (4) If such an MVDDS applicant is otherwise qualified, its 
application will be granted subject to a condition that the applicant 
shall come into compliance with the eligibility restrictions in 
paragraph (a) of this section, within ninety (90) days of final grant of 
such MVDDS license.
    (5) An MVDDS applicant will be considered to have come into 
compliance with paragraph (a) of this section if:
    (i) In the case of the divestiture of a portion of an MVDDS license, 
it has successfully completed the assignment or transfer of control of 
the requisite portion of the MVDDS geographic service area.
    (ii) In all other cases, it has submitted to the Commission a signed 
certification that it has come into compliance with paragraph (a) of 
this section by the following means, identified in such certification:
    (A) By divestiture of a disqualifying interest in a cable operator, 
identified in terms of the interest owned, the owner of such interest 
(and, if such owner is not the applicant itself, the relationship of the 
owner to the applicant), the name of the party to whom such interest has 
been divested, and the date such divestiture was executed; or
    (B) By divestiture of the requisite portion of the cable operator's 
existing service area, identified in terms of the name of the party to 
whom such interest has been divested, the date such divestiture was 
executed, the name of any regulatory agency that must approve such 
divestiture, and the date on which an application was filed for this 
purpose with the regulatory agency.
    (6) If no such certification or application is tendered to the 
Commission within ninety (90) days of final grant of the initial 
license, the Commission may cancel or rescind the license automatically, 
shall retain all monies paid to the Commission, and, based on the facts 
presented, shall take any other action it may deem appropriate.
    Note to paragraph (f): Waivers of Sec. 101.1014(e) may be granted 
upon an affirmative showing: that the interest holder has less than a 
fifty percent voting interest in the licensee and there is an 
unaffiliated single holder of a fifty percent or greater voting 
interest; that the interest holder is not likely to affect the local 
market in an anticompetitive manner; that the interest holder is not 
involved in the operations of the licensee and does not have the ability 
to influence the licensee on a regular basis; and that grant of a waiver 
is in the public interest because the benefits to the public of common 
ownership outweigh any potential anticompetitive harm to the market.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1413  License term and renewal expectancy.

    (a) The MVDDS license term is ten years, beginning on the date of 
the initial authorization grant.
    (b) Application of a renewal expectancy is based on the substantial 
service requirement which is defined as a service that is sound, 
favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service which 
might minimally warrant renewal. At the end of the license term, the 
Commission will consider factors such as:
    (1) Whether the licensee's operations service niche markets or focus 
on serving populations outside of areas serviced by other MVDDS 
licensees;
    (2) Whether the licensee's operations serve populations with limited 
access to telecommunications services; and
    (3) A demonstration of service to a significant portion of the 
population or land area of the licensed area.
    (c) The renewal application of an MVDDS licensee must include the 
following showings in order to claim a renewal expectancy:

[[Page 699]]

    (1) A coverage map depicting the served and unserved areas;
    (2) A corresponding description of current service in terms of 
geographic coverage and population served or transmitter locations in 
the served areas; and
    (3) Copies of any Commission Orders finding the licensee to have 
violated the Communications Act or any Commission rule or policy and a 
list of any pending proceedings that relate to any matter described by 
the requirements for the renewal expectancy.

    Effective Date Note: At 67 FR 43040, June 26, 2002, Sec. 101.1413 
was added. This section contains information collection and 
recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until approval 
has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1415  Partitioning and Disaggregation.

    (a) MVDDS licensees are permitted to partition licensed geographic 
areas along county borders (Parishes in Louisiana or Territories in 
Alaska). Disaggregation will not be permitted by MVDDS licensees in the 
12.2-12.7 GHz band. ``Partitioning'' is the assignment of geographic 
portions of a license along geopolitical or other boundaries. 
``Disaggregation'' is the assignment of discrete portions or ``blocks'' 
of spectrum licensed to a geographic licensee or qualifying entity.
    (b) Eligibility. (1) Parties seeking approval for partitioning shall 
request from the Commission an authorization for partial assignment of a 
license pursuant to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter.
    (2) MVDDS licensees may apply to the Commission to partition their 
licensed geographic service areas to eligible entities and are free to 
partition their licensed spectrum at any time following the grant of a 
license.
    (3) Any existing frequency coordination agreements shall convey with 
the assignment of the geographic area or spectrum, and shall remain in 
effect for the term of the agreement unless new agreements are reached.
    (c) Technical standards. (1) Partitioning. In the case of 
partitioning, applicants and licensees must file FCC Form 603 pursuant 
to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter and list the partitioned service area on a 
schedule to the application.
    (2) The geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, 
minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude and 
must be based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83).
    (d) Unjust enrichment. 12 GHz licensees that received a bidding 
credit and partition their licenses to entities not meeting the 
eligibility standards for such a bidding credit, will be subject to the 
provisions concerning unjust enrichment as set forth in Sec. 1.2111 of 
this chapter.
    (e) License term. The MVDDS license term is ten years, beginning on 
the date of the initial authorization grant. The license term for a 
partitioned license area shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. 101.1413.
    (f) Construction requirements. Applications requesting approval for 
partitioning must include a certification by each party stating that one 
or both parties will satisfy the construction requirement set forth in 
Sec. 101.1413. Failure by a party to meet its respective construction 
requirement will result in the automatic cancellation of its license 
without further Commission action.


<R05>

Sec. 101.1421  Coordination of adjacent area MVDDS stations and incumbent public safety POFS stations.

    (a) MVDDS licensees in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band are required to 
develop sharing and protection agreements based on the design and 
architecture of their systems, in order to ensure that no harmful 
interference occurs between adjacent geographical area licensees. MVDDS 
licensees shall:
    (1) Engineer systems to be reasonably compatible with adjacent and 
co-channel operations in the adjacent areas on all its frequencies; and
    (2) Cooperate fully and in good faith to resolve interference and 
transmission problems that are present on adjacent and co-channel 
operations in adjacent areas.
    (b) Harmful interference to public safety stations, co-channel MVDDS 
stations operating in adjacent geographic areas, and stations operating 
on adjacent channels to MVDDS stations is prohibited. In areas where the 
CEAs are in close proximity, careful consideration should be given to 
power requirements and to the location, height, and radiation pattern of 
the transmitting and receiving antennas. Licensees are expected to 
cooperate fully in attempting to resolve problems of potential 
interference before bringing the matter to the attention of the 
Commission.
    (c) Licensees shall coordinate their facilities whenever the 
facilities have optical line-of-sight into other licensees' areas or are 
within the same geographic area. Licensees are encouraged to develop 
operational agreements with relevant licensees in the adjacent 
geographic areas. Incumbent public safety POFS licensee(s) shall retain 
exclusive rights to its channel(s) within the relevant geographical 
areas and must be protected in accordance with the procedures in 
Sec. 101.103. A list of public safety incumbents is attached as Appendix 
I to the Memorandum Opinion and Order and Second Report and Order, 
Docket 98-206 (released May 23, 2002). Please check with the Commission 
for any updates to that list.

Sec. 101.1423  Canadian and Mexican coordination.

    Pursuant to Sec. 2.301 of this chapter, MVDDS systems in the United 
States within 56 km (35 miles) of the Canadian and Mexican border will 
be granted conditional licenses, until final international agreements 
are approved. These systems may not cause harmful interference to 
stations in Canada or Mexico. MVDDS stations must comply with the 
procedures outlined under Sec. 101.147(p) and Sec. 1.928(f)(1) and (2) 
of this chapter until final international agreements concerning MVDDS 
are signed. Section 1.928(f) of this chapter states that transmitting 
antennas can be located as close as five miles (eight kilometers) of the 
border if they point within a sector of 160 degrees away from the 
border, and as close as thirty-five miles (fifty-six kilometers) of the 
border if they point within a sector of 200 degrees toward the border 
without coordination with Canada. MVDDS licensees shall apply this 
method near the Canadian and Mexican borders. No stations are allowed 
within 5 miles of the borders.


<R05>
Sec. 101.1425  RF safety.

    MVDDS stations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz frequency band do not operate

<R05>
Sec. 101.1440  MVDDS protection of DBS.

    (a) An MVDDS licensee shall not begin operation unless it can ensure 
that the EPFD from its transmitting antenna at all DBS customers of 
record locations is below the values listed for the appropriate region 
in Sec. 101.105(a)(4)(ii). Alternatively, MVDDS licensees may obtain a 
signed written agreement from DBS customers of record stating that they 
are aware of and agree to their DBS system receiving MVDDS signal levels 
in excess of the appropriate EFPD limits specified in 
Sec. 101.105(a)(4)(ii). DBS customers of record are those who had their 
DBS receive antennas installed prior to or within the 30 day period 
after notification to the DBS operator by the MVDDS licensee of the 
proposed MVDDS transmitting antenna site.
    (b) MVDDS licensees are required to conduct a survey of the area 
around its proposed transmitting antenna site to determine the location 
of all DBS customers of record that may potentially be affected by the 
introduction of its MVDDS service. The MVDDS licensee must assess 
whether the signal levels from its system, under its deployment plans, 
would exceed the appropriate EPFD levels in Sec. 101.105(a)(4)(ii) at 
any DBS customer of record location. Using EPFD calculations, terrain 
and building structure characteristics, and the survey results, an MVDDS 
licensee must make a determination of whether its signal level(s) will 
exceed the EPFD limit at any DBS customer of record sites. To assist in 
making this determination, the MVDDS provider can use the EPFD contour 
model developed by the Commission and described in Appendix J of the 
Memorandum Opinion and Order and Second Report and Order, ET Docket 98-
206 or on the OET website at http://www.fcc.gov/oet/dockets/et98-206.
    (c) If the MVDDS licensee determines that its signal level will 
exceed the EPFD limit at any DBS customer site, it shall take whatever 
steps are necessary, up to and including finding a new transmit site, to 
ensure that the

[[Page 702]]

EPFD limit will not be exceeded at any DBS customer location.
    (d) Coordination between MVDDS and DBS licensees. (1) At least 90 
days prior to the planned date of MVDDS commencement of operations, the 
MVDDS licensee shall provide the following information to the DBS 
licensee(s):
    (i) Geographic location (including NAD 83 coordinates) of its 
proposed station location;
    (ii) Maximum EIRP of each transmitting antenna system;
    (iii) Height above ground level for each transmitting antenna;
    (iv) Antenna type along with main beam azimuth and altitude 
orientation information, and description of the antenna radiation 
pattern;
    (v) Description of the proposed service area; and
    (vi) Survey results along with a technical description of how it 
determined compliance with the appropriate EPFD level at all DBS 
subscriber locations.
    (2) No later than forty-five days after receipt of the MVDDS system 
information in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the DBS licensee(s) 
shall provide the MVDDS licensee with a list of any new DBS customer 
locations that have been installed in the 30-day period following the 
MVDDS notification. In addition, the DBS licensee(s) could indicate 
agreement with the MVDDS licensee's technical assessment, or identify 
DBS customer locations that the MVDDS licensee failed to consider or DBS 
customer locations where they believe the MVDDS licensee erred in its 
analysis and could exceed the prescribed EPFD limit.
    (3) Prior to commencement of operation, the MVDDS licensee must take 
into account any new DBS customers or other relevant information 
provided by DBS licensees in response to the notification in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section.
    (e) Beginning thirty days after the DBS licensees are notified of a 
potential MVDDS site under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the DBS 
licensees have the responsibility of ensuring that all future installed 
DBS receive antennas on its system are located in such a way as to avoid 
the MVDDS signal. These later installed receive antennas shall have no 
further rights of complaint against the notified MVDDS transmitting 
antenna(s).
    (f) In the event of a major modification as defined in Sec. 1.929 of 
this chapter, such as the addition of an antenna, to an MVDDS station, 
the procedures of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section and rights of 
complaint begin anew. Exceptions to this are renewal, transfer of 
control, and assignment of license applications.
    (g) Interference complaints. The MVDDS licensee must satisfy all 
complaints of interference to DBS customers of record which are received 
during a one year period after commencement of operation of the 
transmitting facility. Specifically, the MVDDS licensee must correct 
interference caused to a DBS customer of record or cease operation if it 
is demonstrated that the DBS customer is receiving harmful interference 
from the MVDDS system or that the MVDSS signal exceeds the permitted 
EPFD level at the DBS customer location.

    Effective Date Note: At 67 FR 43040, June 26, 2002, Sec. 101.1440 
was added. This section contains information collection and 
recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until approval 
has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.

<R05>
Sec. 201.0  Background.

    National policy with respect to the conservation, allocation and use 
of the Nation's telecommunications resources during crises and 
emergencies is set forth in Executive Order 12472. The following parts 
of this chapter address specific responsibilities with respect to 
management of telecommunications resources and related procedures which 
bear upon provision, restoration and continuity of telecommunications 
services during crises and emergencies. In doing so, the chapter 
encompasses both national security and emergency preparedness 
activities, consistent with Executive Order 12472. This concept of 
national security and emergency preparedness telecommunications services 
(as defined in Sec. 201.2(g)) includes crises that do not necessarily 
entail serious degradation of, or serious threats to, national security. 
It therefore is a broader concept than the term ``national security 
emergency preparedness activities'' in Executive Order 12656, which 
concerns only national security emergencies, and preparedness activities 
necessarily related to such emergencies.


<R05>
Sec. 201.1  Authority.

    (a) Authorities and responsibilities related to and bearing upon 
national security and emergency preparedness telecommunications matters 
are set forth in:
    (1) Section 706 of the Communications Act of 1934 (48 Stat. 1104, 47 
U.S.C. 606), as amended.
    (2) The National Security Act of 1947, as amended (61 Stat. 496, 50 
U.S.C. 402).
    (3) The Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. 
app. 2251 et seq.).
    (4) The Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.).
    (5) The National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and 
Priorities Act of 1976 (90 State. 463, 42 U.S.C. 6611).
    (6) Executive Order 12046, ``Relating to the Transfer of 
Telecommunications Functions,'' March 27, 1978 (43 FR 13349; 3 CFR, 1978

administrative structure consisting of the Executive Agent, the NCS 
Committee of Principals and the Manager. The NCS Committee of Principals 
consists of representatives from those Federal departments, agencies or 
entities, designated by the President, which lease or own 
telecommunications facilities or services of significance to national 
security and emergency preparedness, and, to the extent permitted by 
law, other Executive entities which bear policy, regulatory or 
enforcement responsibilities of importance to national security and 
emergency preparedness telecommunications capabilities. The NCS is a 
confederative arrangement in which member Federal agencies participate 
with their owned and leased telecommunications assets to provide 
necessary communications services for the Federal Government, under all 
conditions, including nuclear war.
    (e) National Coordinating Center (NCC) refers to the joint industry-
government telecommunications entity established by the NCS pursuant to 
Executive Order 12472 to assist in the initiation, coordination, 
restoration and reconstitution of national security and emergency 
preparedness telecommunications services or facilities under all 
conditions of crisis or emergency.
    (f) National priorities means those essential actions and activities 
in which the government and the private sector must become engaged in 
the interests of national survival and recovery.
    (g) National security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP)

telecommunication services which are used to maintain a state of 
readiness or to respond to and manage any event or crisis (local, 
national, or international) which causes or could cause injury or harm 
to the population, damage to or loss of property, or degrades or 
threatens the NS/EP posture of the United States.
    (h) NS/EP treatment refers to the provisioning of a 
telecommunications service before others based on the provisioning 
priority level assigned by the Executive Office of the President.
    (i) National Telecommunications Management Structure (NTMS) means a 
survivable and enduring management structure which will support the 
exercise of the war power functions of the President under section 706 
of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 606), as amended.
    (j) Private sector means those sectors of non-government entities 
that are users of telecommunications services.
    (k) Telecommunications means any transmission, emission, or 
reception of signs, signals, writing, images, graphics, and sounds or 
intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, optical, or other 
electromagnetic systems.
    (l) Telecommunications resources include telecommunications 
personnel, equipment, material, facilities, systems, and services, 
public and private, wheresoever located within the jurisdiction of the 
United States.
    (m) Wartime emergency means a crisis or event which permits the 
exercise of the war power functions of the President under section 706 
of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 606), as amended.


<R05>
Sec. 201.3  Policy.

    (a) The Federal Government is responsible for resources 
mobilization, including determination of the need for and the extent of 
mobilization necessary in all crises and emergencies, wartime and non-
wartime.
    (b) The President has limited non-wartime NS/EP telecommunications 
functions, and wartime NS/EP functions under the Communications Act of 
1934 (as amended), which have been delegated to Federal agencies under 
Executive Order 12472. Federal, State, and local governments share the 
responsibility for conservation of the Nation's telecommunications 
resources.
    (1) The achievement of survival and recovery during a crisis or 
emergency would establish an unavoidable interdependence between and 
among Federal, State, and local authorities; therefore, there should be 
no barriers between Federal and State levels of authorities and between 
State and local levels of authorities which would impede, obstruct, or 
otherwise hinder effective conservation and equitable allocation of 
telecommunications resources and services to the needs of the Nation.

[[Page 707]]

    (2) The Federal Government will rely upon State governments and 
their telecommunications management organizations for management or 
control of intrastate carrier services and continuity of 
interconnectivity with interstate carriers to assure that national 
objectives and priorities are properly served. Applicable regulations of 
the Federal Communications Commission govern the extent of the 
allocation of responsibility between Federal and State authorities for 
the management of NS/EP intrastate carrier services and the 
interconnectivity of intrastate services for NS/EP telecommunications 
functions.
    (c) A system of telecommunications service priorities will be 
established which facilitates the provisioning and early restoration of 
services considered vital to national interests during those events or 
crises which warrant NS/EP treatment.
    (d) The President is authorized during, or in anticipation of, an 
emergency or major disaster (as defined in the Disaster Relief Act of 
19/4) to establish temporary telecommunications systems and to make such 
telecommunications available to State and local government officials and 
such other persons as deemed appropriate (42 U.S.C. 5185).
    (e) The President also is authorized, during war, when necessary in 
the interest of national defense and security, to direct or establish 
priorities for essential communications with any commercial or 
governmental carrier and to prevent obstruction of telecommunications. 
The President may also suspend or amend rules and regulations, close 
stations and facilities, and authorize U.S. government use and control 
of telecommunications resources with regard to:
    (1) Radio communications (during war, or Presidentially declared 
threat of war, public peril, disaster or national emergency or a need to 
preserve the neutrality of the U.S.) and
    (2) Wire communications (during war or threat of war).
    (f) During an attack on the United States by an aggressor nation, 
and in an immediate postattack period, all decisions regarding the use 
of telecommunications resources will be directed to the objective of 
national survival and recovery. In order to achieve this objective, 
postattack resources will be assigned to activities concerned with the 
maintenance and saving of lives, immediate military defense and 
response, and economic activities essential to continued economic 
survival and recovery.
    (g) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will 
serve as the central authority to control, coordinate, and direct the 
activities of the Nation's telecommunications facilities, systems, and 
services during periods of wartime emergency as determined under section 
706 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 606), as amended.
    (h) Telecommunications resources of the Federal Government will be 
employed, as required, to best serve the continuity of government and 
national interests.
    (i) Federal agencies will, in the development of emergency 
operational plans, minimize, to the extent feasible, dependence upon 
telecommunications services for continuity of essential operations.

Sec. 202.0  Objectives.

    (a) During, or in anticipation of, a non-wartime emergency or 
natural disaster, a telecommunications capacity must exist to provide 
temporary telecommunications service to State and local government 
officials and other

[[Page 708]]

persons deemed appropriate by the President.
    (b) In the event of a general war and attack upon the Nation, a 
national telecommunications capability must exist that will support 
telecommunications requirements with respect to national security, 
survival and recovery. The development of survivable telecommunications 
to support essential functions (including an emergency broadcasting 
system), and technical compatibility of signaling methods, transmission 
modes, switching facilities, and terminal devices to permit exchange of 
communications over the surviving media of all systems, government or 
commercial, are crucial elements of such a national capability. In 
addition, a survivable national telecommunications management structure 
is necessary to manage initiation, coordination and restoration of 
telecommunications services. The management structure must include the 
following:
    (1) Legal authority for telecommunications management.
    (2) A control mechanism to manage the initiation, coordination and 
restoration of telecommunications services.
    (3) Procedures to ensure timely damage assessment and allocation of 
residual resources and controlled restoration of services based on 
national policy/direction.
    (4) The capability to execute a telecommunications recovery plan 
based on national policy/guidance.
    (c) Notwithstanding any provision regarding NS/EP Planning and 
Execution, nothing in this part shall be deemed to affect the 
authorities or responsibilities of the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, or any Office or official thereof; or reassign 
any function assigned any agency under the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, or under any other law, 
or any function vested by law in the Federal Communications Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 202.1  Policies.

    (a) The telecommunications resources of the Nation will be available 
for government use during crises and emergencies, wartime and non-
wartime, and to satisfy the needs of the public welfare and safety.
    (b) The National Plan for Telecommunications Support in Non-Wartime 
Emergencies provides procedures for planning and using National 
telecommunications assets and resources in support of non-wartime 
emergencies, including those covered by the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, 
in Presidentially declared Emergencies and Major Disasters, 
Extraordinary Situations, and other emergencies.
    (c) An NS/EP Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) System will 
provide procedures to authorize priority treatment for the provisioning 
and restoration of NS/EP telecommunications services for wartime and 
non-wartime emergencies.
    (d) In wartime emergencies, facilities management will remain 
decentralized to the extent feasible to assure continued flexibility of 
operational response to critical needs, subject to the management 
direction and overriding authority of those officials delegated to act 
for and with the consent of the central point of authority within the 
Federal Government.
    (1) Federally owned, leased, and/or operated telecommunications 
facilities, systems, and networks will be managed during such an 
emergency by the agency normally controlling the facility, system, or 
network except that all operations will be subject to the management 
direction and authority of the officials delegated overall management 
responsibility for Federal Government systems.
    (2) Facilities other than those of the Federal Government, with the 
exception of radio stations in the Aviation Services and certain classes 
of radio stations in the Maritime Services, will be managed by the 
authorized common carrier or other person owning and operating such 
facilities subject to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) guidance 
and direction or in accordance with State or local plans if not subject 
to FCC jurisdiction.
    (3) Radio stations in the Aviation Services and those aboard vessels 
in the Maritime Service will be subject to the control of the Secretary 
of Defense during a national emergency.

[[Page 709]]

    (e) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy is 
the single point of authority within the Federal Government for the 
wartime emergency functions under section 706 of the Communications Act 
(47 U.S.C. 606) with respect to the allocation and use of surviving 
resources in support of national objectives enunciated by the President. 
Authority may be redelegated as necessary and when it can be exercised 
within boundaries established by Presidential authority.
    (f) Radio frequency utilization during a wartime emergency will be 
in accordance with authorizations, assignments, and mobilization plans 
in existence at the onset of the emergency. Subject to the overriding 
control of the Director, OSTP, under the President's War Emergency 
Powers, spectrum management regarding the authorization and assignment 
of radio frequencies will be made by the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration (NTLA) for the Federal Government, and the 
Director, OSTP, through the FCC, for all other entities subject to the 
Commission's jurisdiction. Radio stations are subject to closure if 
considered a threat to national security.
    (g) Section 706 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 
confers authority to the President in the matter of suspension of all 
rules and regulations pertaining to the use and operation of 
telecommunications facilities, public or private during wartime 
emergencies.


<R05>
Sec. 202.2  Criteria and guidance.

    NS/EP planning in government and industry with respect to effective 
conservation and use of surviving telecommunications resources in a 
disaster, emergency or postattack period must provide for orderly and 
uninhibited restoration of services by the carriers and authoritative 
control of services allocation which will assure that priority will be 
afforded the most critical needs of government and the private sector 
with respect to these objectives.
    (a) The preservation of the integrity of characteristics and 
capabilities of the Nation's telecommunications systems and networks 
during wartime or non-wartime emergencies is of the utmost importance. 
This can best be accomplished by centralized policy development, 
planning, and broad direction. Detailed operations management will 
remain decentralized in order to retain flexibility in the use of 
individual systems in responding to the needs of national security, 
survival and recovery. Each Federal agency responsible for 
telecommunications systems operations, and the carriers, are responsible 
for planning with respect to emergency operations. Guidance in this 
matter has been issued from a number of sources and contained in:
    (1) Annex C-XI (Telecommunications), Federal Emergency Plan D 
(Classified).
    (2) National Plan for Telecommunications Support in Non-wartime 
Emergencies.
    (3) The National Communications System Management Plan for Annex

C-XI (Telecommunications) Federal Emergency Plan D (Classified).
    (b) The continuity of essential communications services will be 
maintained through the use of controls and operational procedures to 
assure that priority is given to vital services. NS/EP 
telecommunications services entail policies, procedures and 
responsibilities as described in parts 211 and 213 of this chapter.
    (c) The Nation's telecommunications systems facilities are 
vulnerable to physical and radiological damage. Planning factors with 
respect to the resumption of services in a disaster or postattack period 
must consider the probable loss of facilities which formerly provided 
direct and/or alternate intercity services among surviving population 
centers. Since surviving areas and population centers would serve as the 
sources of support to crippled areas of the Nation, the resumption of 
services between and among surviving metropolitan areas will be a high 
priority with the carriers.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 211.0  Purpose.

    This part establishes policies and procedures under which government 
and private entities will be furnished restoration priorities to insure 
that leased intercity private line telecommunications services vital to 
the national interest will be maintained during the continuance of a war 
in which the United States engaged. It supersedes the Director of 
Telecommunications Management Order of January 15, 1967 (32 FR 791, 47 
CFR 201), which is hereby canceled. To assure the effective ability to 
implement its provisions, and also in order that government and industry 
resources may be used effectively under all conditions ranging from 
national emergencies to international crises, including nuclear attack, 
a single set of rules and procedures is essential, and they must be 
applied on a day-to-day basis so that the priorities they establish can 
be implemented at once when the occasion arises. As provided for in part 
18 of Executive Order 11490, as amended (3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 
820), policies, plans, and procedures developed pursuant to the 
Executive order shall be in consonance with the plans and policies 
contained in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 211.1  Authority.

    (a) Authority to direct priorities for the restoration of 
communications services in national emergencies is vested in the 
President, including authority conferred by section 103 of the National 
Security Act of 1947, as amended (50 U.S.C. 404), section 101 of the 
Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2070), 
section 201 of the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950, as amended (50 
U.S.C. App. 2281), section 1 of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1958, as 
amended (3 CFR, 1954-1958 Comp., p. 447), and section 606 of the Federal 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended. (47 U.S.C. 606).
    (b) Authority to develop plans policies, and procedures for the 
establishment of such restoration priorities has been delegated to the 
National Security Council, by Executive Orders 11051, 11490, and by the 
President's Memorandum of August 21, 1963 (28 FR 9413, 3 CFR part 858 
(1959-63 comp.)), all as amended by Executive Order 12046, (FR 43, 13349

<R05>
Sec. 211.3  Scope and coverage.

    (a) The priority system and procedures established by this part are 
applicable to:
    (1) U.S. domestic leased intercity private line services, including 
private line switched network services;
    (2) U.S. international leased private line services to the point of 
foreign entry;
    (3) Foreign extensions of U.S. international leased private line 
services to the extent possible through agreement between U.S. carriers 
and foreign correspondents;
    (4) International leased private line services terminating in or 
transiting the United States;
    (5) Federal Government-owned and leased circuits.
    (b) The priority system and procedures established by this part are 
not applicable to operational circuits or order wires of the carriers 
needed for circuit reactivation and maintenance purposes, which shall 
have priority of restoration over all other circuits and shall be exempt 
from interruption for the purpose of restoring priority services.


<R05>
Sec. 211.4  Policy.

    During the continuance of a war in which the United States is 
engaged and when the provisions of this part are invoked, all 
communications common carriers shall comply with the following 
principles insofar as possible:
    (a) Whenever necessary to maintain or restore a service having a 
designated priority, services having lower priority, lower subpriority, 
or no priority, will be interrupted in the reverse order of priority 
starting with nonpriority services.
    (b) When services are interrupted to restore priority services, 
carriers will endeavor if feasible to notify users of the reason for the 
preemption.
    (c) When public correspondence circuits are needed to satisfy 
requirements for priority services, idle circuits will be selected 
first. A minimum

[[Page 716]]

number of public correspondence circuits shall at all times be kept 
available so as to provide for the transmission of precedence-type 
messages and calls.
    (d) Communications common carriers will not interrupt conversations 
having priority classification except insofar as necessary to restore 
services of higher priority.
    (e) It is recognized that as a practical matter in providing for the 
maintenance or restoration of a priority service or services operating 
within a multiple circuit-type facility (such as a carrier band, cable, 
or multiplex system), lower priority, lower subpriority, or nonpriority 
services on paralleled channels within a band or system may be restored 
concurrently with higher priority services. Such reactivation shall not, 
however, interfere with the expedited restoration of other priority 
services.
    (f) The Executive Agent is authorized to instruct the carriers on 
the percentage of government-switched network intermachine trunks to be 
restored to provide capacity for priority access line traffic.
    (g) The carriers are authorized to honor NCS-certified priorities 
from other authorized carriers for leased facilities.
    (h) The carriers are authorized to honor restoration priorities 
certified by the Executive Agent.
    (i) To ensure the effectiveness of the system of restoration 
priorities established by this part it is essential that rigorous 
standards be applied. Users are requested and directed to examine their 
private line service requirements in light of the criteria specified in 
this part and with regard to the availability of alternate 
communications facilities such as public correspondence message 
services, and Government-owned emergency communications systems.


<R05>
Sec. 211.5  Priorities.

    There are hereby established four levels of restoration priority. 
Within each level, subpriorities may be established by the Executive 
Agent, with the concurrence of the National Security Council, for both 
government and nongovernment services. The subpriorities categories 
currently in use, which have been established by the Executive Agent 
will remain in effect until modified. Compatibility of subcategories 
applicable to government and nongovernment users is essential to achieve 
the objective of a single restoration priority system.
    (a) Priority 1. Priority 1 shall be the highest level of restoration 
priority, and shall be afforded only to Federal and Foreign Government 
private line services, and to Industrial/Commercial services which are 
designated for prearranged voluntary participation with the Federal 
Government in a national emergency. Circuit requirements in this level 
of priority shall be limited to those esential to national survival if 
nuclear attack occurs for:
    (1) Obtaining or disseminating critical intelligence concerning the 
attack, or immediately necessary to maintain the internal security of 
the United States;
    (2) Conducting diplomatic negotiations critical to the arresting or 
limiting of hostilities;
    (3) Executing military command and control functions essential to 
defense and retaliation;
    (4) Giving warning to the U.S. population;
    (5) Maintaining federal Government functions essential to national 
survival under nuclear attack conditions.
    (b) Priority 2. Priority 2 shall be the second highest level of 
restoration priority, and shall be afforded only to Federal and Foreign 
Government private line services, and to Industrial/Commercial services 
which are designated for prearranged voluntary participation with the 
Federal Government in a national emergency. Circuit requirements in this 
level shall be limited to those essential, at a time when nuclear attack 
threatens, to maintain an optimum defense posture and to give civil 
alert to the U.S. population. These are circuit requirements whose 
unavailability would present serious dangers:
    (1) Reducing significantly the preparedness of U.S. defense and 
retalitory forces;
    (2) Affecting adversely the ability of the United States to conduct 
critical preattack diplomatic negotiations to reduce or limit the threat 
of war;

[[Page 717]]

    (3) Interfering with the effectual direction of the U.S. population 
in the interest of civil defense and survival;
    (4) Weakening U.S. capability to accomplish critical national 
internal security functions;
    (5) Inhibiting the provision of essential Federal Government 
functions necessary to meet a preattack situation.
    (c) Priority 3. Priority 3 shall be the third highest level of 
restoration priority and shall be afforded to government, quais-
government, and Industrial/Commercial private line services: Provided, 
however, That Priority 3 will be afforded circuits serving Industrial/
Commercial, State, county, municipal, and quasi-state and local 
government agencies only where, during an emergency, at least one 
station in the circuit (or in connected circuits if switched service is 
involved) will be manned continually, or where such circuits are 
automated and will be under constant surveillance from a remote 
location. Circuit requirements in this level shall be limited to those 
necessary for U.S. military defense and diplomacy, for law and order, 
and for national health and safety in a national emergency involving 
heightened possibility of hostilities. These are curcuit requirements 
needed to:
    (1) Insure performance of critical logistic functions, public 
utility services, and administrative-military support functions;
    (2) Inform key diplomatic posts of the situation and of U.S. 
intentions;
    (3) Secure and disseminate urgent intelligence;
    (4) Distribute essential food and other supplies critical to health;
    (5) Provide for critical damage control functions;
    (6) Provide for hospitalization;
    (7) Continue critical Government functions;
    (8) Provide transportation for the foregoing activities.
    (d) Priority 4. Priority shall be the fourth highest restoration 
priority and shall be afforded to government, quasi-government, and 
Industrial/Commercial private line services: Provided, however, That 
Priority 4 will be afforded circuits serving Industrial/Commercial, 
State, county, municipal, and quasi-state and local government agencies 
only where, during an emergency, at least one station in the circuit (or 
in connected circuits if switched service is involved) will be manned 
continually, or where such circuits are automated and will be under 
constant surveillance from a remote location. Circuit requirements in 
this level shall be limited to those necessary for the maintenance of 
the public welfare and the national economy in a situation short of 
nuclear attack, or during reconstitution after attack. These include 
circuit requirements needed to continue the more important financial, 
economic, health, and safety activities of the Nation.


<R05>
Sec. 211.6  Submission and processing of restoration priority requests.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided below, all requests for restoration 
priority assignments will be submitted to the Executive Agent in the 
format prescribed by him for processing and certification.
    (b) Priority 3 and 4 applications from county and municipal 
governments, quasi-state and local government agencies and private 
entites shall be forwarded to the Federal Communications Commission for 
its approval and for certification to the carriers. These submissions 
will be in the form prescribed by the Commission.
    (c) Industrial/Commercial entities designated for prearranged 
voluntary participation with the Federal Government in a national 
emergency should submit separate applications to the Commission when 
requesting the assignment of priorities in category 1 or 2. Such 
assignments will require the approval of the National Security Council 
in order to continue to be effective during a war emergency. In all 
cases the justification for restoration priorities will contain a 
validation statement from the Government agency with whom participation 
is prearranged.
    (d) Requests for restoration priority assignments made by Foreign 
Government agencies, except for NATO, NATO national military authority, 
and such other requests as the Executive Agent may be designated, will 
be submitted to the Department of State for initial

[[Page 718]]

evaluation and review. The Department will forward to the Executive 
Agent for processing and approval such of these requests as it finds 
acceptable.
    (e) Requests for restoration priority assignments made by NATO, NATO 
national military authority, and such other requests as the Executive 
Agent may designate, will be forwarded through established Allied Long 
Lines Agency (ALLA) channels to the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary 
will forward to the Executive Agent for processing and approval such of 
these requests as he finds acceptable pursuant to approved NATO/U.S. 
procedures.
    (f) Requests for temporary upgrading of restoration priority 
assignments occasioned by special critical conditions, including natural 
disasters, heightened diplomatic and political tenseness, and tracking 
and control of manned space operations, may be submitted to the 
Executive Agent together with such information as he may require for 
expedited processing decision.
    (g) All assignments, denials and changes of restoration priorities 
and subpriorities are subject to review and modification by the National 
Security Council.
    (h) When requesting service from the carriers the user must include 
the certified restoration priority on the service authorization.


<R05>
Sec. 211.7  Obligation of carriers.

    (a) During the continuance of a war in which the United States is 
engaged, and when the provisions of this part are invoked, all carriers 
shall accord restoration priority assignments certified pursuant to this 
part priority over all other circuits.
    (b) To promote the national interest and defense preparedness, 
carriers shall:
    (1) Maintain such records of restoration priority assignments 
certified pursuant to this part as may be necessary to enable prompt 
implementation;
    (2) Enter into agreements, to the extent possible, with their 
foreign correspondents to effect restoration of the foreign portion of 
leased international services in accordance with this part;
    (3) Notify the Executive Agent of foreign correspondent procedures 
affecting Federal Government services that are not reasonably consistent 
with the priority requirements of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 213.0  Authority.

    (a) The voice and message precedence procedures for departments and 
agencies of the Federal Government prescribed by this part are 
prescribed pursuant to Executive Order No. 12046 (43 FR 13349 et seq.) 
and the President's memorandum of August 21, 1963, which established the 
National Communications System (28 FR 9413; 3 CFR, 1959-1963 Comp., p. 
858).
    (b) The procedures applicable to communications common carriers and 
non-Federal Government users prescribed by this part are prescribed by 
authority conferred upon the President by subsection 606(a) of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and delegated to the National 
Security Council by Executive Order 12046. That authority under section 
606(a) may be exercised only during the continuance of a war in which 
the United States is engaged.


<R05>
Sec. 213.1  Background and purpose.

    (a) The National Security Council and the Federal Communications 
Commission have agreed upon a precedence system for the expeditious 
handling of messages and calls transmitted over Government and public 
correspondence facilities in all types of situations from peacetime to 
massive nuclear attack. Effectuation of that system requires that the 
Director issue a circular and that the Commission concurrently issue an 
order prescribing the standards, procedures, policies, and regulations 
that together, constitute this single integrated precedence system.
    (b) In conformity with that agreement the National Security Council 
is issuing this circular the purpose of

[[Page 720]]

which is to prescribe, on behalf of the President, that part of those 
standards, procedures, policies, and regulations which are within the 
cognizance of the NSC. No significance should be attached to the fact 
that slightly different terms are used in their circular from those used 
in the companion order of the FCC. Those differences result from 
differences in terms in the basic legal authorities of the director and 
the Commission rather than from an intent to denote a distinction in 
purpose or effect.


<R05>
Sec. 213.2  Scope.

    The precedence system contained herein is applicable to:
    (a) Users of Government service facilities, whether owned or leased.
    (b) Users of public correspondence service facilities of the 
communication common carriers, to U.S. domestic and international 
communication common carriers, and to the extent possible by agreement 
between the latter and their foreign correspondents.


<R05>
Sec. 213.3  Cancellation.

    This circular cancels:
    (a) Attachments A and B to Annex 3 of DMO 3000.1, dated November 8, 
1963 (28 FR 12273).
    (b) That portion of the memorandum of the Special Assistant to the 
President for Telecommunications, dated August 27, 1964, pertaining to 
message precedences.


<R05>
Sec. 213.4  Definitions.

    As used herein:
    (a) Public correspondence services means those services offered to 
the general public for communications between all points served by a 
carrier or by interconnected carriers on a nonexclusive message by 
message or call by call basis, as differentiated from leased private 
line services.
    (b) The term precedence means the order in which messages and calls 
are processed. Transmission of information and call completion is 
therefore to be accomplished in the order required by the precedence 
designator. Any such properly categorized communications precede 
noncategorized communications.
    (c) The term Government where used alone means Federal, foreign, 
State, county, or municipal government agencies. Specific reference will 
be made whenever it is intended to apply to less than the whole, e.g., 
State Government, Federal Government, etc.
    (d) The term Foreign Government includes those foreign diplomatic 
and consular establishments and those coalitions or associations of 
governments such as NATO, SEATO, OAS, UN, and associations of 
governments or governmental agencies such as Pan American Union, 
International Postal Union, International Monetary Fund, and similar 
organizations.
    (e) The term message means a written or other form of record 
communication prepared for transmission and delivery at the destination.
    (f) The term call means a request from a user for a connection to 
another station whether for telephone or record communication.


<R05>
Sec. 213.5  Precedence designators.

    (a) The following precedence designators are available for 
Government and public correspondence users:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  Domestic public
            Federal Government                   correspondence and
                                           international telephone calls
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flash....................................  Flash emergency.
Immediate................................  Immediate emergency.
Priority.................................  Priority emergency.
Routine..................................  (No domestic equivalent.)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Government and non-Government users of public correspondence 
services will handle their international messages in accordance with 
current ITU Telegraph Regulations. Government users should note that, 
generally, the only precedence designator available for their use for 
international messages sent over public correspondence circuits if Etat 
Priorite. The ITU Regulations do not contain precedence designators 
which equate to Flash, Immediate, or Priority. Accordingly, Government 
messages whether Flash, Immediate, or Priority precedence when sent over 
international public correspondence circuits will be handled as Etat 
Priorite messages. Thus, Priority messages will receive the same 
treatment in transmission and processing as

[[Page 721]]

Immediate or Flash messages. Conversely, Etat Priorite messages received 
in the United States shall be transmitted and processed in the order of 
receipt, to the extent possible. The precedence designator available for 
non-Government users of public correspondence services is Urgent. The 
Urgent designator is limited for use only during wartime conditions, as 
declared pursuant to section 606 of the Communications Act of 1934.
    (c) Domestic and International U.S. common carriers, insofar as 
practicable by agreement with their foreign correspondents, shall 
endeavor to arrange the proper level of precedence handling of 
international messages and calls originating, terminating in, or 
transiting the United States: Provided, however, That insofar as 
international messages are concerned the level of precedence shall be 
consistent with the International Telecommunication Conventions and 
regulations thereunder.
    (d) The Government designators shall be used throughout the Federal 
Government. All messages and telephone calls sent via public 
correspondence services shall use domestic or international public 
correspondence designators as appropriate. Thus, the responsibility is 
on Government and public correspondence users to recognize and use the 
appropriate designators when using public correspondence services.
    (e) On international telephone calls the carrier's operator will 
convert to the appropriate international designator.


<R05>
Sec. 213.6  Criteria.

    (a) Flash, Flash Emergency. (1) This is the highest order of 
precedence and shall be strictly limited to Federal and Foreign 
Government agencies.
    (2) Flash, or Flash Emergency telephone calls or messages shall be 
handled in the order received and ahead of all calls or messages except 
as indicated for international messages in ITU Regulations. When 
necessary to obtain a circuit for a Flash, or Flash Emergency call any 
call in progress of a lesser precedence will be interrupted, if 
feasible. Any message of a lesser precedence in the process of 
transmission will be halted, if feasible, to clear the channel for the 
Flash or Flash Emergency transmission. Flash or Flash Emergency 
precedence shall be reserved for calls and messages having an immediate 
bearing on:
    (i) Command and control of military forces essential to defense and 
retaliation.
    (ii) Critical intelligence essential to national survival.
    (iii) Conduct of diplomatic negotiations critical to the arresting 
or limiting of hostilities.
    (iv) Dissemination of critical civil alert information essential to 
national survival.
    (v) Continuity of Federal governmental functions essential to 
national survival.
    (vi) Fulfillment of critical U.S. internal security functions 
essential to national survival.
    (vii) Catastrophic events of national or international significance, 
such as Presidential Action Notices essential to national survival 
during attack or preattack conditions.
    (b) Immediate, Immediate Emergency, Urgent. Immediate, Immediate 
Emergency, or Urgent telephone calls or messages shall be handled as 
fast as possible and ahead of all other calls or messages except those 
having a higher precedence. Any message or call of a lower precedence in 
the process of transmission will be halted, if feasible, to clear the 
channel for this transmission. It will be reserved generally for calls 
or messages pertaining to:
    (1) Situations which gravely affect the security of national and 
allied forces.
    (2) Reconstitution of forces in a postattack period.
    (3) Intelligence essential to national security.
    (4) Conduct of diplomatic negotiations to reduce or limit the threat 
of war.
    (5) Implementation of Federal Government actions essential to 
national survival.
    (6) Situations which gravely affect the internal security of the 
United States.
    (7) Civil defense actions concerning direction of our population and 
its survival.

[[Page 722]]

    (8) Disasters or events of extensive seriousness having an immediate 
and detrimental effect on the welfare of the population.
    (9) Vital information having an immediate effect on aircraft, 
spacecraft, or missile operations.
    (c) Priority, Priority Emergency, Urgent. Priority, Priority 
Emergency, or Urgent messages and calls shall take precedence over 
messages or calls designated Routine, or in the case of common carriers, 
over all nonprecedence traffic. Priority, Priority Emergency, or Urgent 
precedence is generally reserved for calls or messages which require 
expeditious action. Examples are calls or messages pertaining to:
    (1) Information on locations where attack is impending or where fire 
or air support will soon be placed.
    (2) Air-ground integrated operations.
    (3) Important intelligence.
    (4) Important diplomatic information.
    (5) Important information concerning the launch, operation, or 
recovery of spacecraft or missiles.
    (6) Movement of naval, air, and ground forces.
    (7) Coordination between governmental agencies concerning the 
performance of emergency preparedness functions.
    (8) Major civil aircraft accidents.
    (9) Maintaining the public health, safety, and the welfare of our 
population.
    (10) Critical logistic functions, provisions of critical public 
utility services, and administrative military support functions.
    (11) Distributing essential food and supplies critical to health.
    (12) Accomplishing tasks necessary to insure critical damage control 
functions.
    (13) Preparations for adequate hospitalization.
    (14) Continuity of critical Government functions.
    (15) Arranging minimum transportation for accomplishing the 
aforesaid functions.
    (16) Continuing or reestablishing our more important financial, 
economic, health, and safety activities. Producing, procuring, and 
distributing food materials and supplies which are considered necessary 
to the immediate support of a war effort, the national defense, or for 
expediting the means of meeting the effects of natural disasters.
    (17) Prompt delivery of information by press representatives to news 
media organizations and newspapers covering news of national or 
widespread disasters.
    (d) Routine; no domestic equivalent. Routine precedence designation 
applies to those normal day-to-day communications which require rapid 
transmission by telephone or message, but do not require urgent or 
preferential handling.


<R05>
Sec. 213.7  Policies.

    (a) Calls and messages in each precedence classification above shall 
have no precedence over others within the same classification, except 
where, within the same classification, they cannot be handled 
simultaneously. Then, they shall be handled in the order of their 
receipt.
    (b) Individuals whose requirements qualify them to use the 
precedence system share the responsibility for insuring its 
effectiveness. Users must familiarize themselves with the purposes to be 
served by the use of each precedence designator. It must be remembered 
that the entire system will operate successfully only if the use of the 
precedence designator is limited strictly to the intended purposes. Each 
user must consider whether each message or call requires any special 
precedence and exercise care not to specify a higher precedence than 
circumstances require.
    (c) For public correspondence message services, the domestic or 
international precedence designators shall be shown in full by the 
sender as the first word preceding the name of the addressee.
    (d) For public correspondence call services, the user should first 
attempt to complete the call in the normal manner. In the event the user 
is unable to complete the call and the type of communication falls 
within one of the precedence categories listed herein the call should be 
filed with an operator for completion and the user must specify the 
required precedence handling by stating that this is a Flash Emergency,

[[Page 723]]

Immediate Emergency, or Priority Emergency call, whichever the case may 
be.
    (e) Any apparent misuse of precedence indicators by non-Federal 
Government activities brought to the attention of the communication 
common carriers shall be referred to the FCC on and after-the-fact 
basis.
    (f) Any apparent misuse by Federal Government activities brought to 
the attention of the communication common carriers shall be referred to 
the Executive Agent, National Communications System. The Executive Agent 
will refer any matter which cannot be resolved with the cognizant 
Government activity to the National Security Council, for decision.
    (g) It is essential to provide public message and call capability 
for the transmission of military, governmental, and essential non-
Government precedence messages and calls. Private line services for 
military, governmental, and other essential users are protected under a 
Priority System for Intercity Private Line Services promulgated by the 
FCC (FCC Order 67-51) and the National Security Council. However, during 
national emergencies, military, governmental, and other essential users 
will have additional requirements for prompt completion of precedence 
traffic over public correspondence communication common carrier 
facilities. Therefore, notwithstanding the provisions of the above-
described Priority System for Intercity Private Line Services, 
communication common carriers shall have available a minimum number of 
public correspondence circuits at all times so as to provide for the 
transmission of precedence type messages and calls. Normally, the 
communication common carriers shall use their judgment in determining 
this number of circuits required for public correspondence precedence 
traffic. However, the authority is reserved to the National Security 
Council or the Federal Communications Commission, as appropriate to the 
time and situation, to revise the decisions of the carriers respecting 
the allocation of circuits, and to resolve any questions which are 
referred to them by the carriers or the users.


<R05>
Sec. 213.8  Implementation.

    Federal departments and agencies are authorized to issue such 
additional orders as are necessary to effect implementation of this 
circular.

proclamation by the President that there exists war, or a threat of war 
or a state of public peril or other wartime emergency or in order to 
preserve the neutrality of the United States. These procedures will be 
applied in the coordination, application for, and assignment of radio 
frequencies upon order of the Director, OSTP. These procedures are 
intended to be consistent with the provisions and procedures contained 
in emergency plans for use of the radio spectrum.

[[Page 724]]


<R05>
Sec. 214.3  Assumptions.

    When the provisions of this part become operative, Presidential 
emergency authority, including Executive Order 12656, 12472, 12046 (3 
CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 820), and other emergency plans regarding the 
allocation and use of national resources will be in effect. During an 
attack, and in a postattack period, the Director, OSTP, will have 
authority to make new or revised assignments of radio frequencies in 
accordance with authority delegated by the President.


<R05>
Sec. 214.4  Planned actions.

    (a) Whenever it is determined necessary to exercise, in whole or in 
part, the President's emergency authority over telecommunications, the 
Director, OSTP, will exercise that authority as specified in Executive 
Order 12472 (49 FR 13471; 3 CFR, 1984 Comp., p. 193).
    (b) In this connection, and concurrently with the war or national 
emergency proclamation by the President, the Director will:
    (1) Authorize the continuance of all frequency authorizations issued 
by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) 
and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), except as they may 
otherwise be modified or revoked by the Director, OSTP, in the national 
interest;
    (2) Redelegate to the Secretary of Defense the authority necessary 
to control the use of the radio spectrum in areas of active combat, 
where such control is necessary to the support of U.S. military 
operations;
    (3) Close all non-government radio stations in the international 
broadcasting service as defined in the FCC rules and regulations, except 
those carrying or scheduled to carry U.S. Government-controlled radio 
broadcasts.


<R05>
Sec. 214.5  Responsibilities.

    (a) The Director, OSTP, will issue such policy guidance, rules, 
regulations, procedures, and directives as may be necessary to assure 
effective frequency usage during wartime emergency conditions.
    (b) The FCC, in coordination with NTIA, shall issue appropriate 
rules, regulations, orders, and instructions and take such other actions 
not inconsistent with the actions of the Director, OSTP, and the NTIA 
Emergency Readiness Plan for Use of the Radio Spectrum as may be 
necessary to ensure the effective use of those portions of the radio 
spectrum shared by Government and non-governments users.
    (c) The FCC shall assist the Director in the preparation of 
emergency plans pursuant to section 3(h)(3) of Executive Order 12472.
    (d) Each Federal Government agency concerned shall develop and be 
prepared to implement its own plans, and shall make necessary 
preemergency arrangements with non-government entities for the provision 
of desired facilities or services, all subject to the guidance and 
control of the Director.


<R05>
Sec. 214.6  Postattack procedures and actions.

    (a) The frequency management staff supporting the Director, OSTP, 
comprised of predesignated personnel from the frequency management 
staffs of the government user agencies, NTIA and the FCC, will have 
proceeded to the OSTP relocation site in accordance with alerting orders 
in force.
    (b) Government agencies having need for new radio frequency 
assignments or for modification of existing assignments involving a 
change in the frequency usage pattern shall, unless otherwise provided, 
submit applications therefor to the Director, OSTP, by whatever means of 
communication are available and appropriate, together with a statement 
of any preapplication coordination accomplished. The Director, OSTP, 
will review such applications accomplish the necessary additional 
coordination insofar as practicable, consider all pertinent views and 
comments, and grant or deny, as he shall determine, the assignment of 
such frequencies. All concerned will be informed promptly of his 
decisions.
    (c) Non-Government entities having need for new radio frequency 
assignments or for modifications of existing assignments will continue 
to submit applications therefor to the FCC, or in accordance with FCC 
instructions. Such applications shall be coordinated with the Director, 
OSTP, and granted subject to the approval of the Director, OSTP, or his 
delegate.

[[Page 725]]

    (d) All changes of radio frequency usage within U.S. military 
theaters of operation will be coordinated with the Director, OSTP, where 
harmful interference is likely to be caused to stations authorized to 
operate within the United States and its possessions.
    (e) Where submission to the Director, OSTP, is impracticable, the 
applicant shall:
    (1) Consult the NTIA Emergency Readiness Plan for use of the Radio 
Spectrum and the Government Master File;
    (2) Accomplish such coordination as appropriate and possible;
    (3) Act in such manner as to have a minimum impact upon established 
services, accepting the responsibility entailed in taking the temporary 
action required;
    (4) Advise the Director, OSTP, as soon as possible of the action 
taken, and submit an application for retroactive approval.

<R05>
Sec. 215.0  Purpose and authority.

    The purpose of this part is to designate a focal point within the 
Federal Government for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) information 
concerning telecommunications. It is issued pursuant to the authority of 
Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977, 42 FR 56101, 91 Stat. 1633, as 
amended (5 U.S.C. appendix), Executive Order 12472, (49 FR 13471; 3 CFR, 
1984 Comp., p. 193), ``Assignment of National Security and Emergency 
Preparedness Telecommunications, April 3, 1984 and Executive Order 
12046, 43 FR 13349, ``Relating to the Transfer of Telecommunications 
Functions,'' May 27, 1978, as amended by Executive Order 12472.


<R05>
Sec. 215.1  Background.

    (a) The nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is part of the complex 
environment produced by nuclear explosions. It consists of transient 
voltages and currents which can cause malfunctioning and serious damage 
to electrical and electronic equipment.
    (b) The Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA) is the overall technical 
coordinator for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and DOE laboratories on 
matters concerning nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons effects, and nuclear 
weapons testing. It acts as the focal point between the service 
laboratories and other agencies. The National Communications System 
(NCS), with the Defense Communications Agency (DCA), maintains a data 
base for telecommunications. DCA also provides the primary capability 
for the NCS to conduct telecommunications survivability studies for 
civil and military departments and agencies.
    (c) In order to disseminate among affected Federal agencies 
information concerning the telecommunications effects of EMP and 
available protective measures, and in order to avoid duplication of 
research efforts, it is desirable to designate a focal point within the 
Federal Government for telecommunications EMP matters.


<R05>
Sec. 215.2  Assignment of responsibilities.

    The Executive Agent, NCS, shall be the focal point within the 
Federal Government for all EMP technical data and studies concerning 
telecommunications. It shall provide such data and the results of such 
studies to all appropriate agencies requesting them. It shall coordinate 
and approve EMP telecommunications tests and studies, and shall keep the 
National Security Advisor informed regarding such tests and studies 
being conducted and planned.

switched services is limited to (a) provisioning of such services (e.g., 
business, centrex, cellular, foreign exchange, Wide Area Telephone 
Service (WATS) and other services that the selected vendor is able to 
provision), and (b) restoration of services that the selected vendor is 
able to restore.)
    (2) Services which are provided by government and/or non-common 
carriers and are interconnected to common carrier services assigned a 
priority level pursuant to paragraph 13 of this directive.
    b. Control Services and Orderwires. The NSEP TSP System and 
procedures implemented in this directive are not applicable to authorize 
priority treatment to control services or orderwires owned by a service 
vendor and needed for provisioning, restoration, or maintenance of other 
services owned by that vendor. Such control services and orderwires 
shall have priority of provisioning and restoration over all other 
telecommunication services (including NSEP services) and shall be exempt 
from preemption. However, the NSEP TSP System and procedures implemented 
in this directive are applicable to control services or orderwires 
leased by a service vendor or user from another service vendor.
    c. Other Services. The NSEP TSP System may apply, at the discretion 
of and upon special arrangements by the entities involved, to authorize 
priority treatment to the following telecommunication services:
    (1) Government or non-common carrier services which are not 
connected to common carrier provided services assigned a priority level 
pursuant to paragraph 13 of this directive.
    (2) Portions of U.S. international services which are provided by 
foreign correspondents. (Subject to pertinent law, including references 
4a, 4c, and 4f, U.S. telecommunication service vendors are encouraged to 
ensure that relevant operating arrangements are consistent to the 
maximum extent practicable with the NSEP TSP System. If such agreements 
do not exist, U.S. telecommunication service vendors should handle 
service provisioning and/or restoration in accordance with any system 
acceptable to their foreign correspondents which allows provisioning and 
restoration in the manner most comparable to the procedures established 
in this directive.) In addition, the U.S. government, acting through the 
Department of State, may enter into the following types of agreements to 
ensure that priority provisioning and restoration procedures consistent 
with those governing domestic services within the NSEP TSP System are in 
place: (a) Bilateral agreements for reciprocal priority treatment for 
critical foreign government telecommunication services in the U.S., and 
(b) multilateral agreements within such international telecommunication 
organizations as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Allied Long 
Lines Agency or Civil Communications Planning Committee, which have or 
are conducive to having a provisioning and restoration priority system.
    d. Subpriority and Precedence Systems. Service users may implement 
subpriority and/or precedence systems that are consistent, and do not 
conflict with, the NSEP TSP System.
    8. Policy. The NSEP TSP System is the regulatory, administrative, 
and operational system authorizing and providing for priority treatment 
(i.e., provisioning, and restoration) of NSEP telecommunication services 
(see definition in appendix). As such, it establishes the framework for 
NSEP telecommunication service vendors to provision, restore, or 
otherwise act on a priority basis to ensure effective NSEP 
telecommunication services. The NSEP TSP System allows the assignment of 
priority levels to any NSEP service across three time periods, or stress 
conditions: Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization, Attack/War, and Post-Attack/
Recovery. All requests for priority level assignments will be processed 
through the Manager, NCS. Although priority levels normally will be 
assigned by the Manager, NCS, and retained by service vendors, only for 
the current time period, they may also be preassigned for the other two 
time periods at the request of service users who are able to identify 
and justify, in advance, their wartime or post-attack NSEP 
telecommunication requirements. Absent such preassigned priority levels 
for the Attack/War and Post-Attack/Recovery periods, priority level 
assignments for the Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization period will remain in 
effect. At all times, priority level assignments will be subject to 
revision

[[Page 737]]

by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC); or, on an interim basis, 
the Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP); and the 
Manager, NCS, based upon changing NSEP needs. No other system of 
telecommunication service priorities which conflicts with the NSEP TSP 
System is authorized.
    9. Legal Basis for the NSEP TSP System. The laws and regulations 
authorizing the NSEP TSP System are those cited above in paragraphs 3 
and 4.
    a. Communications Act. Sections 1, 4(i), and 201 thru 205 of the 
Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C., 151, 154(i), and 201 thru 205) 
grant to the FCC the authority over assignment and approval of 
priorities for provisioning and restoration of common carrier-provided 
telecommunication services. Under section 706 of the Communications Act, 
this authority may be superseded, and expanded to include privately 
owned telecommunication services, by the war emergency powers of the 
President of the United States.
    b. Executive Order No. 12472. In Executive Order No. 12472, the 
President tasked the NCS to assist the Director, OSTP, in the exercise 
of the President's war emergency powers. Executive Order No. 12472 also 
directs the Manager, NCS, to assist the Director, OSTP, in executing 
those functions by developing plans and procedures for the management, 
allocation and use (including the establishment of priorities and 
preferences) of federally owned or leased telecommunication assets.
    c. Federal Rules. The FCC and Executive Office of the President 
(EOP) have used their respective authorizations to develop and establish 
the NSEP TSP System as the one uniform system of priorities for the 
provisioning and restoration of NSEP telecommunication services, both 
before and after invocation of the section 706 Presidential war 
emergency powers. The Federal rules governing the NSEP TSP System have 
been promulgated by the FCC and OSTP (on behalf of the EOP) in title 47 
of the Code of Federal Regulations. In those rules, the FCC has 
requested the EOP to administer the NSEP TSP System before the 
invocation of section 706 of the Communications Act, Presidential war 
emergency powers. In this directive, the EOP assigns to the Manager, 
NCS, both this administrative authority to administer the NSEP TSP 
System before, and the President's statutory authority to administer the 
NSEP TSP System after, the invocation of the section 706 Presidential 
war emergency powers.
    d. Defense Production Act. The Defense Production Act of 1950 
authorizes the President to require the priority performance of 
contracts and orders necessary to promote national defense. It also 
authorizes the President to allocate materials and facilities as 
necessary to promote national defense. Pursuant to the Defense 
Production Act, regulations promulgated by the Department of Commerce in 
the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) permit the 
assignment of ``priority ratings'' to equipment associated with NSEP 
telecommunication services warranting priority treatment, if they 
support authorized programs under Schedule I of the DPAS.
    e. Contracts. NSEP telecommunication service users may also employ 
contractual mechanisms to obtain the priority provisioning or 
restoration of service, including customer premises equipment and 
wiring. However, any such contractual arrangements must be consistent 
with NSEP TSP System rules and regulations, including any priority order 
of provisioning and restoration assigned in accordance with the NSEP TSP 
System.
    10. Responsibilities.
    a. Federal Communications Commission. As authorized by the 
Communications Act the FCC will:
    (1) Provide regulatory oversight of implementation of the NSEP TSP

System Oversight Committee a summary report identifying the time and 
event associated with each invocation of NSEP treatment under paragraph 
13c of this directive and section 10c of 47 CFR part 64; whether the 
NSEP service requirement was adequately handled; and whether any 
additional charges were incurred. These reports will be due by April 
30th for the preceding July through December and by October 31st for the 
preceding January through June time periods.
    (3) Function (on a discretionary basis) as a sponsoring Federal 
organization. (See paragraph 10d below.)
    d. Sponsoring Federal Organizations. Sponsoring Federal 
organizations will:
    (1) Review and decide whether to sponsor private industry (including 
telecommunication service vendors) requests for priority actions. 
Federal organizations will forward sponsored requests with 
recommendations for disposition to the Manager, NCS. Recommendations 
will be based on paragraph 16 of this directive.
    (2) Forward notification of priority actions or denials of requests 
for priority actions to the requesting private industry entities, for 
disposition.
    (3) Cooperate with the Manager, NCS, during reconciliation, 
revalidation, and audits.
    e. Departments of State and Defense. The Departments of State and 
Defense will, in addition to the responsibilities listed in paragraph 
10h below:
    (1) Review and decide whether to sponsor requests for priority level 
assignments from foreign governments and forward sponsored requests to 
the Manager, NCS, with recommendations for disposition. Recommendations 
will be based on paragraph 16 of this directive and whether or not 
priority treatment is afforded to U.S. NSEP telecommunication service 
requirements in the foreign country concerned.
    (2) Forward notification of priority actions or denials of requests 
for priority actions to the requesting foreign government entities, for 
disposition.
    f. Department of Energy. The Department of Energy will, in addition 
to the responsibilities listed in paragraph 10h below:
    (1) Review and decide whether to sponsor public and private 
interstate power utility company requests for priority actions and 
forward sponsored requests with recommendations for disposition to the 
Manager, NCS. Recommendations will be based on paragraph 16 of this 
directive. This does not preclude public and private power utility

[[Page 739]]

companies from obtaining sponsorship elsewhere.
    (2) Forward notification of priority actions or denials of requests 
for priority actions to the requesting public and private power utility 
companies for disposition.
    g. Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Federal Emergency 
Management Agency will, in addition to the responsibilities listed in 
paragraph 10h below:
    (1) Review and decide whether to sponsor state and local government 
requests for priority actions and forward sponsored requests with 
recommendations for disposition to the Manager, NCS. Recommendations 
will be based on paragraph 16 of this directive.
    (2) Forward notification of priority actions or denials of requests 
for priority actions to the requesting state and local government 
entities, for disposition.
    h. Federal Organizations. Federal organizations will:
    (1) Ensure that NSEP TSP System users within each organization 
comply with their obligations under the NSEP TSP System.
    (2) Provision and restore government-provided services (which are 
interconnected with commercially provided services assigned a priority 
level pursuant to paragraph 13 of this directive) in accordance with 
NSEP TSP System rules and regulations. (See paragraph 7a(2) of this 
directive.)
    (3) Function (on a discretionary basis) as sponsoring Federal 
organizations for private sector service users (e.g., government 
contractors).
    (4) Cooperate with the Manager, NCS, during reconciliation, 
revalidation, and audits.
    i. Service Users. Service users, or entities acting on their behalf, 
will:
    (1) Identify services requiring priority level assignments and 
request and justify priority level assignments in accordance with this 
directive and any supplemental NCS issuances.
    (2) Justify and revalidate all priority level assignments at least 
every three years.
    (3) For services assigned priority levels, ensure (through 
contractual means or otherwise) availability of customer premises 
equipment and wiring necessary for end-to-end service operation by the 
service due date, and continued operation; and, for such services in the 
Emergency NSEP category, by the time that vendors are prepared to 
provide the services. Additionally, designate the organization 
responsible for the service on an end-to-end basis.
    (4) Be prepared to accept services assigned priority levels by the 
service due dates or, for services in the Emergency NSEP category, when 
they are available.
    (5) Pay vendors any authorized costs associated with services that 
are assigned priority levels.
    (6) Report to vendors any failed or unusable services that are 
assigned priority levels.
    (7) Designate a 24-hour point-of-contact for matters concerning each 
request for priority action and apprise the Manager, NCS.
    (8) Upon termination of services that are assigned priority levels, 
or circumstances warranting revisions in priority level assignment 
(e.g., expansion of service), request and justify revocation or 
revision.
    (9) When NSEP treatment is invoked under paragraph 13c of this 
directive, within 90 days following provisioning of the service 
involved, forward to the Manager, NCS complete information identifying 
the time and event associated with the invocation and regarding whether 
the NSEP service requirement was adequately handled and whether any 
additional charges were incurred.
    (10) Cooperate with the Manager, NCS, during reconciliation, 
revalidation, and audits.
    j. Service Vendors. Service vendors will comply with the provisions 
of 47 CFR part 64. When those provisions are superseded by the 
President's war emergency powers under section 706 of the Communications 
Act, vendors will continue to comply with 47 CFR part 64, subject to 
further direction by Director, OSTP.
    11. Preemption of Existing Services. When necessary to provision or 
restore NSEP services, service vendors may preempt services they provide 
as specified below. ``User,'' as used in this section, means any user of 
a telecommunications service, to include both NSEP and non-NSEP 
services. Prior consent by a preempted user is not required.
    a. The sequence in which existing services may be preempted to 
provision NSEP services assigned a provisioning priority level ``E'' or 
restore NSEP services assigned a restoration priority level from ``1'' 
through ``5'':
    (1) Non-NSEP services: If suitable spare services are not available, 
then, based on the considerations in 47 CFR part 64 and the service 
vendor's best judgement, non-NSEP services will be preempted. After 
ensuring a sufficient number of public switched services will remain 
available for public use, based on the service vendor's best judgement, 
such services may be used to satisfy a requirement for provisioning or 
restoring NSEP services.
    (2) NSEP Services: If no suitable spare or non-NSEP services are 
available, then existing NSEP services may be preempted to provision or 
restore NSEP services with higher priority level assignments. When this 
is necessary, NSEP services will be selected for preemption in the 
inverse order of priority level assignment.
    (3) Service vendors who are preempting services will ensure their 
best effort to notify the service user of the preempted service and 
state the reason for and estimated duration of the preemption.

[[Page 740]]

    b. Service vendors may, based on their best judgement, determine the 
sequence in which existing services may be preempted to provision NSEP 
services assigned a provisioning priority of ``1'' through ``5.'' 
Preemption is not subject to the consent of the user whose service will 
be preempted.
    12. Requests for Priority Actions. All service users are required to 
submit requests for priority actions through the Manager, NCS, in the 
format and following the procedures prescribed by the Manager.
    13. Assignment, Approval, Use, and Invocation of Priority Levels.
    a. Assignment and Approval of Priority Levels and Priority Actions.
    (1) Priority level assignments or other priority actions will be 
based upon section 16, NSEP TSP System Categories, Criteria, and 
Priority Levels, of this directive. A priority level assignment or other 
priority action made by the Manager, NCS, will serve as the 
recommendation of the Director, OSTP (on behalf of the EOP) to the FCC. 
If the Director, OSTP does not approve the priority level assignment or 
other priority action made by the Manager, NCS, then the Director can 
direct the Manager, NCS, to revise or revoke the priority level 
assignment or other priority action.
    (2) Until the President's war emergency powers under Section 706 of 
the Communications Act are invoked, priority level assignments or other 
priority actions must be approved by the FCC. (If the FCC does not 
approve the priority level assignment or other priority action, then it 
can direct the Manager, NCS, to revise or revoke the priority level 
assignment or other priority action.) However, the FCC has instructed 
service vendors to implement any priority level assignments or other 
priority actions that are pending FCC approval.
    (3) After invocation of the President's war emergency powers, the 
requirement for FCC approval of priority level assignments or other 
priority actions may be superseded by other procedures issued by the 
Director, OSTP.
    b. Use of Priority Level Assignments.
    (1) All provisioning and restoration priority level assignments for 
services in the Emergency NSEP category will be included in initial 
service orders to vendors. Provision priority level assignments for 
Essential NSEP services, however, will not usually be included in 
initial service orders to vendors. NSEP treatment for Essential NSEP 
services will be invoked and provisioning priority level assignments 
will be conveyed to service vendors only if the vendors cannot meet 
needed service dates through the normal provisioning process.
    (2) Any revision or revocation of either provisioning or restoration 
priority level assignments will also be transmitted to vendors.
    (3) Service vendors shall accept priority levels and/or revisions 
only after assignment by the Manager, NCS. (Note: Service vendors acting 
as prime contractors for NSEP services will accept assigned NSEP 
priority levels only when they are accompanied by the Manager, NCS 
designated service identification (i.e., TSP Authorization Code). 
However, service vendors are authorized to accept priority levels and/or 
revisions from users and contracting activities before assignment by the 
Manager, NCS when service vendors, users, and contracting activities are 
unable to communicate with either the FCC, Director, OSTP, or the 
Manager, NCS. Processing of Emergency NSEP service requests will not be 
delayed for verification purposes.
    c. Invocation of NSEP Treatment. To invoke NSEP treatment for the 
priority provisioning of an NSEP telecommunications service, an 
authorized Federal official either within, or acting on behalf of, the 
service user's organization must make a written or oral declaration to 
concerned service vendor(s) and the Manager, NCS, that NSEP treatment is 
being invoked. Authorized Federal officials include the head or director 
of a Federal agency, commander of a unified/specified military command, 
chief of a military service, or commander of a major military command; 
the delegates of any of the foregoing; or any other officials as 
specified in supplemental procedures issued by the Manager, NCS. The 
authority to invoke NSEP treatment may be delegated only to a general or 
flag officer of a military service, civilian employee of equivalent 
grade (e.g., Senior Executive Service member), Federal Coordinating 
Officer or Federal Emergency Communications Coordinator/Manager, or any 
other such officials specified in supplemental procedures issued by the 
EOP. Delegates must be designated as such in writing, and written or 
oral invocations must be accomplished, in accordance with supplemental 
procedures issued by the Manager, NCS.
    14. Resubmission of Circuits Presently Assigned Restoration 
Priorities. All circuits assigned restoration priorities must be 
reviewed for eligibility for initial restoration priority level 
assignment under the provisions of this directive. Circuits assigned 
restoration priorities, and for which restoration priority level 
assignments are requested under paragraph 12 of this directive, will be 
resubmitted to the Manager, NCS. To resubmit such circuits, service 
users will comply with applicable provisions of paragraphs 10i and 13 of 
this directive.
    15. Appeal. Service users or sponsoring Federal organizations may 
appeal any priority level assignment, denial, revision, revocation, 
approval, or disapproval to the Manager, NCS within 30 days of 
notification to the service user. The appellant must use the form or 
format required by the Manager,

[[Page 741]]

NCS and must serve the FCC with a copy of its appeal. The Manager, NCS 
will act on the appeal within 90 days of receipt. Service users and 
sponsoring Federal organizations may only then appeal directly to the 
FCC. Such FCC appeal must be filed within 30 days of notification of the 
Manager, NCS' decision on appeal. Additionally, the Manager, NCS may 
appeal any FCC revisions, approvals or disapprovals to the FCC. All 
appeals to the FCC must be submitted using the form or format required. 
The party filing its appeal with the FCC must include factual details 
supporting its claim and must serve a copy on the Manager, NCS and any 
other party directly involved. Such party may file a response within 20 
days, and replies may be filed within 10 days thereafter. The Commission 
will not issue public notices of such submissions. The Commission will 
provide notice of its decision to the parties of record. Any appeals to 
the Manager, NCS that include a claim of new information that has not 
been presented before for consideration may be submitted at any time.
    16. NSEP TSP System Categories, Criteria, and Priority Levels.
    a. General. NSEP TSP System categories and criteria, and permissible 
priority level assignments, are defined and explained below.
    (1) The Essential NSEP category has four subcategories (i.e., 
National Security Leadership; National Security Posture and U.S. 
Population Attack Warning; Public Health, Safety, and Maintenance of Law 
and Order; and Public Welfare and Maintenance of National Economic 
Posture). Each subcategory has its own criteria. Criteria are also shown 
for the Emergency NSEP category, which has no subcategories.
    (2) Priority levels of ``1,'' ``2,'' ``3,'' ``4,'' and ``5'' may be 
assigned for provisioning and/or restoration of Essential NSEP 
telecommunication services. However, for Emergency NSEP 
telecommunication services, a priority level ``E'' is assigned for 
provisioning. A restoration priority level from ``1'' through ``5'' may 
be assigned if an Emergency NSEP service also qualifies for such a 
restoration priority level under the Essential NSEP category.
    (3) The NSEP TSP System allows the assignment of priority levels to 
any NSEP telecommunications service across three time periods, or stress 
conditions: Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization, Attack/War, and Post-Attack/
Recovery. Priority levels will normally be assigned only for the first 
time period. These assigned priority levels will apply through the onset 
of any attack, but it is expected that they would later be revised by 
surviving authorized telecommunication resource managers within the 
Executive Office of the President based upon specific facts and 
circumstances arising during the Attack/War and Post-Attack/Recovery 
time periods.
    (4) Service users may, for their own internal use, assign 
subpriorities to their services assigned priority levels. Receipt of and 
response to any such subpriorities is optional for service vendors.
    (5) The following paragraphs provide a detailed explanation of the 
categories, subcategories, criteria, and priority level assignments, 
beginning with the Emergency NSEP category.
    b. Emergency NSEP. Telecommunication services in the Emergency NSEP 
category are those new services so critical as to be required to be 
provisioned at the earliest possible time, without regard to the costs 
of obtaining them.
    (1) Criteria. To qualify under the Emergency NSEP category, the 
service must meet the criteria of directly supporting or resulting from 
at least one of the following NSEP functions:
    (a) Federal government activity responding to a Presidentially 
declared disaster or emergency as defined in the Disaster Relief Act (42 
U.S.C. 5122).
    (b) State or local government activity responding to a 
Presidentially, state, or locally declared disaster or emergency.
    (c) Response to a state of crisis declared by the National Command 
Authorities (e.g., exercise of presidential war emergency powers under 
Section 706 of the Communications Act, supra).
    (d) Efforts to protect endangered U.S. personnel or property.
    (e) Response to an enemy or terrorist action, civil disturbance, 
natural disaster, or any other unpredictable occurrence that has damaged 
facilities whose uninterrupted operation is critical to NSEP or the 
management of other ongoing crises.
    (f) Certification by the head or director of a Federal agency, 
commander of a unified/specified command, chief of a military service, 
or commander of a major military command, that the telecommunications 
service is so critical to protection of life and property or to NSEP 
that it must be provided immediately.
    (g) A request from an official authorized pursuant to the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. and 18 U.S.C. 
2511, 2518, 2519).
    (2) Priority Level Assignment.
    (a) Services qualifying under the Emergency NSEP category are 
assigned priority level ``E'' for provisioning.
    (b) After 30 days, assignments of provisioning priority level ``E'' 
for Emergency NSEP services are automatically revoked unless extended 
for another 30-day period. A notice of any such revocation will be sent 
to service vendors.
    (c) For restoration, Emergency NSEP services may be assigned 
priority levels under

[[Page 742]]

the provisions applicable to Essential NSEP services (see paragraph 
16.c.). Emergency NSEP services not otherwise qualifying for restoration 
priority level assignment as Essential NSEP may be assigned a 
restoration priority level ``5'' for a 30-day period. Such 30-day 
restoration priority level assignments will be revoked automatically 
unless extended for another 30-day period. A notice of any such 
revocation will be sent to service vendors.
    c. Essential NSEP. Telecommunication services in the Essential NSEP 
category are those required to be provisioned by due dates specified by 
service users, or restored promptly, normally without regard to 
associated overtime or expediting costs. They may be assigned priority 
levels of ``1,'' ``2,'' ``3,'' ``4,'' or ``5'' for both provisioning and 
restoration, depending upon the nature and urgency of the supported 
function, the impact of a lack of service or service interruption upon 
the supported function, and, for priority access to public switched 
services, the user's level of responsibility. Priority level assignments 
will be valid for no more than three years unless revalidated. To be 
categorized as Essential NSEP, a telecommunications service must qualify 
under one of the four subcategories described below: National Security 
Leadership; National Security Posture and U.S. Population Attack 
Warning; Public Health, Safety, and Maintenance of Law and Order; or 
Public Welfare and Maintenance of the National Economic Posture. (Note: 
Under emergency circumstances, Essential NSEP telecommunication services 
may be recategorized as Emergency NSEP and assigned a priority level

Telecommunications Operations--Shared Resources (SHARES) High Frequency 
                           (HF) Radio Program

September 30, 1988.

    1. Purpose. This directive establishes National Communications 
System (NCS) policies pertaining to operation and use of the Shared 
Resources (SHARES) High Frequency (HF) Radio Program.
    2. Applicability. This directive is binding upon NCS and other 
Executive entities who voluntarily elect to participate in the SHARES HF 
Radio Program.
    3. Authority. This directive is issued under the authority of 
Executive Order No. 12472, ``Assignment of National Security and 
Emergency Preparedness Telecommunications Functions,'' April 3, 1984, 49 
FR 13471 (1984); and NCS Directive 1-1, ``National Communications System 
(NCS) Issuance System,'' November 30, 1987.
    4. References.
    a. Executive Order (E.0.) No. 12472, ``Assignment of National 
Security and Emergency Preparedness Telecommunications Functions,'' 
April 3, 1984, 49 FR 13471 (1984).
    b. National Telecommunications & Information Administration (NTIA), 
``Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency 
Management,'' May, 1986 Edition as revised May, 1987 or current edition/
revision.
    5. General.
    a. E.O. No. 12472 established national policy guidance in support of 
National Security Emergency Preparedness (NSEP) objectives. Executive 
Order No. 12472 mandates that action be taken to ``. . . ensure that a 
national telecommunications infrastructure is developed . . .''. 
Consistent with the Executive Order, functionally similar government 
telecommunications networks should be designed to interchange traffic in 
support of national leadership requirements.
    b. The SHARES HF Radio Program will provide a backup capability to 
exchange critical information among Federal entities to support NSEP. 
Federally controlled HF radio resources will be shared to establish a 
robust NSEP HF radio communications infrastructure. The program involves 
a collection of existing Federally controlled HF radio stations that 
inter-operate to transmit NSEP messages when normal means of 
communication are not available.
    6. Policy.
    a. Any participating Federal entity will accept, to the extent that 
acceptance does not interfere with the mission responsibilities of the 
entity, emergency messages of other Federal entities, or other 
components of the same entity, for transmission by HF radio to the 
addressee or to another participant for relay to the addressee.
    b. A SHARES message is an emergency message to be sent via the 
SHARES network. It consists of information that must be communicated to 
a Federal entity and is of critical importance to the Federal 
Government, the entity's mission, and/or involves the preservation of 
life and the protection of property.
    c. Transmission of SHARES messages will be guided by the policy of 
the agency accepting the message. Advice that a ``SHARES Message'' is to 
be transmitted will serve to notify operating personnel that a critical 
NSEP message requirement exists, and implicitly, that normal 
communication paths are not available.
    7. Responsibilities.
    a. NCS entities participating in the SHARES HF Radio Program will, 
to the maximum extent possible:

[[Page 746]]

    (1) Identify HF stations under their control for participation in 
the SHARES Program.
    (2) Maintain the operational readiness of their SHARES HF stations.
    (3) Provide updated information as necessary for inclusion in a 
SHARES HF Radio Program Directory. Use of Federal frequencies for SHARES 
traffic shall be in accordance with National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration (NTIA) ``Manual of Regulations and Procedures 
for Federal Radio Frequency Management.''
    (4) Ensure participation of available stations in scheduled 
exercises.
    (5) Provide representation, as required, at meetings, briefings, 
conferences, and other official SHARES HF Radio Program activities.
    b. The Manager, NCS, will administer the SHARES HF Radio Program and 
perform the management functions defined below:
    (1) Publish and periodically update, as NCS issuances, a User 
Manual, giving detailed procedures for using SHARES HF Radio Program 
capabilities, and HF Directory of participating Federally controlled HF 
radio stations.
    (2) Develop, schedule, and administer periodic exercises of the 
SHARES HF Radio Program capabilities.
    (3) Perform other functions, as necessary, to improve SHARES 
capabilities.
    8. Authorizing Provision. NCS manuals implementing this directive 
are authorized.
    9. Effective Date. This directive is effective immediately.
    10. Expiration. This directive is in effect until superseded or 
cancelled.

<R04>
                     Subpart A--General Information


<R05>
Sec. 301.1  Purpose.

    Pursuant to Public Law 105-261 (112 Stat. 1920), private sector 
entities are required to reimburse Federal users for relocation of 
Federal Government stations from one or more frequencies due to 
reallocation. Reimbursement costs are in addition to funds paid by the 
non-Government licensee in connection with grant of the license by the 
Federal Communications Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 301.10  Applicability.

    (a) Affected bands. (1) These provisions apply to Government 
assignments in the following bands of frequencies located below 3 GHz:
    (i) 216 to 220 MHz.
    (ii) 1432 to 1435 MHz.
    (iii) 1710 to 1755 MHz.
    (iv) 2385 to 2390 MHz.

    (2) NTIA will identify additional bands that may become subject to 
this part in a public notice and request for comments published in the 
Federal Register.
    (b) Availability of comparable facility. The Federal entity will not 
be required

[[Page 750]]

to relocate until a comparable facility, or modification to an existing 
facility, is available in enough time to determine comparability, make 
adjustments, and ensure a seamless handoff. The factors to be considered 
in determining comparability include at least communications throughput, 
system reliability, operating costs, and operational capability as 
defined in this part. These factors may not be appropriate to determine 
comparable facility for certain Federal Government stations required to 
relocate, such as radar systems.
    (c) Frequency assignments eligible for reimbursement. (1) Equipment 
modification/Retuning. To the extent that a Federal entity that is 
required to relocate is able to modify/retune its equipment with the 
result that the modified equipment provides operational capabilities 
comparable with the original system, reimbursement will be limited to 
the marginal costs associated with modification/retuning.
    (2) Old assignments/new assignments. Old assignments are those that 
were authorized prior to October 17, 1998 (i.e., 216-220 MHz, 1432-1435 
MHz, 1710-1755 MHz, 2385-2390 MHz). New assignments are those 
assignments in the affected bands that were authorized after October 17, 
1998. New assignments in the affected bands are not eligible for 
reimbursement under these rules.
    (3) Exempted Federal power agencies and other exempted assignment. 
Frequency assignments in the 1710--1755 MHz band that are exempt from 
reallocation requirements are not required to relocate and therefore are 
not entitled to reimbursement under these rules. Federal agencies may 
accept reimbursement for relocation costs of exempted assignments in 
cases of voluntary relocation.
    (4) Experimental stations. Frequency assignments for experimental 
stations or experimental testing stations are not entitled to 
reimbursement under this part. Reimbursement shall apply to experimental 
stations that have been certified for spectrum support prior to October 
17, 1998 by NTIA for stage 3 developmental tests under section 10.3.1. 
of the NTIA Manual of Federal Regulations and Procedures for Federal 
Radio Frequency Management. This manual is available on NTIA's website 
at http://www.ntia.doc.gov/osmhome/redbook/redbook.html. The manual is 
also available from the U.S. Government Printing Office (S/N: 903-008-
0025-3).
    (5) Certain other government stations. Other exempted stations 
identified under the 1995 Spectrum Reallocation Final Report and the 
1998 Spectrum Reallocation Report are not required to relocate and 
therefore are not entitled to reimbursement under these rules. These 
agencies may, however, accept reimbursement for relocation costs in 
cases of voluntary relocation.
    (d) Sunset of reimbursement rights. There is no sunset of 
reimbursement rights for affected agencies.
    (e) Authority. The rules set forth in this subpart in no way affect 
what authority, if any, has been delegated to the Federal entity to 
negotiate or contract on behalf of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 301.20  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    (a) The term allocation means an entry in the National Table of

information related to a frequency assignment that has been determined 
pursuant to Executive Order 12958 or any predecessor order or successor 
executive order to require protection against unauthorized disclosure 
and that is marked as ``confidential,''

[[Page 751]]

``secret,'' or ``top secret'' to indicate its classified status when in 
documentary form.
    (e) The term Commission or FCC means the Federal Communications 
Commission.
    (f) The term communications throughput means the amount of 
information transferred within the system for a given amount of time. 
For digital systems, the communications throughput is measured in bits 
per second (bps); for analog systems, the communications throughput is 
measured by the number of voice, video or data channels.
    (g) The term comparable facility means that the replacement facility 
restores the operational capabilities of the original facility to an 
equal or superior level taking into account at least four factors: 
Communications throughput, system reliability, operating costs, and 
operational capability.
    (h) The term experimental station means a station utilizing radio 
waves in experiments with a view to the development of science or 
technique.
    (i) The term experimental testing station refers to an experimental 
station used for the evaluating or testing of electronics equipment or 
systems, including site selection and transmission path surveys.
    (j) The term Federal entity means any department, agency or other 
instrumentality of the Federal Government that utilizes a Government 
station authorization obtained under section 305 of the Communications 
Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 305).
    (k) The term in-kind means the value of non-cash contributions 
provided by non-Federal private parties. In-kind contributions may be in 
the form of real property, equipment, supplies and other expendable 
property, and the value of goods and services directly benefitting and 
specifically identifiable to the project or program.
    (l) The term licensee refers to a person awarded a license by the 
Federal Communications Commission for use of the bands identified in 
Sec. 301.10. The transfer or assignment of a license does not change the 
time periods established in these rules.
    (m) The term marginal costs means the costs that will be incurred by 
a Federal entity to achieve comparable capability of systems relocated 
to a new frequency assignment or band or otherwise modified. 
Specifically, marginal costs would include all engineering, equipment, 
software, site acquisition and construction costs, as well as any 
legitimate and prudent transaction expenses, including outside 
consultants, and reasonable additional costs incurred by the Federal 
entity that are attributable to relocation, including increased 
recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities. Marginal 
costs would include costs related to the need to achieve comparable 
capability when replacing, modifying or reissuing equipment in order to 
relocate when the systems that must be procured or developed have 
increased functionality due to technological growth. Marginal costs do 
not include costs related to optional increased functionality that is 
independent of the need to achieve comparable capability. To the extent 
that a Federal entity needs to accelerate the introduction of systems 
and equipment to allow for relocation earlier than the Federal entity 
had planned, replacement costs of the accelerated systems and equipment 
shall be included in marginal costs. Marginal costs would also include 
the costs of any modification or replacement of equipment, software, 
facilities, operating manuals, training costs, or regulations that are 
attributable to relocation. Marginal costs would not include costs 
related to routine upgrades and operating costs and lifecycle 
replacements that would have occurred absent the need to relocate 
pursuant to these rules.
    (n) The term mediation means a flexible and voluntary dispute 
resolution procedure in which a specially trained mediator facilitates 
negotiations to reach a mutually agreeable resolution. The mediator may 
not dictate a settlement. The mediation process involves one or more 
sessions in which counsel, parties and the mediator participates, and 
may continue over the period of time specified in this part. The 
mediator can help the parties improve communication, clarify interests, 
and probe the strengths and weaknesses of positions. The mediator can 
also identify areas of agreement and help generate options that lead to 
a settlement.

[[Page 752]]

    (o) The term NTIA means the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration.
    (p) The term operational costs means the cost to operate and 
maintain the Federal entity's replacement facility. New licensees would 
compensate Federal entities for any increased recurring costs associated 
with the replacement facilities for five years after relocation. Such 
costs shall include, but not be limited to, additional rental payments 
and increased utility fees.
    (q) The term operational capability means the measure of a system's 
ability to perform its validated functions within doctrinal 
requirements, including service, joint service, and allied 
interoperability requirements with related systems.
    (r) The term relocation refers to the process of moving a system 
that is displaced as a result of reallocation.
    (s) The term sensitive assignment refers to those assignments whose 
operations or technical parameters are not releasable to the public 
under the Freedom of Information Act.
    (t) The term system reliability means the percentage of time 
information is accurately transmitted within a system. The reliability 
of a system is a function of equipment failures (e.g., transmitters, 
feed lines, antennas, receivers and battery back-up power), the 
availability of the frequency channel given the propagation 
characteristics (e.g., frequency, terrain, atmospheric condition and 
noise), and equipment sensitivity. System reliability also includes the 
ability of a radio-communications station to perform a required function 
under stated conditions for a stated period of time. System reliability 
may involve three concepts: Attaining a specified level of performance; 
the probability of achieving that level; and maintaining that level for 
a specified time. For digital systems, system reliability shall be 
measured by the percentage of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a 
desired value; and for analog transmissions, this would be measured by 
the percentage of time that the received carrier-to-noise ratio exceeds 
the receiver threshold.

   Subpart B--Procedure for Reimbursement for Relocations and Dispute 
                               Resolution


<R05>
Sec. 301.100  Costs to relocate.

    (a) Relocation costs. The licensee is required to reimburse the 
Federal entity for all costs incurred as a result of modification, 
retuning and/or relocation.
    (b) Method of reimbursement. Reimbursement payments shall be made in 
advance of relocation and may be in cash or in-kind as agreed to by the 
affected Federal entity. Any such payment in cash shall be deposited in 
the account of such Federal entity in the Treasury of the United States 
or in a separate account as authorized by law. If actual costs are less 
than the payments made, the Federal entity shall refund the difference.


<R05>
Sec. 301.110  Notification of marginal costs.

    (a) NTIA shall provide the Federal entity's estimated marginal cost 
information to the FCC at least 180 days prior to the date on which the 
FCC schedules an auction to commence. Marginal costs, as defined in 
Sec. 301.20(l), are the costs that will be incurred by a Federal entity 
to achieve comparable capability of systems relocated to a new frequency 
assignment or band or otherwise modified. Any Federal entity that 
proposes to relocate, modify or retune shall notify NTIA at least 240 
days before the auction of the marginal costs anticipated to be 
associated with relocation or with modifications necessary to 
accommodate prospective licensees. The information provided to NTIA must 
also include the name and telephone number of a person within the 
Federal entity that can be contacted by the auction winner or licensee.
    (b) Unclassified assignments. NTIA will provide the following 
information to the FCC prior to the date on which the FCC scheduled the 
auction to commence with respect to unclassified Government facilities:
    (1) List of Government facilities.
    (2) Government agency operating each facility.
    (3) Location of each facility.

[[Page 753]]

    (4) General type of operation and equipment.
    (5) Whether the facility can be retuned, modified, or must be 
relocated.
    (6) Estimated marginal cost of retuning, modification, or 
relocation.
    (7) Total estimated costs for all assignments.
    (c) Classified assignments. Prior to the date on which the FCC has 
scheduled an auction to commence, Federal entities located on the 
spectrum to be auctioned will provide a single, consolidated and 
unclassified figure to NTIA for the cost of relocating, retuning, or 
modifying all such classified systems. NTIA will provide this 
information to the FCC which in turn will provide the figure to bidders 
with the following conditions: To the extent it is consistent with 
national security considerations, the figure may be broken down by 
geographical location and spectrum block to give those bidding on a 
geographic basis the best indication possible of the cost they may have 
to pay to relocate, retune or modify the systems at issue. Following the 
auction, the winner may apply for a facility clearance pursuant to the 
National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual and related 
individual security clearances. If those clearances and accesses are 
granted, classified information may be made available with regard to 
certain Government systems in accordance with the terms and conditions 
prescribed in the clearances and accesses provided, and subject to the 
overall rules and authorities found in Executive Order 12958, Executive 
Order 12968, and related Federal laws, rules and regulations.
    (d) Sensitive assignments. Prior to the date on which the FCC has 
scheduled an auction to commence, Federal entities will provide a 
single, consolidated and unclassified figure to NTIA for the cost of 
relocating, retuning, or modifying all such sensitive systems. NTIA will 
provide this information to the FCC which in turn will provide the 
figure to bidders with the following conditions: To the extent it is 
consistent with the sensitive nature of the assignment, the figure may 
be broken down by geographical location and spectrum block to give those 
bidding on a geographic basis the best indication possible of the cost 
they may have to pay to relocate, retune or modify the systems at issue. 
Following the auction, the Government agency shall release the sensitive 
information to the winning licensee pursuant to a non-disclosure 
agreement, if required.


<R05>
Sec. 301.120  Negotiations and mediation.

    (a) Within 30 days after public notice of the grant of a license for 
use of the bands identified in Sec. 301.10, the licensee is required to 
provide the Federal entity that occupies the band with written 
notification of such event. Public notice of the grant commences the 
135-day period for negotiation or mediation. During this period, parties 
are encouraged to resolve any differences with respect to relocation or 
modification costs or any other related issues, either through party-to-
party negotiations and/or a third party mediator. Each party shall pay 
its own costs for negotiation and mediation. If, at the end of the 135-
day period, the parties have not reached an agreement with respect to 
relocation, the parties may agree to extend the negotiation period.
    (b) Good faith obligation. The parties are required to negotiate in 
good faith. Good faith means that:
    (1) Neither party may refuse to negotiate; and
    (2) Each party must behave in a manner necessary to facilitate the 
relocation process in a timely manner. Classified or sensitive 
information will be treated in accordance with Sec. 301.110.


<R05>
Sec. 301.130  Non-binding arbitration.

    If the parties have not reached agreement to extend the negotiation/
mediation period, or if a previously extended negotiation/mediation 
period expires, the parties shall enter into non-binding arbitration. 
The parties shall agree on an arbitrator, and the arbitrator may not be 
the same person as the mediator if mediation has been used by the 
parties and failed. The parties may design such rules for arbitration as 
deemed appropriate. The arbitrator's non-binding written decision may be 
requested by NTIA as part of the record in its determination on a 
petition for relocation under Sec. 301.140. The decision may be a 
factor, among other

[[Page 754]]

things, in the NTIA determination on a petition for relocation. Each 
party shall pay its own costs for arbitration and share equally the cost 
of the arbitrator.


<R05>
Sec. 301.140  Petition for relocation.

    (a) In general. A licensee seeking to relocate a Federal Government 
station must submit a petition for relocation to NTIA. A copy of the 
petition must also be simultaneously provided to the FCC. NTIA's 
determination shall be set forth in writing within six months after the 
petition for relocation has been filed, and be provided to the auction 
winner and the Federal entity. NTIA shall limit or terminate the Federal 
entity's operating license within six months after receiving the 
petition if the following requirements are met:
    (1) The person seeking relocation of the Federal Government station 
has guaranteed to pay all modification and relocation costs incurred by 
the Federal entity, including all engineering, equipment, site 
acquisition and construction, and regulatory fees;
    (2) All activities necessary for implementing the relocation or 
modification have been completed, including construction of replacement 
facilities (if necessary and appropriate) and identifying and obtaining 
new frequencies for use by the relocated Federal Government station 
(where such station is not relocating to spectrum reserved exclusively 
for Federal use);
    (3) Any necessary replacement facilities, equipment modifications, 
or other changes have been implemented and tested to ensure that the 
Federal Government station is able to accomplish its purposes; and
    (4)(i) NTIA has determined that the proposed use of the spectrum 
frequency band to which the Federal entity will relocate its operations 
is
    (A) Consistent with obligations undertaken by the United States in 
international agreements and with United States national security and 
public safety interests; and
    (B) Suitable for the technical characteristics of the system band 
and consistent with other uses of the band.
    (ii) In exercising its authority, NTIA shall consult with the 
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, or other appropriate 
officers of the Federal Government.
    (5) If these requirements are not met, NTIA shall notify the 
petitioner that the request is declined and the reasons for denial.
    (6) If NTIA does not issue a determination under this section within 
6 months of the filing of a Petition for Relocation, the Petition for 
Relocation is deemed to be denied.
    (7) In making its determination under this section, NTIA shall 
consult with the affected Federal entity and the Office of Management 
and Budget and other executive branch agencies.
    (b) Petition after agreement between the parties. The licensee may 
file a petition for relocation pursuant to Sec. 301.140 at anytime after 
the parties have reached agreement on relocation in negotiations or 
mediation as provided in Sec. 301.120 and submit the agreement as 
evidence of having met the requirements of the Petition for Relocation.
    (c) Petition after failure to reach an agreement. If the parties 
fail to reach an agreement as provided in Sec. 301.120 and non-binding 
arbitration has occurred pursuant to Sec. 301.130, the licensee may file 
a petition for relocation with NTIA after a decision has been rendered 
by the arbitrator. Any recommended decision by the arbitrator may be 
requested by NTIA as part of the record in a petition for relocation 
under Sec. 301.140. The recommended decision may be a factor, among 
others, in the NTIA determination on the Petition for Relocation.


<R05>
Sec. 301.150  Request for withdrawal.

    As an alternative to a Petition for Relocation, if the parties reach 
an agreement in negotiations or mediation or agree with the decision of 
the arbitrator, the Federal entity may seek voluntary withdrawal of the 
assignments that are the subject of the relocation.
