                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1999), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, and parts 
and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also 
included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

                               THIS TITLE

    Title 48--Federal Acquisition Regulations System is composed of 
seven volumes. The chapters in these volumes are arranged as follows: 
Chapter 1 (parts 1 to 51), chapter 1 (parts 52 to 99), chapter 2 (parts 
201 to 299), chapters 3 to 6, chapters 7 to 14, chapters 15 to 28 and 
chapter 29 to end. The contents of these volumes represent all current 
regulations codified under this title of the CFR as of October 1, 1999.

    The Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 1 are those 
government-wide acquisition regulations jointly issued by the General 
Services Administration, the Department of Defense, and the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Chapters 2 through 99 are 
acquisition regulations issued by individual government agencies. Parts 
1 to 69 in each of chapters 2 through 99 are reserved for agency 
regulations implementing the Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 
1 and are numerically keyed to them. Parts 70 to 99 in chapters 2 
through 99 contain agency regulations supplementing the Federal 
acquisition regulations.

    The OMB control numbers for the Federal Acquisition Regulations 
System appear in section 1.106 of chapter 1. For the convenience of the 
user section 1.106 is reprinted in the Finding Aids section of the 
second volume containing chapter 1 (parts 52 to 99).

    The first volume, containing chapter 1 (parts 1 to 51), includes an 
index to the Federal acquisition regulations.

    For this volume, Melanie L. Marcec was Chief Editor. The Code of 
Federal Regulations publication program is under the direction of 
Frances D. McDonald, assisted by Alomha S. Morris.

<R04>
               Subpart 301.1--Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
301.101  Purpose.

    (a) The Department of Health and Human Services Acquisition 
Regulation (HHSAR) is issued to establish uniform acquisition policies 
and procedures for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
which conform to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) System.
    (b) The HHSAR implements and supplements the FAR. (Implementing 
material expands upon or indicates the manner of compliance with related 
FAR material. Supplementing material is new material which has no 
counterpart in the FAR.)
    (c) The HHSAR contains all formal departmental policies and 
procedures that govern the acquisition process or otherwise control 
contracting relationships between the Department's contracting offices 
and contractors.


<R05>
301.102  Authority.

    The HHSAR is prescribed by the Assistant Secretary for Management 
and Budget under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 301 and section 205(c) of the 
Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 
U.S.C. 486(c)), as delegated by the Secretary. The Assistant Secretary 
for Management and Budget has redelegated the authority to establish all 
departmental acquisition policy and publish all acquisition regulations 
to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Management and

[[Page 6]]

Acquisition. This authority is not redelegable.

[49 FR 13961, Apr. 9, 1984, as amended at 54 FR 24342, June 7, 1989]


<R05>
301.103  Applicability.

    The FAR and HHSAR apply to all HHS acquisitions as stated in FAR 
1.103. Unless specified otherwise, these regulations apply to 
acquisitions within and outside the United States.


<R05>
301.104  Issuance.


<R05>
301.104-1  Publication and code arrangement.

    (a) The HHSAR is also published in the same forms as indicated in 
FAR 1.104-1(a).
    (b) The HHSAR is issued in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as 
Chapter 3 of Title 48, Department of Health and Human Services 
Acquisition Regulation. It may be referenced as ``48 CFR Chapter 3.''


<R05>
301.104-2  Arrangement of regulations.

    (a) General. The HHSAR conforms to the FAR with respect to 
divisional arrangements; i.e., subchapters, parts, subparts, sections, 
subsections, and paragraphs.
    (b) Numbering. The FAR System of numbering permits the keying of the 
same or similar subject matter throughout Chapters 1 (FAR) and 3 
(HHSAR). However, unlike the FAR numbering scheme, our scheme varies 
somewhat in the numbering to the left of the decimal point. Whereas the 
FAR only identifies the part number to the left of the decimal point, 
our corresponding reference identifies the chapter as well. For example, 
this corresponding paragraph in the FAR is numbered 1.104-2(b) where 
``1'' is the part number (may be one or two digits and is followed by a 
decimal point), ``1'' (to the right of the decimal point) is the subpart 
number, ``04'' (always two digits) is the section number, ``2'' is the 
subsection number (always hyphenated), and ``(b)'' is the paragraph 
reference. The corresponding HHSAR reference is 301.104-2(b) where the 
``3'' or first digit is the chapter number assigned to the particular 
department or agency (may be two digits) and the ``01'' represents the 
part number (part numbers will always be two digits for agencies 
implementing the FAR). The remaining numbers are identical to and 
represent the same divisions as the FAR example.
    (c) References and citations. (1) Unless otherwise stated, 
references, indicate parts, subparts, sections, subsections, etc, of 
this regulation, the HHSAR.
    (2) This regulation shall be referred to as the Department of Health 
and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR). Any reference may be 
cited as ``HHSAR'' followed by the appropriate number. Within the HHSAR, 
the number alone will be used.
    (3) Citations of authority shall be incorporated where necessary. 
All FAR reference numbers shall be preceded by ``FAR''.


<R05>
301.104-3  Copies.

    Copies of the HHSAR in Federal Register and CFR form may be 
purchased by the public from the Superintendent of Documents, Government 
Printing Office (GPO), Washington, DC 20402. Lose-leaf copies of the 
HHSAR may be obtained by departmental personnel having a need for the 
document by placing an order with a Directives Distribution Coordinator 
in accordance with General Administration Manual Chapter 1-00, HHS Staff 
Manual System.

collection and recordkeeping requirements contained in this regulation:

301.270  Executive Committee for Acquisition.

    (a) The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Management and Acquisition 
has established the Executive Committee for Acquisition (ECA) to assist 
and facilitate the planning and development of departmental acquisition 
policies and procedures and to assist in responding to other agencies 
and organizations concerning policies and procedures impacting the 
Federal acquisition process.
    (b) The ECA consists of members and alternates from the Office of

301.271  Timing of HHSAR revisions.

    HHSAR revisions will be issued throughout the year as the need 
arises. HHSAR material shall become effective on the date cited in the

distributes it to HHSAR Staff Manual holders, unless otherwise 
indicated.


<R04>
              Subpart 301.3--Agency Acquisition Regulations


<R05>
301.301  Policy.

    (a)(1) The FAR and HHSAR are intended to provide all necessary 
regulatory guidance for the conduct of the

[[Page 8]]

acquisition process within the Department. However, there may be some 
rare instances where regulations are necessary to implement and/or 
supplement the FAR and/or HHSAR at the Operating Division (OPDIV) level 
or lower. The Department discourages the proliferation of OPDIV and 
lower level issuances, but will allow lower level issuances when deemed 
pertinent.

[49 FR 13961, Apr. 9, 1984, as amended at 50 FR 23126, May 31, 1985; 50 
FR 38004, Sept. 19, 1985]


<R05>
301.302  Limitations.

    The same limitations applicable to the FAR also apply to the HHSAR.


<R05>
301.303  Publication and codification.

    (a) The HHSAR shall be codified in Chapter 3 of Title 48, Code of 
Federal Regulations. Any OPDIV or lower implementation or 
supplementation of the HHSAR or FAR shall also be codified as part of 
Chapter 3. Implementing material is that which expands upon or indicates 
the manner of compliance with related higher level material. 
Supplementing material is that for which there is no counterpart. Where 
material in the FAR requires no implementation, there will be no 
corresponding number in the HHSAR. Thus, there are gaps in the HHSAR 
sequence of numbers where the FAR, as written, is deemed adequate. 
Supplementary material shall be numbered as specified in FAR 1.303.

[49 FR 13961, Apr. 9, 1984, as amended at 50 FR 23126, May 31, 1985; 50 
FR 38004, Sept. 19, 1985]


<R05>
301.304  Agency control and compliance procedures.

    (a) Whenever an OPDIV or lower level organization determines a need 
for an acquisition regulation not covered by the FAR or HHSAR or wishes 
to implement or supplement the coverage in either, the organization 
shall prepare a memorandum that explains the need, background, 
justification, and significant aspects of the proposed regulation and 
send it, together with an outline, to the Director, Office of 
Acquisition and Grants Management. The Director will analyze the request 
to determine if it has applicability to the HHSAR or FAR; if not, the 
Director will either approve or disapprove the request for incorporation 
into the organization's acquisition regulation. If the request is 
approved, the organization must prepare the proposed regulation in 
Federal Register format, obtain all necessary concurrences, including 
Office of General Counsel--Business and Administrative Law Division, and 
send it to the Director, Office of Acquisition and Grants Management for 
review and approval. The regulation must be prepared for signature by 
the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Management and Acquisition. All 
regulations will be required to be processed through the public 
rulemaking process in the Federal Register.
    (b) Only the organizations listed in paragraph (d) are authorized to 
established acquisition regulations. As of the date of issuance of the 
HHSAR, no acquisition regulations below the HHSAR level exist, and the 
procedures detailed in paragraph (a) must be followed to initiate the 
establishment of an OPDIV or lower level regulation.
    (c) Under no circumstances shall any organization's implementation 
or supplementation of the FAR or HHSAR conflict with, supersede, or 
repeat, paraphrase, or otherwise restate policies or procedures 
prescribed by these regulatory issuances. OPDIV or lower level material 
shall follow the numbering system, format, and arrangement of the FAR 
and HHSAR and will be applicable only within the organization issuing 
it. One copy of all OPDIV or lower level material issued in loose-leaf 
format shall be furnished the Director, Office of Acquisition and Grants 
Management at the times of issuance.
    (d) Material issued by OPDIV or lower level organizations to 
implement and supplement the HHSAR and FAR shall be identified by 
prefixes to the digit 3 (indicating Chapter 3-HHSAR) as follows, and 
shall use the same numbering system as the HHSAR:

Each OPDIV or lower level acquisition regulation will be included in its 
entirety as a separate appendix to 48 CFR Chapter 3. The Director, 
Office of Acquisition and Grants Management will assign the appendix 
designation upon approval of the initial request to establish the OPDIV 
or lower level acquisition regulation.

<R05>
301.470  Procedure.

    (a) When a contracting activity or contracting office determines 
that a deviation is needed, it shall prepare a deviation request in 
memorandum form and forward it through administrative channels to the 
official designated as stated in 301.403 or 301.404. In an exigency 
situation, the contracting activity or contracting office may request a 
deviation verbally, but is required to confirm the request in writing as 
soon as possible.
    (b) A deviation request shall clearly and precisely set forth the:
    (1) Nature of the needed deviation;
    (2) Identification of the FAR or HHSAR from which the deviation is 
needed;
    (3) Circumstances under which the deviation would be used;
    (4) Intended effect of the deviation;

<R05>
301.501-2  Opportunity for public comments.

    (b) Public opportunity for comment on proposed changes or additions 
to the HHSAR or lower level acquisition regulations will be offered 
whenever the proposed regulation will have an impact on the public and/
or contractors. This will be accomplished by publishing a notice of 
proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register which will include the 
proposed language and the background and rationale for the proposed 
regulation. Comments will not be solicited directly from professional or 
industry associations or other interested parties; they will be expected 
to respond based upon the Federal Register notification. Normally, the 
public will be given 45 days to comment. Proposed changes or additions 
to the HHSAR or FAR shall be staffed to the Executive Committee

<R05>
301.602-3  Ratification of unauthorized commitments.

    (b) Policy. (1) The Government is not bound by agreements or 
contractual commitments made to prospective contractors by persons to 
whom contracting authority has not been delegated. However, execution of 
otherwise proper contracts made by individuals without contracting 
authority, or by contracting officers in excess of the limits of their 
delegated authority, may be later ratified. The ratification must be in 
the form of a written document clearly stating that ratification of a 
previously unauthorized act is intended and must be signed by the head 
of the contracting activity (HCA).
    (2) The HCA or his/her designee is the official authorized to ratify 
an unauthorized commitment (but see (b)(3), below).
    (3) Ratification authority may be redelegated by the HCA, but not 
below the level of the principal official responsible for acquisition 
(PORA).
    (c) Limitations. (5) The concurrence of legal counsel concerning the 
payment issue is optional.
    (7) The ratification shall be in written document form containing 
verification of each limitation stated in FAR 1.602-3(c)(1)-(6), and 
shall be processed in accordance with 301.602-3(e) Procedures.
    (e) Procedures. (1) The individual who made the unauthorized 
contractual commitment shall furnish the reviewing contracting officer 
all records and documents concerning the commitment and a complete 
written statement of facts, including, but not limited to: a statement 
as to why the contracting office was not used, a statement as to why the 
proposed contractor was selected, a list of other sources considered, a 
description of work to be performed or products to be furnished, the 
estimated or agreed contract price, a citation of the appropriation 
available, and a statement of whether the contractor has commenced 
performance.
    (2) The contracting officer will review the submitted material, and 
prepare the ratification document if he/she determines that the 
commitment may be ratifiable. The contracting officer shall forward the 
ratification document and the submitted material to the HCA or designee 
with any comments or information which should be considered in 
evaluation of the request for ratification. If legal review is 
desirable, the HCA or designee will coordinate the request for 
ratification with the Office of General Counsel, Business and 
Administrative Law Division.
    (3) If ratification is authorized by the HCA or designee, the file 
will be returned, along with the ratification document, to the 
contracting officer for issuance of a purchase order or contract, as 
appropriate.
    (4) HCA's or their designees will report the number and dollar value 
of requests for ratifications received and

[[Page 11]]

ratifications authorized each calendar quarter. Reports shall be 
submitted in an original and one copy to the Deputy Assistant Secretary 
for Management and Acquisition to arrive no later than 30 calendar days 
after the close of each calendar quarter.

<R05>
301.603  Selection, appointment, and termination of appointment.


<R05>
301.603-1  General.

    (a) The appointment and termination of appointment of contracting 
officers shall be made by the principal official responsible for 
acquisition (PORA). This authority is not delegable. The head of the 
contracting activity shall ensure that only the PORA is redelegated, and 
exercises, this authority.
    (b) Only GS-1105 and 1106 and GS/GM-1101 and 1102 personnel shall be 
appointed as contracting officers (see 301.603-3(b)).
    (c) The appointment of contracting officers shall be made at one of 
the four levels specified under the HHS Acquisition Certification 
Program (see 301.603-3(b)).
    (d) An individual shall be appointed only in instances where a valid 
organizational need for a contracting officer can be demonstrated or a 
replacement position is to be filled. Factors to be considered in 
assessing the need for a contracting officer appointment include volume 
of actions, complexity of work, and structure of the organization.


<R05>
301.603-2  Selection.

    (a) When an organizational need for a contracting officer is 
determined or a replacement is required, an official (usually the 
prospective contracting officer's immediate supervisor) will nominate a 
contracting officer candidate. The nomination shall be accompanied by 
the candidate's current Standard Form (SF) 171, Personal Qualifications 
Statement, that contains all relevant information, to include that 
stated in FAR 1.603-2, a copy of the nominee's most recent performance 
appraisal, and a copy of the certificate issued under the HHS 
Acquisition Certification Program indicating the current level of 
certification.
    (b) The PORA shall review the submitted material to determine the 
candidate's ability to perform the contracting functions required to 
meet the organizational need. If the PORA requires additional 
information to make the decision, it shall be provided expeditiously by 
the nominating official.


<R05>
301.603-3  Appointment.

    (a) Contracting officer appointments shall become effective when the 
PORA signs the Standard Form 1402, Certificate of Appointment. SF 1402's 
shall be prepared and maintained in accordance with FAR 1.603-3.
    (b) Appointments shall be made at one of the four levels established 
by the HHS Acquisition Certification Program. Therefore, the contracting 
officer candidate must meet the minimum eligibility requirements of 
certification for one of the four stated levels. The level will be 
determined by the organizational need or position being refilled 
(replacement). The four levels are as follows:
    (1) Level I--Purchasing Agent. Mandatory for all personnel who have 
signature authority for small purchases (GS-1102, 1105, and 1106), 
including orders from GSA sources.
    (2) Level II--Acquisition Official. Mandatory for those in the GS-
1102 series. Sufficient for delegation of contracting officer authority 
to a maximum of $100,000.
    (3) Level III--Senior Acquisition Official. Mandatory for those in 
the GS-1102 series for delegation of contracting officer authority above 
$100,000.
    (4) Level IV--Acquisition Manager. Mandatory for preaward review and 
approval authority as specified in HHSAR Subpart 304.71.
    (c) Changes to contracting officer appointments, either increasing 
or decreasing the warrant limitations, shall be made by the PORA. 
Changes must be made from one of the four certification levels to 
another, or within one of the certification levels, and must be 
implemented by the PORA's issuance of a new SF 1402 to replace the 
existing SF 1402.
    (d) Personnel shall not ordinarily be appointed as contracting 
officers if they do not meet the qualifications

[[Page 12]]

prescribed for one of the four certification levels. However, if it is 
essential to appoint a contracting officer who does not fully meet the 
certification qualifications, an interim appointment may be granted by 
the PORA. The PORA shall require as a condition of the interim 
appointment that all training or experience requirements be met within a 
six month time period. Usually, interim appointments shall not exceed 
six months. Failure to successfully complete the necessary training 
requirements or gain the experience within this time frame will result 
in termination of the appointment, unless the PORA determines that 
unusual circumstances prevented the attainment of either. In this 
instance, one additional six month interim appointment may be issued, 
but no more shall be allowed. The PORA shall fully document all interim 
appointment actions.
    (e) The original SF 1402 shall be provided to the contracting 
officer, and a copy shall be retained by the PORA. Another copy of the 
SF 1402 along with the SF 171 material shall be forwarded to the 
servicing personnel office for inclusion in the individual's personnel 
file folder. Files on individuals should not be established by the PORA.


<R05>
301.603-4  Termination.

    Termination of contracting officer appointments shall be executed by 
the PORA in accordance with FAR 1.603-4.


<R05>
301.603-70  Delegation of contracting officer responsibilities.

    (a) Non-GS/GM-1101 or 1102 or GS-1105 or 1106 personnel shall only 
be delegated contracting officer responsibilities when determined 
necessary by a warranted contracting officer (holder of a valid SF 
1402), and in accordance with this subsection. Personnel, such as a 
contracting officer's representative or an ordering officer, shall be 
delegated only the needed responsibilities by the warranted contracting 
officer in a written memorandum of delegation which clearly states any 
limitations on the delegation. Personnel who are not in the GS/GM-1101 
or 1102 or GS-1105 or 1106 job series shall not be issued a SF 1402, 
Certificate of Appointment.
    (b) Non-acquisition personnel who are delegated acquisition 
responsibilities shall be required to have the training, experience, and 
education requirements necessary for the responsibilities assigned. If, 
for example, responsibility is to be delegated for making small 
purchases, the training, education, and experience for Level I--
Purchasing Agent, or its equivalent as determined by the PORA, shall be 
required.


<R05>
301.670  Head of the contracting activity.


<R05>
301.670-1  Responsibility.

    The head of the contracting activity (HCA) is responsible for 
conducting an effective and efficient acquisition program. Adequate 
controls shall be established to assure compliance with applicable laws, 
regulations, procedures, and the dictates of good management practices. 
Periodic reviews shall be conducted by qualified personnel, preferably 
assigned to positions other than in the contracting office being 
reviewed, to determine the extent of adherence to prescribed policies 
and regulations, and to detect a need for guidance and/or training.


<R05>
301.670-2  Designation.

    Each OPDIV head and PHS agency head has been designated as HCA along 
with the following officials:
    (a) Deputy Assistant Secretary for Management and Acquisition; and
    (b) Each Regional Director.

[53 FR 15562, May 2, 1988, as amended at 54 FR 24342, June 7, 1989]


<R05>
301.670-3  Redelegation.

    (a) The heads of contracting activities may redelegate their HCA 
authorities to the extent that redelegation is not prohibited by the 
terms of their respective delegations of authority, by law, by the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation, by the HHS Acquisition Regulation, or by 
other regulations. However, HCA and other contracting approvals and 
authorities shall not be redelegated below the levels specified in the 
HHS Acquisition Regulation or, in the

[[Page 13]]

absence of coverage in the HHS Acquisition Regulation, the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation. To ensure proper control of redelegated 
acquisition authorities, HCA's shall maintain a file containing 
successive delegations of HCA authority through and including the 
contracting officer level.
    (b) Personnel delegated responsibility for acquisition functions 
must possess a level of experience, training, and ability commensurate 
with the complexity and magnitude of the acquisition actions involved.

<R05>
303.104  Procurement integrity.


<R05>
303.104-4  Definitions.

    (h)(1) Procurement official means any individual who has 
participated personally and substantially in the conduct of a 
procurement. The following classes of employees may be considered 
procurement officials depending on the circumstances prevailing in a 
given case: contracting officers, contract specialists, contract 
administrators, procurement agents, procurement clerks, cost/price 
analysts, procurement analysts, clerical support and administrative 
personnel, auditors, professional staff of the Division of Cost 
Allocation, acquisition review and approval officials, contract 
clearance staff, board of award members, supervisory procurement 
officials, small and disadvantaged business utilization specialists, 
project officers, project managers, program officials, officials who 
provide special program clearances and approvals, program managers, 
technical evaluation panelists, peer reviewers, source selection 
evaluation board members, source selection advisory council members, 
source selection authorities, finance officials, and procurement 
lawyers. Concept peer reviewers are not considered to be procurement 
officials when participating in project concept reviews pursuant to 42 
CFR 52h.10(a). However, concept peer reviewers, or other peer reviewers, 
who participate in a project approach review are procurement officials. 
When there is a question whether an individual is a procurement 
official, the activities of the individual should be analyzed by the 
contracting officer to determine

[[Page 15]]

whether there is both personal and substantial involvement in a 
procurement. If there is doubt in a particular case, the doubt should be 
resolved by including the individual as a procurement official. The 
contracting officer has the authority to decide who is or who is not a 
procurement official in a particular case. The opinion of the Office of 
the General Counsel (OGC) should be requested when the contracting 
officer believes the situation is particularly complex or sensitive. 
When the contracting officer's decision is disputed by the individual 
whose status as a procurement official is in question, the matter will 
be referred to the Principal Official Responsible for Acquisition (PORA) 
for a final determination.
    (k)(1) Source selection information includes ``derivative 
documents'' which are documents containing references to or directly 
citing or paraphrasing proprietary or source selection information.


<R05>
303.104-5  Disclosure of proprietary and source selection information.

    (a) The contracting officer or any other individual who prepares, 
makes or controls proprietary, source selection information, or 
derivative documents shall--
    (1) Ensure documents are marked as prescribed in FAR 3.104-4 (j) and 
(k);
    (2) Provide physical security for documents in the office 
environment during and after duty hours; and
    (3) Ensure security of interoffice mailing of documents by using 
opaque envelopes, double wrapping with more than one envelope, and 
sealing of envelopes, as necessary.
    (b) Individuals responsible for preparing derivative documents are 
responsible for marking such documents in accordance with FAR 3.104-
5(b).
    (c) Only the contracting officer has the authority to authorize 
individuals, or classes of individuals, access to proprietary or source 
selection information for each procurement except for paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (d) The following classes of individuals are authorized blanket 
access to only that source selection information developed before a 
request for contract is sent to the contract office, or to later 
modifications or supplements to such information--
    (1) The generators of the requirements, including program, 
scientific, and technical experts involved in the development of the 
statements of work, specifications, evaluation plans, budget estimates, 
or similar documents;
    (2) Reviewing officials; and
    (3) Supervisors in the management chain of the individuals listed in 
paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section. The contracting officer 
shall include in the contract file names and functions of any other 
individuals authorized access to proprietary or source selection 
information.


<R05>
303.104-6  Restrictions on Government officials, employees, and consultants.

    (b) Procurement officials leaving the Department will be required to 
complete the certification set forth in Chapter 1-90 of the General 
Administration Manual if that official leaves the Department during the 
conduct of a procurement expected to result in a contract or 
modification in excess of $100,000. The administrative officer will 
forward a copy of the certification to each responsible contracting 
officer for incorporation into the contract file.


<R05>
303.104-9  Certification requirements.

    (c) The contracting officer shall include the contracting officer 
certification in the contract file for each contract action over 
$100,000. Including the certificate in the contract file shall be 
considered notification to the head of the agency.
    (e)(2) The waiver shall be submitted to the Office of Acquisition 
and Grants Management in the Office of Management and Acquisition, 
Office of Management and Budget in the Office of the Secretary for 
review and approval before submission to the head of the agency.


<R05>
303.104-11  Processing violations or possible violations.

    (a)(1) The contracting officer determination that a reported 
violation or possible violation of the statutory prohibitions has no 
impact on the impending award or selection of a source must

[[Page 16]]

be submitted through channels, along with supporting documentation, to 
the PORA for review and approval of the determination before award of a 
contract.
    (2) The contracting officer's determination that a reported 
violation or possible violation of the statutory prohibitions has an 
impact on the pending award or selection of a source must be referred 
through channels, along with all related information available, to the 
PORA (if the PORA is an SES) or to another SES official designated by

agency head designee with respect to actions taken under the FAR clause 
at 52.203-10, Remedies for Illegal or Improper Activity.


<R05>
303.104-12  Ethics program training requirements.

    (a) The Office of Acquisition and Grants Management in the Office of 
Management and Acquisition (OAGM), Office of Management and Budget in 
the Office of the Secretary is responsible for developing a training 
module which can be used by the Department's OPDIVs and Regional offices 
to train procurement officials. Upon receipt of the module, each OPDIV 
and Regional Office must train the procurement officials set forth in 
303.104-4(h)(1) before they can act as procurement officials.
    (b) After the training has been completed, each procurement official 
must sign the ``Procurement Official's Certificate of Procurement 
Integrity'' before he/she can act as a procurement official on any 
procurement. The certificate shall be submitted to the servicing 
personnel office, where the certificate will be filed on the left side 
of the employee's Official Personnel Folder. A copy of the certificate 
shall be provided to the contract office which shall maintain a list of 
the procurement officials who have signed the certificates.
    (c) Procurement officials who serve multiple contracting offices 
(such as procurement lawyers) shall submit copies of their certificates 
to OAGM with the originals being transmitted to their servicing 
personnel office. OAGM shall maintain a list of such procurement 
officials and inform cognizant contracting officers upon telephonic 
request whether particular individuals are included on the list.

<R05>
304.801  General.

    OPDIVs shall prescribe the contents of contract files and establish 
filing procedures consistent with the nature of the contracting actions 
and in accordance with FAR 4.801, 4.802, and 4.803. Contract files

be separated into logical categories (see FAR 4.803).


<R05>
304.804  Closeout of contract files.


<R05>
304.804-1  Closeout by the office administering the contract.

    (3) Files for all cost-reimbursement type contracts should be closed 
within 20 months of the month in which the contracting officer receives 
evidence of physical completion (see FAR 4.804-4). The contracting 
officer responsible for contract closeout may negotiate settlement of 
indirect costs for a specific contract, in advance of the determination 
of final indirect cost rates in accordance with FAR 42.708.


<R05>
304.870  Closing review.

    (a) Contracting officers shall assure the applicable items in FAR 
4.804-5,

[[Page 19]]

other than a field audit, have been accomplished prior to closing any 
physically completed contract. Cost-reimbursement type contracts will be 
subject to the additional requirements set forth below before they may 
be closed.
    (b) Contracting officers shall use the instructions in the October 
5, 1982 memorandum from the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Procurement, 
Assistance and Logistics to closeout cost-reimbursement type contracts 
physically completed prior to fiscal year 1977 and cost-reimbursement 
type contracts completed subsequent to that date for which field audit 
information is available.
    (c) Contracting officers shall closeout all other cost-reimbursement 
type contracts physically completed after September 30, 1977 in 
accordance with the following procedures:
    (1) Field audits will be conducted for contracts in excess of 
$500,000 awarded to commercial organizations and non-profit 
organizations other than colleges and universities, hospitals and State 
and local units of government for which an agency other than HHS has 
audit cognizance. Field audits will also be conducted each year on 
approximately 25 of the same type contractors for which HHS has audit 
cognizance. These contracts may be closed after receipt of the field 
audit report.
    (2) Contracts of any dollar value with non-proprietary colleges and 
universities, hospitals and State and local units of government and 
contracts not in excess of $500,000 with other institutions/
organizations shall be closed out on the basis of a desk audit. The desk 
audit should include (i) a confirmation from the project officer that 
labor, material, travel, and other types of direct costs are 
commensurate with contract requirements, (ii) a review of available 
audit reports to determine if any adjustments were made that may be 
applicable to the contract under review, and (iii) discussions with the 
cognizant government auditor when considered appropriate. These 
contracts shall be closed with the condition that they are subject to 
adjustment should an on-site audit be conducted at a later date and 
should unallowable costs be identified as a result of that audit. The 
release executed by the contractor shall contain the following:

    The Contractor agrees, pursuant to the clause in this contract 
entitled Allowable Cost (for cost-reimbursement contracts) or Allowable 
Cost and Fixed Fee (for CPFF contracts), that the amount of any 
sustained audit exceptions resulting from any audit made after final 
payment will be refunded to the Government.

    (3) The contracting officer may request a field audit of any 
contract when, in his/her judgment, the risk attendant with the contract 
warrants it. The contracting officer, however, shall exercise discretion 
in requesting such audits on creditable evidence such as unsatisfactory 
dealings with the contractor during the period of contract performance, 
prior audit reports containing serious findings against the contractor, 
the known experience of other government officials in dealing with the 
contractor when the contracting officer is personally knowledgeable 
about the circumstances, formal third party complaints or allegations 
which bear upon the contractor's integrity or the propriety of costs 
charged to the Government, and other comparable allegations or advice of 
a derogatory nature about the contractor made by responsible individuals 
which in the contracting officer's judgment should be investigated. 
Except where a contracting officer suspects misrepresentation or fraud, 
audits should not be requested if their cost of performance is likely to 
exceed their potential cost recovery.
    (4) When an audit is warranted prior to closing out a contract, the 
contracting officer should request the audit directly from the 
Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, 
Office of Audits (HHSOA). The request should cite the reasons the 
contracting officer believes an audit is warranted. A copy of the 
request should be forwarded to the Director, Office of Acquisition and 
Grants Management (DOAGM). In the event the Office of the Inspector 
General cannot honor the request in a reasonable period of time, it will 
consult with DOAGM and the contracting officer. The final decision on 
the need and scope of an audit will be made on the basis of the value of 
the contract, the

[[Page 20]]

nature of the contracting officer's concerns, and the availability of 
HHSOA or other existing resources in the Department to perform a review 
to satisfy the contracting officer's concerns.
    (5) Closeout procedures are to be followed in conjunction with the 
regular procedures now followed in administering contracts. These 
procedures are not meant or to be interpreted as imposing any 
requirement or responsibility on contracting officers or necessitating 
any reviews on the part of the contracting officials not currently 
required by the FAR. With some rare exceptions, Standard Form 1034, 
Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other than Personal, will 
contain sufficient information to allow a contracting officer to satisfy 
requirements for desk audits. Accordingly, these closeout procedures 
shall not cause contracting officers to engage in extraordinary 
oversight or review and shall not be used by contracting officers as the 
basis for requiring contractors to submit extraordinary documentation 
such as payroll listing, labor billings, travel details, etc.

fiscal year 1983 should be numbered 100-83-0001, the second contract 
100-83-0002. Alternatively, if it is desirable for internal 
identification purposes to establish separate series of numbers for 
sealed bid and negotiated contracts, this procedure is permissible. In 
this instance, the initial sealed bid contract might be numbered 100-83-
0001 and the initial negotiated contract numbered 100-83-0500.
    (d) Assignment of identification codes. Each contracting office of 
the Department shall be assigned a three digit identification code by 
the Office of Financial Operations. Requests for the assignment of such 
codes for newly established contracting offices shall be submitted by 
the headquarters acquisition staff office of the contracting activity to 
the Director, Office of Financial Operations. Conversely, in the event 
that a contracting office is to be disestablished, the Director, Office 
of Financial Operations shall be notified.

A listing of the contracting office identification codes currently in 
use is contained in the Department-wide Contract Information System 
Manual (DCIS).

<R04>
     Subpart 304.71--Review and Approval of Proposed Contract Awards


<R05>
304.7100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes review and approval procedures for contract 
actions to ensure that:
    (a) Contract awards are in conformance with law, established 
policies and procedures, and sound business practices;
    (b) Contractual documents properly reflect the mutual understanding 
of the parties; and
    (c) The contracting officer is informed of deficiencies and items of 
questionable acceptability and corrective action is taken.


<R05>
304.7101  Contracts requiring review and approval.

    (a) General. All contractual documents, regardless of dollar value, 
are to be reviewed by the contracting officer prior to award, even if 
the review and approval procedures prescribed in this section are 
applicable. However, under no circumstances may the individual who signs 
a contract instrument as contracting officer perform final review and 
approval of that contract action if it, or any modification to it, is 
expected to exceed the levels set forth in (b) (1) or (2) below.
    (b) Required reviews and approvals. (1) Officials responsible for 
the acquisition function in the Office of the Secretary, OPDIVs (except 
the Public Health Service), and regional offices are to assure that 
sealed bid or negotiated contracts, and/or modifications to them, 
expected to exceed $300,000, are reviewed and approved prior to award. 
In order to assure the propriety of smaller dollar acquisitions, a 
statistically significant sample of contract actions not expected to 
exceed $300,000 are to be reviewed and approved prior to award.
    (2) Contract actions of the Public Health Service are to be reviewed 
and approved prior to award in accordance with the dollar thresholds 
stated in Subpart PHS 304.71. In order to assure the propriety of 
smaller dollar acquisitions, a statistically significant sample of 
contract actions not expected to exceed those dollar thresholds 
referenced in Subpart PHS 304.71 are to be reviewed and approved prior 
to award.
    (c) Reviewing officials. Officials assigned responsibility for 
review and approval of contract actions must possess qualifications in 
the field of acquisition commensurate with the level of review 
performed, and, as a minimum, possess those acquisition skills expected 
of a contracting officer. The following officials are responsible for 
preaward contract review and approval:

Office of the Secretary--

[[Page 22]]

    Director, Division of Contract and Grant Operations
    Director, Division of Contract Operations, Office of Administrative 
and Management Services
Office of Human Development Services--Director, Grants and Contracts 
Management Division
Social Security Administration--Director, Office of Acquisition and 
Grants (may be redelegated to the appropriate division direction within 
the Office of Acquisition and Grants)
Health Care Financing Administration--Director, Division of Procurement 
Services.
Public Health Service--The reviewing official is designated in Subpart 
PHS 304.71, as approved by the Director, Office of Procurement and 
Logistics Policy, OPAL.


However, if any of the officials are to serve as the contracting officer 
and sign the contractual document, the review and approval function 
shall be performed by an appropriate official at least one level above.
    (d) Regional offices. The Director, Regional Administrative Support 
Center (RASC) is responsible for review and approval of contracts, or 
modifications to them, expected to exceed $300,000 and executed by the 
regional office's contracting staff. The RASC may obtain the advice of 
the Regional Attorney in the review of proposed contract awards.

[49 FR 13961, Apr. 9, 1984, as amended at 50 FR 23127, May 31, 1985; 50 
FR 38004, Sept. 19, 1985; 51 FR 44293, Dec. 9, 1986; 52 FR 27558, July 
22, 1987; 54 FR 24343, June 7, 1989]


<R05>
304.7102  Conduct of the review.

    (a) General. Reviewing officials may solicit the participation of 
specialists in various technical and administrative disciplines to aid 
in the review. The method of the review is not prescribed here in order 
to permit discretionary judgment in determining the depth to which 
significant areas are to be examined.
    (b) Contract file. The reviewer is to: (1) Determine that the 
contract file constitutes an independent record, documented to provide a 
complete chronology of actions related to all aspects of the 
acquisition, and that the documentation is consistent with the 
requirements of FAR 4.803;
    (2) Determine that each contract file contains documentation or 
other data (i.e., technical and business management evaluation, cost 
advisory and audit reports, negotiation memorandum, etc.) sufficient to 
explain and support the rationales, judgments, and authorities upon 
which all decisions and actions were predicated; and
    (3) Ascertain:
    (i) If the proposed acquisition action is to be awarded by other 
than full and open competition, that the documentation and approvals 
supporting the decision are present in the contract file;
    (ii) That proper publicizing of the proposed acquisition was made 
pursuant to FAR Part 5;
    (iii) That approval was obtained for any deviation from prescribed 
contract clauses;
    (iv) That sufficient competition was obtained, the competitive range 
was appropriately determined, and oral or written discussions were 
conducted with all firms in the competitive range;
    (v) That all the rules set forth in FAR Part 14 were complied with 
when the proposed award is a result of an IFB; and
    (vi) That appropriate determinations and findings which justify the 
type of contract and advance payments are a part of the contract file.

[49 FR 13961, Apr. 9, 1984, as amended at 50 FR 23127, May 31, 1985; 50 
FR 38004, Sept. 19, 1985]


<R05>
304.7103  Approvals.

    (a) Awards are not to be made until approval is granted by the 
reviewing official identified in 304.7101. All approvals are to be in 
writing, except that when time is of the essence approval may be given 
orally and subsequently confirmed in writing.
    (b) The reviewing official shall not approve a proposed contract 
award if a substantive issue (or issues) remains to be resolved. 
However, in appropriate circumstances, the reviewing official may use 
discretion and grant approval on a conditional basis and require the 
contracting officer to submit follow-up written documentation that the 
substantive issue has been resolved. This provides the reviewing 
official the option to require the contracting officer to resolve the 
substantive issue and submit documenting evidence before award approval 
is given, or to grant

[[Page 23]]

conditional approval providing the substantive issue is resolved before 
the contract is awarded and require the contracting officer to submit 
documenting evidence either before or after the award. The reviewing 
official also has the option to determine the extent of documentation 
evidence to be submitted by the contracting officer. This may range from 
complete resubmission of the contract file to submission of a memorandum 
stating the contracting officer's actions in resolving the substantive 
issue.

<R04>
   Subpart 306.2--Full and Open Competition After Exclusion of Sources


<R05>
306.202  Establishing or maintaining alternative sources.

    (a) The reference to the agency head in FAR 6.202(a) shall mean the 
appropriate competition advocate cited in 306.501.
    (b)(1) The required determination and findings (D&F) shall be 
prepared by the contracting officer based on the data provided by 
program personnel, and shall be signed by the appropriate competition 
advocate. The D&F signatory authority is not delegable.

[50 FR 23127, May 31, 1985, and 50 FR 38004, Sept. 19, 1985, as amended 
at 51 FR 44293, Dec. 9, 1986]


<R04>
           Subpart 306.3--Other Than Full and Open Competition


<R05>
306.302  Circumstances permitting other than full and open competition.


<R05>
306.302-1  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

    (a) Authority. (2)(ii) Follow-on contracts for the continuation of 
major research and development studies on long-term social and health 
programs, major research studies, or clinical trails may be deemed to be 
available only from the original source when it is likely that award to 
any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the 
Department's or OPDIV's requirements.
    (b) Application. (4) When the OPDIV head has determined that a 
specific item of technical equipment or parts must be obtained to meet 
an activity's program responsibility to test and evaluate certain kinds 
and types of products, and only one source is available. (This criterion 
is limited to testing and evaluation purposes only and may not be used 
for initial outfitting or repetitive acquisitions. Project officers 
should support the use of this criterion with citations from their 
agency's legislation and the technical rationale for the item of 
equipment required.)
    (c) Application for brand name descriptions. There is existing 
equipment which, for reasons of compatibility and interchangeability, 
requires an item which is manufactured only by one source. (This 
criterion is for use in acquisitions where a particular brand name item 
is required, and an ``or equal'' will not meet the Government's 
requirements. This criterion may not be used when there are other 
manufacturers available which may be able to produce acceptable items 
even though their products might require some adjustments and 
modifications. These other manufacturers must be given the opportunity 
to compete.)

[50 FR 23127, May 31, 1985, and 50 FR 38004, Sept. 19, 1985, as amended 
at 51 FR 44293, Dec. 9, 1986; 57 FR 11689, Apr. 7, 1992]

[[Page 26]]


<R05>
306.302-7  Public interest.

    (a) Authority. (2) Agency head, in this instance, means the 
Secretary.
    (c) Limitations. When using the authority cited in FAR 6.302-
7(a)(1), the Secretary's approval must be obtained. Therefore, an 
``approval package'' must be prepared and staffed through departmental 
acquisition channels to the Secretary. The package shall include:
    (1) A determination and findings, prepared by the contracting 
officer, for the Secretary to sign.
    (2) A letter for the Secretary to sign notifying Congress of the 
determination to award a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 
253(c)(7). This letter must be received by Congress at least 30 days 
before contract award.
    (3) A ``Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition'' 
(JOFOC).
    (4) A briefing paper presenting background, need, etc.
    (5) Any other pertinent papers or documents required by the 
Department.


<R05>
306.303  Justifications.


<R05>
306.303-1  Requirements.

    (b) Preliminary arrangements or agreements with the proposed 
contractor made by someone other than the contracting officer shall have 
no effect on the rationale used to support an acquisition for other than 
full and open competition.
    (f) The program office should discuss prospective other than full 
and open competition requests with their supporting contracting office 
as early as possible during the acquisition planning stage (see FAR 
Subpart 7.1 and Subpart 307.1), and before submitting the requisition or 
request for contract. The discussions may resolve uncertainties, provide 
program offices with names of other sources, allow proper scheduling of 
the acquisition, and avoid delays which might otherwise occur should it 
be determined that the request for other than full and open competition 
is not justified.
    (g) When a program office desires to obtain certain goods or 
services by contract without full and open competition, it shall, at the 
time of forwarding the requisition or request for contract, furnish the 
contracting office a justification explaining why full and open 
competition is not feasible. All justifications shall be initially 
reviewed by the contracting officer.
    (1) Justifications in excess of the small purchase limitation shall 
be in the form of a separate, self-contained document, prepared in 
accordance with FAR 6.303 and 306.303, and called a ``JOFOC'' 
(Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition). Justifications 
of $25,000 or less may be in the form of a paragraph or paragraphs 
contained in the requisition or request for contract.
    (2) Justifications, whether over or under the small purchase 
limitation, shall fully describe what is to be acquired, offer reasons 
which go beyond inconvenience, and explain why it is not feasible to 
obtain competition. The justifications shall be supported by verifiable 
facts rather than mere opinions. Documentation in the justifications 
should be sufficient to permit an individual with technical competence 
in the area to follow the rationale.

[50 FR 23127, May 31, 1985, as amended at 57 FR 11689, Apr. 7, 1992]


<R05>
306.303-2  Content.

    (a)(1) The program office and name, address, and telephone number of 
the project officer shall also be included.
    (2) This item shall include project identification such as the 
authorizing program legislation, to include citations or other internal 
program identification data such as title, contract number, etc.
    (3) A full description of the requirement and its dollar amount is 
to be included. It may be in the form of a statement of work, purchase 
description, or specification. A statement is to be included to explain 
whether the acquisition is an entity in itself, whether it is one in a 
series, or part of a related group of acquisitions.
    (c) Each JOFOC shall conclude with at least the following signatory 
lines (other concurrence lines may be added as deemed necessary by the 
contracting activity):

Recommended, Project Officer____________________________________________
Date____________________________________________________________________
Concur, Project Officer's Immediate Supervisor__________________________
Date____________________________________________________________________
Concur, Contracting Officer_____________________________________________

Date____________________________________________________________________
Approved, Approving Official____________________________________________
Date____________________________________________________________________


<R05>
306.304  Approval of the justification.

    (a)(1) For purchases in excess of 10 percent of the small purchase 
limitation but not over the small purchase limitation, the contracting 
officer is authorized to review and approve (or disapprove) the 
justification (see 313.106(c)(2)). For acquisitions over the small 
purchase limitation, but not exceeding $100,000, the JOFOC shall be 
submitted to the contracting officer for review. The contracting officer 
will either concur or nonconcur, and forward the JOFOC to the principal 
official responsible for acquisition for approval. (When the contracting 
officer and principal official responsible for acquisition are the same 
individual, the approval will be made by the respective official listed 
in 306.501.) The principal official responsible for acquisition may 
redelegate approval for acquisitions between the small purchase 
limitation and $50,000 to the chief of the contracting office, provided 
that individual is at least one level above the contracting officer who 
will sign the contract.
    (2) The competition advocates are listed in 306.501.
    (3) The following shall serve as the approving officials referenced 
in FAR 6.304(a)(3):

HCFA--Administrator for Health Care Financing
OHDS--Assistant Secretary for Human Development Services
OS--Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget
PHS--Assistant Secretary for Health (may be delegated to the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Health Operations)
SSA--Commissioner of Social Security
RO's--Regional Director


This authority is not delegable, except as indicated for PHS.
    (4) The senior procurement executive of the Department is the 
Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget.
    (c) A class justification shall be processed the same as an 
individual justification.
    (d) The contracting officer who receives a JOFOC for processing 
shall, after ascertaining that the document is complete, request advice 
from pricing, audit, legal, and other appropriate staff offices, and 
forward the JOFOC with his or her concurrence or nonconcurrence, to the 
appropriate approving official. When the contracting officer does not 
concur with the JOFOC, a written explanation setting forth the reasons 
must be provided the approving official. If the JOFOC is disapproved by 
the approving official, the contracting officer shall promptly notify 
the concerned program office.
    (e) It is the responsibility of the approving official to determine 
whether a contract may properly be awarded without full and open 
competition. The program office and project officer are responsible for 
furnishing the contracting officer and approving official with pertinent 
supporting information necessary to make such determinations. Other 
staff offices shall advise the contracting officer and approving 
official as requested.
    (f) As each justification is reviewed, the approving official should 
ask: why the acquisition cannot be competed, are there sufficient 
grounds for excluding all other actual or potential sources, what 
actions can be taken to obtain full and open competition in the instant 
acquisition, and what actions are needed to avoid the need for a 
subsequent or continuing acquisition that is for other than full and 
open competition?

criteria) listed in FAR 6.401(a) is (are) not applicable to the 
acquisition.

                    Subpart 307.1--Acquisition Plans


<R05>
307.104  General procedures.

    (a) The acquisition planning document is an administrative tool 
designed to enable the contracting officer and project officer to plan 
effectively for the accomplishment of an acquisition during a specified 
time frame. The acquisition planning document serves as an outline of 
the method by which the contracting officer expects to accomplish the 
acquisition task.
    (c) If the plan proposes using other than full and open competition, 
the plan shall also be coordinated with the

[[Page 29]]

Chief of the contracting office, acting for the competition advocate.

[49 FR 13969, Apr. 9, 1984, as amended at 50 FR 23129, May 31, 1985; 50 
FR 38004, Sept. 19, 1985; 51 FR 44293, Dec. 9, 1986]


<R05>
307.104-1  Requirement for acquisition planning.

    (a) The acquisition planning document is required for all new 
negotiated acquisitions which are expected to exceed $100,000, except 
the following:
    (1) Acquisition of architect-engineer services;
    (2) Acquisitions of utility services where the services are 
available from only one source; and
    (3) Acquisitions made from or through other Government agencies.
    (b) An acquisition planning document is also required for all two-
step sealed bid acquisitions expected to exceed $100,000.
    (c) The principal official responsible for acquisition shall 
prescribe acquisition planning procedures for:
    (1) Negotiated acquisitions which are not expected to exceed 
$100,000;
    (2) Two-step sealed bid acquisitions which are not expected to 
exceed $100,000; and
    (3) All other sealed bid acquisitions regardless of dollar amount.
    (d) An acquisition planning document is not required for a contract 
modification which either exercises an option or adds funds to an 
incrementally funded contract, provided there is an approved acquisition 
planning document in accordance with 307.105 and there is no significant 
deviation from that plan.

[49 FR 13969, Apr. 9, 1984, as amended at 50 FR 23126, May 31, 1985; 50 
FR 38004, Sept. 19, 1985]


<R05>
307.104-2  Responsibilities for acquisition planning.

    (a) Planning by program and staff activities. Whenever execution of 
a program or project requires the acquisition of property or services by 
contract, the program or project plan shall delineate all elements to be 
acquired by contract. The program or project plans must include a plan 
and time-frame for completion action.
    (b) Planning for acquisition actions. Action should commence as 
early as possible to effect an orderly and balanced acquisition workload 
throughout a fiscal year. Project officers who expect to initiate 
acquisitions are required to discuss their requirements with the 
contracting officials who will be responsible for these acquisitions to 
compare current staff capabilities with anticipated requirements to 
achieve an even distribution of fiscal year workload consistent with 
program needs. These discussions should result in understandings on:
    (1) The details of the acquisition plan;
    (2) Schedule for the completion of the acquisition plan;
    (3) Preliminary discussions on the work statement/specifications and 
appropriate evaluation criteria; and
    (4) Preliminary discussions on the content and timing of the request 
for contract (RFC).
    (c) Planning by contracting activities. Contracting activities are 
required to coordinate with program and staff offices to ensure:
    (1) Timely and comprehensive planning for acquisitions;
    (2) Timely initiation of requests for contracts; and
    (3) Instruction of program and staff offices in proper acquisition 
practices and methods.


<R05>
307.104-3  Preparation of acquisition plan.

    (a) The acquisition planning document serves as an advance agreement 
between program and contracting personnel by outlining the methods of 
how and when the acquisition is to be accomplished. It serves to resolve 
problems early in the acquisition cycle thereby precluding delays in 
contract placement. It is developed prior to the preparation and 
submission of the formal request for contract to the contracting 
activity. (For detailed information concerning the request for contract, 
see Subpart 315.70.)
    (b) The acquisition planning document shall be prepared jointly by 
the project officer and the contract negotiator or in accordance with 
procedures prescribed by the principal official responsible for 
acquisition.

<R05>
307.105  Contents of written acquisition plans.


<R05>
307.105-1  Format and content.

    The Department does not prescribe a standard format for the 
acquisition planning document, but recommends the use of a format 
similar to what is provided in this section. The subject areas addressed 
in paragraphs (a) through (e) must be included in every acquisition 
planning document. An OPDIV, agency, or regional office contracting 
activity may prescribe a standard format for the acquisition planning 
document and may include additional subject areas that are pertinent to 
that activity's needs.
    (a) Identification information. The contracting activity shall 
prescribe the information necessary for readily identifying a planned 
acquisition. The information may include items such as acquisition 
planning document number, request for contract number, public law, 
program or project officer, etc.
    (b) Programmatic considerations. (1) Description of the project/
supplies/services. Include a brief description of the proposed project/
supplies/services. Discuss all anticipated future requirements related 
to the acquisition. Discuss any past, present or future interrelated 
projects.
    (2) Project funding. Include the summary of funds expected to be 
obligated for the entire project by fiscal years and phases. Include 
expenditures for previous years. Discuss the probability of obtaining 
future years funding and/or what specific managerial action can be taken 
to insure future funding (if applicable).
    (3) Background and acquisition history. Provide a brief factual 
summary of the technical and contractual history of the supplies/
services being acquired.
    (4) Related projects, efforts undertaken to avoid duplication of 
effort. Discuss efforts made to determine if existing projects, supplies 
or materials will satisfy the requirement. Include any related in-house 
efforts, searches, and clearinghouse reviews made to avoid duplication 
of effort.
    (5) Need for project/supplies/services. Discuss rationale for 
deciding on the need for the project/supplies/services.
    (6) Special program clearances or approvals. Review 307.105-2 to 
determine which special program clearances or approvals are required.

accomplishment which could be susceptible to phasing. Describe criteria 
for evaluation of performance of each phase before proceeding to the 
next. (See 307.105-3(c)(3) for a discussion on phasing.)
    (8) Government furnished material/facilities. Indicate material and 
facilities that will be furnished to the contractor and any associated 
problems which may be encountered. Discuss possible inequities which may 
arise in furnishing the materials or facilities. Discuss screening 
efforts for availability through GSA excess property schedules.
    (9) Discussion of project risk. Provide a discussion of major areas 
of project risk including technical, cost, and schedule risk. Describe 
what efforts are planned to reduce risk. If an acquisition, which is 
planned to be awarded using other than full and open competition 
represents a significant portion of a proposed contractor's business, 
discuss the impact on technical capability, realism of schedule, changes 
in contractor workload and related cost impact.
    (10) Reporting/delivery requirements. Describe the basis for 
establishing the delivery/reporting requirements and include the 
anticipated deliverables and time(s) for delivery.
    (11) Replication, dissemination, or use of the results. Discuss 
anticipated replication, dissemination, or use of the results. Describe 
user audience and their expected use. Include a description of the 
delivery system.
    (12) Data, data rights, patents, copyrights. Discuss data to be 
developed. Specify data to be delivered and data to remain in the 
contractor's possession. Discuss how the data is to be used, maintained, 
disclosed and disposed of by the contractor. Discuss data subject to the 
Privacy Act or Confidentiality of Information clause. Discuss data to be 
delivered with limited rights, data where title would not vest in the 
Government, and anticipated

[[Page 31]]

copyrights or patents. Discuss whether or not the data will permit any 
follow-on acquisitions to be competitive.
    (13) Post-award administration and monitoring. Detail milestones 
that require periodic evaluation of the contractor's progress. Discuss 
any formal management systems to be used to monitor the contractor. 
Discuss plans for post-award conference and site visits. Delineate the 
timing of the periodic status reports.
    (14) Technical evaluation plans. Discuss the plans for technical 
evaluation of the proposal. Discuss whether non-Federal technical 
evaluators will review the proposals. Discuss potential conflict of 
interest situations.

categories of sources (if apparent). Address the pertinent areas stated 
in FAR 7.105(b)(2).
    (2) Contract type. Provide the rationale for recommendation of 
contract type.
    (3) Socioeconomic programs. Discuss preliminary liaison with the 
Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization Specialist for review to 
determine requirements susceptible for the various socioeconomic 
acquisition programs; i.e., small business, disadvantaged business, or 
labor surplus area set-asides.
    (4) Other considerations, as applicable. Discuss special contract 
clauses and proposed HHSAR deviations, if required. Discuss 
circumstances such as the effect of a protest on a previous acquisition 
to this acquisition, special public law or regulatory requirements which 
place restrictions on this acquisition, and use of a special type of 
synopsis. Address planned preproposal conference, preaward survey and 
preaward site visits.
    (d) Planning for the acquisition cycle. (1) Scheduling 
considerations. The project officer and the contract negotiator shall 
establish realistic planned dates which meet the program needs for award 
to assure timely delivery or completion of the project. The following 
factors should be considered in planning realistic dates:
    (i) Individual project officer and contract negotiator workloads;
    (ii) Planned, extended absences from the office; and
    (iii) Schedules are in consonance with established office goals for 
overall orderly and balanced workloads.
    (2) Acquisition planning schedule. The following acquisition 
planning schedule should be included in all plans to the extent the 
items are significant or appropriate to the acquisition. Additional 
items may be added as appropriate.

<R05>
307.105-2  Special program clearances or approvals.

    The following special program clearances or approvals should be 
reviewed for applicability to each planned acquisition. The ones which 
are applicable should be addressed in the acquisition planning document 
and immediate programmatic action should be initiated to obtain the 
necessary clearances or approvals.
    (a) Clearances or approvals required to be completed and submitted 
with the request for contract (RFC). (1) Automatic data processing. All 
proposed acquisitions of automatic data processing hardware, software 
packages, and services, as well as telecommunications equipment, which 
exceed the dollar thresholds stated in Chapter 4-10 of the HHS 
Information Resources Management (IRM) Manual, must be reviewed and 
approved by the Office of Information Resources Management (OIRM), 
OASMB-0S. (See HHS Information Resources Management (IRM) Manual, 
Chapter 4-10; Title 41 CFR Chapter 201; and Subpart 339.70.)
    (2) ADP systems security. All ADP systems regardless of dollar 
amount are required to have a Certification of ADP Systems Security 
Adequacy signed by the ADP system manager and the cognizant ADP systems 
security officer. (See HHS IRM Manual, Part 6--ADP Systems Security; OMB 
Circular No. A-71, Transmittal Memorandum No. 1; and Subpart 339.70.)
    (3) Advisory and assistance services. OPDIV and STAFFDIV heads and 
regional directors are responsible for review and approval of all 
proposed advisory and assistance services contracts and purchase orders. 
(See General Administration Manual Chapter 8-15.)
    (4) Evaluation contracts. The Assistant Secretary for Planning and 
Evaluation (ASPE) must approve all evaluation projects for proposed 
solicitations, except those which have been included in research, 
demonstration, or evaluation plans previously approved by the ASPE.
    (5) Commercial activities. (OMB Circular No. A-76) A request for 
contract (RFC) must contain a statement as to whether the proposed 
solicitation is or is not to be used as part of an OMB Circular No. A-76 
cost comparison. (See General Administrative Manual (GAM) Chapter 18-10; 
FAR Subpart 7.3, Subpart 307.3; OMB Circular No. A-76.)
    (6) Paid advertising. Paid advertisements, notices or contract 
proposals to be published in newspapers and periodicals may be 
authorized by the contracting officer. (See FAR Subpart 5.5, Subpart 
305.5; Title 7, Chapter 5-25.2, and the General Accounting Office Policy 
and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies.)
    (7) Printing. The acquisition of printing by contract is prohibited 
unless it is authorized by the Joint Committee on Printing of the U.S. 
Congress. Procedures to be followed are contained in the ``Government 
Printing and Binding Regulations'' and the HHS Printing Management 
Manual and FAR Subpart 8.8.
    (8) Fraud, abuse and waste. All proposed acquisitions that concern 
the subjects of fraud, abuse and waste must be reviewed and approved by 
the Inspector General or Deputy Inspector General, and written approval 
from either must be included in the request for contract.
    (9) Paperwork Reduction Act. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1980 (Pub. L. 96-511), a Federal agency shall not collect information or 
sponsor the collection of information from ten or more persons (other 
than Federal employees acting within the scope of their employment) 
unless, in advance, the agency has submitted Standard Form 83, Request 
for OMB Review, to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, 
and the Director has approved the proposed collection of information. 
Procedures for the approval may be obtained by contacting the OPDIV 
reports clearance officer. (See Title 5 CFR Part 1320 and General 
Administration Manual Chapter 10-20.)
    (10) Contracts with federal employees. Contracts between the 
Government and Government employees or between the Government and 
organizations which are substantially owned or controlled by Government 
employees may not knowingly be entered into, except for the most 
compelling reasons (see FAR Subpart 3.6). Authority to enter into a 
contract with a Government employee or an organization substantially 
owned

[[Page 33]]

or controlled by a Government employee must be approved prior to award 
of the contract by either the Assistant Secretary for Management and 
Budget, the head of the OPDIV, or the regional director, or their 
designees. (See 45 CFR Part 73 and HHS Standards of Conduct.)
    (11) Publications. All projects which will result in contracts and 
which include publications require review and approval by the Office of 
the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (OASPA). Form HHS-615, 
Publication Planning and Clearance Request, should be forwarded to OASPA 
through the OPDIV public affairs officer. Publications are defined in 
the chapter on publications in the Public Affairs Management Manual.
    (12) Public affairs services. Projects for the acquisition of public 
affairs services in excess of $5,000 shall be submitted to the Office of 
the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (OASPA) for review and 
approval on Form HHS-524, Request for Public Affairs Service Contract.
    (13) Audiovisual (videotape and motion picture production). Any 
proposed acquisition of an audiovisual production requires the 
submission of a Standard Form 282, Mandatory Title Check, to the 
National Audiovisual Center (NAC). When the results of this title check 
have been reviewed by the project office and if a determination is made 
that existing materials are not adequate to fulfill the requirement, a 
statement to that effect shall be prepared by the project office. For 
acquisitions in excess of $5,000, a copy of that statement, together 
with a Standard Form 202, Federal Audiovisual Production Report, and 
Form HHS-524A, Request for Audiovisual Material, shall be submitted 
through the OPDIV public affairs officer to the Office of the Assistant 
Secretary for Public Affairs (OASPA) for review and approval. Following 
approval by OASPA, the SF 202 and the statement explaining why existing 
materials are insufficient will be forwarded to NAC by OASPA. An 
approved copy of the Form HHS-524A will be returned to the OPDIV for 
transmission to the contract negotiator. All audiovisuals are required 
to be acquired under the Government-wide Contracting System for Motion 
Picture and Videotape Productions, unless they are included in the 
exceptions to the mandatory use of the uniform system. (See the 
Executive Agent for Government-Wide Contracting System for Audiovisual 
Productions' March 21, 1980, memorandum on Implementation of OFPP Policy 
Letter No. 79-4, November 28, 1979, Contracting for Motion Picture and 
Videotape Productions; HHS General Administration Manual Chapter 1-121.)
    (14) Privacy Act (Pub. L. 93-579.) Whenever the Department contracts 
for the design, development, operation, or maintenance of a system of 
records on individuals on behalf of the Department in order to 
accomplish a departmental function, the Privacy Act is applicable. The 
program official, after consultation with the activity's Privacy Act 
Coordinator and the Office of General Counsel as necessary shall include 
a statement in the request for contract as to the applicability of the 
Act. Whenever an acquisition is subject to the Act, the program official 
prepares a ``system notice'' and has it published in the Federal 
Register. (See HHS Privacy Act regulation, 45 CFR 5b; FAR Subpart 24.1 
and Subpart 324.1.)
    (b) Clearances or approvals required to be completed prior to 
contract award. All foreign research contract projects to be conducted 
in a foreign country and financed by HHS funds (U.S. dollars) must have 
clearance by the Department of State with respect to consistency with 
foreign policy objectives. This clearance should be obtained prior to 
negotiation. Procedures for obtaining this clearance are set forth in 
the HHS General Administration Manual, Chapter 20-60.

<R05>
307.105-3  Specification, purchase description, and statement of work.

    One of the most important parts of a contract is the description of 
the work to be done. The description of that work may be in the form of 
a specification, purchase description or statement

[[Page 34]]

of work. A brief reference to specifications and purchase descriptions 
is provided, although the nature of the work performed in this 
Department usually results in the development of work statements. The 
development of the acquisition planning document should result in 
sufficient information to readily develop the description of work, 
usually in the form of a statement of work.
    (a) Specification. Specification is defined in FAR 10.001. Use of 
the specification is primarily limited to supply or service contracts 
where the material end item or service to be delivered is well defined 
by the Government.
    (b) Purchase description. FAR 10.001 also contains the definition of 
purchase description.
    (c) Statement of work. (1) General. A statement of work differs from 
a specification and purchase description primarily in that it describes 
work or services to be performed in reaching an end result rather than a 
detailed, well defined description or specification of the end product. 
The statement of work may enumerate or describe the methods 
(statistical, clinical, laboratory, etc.) that will be used. However, it 
is preferable for the offeror to propose the method of performing the 
work. The statement of work should specify the desired results, 
functions, or end items without telling the offeror what has to be done 
to accomplish those results unless the method of performance is critical 
or required for the successful performance of the contract. The 
statement of work should be clear and concise and must completely define 
the responsibilities of the Government and the contractor. The statement 
of work should be worded so as to make more than one interpretation 
virtually impossible because it has to be read and interpreted by 
persons of varied backgrounds, such as attorneys, contracting personnel, 
cost estimators, accountants, scientists, sociologists, educators, 
functional specialists, etc. If the statement of work does not state 
exactly what is wanted, or does not state it precisely, it will generate 
many contract management problems for both the project officer and the 
contracting officer. Ambiguous statements of work can create 
unsatisfactory performance, delays, and disputes, and can result in 
higher costs.
    (2) Term (level of effort) vs. completion work statement. Careful 
distinctions must be drawn between term (level of effort) statements of 
work, which essentially require the furnishing of technical effort and a 
report thereof, and completion type work statements, which often require 
development of tangible end items designed to meet specific performance 
characteristics.
    (i) Term or level of effort. A term or level of effort type 
statement of work is appropriate to research where one seeks to discover 
the feasibility of later development, or to gather general information. 
A term or level of effort type statement of work may only specify that 
some number of labor-hours be expended on a particular course of 
research, or that a certain number of tests be run, without reference to 
any intended conclusion.
    (ii) Completion. A completion type statement of work is appropriate 
to development work where the feasibility of producing an end item is 
already known. A completion type statement of work may describe what is 
to be achieved through the contracted effort, such as the development of 
new methods, new end items, or other tangible results.
    (3) Phasing. Individual research, development, or demonstration 
projects frequently lie well beyond the present state of the art and 
entail procedures and techniques of great complexity and difficulty. 
Under these circumstances, a contractor, no matter how carefully 
selected, may be unable to deliver the desired result. Moreover, the job 
of evaluating the contractor's progress is often difficult. Such a 
contract is frequently phased and often divided into stages of 
accomplishment, each of which must be completed and approved before the 
contractor may proceed to the next. Phasing makes it necessary to 
develop methods and controls, including reporting requirements for each 
phase of the contract and criteria for evaluation of the reports 
submitted, that will provide, at the earliest possible time, appropriate 
data for making decisions relative to all phases. A phased contract may 
include

[[Page 35]]

stages of accomplishment such as research, development, and 
demonstration. Within each phase, there may be a number of tasks which 
should be included in the statement of work. When phases of work can be 
identified, the statement of work will provide for phasing and the 
request for proposals will require the submission of proposed costs by 
phases. The resultant contract will reflect costs by phases, require the 
contractor to identify incurred costs by phases, establish delivery 
schedules by phases, and require the written acceptance of each phase. 
The provisions of the Limitation of Cost clause shall apply to the 
estimated cost of each phase. Contractors shall not be allowed to incur 
costs for phases which are dependent upon successful completion of 
earlier phases until written acceptance of the prior work is obtained 
from the contracting officer.
    (4) Elements of the statement of work. The elements of the statement 
of work will vary with the objective, complexity, size, and nature of 
the acquisition. In general, it should cover the following matters as 
appropriate.
    (i) A general description of the required objectives and desired 
results. Initially, a broad, nontechnical statement of the nature of the 
work to be performed. This should summarize the actions to be performed 
by the contractor and the results that the Government expects.
    (ii) Background information helpful to a clear understanding of the 
requirements and how they evolved. Include a brief historical summary as 
appropriate. Include pertinent legislative history, related contracts or 
grants, and the relationship to overall program objectives.
    (iii) A detailed description of the technical requirements. A 
comprehensive description of the work to be performed to provide 
whatever details are necessary for prospective offerors to submit 
meaningful proposals.
    (iv) Subordinate tasks or types of work. A listing of the various 
tasks or types of work (it may be desirable in some cases to indicate 
that this is not all-inclusive). The degree of task breakout is directly 
dependent on the size and complexity of the work to be performed and the 
logical groupings. A single cohesive task should not be broken out 
merely to conform to a format. Indicate whether the tasks are sequential 
or concurrent for offeror planning purposes.
    (v) Phasing. When phasing is applicable, describe in detail the work 
or effort required in each phase and the criteria for determining 
whether the next phase will take place. If one or more phases contain 
subordinate tasks or types of work, the preceding information in 
paragraph (c)(4) (iv) may be incorporated into the part.
    (vi) Reference material. All reference material to be used in the 
conduct of the project, such as technical publications, reports, 
specifications, architect or engineering drawings, etc., that tell how 
the work is to be carried out must be identified. Applicability should 
be explained, and a statement made as to where the material can be 
obtained.
    (vii) Level of effort. When a level of effort is required, the 
number and type of personnel required should be stated. If known, the 
type and degree of expertise should be specified.
    (viii) Special requirements (as applicable). An unusual or special 
contractual requirement, which would impact on contract performance, 
should be included as a separate section. Such items could include 
required place(s) of performance or unusual travel requirements. 
Clearance requirements, such as forms clearance, should be addressed.
    (ix) Deliverables reporting requirements. All deliverables and/or 
reports must be clearly and completely described. For example, in a 
Final Study Report it is important to indicate what areas the report 
should cover and the criteria for use in accepting the final report to 
determine if the contract objectives have been satisfied. It is 
important to require the preparation and submission of progress reports 
(administrative, technical and financial) to reflect contractor 
certification of satisfactory progress. If possible, the reports should 
be coordinated in such a manner as to provide a correlation between 
costs incurred and the state of completion. All delivery and reporting 
requirements shall include the quantities, the place of delivery, and 
time of delivery.

307.170  Program training requirements.

    (a) Chapter 8-95 of the General Administration Manual (GAM) 
addresses the general parameters for acquisition planning as stated in 
307.104. In conjunction with the principles of proper acquisition 
planning, the Department has established training courses for program 
officials to promote expedient program management in the planning and 
other pertinent aspects of the acquisition process. Chapter 8-96 of the 
GAM sets forth specific training requirements for program officials as 
follows:
    (1) All program personnel selected to serve as project officer for 
an HHS contract shall have successfully completed either the 
Department's appropriate ``Base Project Officer'' course, or an 
equivalent course (see paragraph (b), below).
    (2) At least fifty percent of the HHS program personnel performing 
the function of technical proposal evaluator on a technical evaluation 
team or panel for any competitively solicited HHS contract shall have 
successfully completed the appropriate ``Basic Project Officer'' course, 
or an equivalent course (see paragraph (b), below). This requirement 
applies to the initial technical proposal evaluation and any subsequent 
technical evaluations that may be required.
    (b) Determination of course equivalency shall be made by the 
principal official responsible for acquisition of the cognizant 
contracting activity. The contracting officer is responsible for 
ensuring that the project officer and technical proposal evaluators have 
successfully completed the required training discussed in 307.170-2.

<R05>
307.170-1  Policy exceptions.

    (a) Small contracting activities. (1) Program personnel designated 
to serve as project officers and technical proposal evaluators for 
contracts which originate in offices having a mission which only 
incidentally and infrequently involves the generation of contract 
requirements (i.e., normally less than three contract requirements per 
fiscal year and in an amount not exceeding $100,000 per contract) are 
not required to have completed any of the referenced training courses, 
although completion of an appropriate ``Basic Project Officer'' course 
is recommended.
    (2) As a substitute for the training, contracting officers servicing 
these program offices are required to ensure, as a minimum, that program 
personnel designated to serve as project officers and technical proposal 
evaluators have read and studied the ``DHHS Project Officers' 
Contracting Handbook,'' and fully understand their responsibilities. The 
contracting officer shall require these program personnel to furnish 
written certification that they have fulfilled this requirement prior to 
discharging the duties of project officer or technical proposal 
evaluator.
    (b) Urgent requirements. In the event there is an urgent requirement 
for a specific individual to serve as a project officer and that 
individual has not successfully completed the prerequisite training 
course, the principal official responsible for acquisition may waive the 
training requirement and authorize the individual to perform the project 
duties, provided that:
    (1) The individual first meets with the cognizant contracting 
officer to review the ``DHHS Project Officers' Contracting Handbook,'' 
and to discuss the important aspects of the contracting--program office 
relationship as appropriate to the circumstances; and
    (2) The individual attends the next scheduled and appropriate 
``Basic Project Officer'' course.

[49 FR 13969, Apr. 9, 1984, as amended at 56 FR 47002, Sept. 17, 1991]


<R05>
307.170-2  Training course prerequisites.

    (a) Project officers. (1) Newly appointed project officers, and 
project officers with less than three years experience and no previous 
related training, are required to take the appropriate ``Basic Project 
Officer'' course. (The grade level for project officers attending the 
course should be GS-7 and above). All project officers are encouraged to 
take the appropriate ``Writing Statements of Work'' course.

[[Page 37]]

    (2) Project officers with more than three years experience, and 
project officers with less than three years experience who have 
successfully completed the appropriate basic course, are qualified (and 
encouraged) to take the ``Advanced Project Officer'' course.
    (3) Additional information on prerequisites for attendance of these 
courses may be found in the ``DHHS Acquisition Training and 
Certification Program Handbook.''
    (b) Technical proposal evaluators. Technical proposal evaluators, 
regardless of experience, are required to take the appropriate ``Basic 
Project Officer'' course. Upon successful completion of the basic 
course, it is recommended that they take the appropriate ``Advanced 
Project Officer'' course.

         Subpart 307.3--Contractor Versus Government Performance


<R05>
307.302  General.

    (a) GAM Chapter 18-10, Commercial-Industrial Activities of the 
Department of Health and Human Services Providing Products or Services 
for Government Use, assigns responsibilities for making method-of-
performance decisions (contract vs. in-house performance) to various 
management levels within the Department depending on the dollar amount 
of capital investment or annual operating costs. It also requires that 
each operating division (OPDIV), staff division (STAFFDIV) and regional 
office (RO) designate a ``Commercial-Industrial Control Officer'' (CICO) 
to be responsible for ensuring compliance with the requirements of the 
Chapter.
    (d) Besides contracts with annual operating costs under $100,000, 
contracts under an authorized acquisition set-aside for small business 
or labor surplus area concerns and contracts made pursuant to section 
8(a) of the Small Business Act are exempted from the requirements of FAR 
Subpart 7.3, GAM Chapter 18-10, and OMB Circular No. A-76.


<R05>
307.303  Determining availability of private commercial sources.

    In accordance with the provisions of GAM Chapter 18-10, OPDIVs, 
STAFFDIVs, and ROs and must prepare and maintain a complete inventory of 
all individual commercial or industrial activities, including those 
conducted under contracts in excess of $100,000 annually. They must also 
conduct periodic reviews of each activity and contract in the inventory 
to determine if the existing performance, in-house or by contract, 
continues to be in accordance with the policy guidelines of GAM Chapter 
18-10.


<R05>
307.304  Procedures.

    Contracting officers shall ensure that no acquisition action 
involving a commercial-industrial activity is initiated unless it is in 
compliance with the requirements of GAM Chapter 18-10. The contracting 
officer must check each request for contract expected to result in a 
contract in excess of $100,000 to ensure that it contains a statement as 
to whether the proposed contract is or is not subject to review under 
GAM Chapter 18-10 requirements. If the contracting officer has any 
questions regarding the determination of applicability or 
nonapplicability, or if the required statement is missing, the program 
office submitting the request for contract should be contacted and the 
situation rectified. If the issue cannot be resolved with the program 
office, the contracting officer shall refer the matter to the CICO for a 
final determination. The principal official responsible for acquisition 
is responsible for ensuring that contracting activities are in full 
compliance with FAR Subpart 7.3.


<R05>
307.307  Appeals.

    The review and appeals procedures discussed in FAR 7.307 are 
addressed in GAM Chapter 18-10.


<R04>
     Subpart 307.70--Considerations in Selecting an Award Instrument


<R05>
307.7000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart provides guidance on the appropriate selection of award 
instruments consistent with the Federal

[[Page 38]]

Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-224) and the OMB 
implementation of the Act as published in the Federal Register on August 
18, 1978 (41 FR 36860). This subpart addresses acquisition relationships 
where the award instrument is the contract, and assistance relationships 
where the award instrument is either a grant or cooperative agreement.


<R05>
307.7001  Applicability.

    This subpart applies to the choice of award instrument--contract, 
grant, or cooperative agreement--for all program and individual 
transactions, except where specifically prohibited by law.


<R05>
307.7002  Purpose.

    This subpart provides guidance to assist in the determination of 
whether to use the acquisition or assistance process to fulfill program 
needs. The distinction between, and use of, grants and cooperative 
agreements is not discussed in detail. Detailed guidance may be found in 
Chapter 1-02 of the Grants Administration Manual.


<R05>
307.7003  Distinction between acquisition and assistance.

    (a) The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977 requires 
the use of contracts to acquire property or services for the direct 
benefit or use of the Government and grants or cooperative agreements to 
transfer money, property, services, or anything of value to recipients 
to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by 
Federal statute.
    (b) A contract is to be used as the legal instrument to reflect a 
relationship between the Federal Government and a recipient whenever:
    (1) The principal purpose of the instrument is the acquisition, by 
purchase, lease, or barter, of property or services for the direct 
benefit or use of the Federal Government; or
    (2) The Department determines in a specific instance that the use of 
a type of contract is appropriate. That is, it is determined in a 
certain situation that specific needs can be satisfied best by using the 
acquisition process. However, this authority does not permit 
circumventing the criteria for use of acquisition or assistance 
instruments. Use of this authority is restricted to extraordinary 
circumstances and only with the prior approval of the Director, Office 
of Acquisition and Grants Management.
    (c) A grant or cooperative agreement is to be used as the legal 
instrument to reflect a relationship between the Federal Government and 
a recipient whenever the principal purpose of the relationship is the 
transfer of money, property, services, or anything of value to the 
recipient to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation 
authorized by Federal statute.
    (1) A grant is the legal instrument to be used when no substantial 
involvement is anticipated between the Department and the recipient 
during performance of the contemplated activity.
    (2) A cooperative agreement is the legal instrument to be used when 
substantial involvement is anticipated between the Department and the 
recipient during performance of the contemplated activity.
    (d) As a general rule, contracts are to be used for the following 
purposes:
    (1) Evaluation (including research of an evaluative nature) of the 
performance of Government programs or projects or grantee activity 
initiated by the funding agency for its direct benefit or use.
    (2) Technical assistance rendered to the Government, or on behalf of 
the Government, to any third party, including those receiving grants or 
cooperative agreements.
    (3) Surveys, studies, and research which provide specific 
information desired by the Government for its direct activities, or for 
dissemination to the public.
    (4) Consulting services or professional services of all kinds if 
provided to the Government or, on behalf of the Government, to any third 
party.
    (5) Training projects where the Government selects the individuals 
or specific groups whose members are to be trained or specifies the 
content of the curriculum (not applicable to fellowship awards).
    (6) Planning for Government use.

[[Page 39]]

    (7) Production of publications or audiovisual materials required 
primarily for the conduct of the direct operations of the Government.
    (8) Design or development of items for Government use or pursuant to 
agency definition or specifications.
    (9) Conferences conducted on behalf of the Government.
    (10) Generation of management information or other data for 
Government use.
    (e) As a general rule, grants or cooperative agreements are to be 
used for the following purposes:
    (1) General financial assistance (stimulation or support) to 
eligible recipients under specific legislation authorizing the 
assistance.
    (2) Financial assistance (stimulation or support) to a specific 
program activity eligible for assistance under specific legislation 
authorizing the assistance.

[49 FR 13969, Apr. 9, 1984, as amended at 54 FR 24343, June 7, 1989]


<R05>
307.7004  Procedures.

    (a) OPDIV, agency, and regional office program officials should use 
existing budget and program planning procedures to propose new 
activities and major changes in ongoing programs. It is the 
responsibility of these program officials to meet with the principal 
official responsible for acquisition and the principal grants management 
official, or their designees, to distinguish the relationships and 
determine whether award is to be made through the acquisition process or 
assistance process. This determination should be made prior to the time 
when the annual acquisition plan is reviewed and approved so that the 
plan will reflect all known proposed contract actions. The cognizant 
contracting officer will confirm the appropriateness of the use of the 
contract instrument when reviewing the request for contract.
    (b) Shifts from one award instrument to another must be fully 
documented in the appropriate files to show a fundamental change in 
program purpose that unequivocably justifies the rationale for the 
shift.
    (c) OPDIVs, agencies, and regional offices must ensure that the 
choice of instrument is determined in accordance with the Federal Grant 
and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977 and applicable departmental 
policies. If, however, there are major individual transactions or 
programs which contain elements of both acquisition and assistance in 
such a way that they cannot be characterized as having a principal 
purpose of one or the other, guidance should be obtained from the 
Director, Office of Acquisition and Grants Management through normal 
channels, before proceeding with a determination.
    (d) Any public notice, program announcement, solicitation, or 
request for applications or proposals must indicate whether the intended 
relationship will be one of acquisition or assistance and specify the 
award instrument to be used.

<R04>
   Subpart 307.71--Phase II Advance Acquisition Planning (Scheduling)


<R05>
307.7101  Background.

    (a) Failure to properly plan individual acquisitions and failure to 
schedule the overall acquisition workload of an office, agency, or OPDIV 
tends to result in an inordinate percentage of contract awards being 
made in the closing weeks and even days of the fiscal year. This 
phenomenon, variously identified as ``The September Rush'', ``Hurry-up 
Spending'', ``End-of-Year Purchasing'', and ``Year-End Spending 
Abuses'', in turn fosters rushed, other than full and open competition, 
inadequately documented, and potentially wasteful acquisitions. 
Excessive year-end spending also invites increased intervention and/or 
scrutiny from Congress, the Office of Management and Budget, and the 
media. The end of the fiscal year, however, is usually too late to take 
corrective actions that are effective without being unduly damaging to 
necessary programs. The key is to begin advance acquisition planning far 
earlier.
    (b) To avoid the historic pattern of wasteful and unnecessary year-
end spending, the Department introduced the Acquisition Planning 
Initiative by Under Secretarial memorandum of

[[Page 40]]

February 19, 1980, Subject: New Procedures to Improve Planning and 
Scheduling of Contract Awards and Curb Last-Minute Year-End Procurement 
Spending. Phase II of this initiative, beginning with Fiscal Year 1981, 
established the present acquisition planning mechanism. Basic guidance 
on the Phase II mechanism is contained in the ASMB memorandum of March 
28, 1980, Subject: Phase II of (Fiscal Year 1981) Procurement Planning 
Initiative--Guidelines for Program Funding Milestones. For the Public 
Health Service, the above guidance is supplemented by the ASMB 
memorandum of April 21, 1982, Subject: Phase II Annual Procurement 
Planning.

[49 FR 13969, Apr. 9, 1984, as amended at 50 FR 23129, May 31, 1985; 50 
FR 38004, Sept. 19, 1985]


<R05>
307.7102  Accountability and responsibility.

    Phase II is a Department-wide monitoring and accountability system 
that requires early planning of acquisition requirements down to the 
individual project level. The Phase II mechanism includes the following:
    (a) Accountability lies with the OPDIV and STAFFDIV heads who are 
required to coordinate overall schedules which plot the planned 
distribution of RFC deliveries and contract awards over an eighteen-
month timeline extending to fiscal year-end.
    (b) Each OPDIV and STAFFDIV retains the flexibility to schedule 
individual RFC deliveries and contract awards as desired, so long as the 
overall schedule presents a relatively even distribution of contract 
awards and workload across the fiscal year.
    (c) The schedules are updated quarterly to compare actual versus 
planned progress and, when necessary, to revise the schedules for the 
remainder of the fiscal year.
    (d) Project officers are responsible for initiating the project 
planning by coordinating with contracting activities prior to RFC 
preparation, and taking the lead in developing acquisition plans that 
establish the date(s) for delivering complete RFC packages to the 
contracting activity, and that establish the planned award dates for 
individual projects.
    (e) The Director, Office of Acquisition and Grants Management 
monitors the OPDIV and STAFFDIV Phase II plans throughout the year to 
assure that an even distribution of awards, dollar obligations, and 
workload is maintained.

[49 FR 13969, Apr. 9, 1984, as amended at 50 FR 23126, May 31, 1985; 50 
FR 38004, Sept. 19, 1985; 54 FR 24343, June 7, 1989]


<R05>
307.7103  Purpose.

    The Phase II Advance Acquisition Planning mechanism serves to avoid 
excessive year-end spending and distributes the contract workload as 
evenly as possible over the fiscal year, and provides a mechanism for 
planning at the program/acquisition operational level and a management 
tool for monitoring at the program, OPDIV, and departmental levels.


<R05>
307.7104  Contracting activity actions.

    The contracting activity shall take the following actions:
    (a) Advise program and staff personnel of their responsibilities to 
ensure that:
    (1) Year-end acquisitions of unplanned items are not entered into to 
use available balances of expiring appropriations (which would otherwise 
revert to the Treasury);
    (2) Orders for supplies, materials, and equipment are kept to the 
minimum needed to carry on approved programs;
    (3) Inventories are held to normal levels; and
    (4) New contracts for future services and payments to contractors 
are made only in accordance with established plans.
    (b) Determine closing dates for purchases to be made from 
appropriations ending on September 30.
    (c) Expedite the preparation and processing of determinations and 
findings which require the approval of the Assistant Secretary for 
Management and Budget or the OPDIV head.

           Subpart 309.1--Responsible Prospective Contractors


<R05>
309.104  Standards.


<R05>
309.104-1  General standards.

    (a) In determining the adequacy of a prospective contractor's 
financial resources for the performance of the proposed contract, 
particular attention shall be given to the ability of the contractor to 
discharge its full financial responsibility for charges and losses of 
Government-furnished material, when the contractor has responsibility 
for such material.
    (e) The prospective contractor must have an established system of 
accounting and financial controls which are determined by the 
contracting officer to be adequate to permit the effective 
administration of the type of contract proposed, particularly if under 
its terms the costs incurred are a factor in determining the amount 
payable under the contract, or if advance or progress payments are 
requested.


<R05>
309.105  Procedures.


<R05>
309.105-1  Obtaining information.

    (b)(2)(ii) To ensure that a prospective contractor has the necessary 
accounting and operational controls (see 309.104-1(e)), a written 
determination must be made by the contracting officer that the 
prospective contractor has an adequate accounting system for determining 
costs applicable to the contract and a billing system that satisfies the 
contractual payment provisions. The determination must explain the basis 
for this judgment.
    (A) When dealing with high risk organizations, i.e., new 
organizations, those with known problems, and those with accounting 
system deficiencies, the contracting officer shall use every reasonable 
means available to protect the Government from the improper expenditure 
of Federal funds. Actions should include at least one of the following: 
preaward and postaward audits; direct identification of cost with 
deliverables; billing by contract phases or tasks; fidelity bonding or 
other guarantees by the parent company or principals of the 
organization; increased scrutiny of vouchers and financial reports; and 
frequent site visits to verify the incurrence of specific costs and the 
relationship of technical progress with the amount billed.
    (B) If a prospective contractor's accounting or billing system (or 
both) is determined to be inadequate, corrective action must be taken 
before that organization is awarded a contract. When corrective action 
cannot be completed until after the award and the contracting officer 
determines that the award must be made, the contracting officer shall 
consult with the cognizant cost advisor and take the appropriate actions 
set forth in FAR 16.104 to ensure that the Government's interests will 
be protected and the contract will be adequately costed and 
administered. Awards made under the preceding condition must be approved 
in writing by the principal official responsible for acquisition.

<R05>
309.403  Definitions.

    Acquiring agency's head or a designee, as used in the FAR, shall 
mean, unless otherwise stated in this subpart, the head of the 
contracting activity. Acting in the capacity of the acquiring agency's 
head, the head of the contracting activity may make the required 
justifications or determinations, and take the necessary actions, 
specified in FAR 9.405, 9.406, and 9.407 for his or her respective 
activity, but only after obtaining the approval of the debarring or 
suspending official, as the case may be.
    Debarring official means the Assistant Secretary for Management and 
Budget, or his/her designee.
    Initiating official means either the contracting officer, the head 
of the contracting activity, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Management and Acquisition, or the Inspector General.
    Suspending official means the Assistant Secretary for Management and 
Budget, or his/her designee.

<R05>
309.405  Effect of listing.

    (a) The head of the contracting activity may, with the concurrence 
of the debarring or suspending official, make the determinations 
referenced in FAR 9.405(a), regarding contracts for their respective 
activities.
    (1) If a contracting officer considers it necessary to award a 
contract, or consent to a subcontract with a debarred or suspended 
contractor, the contracting officer shall prepare a determination, 
including all pertinent documentation, and submit it through acquisition 
channels to the head of the contracting activity. The documentation must 
include the date by which approval is required and a compelling reason 
for the proposed action. Some examples of circumstances that may 
constitute a compelling reason for the award to, or consent to a 
subcontract with, a debarred or suspended contractor include:
    (i) The property or services to be acquired are available only from 
the listed contractor;
    (ii) The urgency of the requirement dictates that the Department 
deal with the listed contractor; or
    (iii) There are other compelling reasons which require business 
dealings with the listed contractor.
    (2) If the head of the contracting activity decides to approve the 
requested action, he/she shall request the concurrence of the debarring 
or suspending official and, if given, shall, in writing, inform the 
contracting officer of the decision within the required time period.


<R05>
309.405-1  Continuation of current contracts.

    (a) Notwithstanding the debarment or suspension of a contractor, 
contracting officers may continue contracts or subcontracts in existence 
at the time the contractor was debarred or suspended, unless the head of 
the contracting activity or debarring or suspending official directs 
otherwise. A decision as to the type of termination action, if any, to 
be taken should be made only after review by the awarding activity's 
contracting and technical personnel. The contracting officer shall 
coordinate any termination with the Office of the General Counsel to 
ensure the propriety of the proposed action.
    (b) Contracting officers shall not renew the current contracts of 
debarred or suspended contractors, or otherwise extend their duration, 
unless

[[Page 43]]

the head of the contracting activity determines to do so, with the 
concurrence of the debarring or suspending official. The contracting 
officer shall prepare a determination meeting the requirements of 
309.405(a) and submit it, through acquisition channels, to the head of 
the contracting activity. If the head of the contracting activity agrees 
with the determination, he/she shall obtain the concurrence of the 
debarring or suspending official.


<R05>
309.406  Debarment.


<R05>
309.406-3  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. Whenever an apparent cause for 
debarment becomes known to an initiating official, that person shall 
prepare a report incorporating the information required by 309.470-2, if 
known, and forward it through appropriate channels, with a written 
recommendation, to the debarring official. Contracting officers shall 
forward their reports in accordance with 309.470-1. The debarring 
official shall initiate an investigation through such means as he/she 
deems appropriate.
    (b) Decisionmaking process. The debarring official shall review the 
results of the investigation, if any, and make a written determination 
whether or not debarment procedures are to be commenced. A copy of the 
determination shall be promptly sent through appropriate channels to the 
initiating official, and the contracting officer, if necessary. If the 
debarring official determines to commence debarment procedures, he/she 
shall, after consultation with the Office of the General Counsel, notify 
the contractor in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c). If the proposed action 
is not based on a conviction or judgment and the contractor's submission 
in response to the notice raises a genuine dispute over facts material 
to the proposed debarment, the debarring official shall arrange for 
fact-finding hearings and take the necessary actions specified in FAR 
9.406-3(b)(2). The debarring official shall also ensure that written 
findings of fact are prepared, and shall base the debarment decision on 
the facts as found, after considering information and argument submitted 
by the contractor and any other information in the administrative 
record. The Office of the General Counsel shall represent the Department 
at any fact-finding hearing and may present witnesses for HHS and 
question any witnesses presented by the contractor.


<R05>
309.407  Suspension.


<R05>
309.407-3  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. Whenever an apparent cause for 
suspension becomes known to an initiating official, that person shall 
prepare a report incorporating the information required by 309.470-2, if 
known, and forward it through appropriate channels, with a written 
recommendation, to the suspending official. Contracting officers shall 
forward their reports in accordance with 309.470-1. The suspending 
official shall initiate an investigation through such means as he/she 
deems appropriate.
    (b) Decisionmaking process. The suspending official shall review the 
results of the investigation, if any, and make a written determination 
whether or not suspension should be imposed. A copy of this 
determination shall be promptly sent through appropriate channels to the 
initiating official and the contracting officer, if necessary. If the 
suspending official determines to impose suspension, he/she shall, after 
consultation with the Office of the General Counsel, notify the 
contractor in accordance with FAR 9.407-3(c). If the action is not based 
on an indictment and, subject to the provisions of FAR 9.407-3(b)(2), 
the contractor's submission in response to the notice raises a genuine

    ``Small purchase procedures''
    (d) Acquisition of architect-engineer professional services of any 
dollar amount.


<R05>
313.104  Procedures.

    (i) Small purchase methods are designed to acquire defined, off-the-
shelf, standard supplies, equipment, or services which may be awarded on 
the basis of a fixed price quotation. Small purchase methods should not 
be used to acquire R & D, complex studies, services, and the like (which 
require judgmental technical evaluations and involve negotiations) where 
the award cannot be confidently made on the low price. Where 
requirements are not suitable for accomplishment using small purchase 
methods, more formal negotiation methods or sealed bidding should be 
used.
    (j) Small purchases accomplished in accordance with this part may 
not be awarded on a cost-reimbursement basis.
    (k) Small purchase methods should be used with great prudence for 
the acquisition of consultants to avoid the increased possibility of 
using consultants in an improper personal services capacity.

[49 FR 13977, Apr. 9, 1984, as amended at 50 FR 23129, May 31, 1985; 50 
FR 38004, Sept. 19, 1985; 53 FR 15563, May 2, 1988]


<R05>
313.105  Small business-small purchase set-aside.

    (d)(2) The contracting officer shall consult with the small and 
disadvantaged business utilization specialist (SADBUS) to determine 
whether small business sources are known by the SADBUS before 
determining not to proceed with the small business-small purchase set-
aside. Coordination with the SADBUS is not required for small purchases 
at or below ten percent of the small purchase limitation.

[57 FR 11689, Apr. 7, 1992]


<R05>
313.106  Competition and price reasonableness.

    (a) Purchases not over 10 percent of the small purchase limitation. 
Purchases not exceeding this limit are exempt from the documentary 
requirements of FAR Subpart 6.3 and Subpart 306.3. However, purchases 
shall not be made repetitively from one source except for reasons which 
clearly and convincingly justify other than full and open competition 
(see FAR Subpart 6.3).
    (b) Purchases over 10 percent of the small purchase limitation.
    (4)(i)(D) Women-owned small business.
    (c) Data to support small purchases over 10 percent of the small 
purchase limitation.

[[Page 46]]

    (2) Purchases ranging in excess of 10 percent of the small purchase 
limitation up to and including the small purchase limitation which are 
made without full and open competition require justification as to why 
competition was not obtained. The justification, which may be in the 
form of a paragraph or paragraphs in the request for contract or 
requisition, must address the considerations in FAR Subpart 6.3 and 
Subpart 306.3. The contracting officer may approve or disapprove the 
justification. Award of the contract or purchase order by the 
contracting officer shall constitute approval of the justification (see 
306.304(a)(1)).

<R05>
313.107  Solicitation and evaluation of quotations.

    (e) Amendments. (1) If after the issuance of a request for 
quotations but before the closing date of their receipt, it becomes 
necessary (i) to make significant changes in the quantity, 
specifications, or delivery schedule, (ii) to make any change in the 
closing date, or (iii) to correct a defect or ambiguity, the change 
shall be accomplished by issuance of an amendment to the request. 
Requests for quotations using the Standard Form 18 may be amended by 
letter. Oral requests for quotations may be amended orally.
    (2) When it is considered necessary to issue an amendment to a 
request for quotations, the period of time remaining before closing and 
the need for extending this period by postponing the time set for 
closing must be considered. Where only a short time remains before the 
time set for closing, extension of time may be made by telegram or 
telephone. This notification should be confirmed in the amendment.
    (3) Any information given to one potential quoter concerning a 
request for quotations shall be furnished promptly to all other 
potential quoters in an amendment to the request, if the information is 
necessary to potential quoters in submitting quotations, or if the lack 
of the information would be prejudicial to uninformed potential quoters.

    (e)(5) Delivery documents, invoices, etc. signed by the Government 
employee receiving the item or service, will be forwarded to the fiscal 
office or other paying office as designated by the OPDIV. Payment will 
be made on the basis of the signed document, invoice, etc. Contracting 
offices will ensure that established procedures allowing for 
availability of funds are in effect prior to placement of orders.

<R05>
313.403  Agency responsibilities.

    (a) The amount of each imprest fund shall be established on the 
basis of the estimated monthly payment and the need for replenishment. A 
review shall be made by the responsible official at least quarterly to 
insure that the fund is not in excess of needs, and appropriate 
adjustments are made accordingly.
    (c) Requests to establish imprest funds shall be made to the 
responsible fiscal office. At larger activities where the cashier may 
not be conveniently located near the purchasing office, a Class C 
Cashier may be installed in the purchasing office. Documentation of cash 
purchases shall be in accordance with instructions contained in the HHS 
Voucher Audit Manual Part 1, Chapter 1-10.

prevent unauthorized use. A reservation of funds shall be established to 
cover total anticipated expenditures prior to use of the SF-44.

referred by telephone or telegraph.
    (5) Where the evidence submitted by the bidder is incomplete or in 
need of clarification, the contracting officer shall document the file

315.405-1  General.

    The determination approval required by FAR 15.405-1 that a 
solicitation for information or planning purposes is appropriate shall 
be made by the chief of the contracting office.


<R05>
315.406  Preparing requests for proposals (RFP's) and requests for quotations (RFQ's).

    (a) The contracting officer is responsible for preparing the RFP 
with the assistance of the project officer. The purpose of the RFP is to 
convey information that prospective offerors need to prepare a proposal. 
The RFP includes the statement of work and the terms, conditions and 
provisions that will form the basis for the final definitive contract. 
It specifies all the information that prospective offerors must furnish 
to permit a meaningful and equitable evaluation of their offers. The RFP 
must be clear, complete, accurate, and consistent with the requirements 
of the acquisition so that it provides all who receive it with the same 
understanding of the requirements. Much of the information in the RFP is 
either derived directly from the request for contract or is otherwise 
furnished by the project officer. Therefore, it is important that the 
project officer develop a meaningful request for contract and supporting 
documentation during the initial presolicitation phase which will fully 
satisfy program needs and objectives when included in the RFP (see 
subpart 315.70).
    (b) Careful drafting of the RFP is vital to the proper working of 
the competitive process. The success of the acquisition depends, in 
large measure, on how well the work to be performed and the basic ground 
rules under which the competition will be conducted are described in the 
RFP. Particular effort must be made to develop a comprehensive and 
accurate statement of work (see 307.105-3 and FAR 35.007) to prevent 
ambiguities and to avoid misunderstandings which might otherwise surface 
at later stages of the acquisition.
    (c) Care should be taken to avoid conflicting statements in the RFP. 
Clear

[[Page 50]]

distinctions must be made as to the contents and purpose of the 
statement of work, the instructions to offerors, and the evaluation 
criteria. Briefly:
    (1) The statement of work must clearly specify the work to be done 
by the resultant contractor (or, if it is an R & D acquisition, present 
a clear statement of the requirements, see FAR part 35);
    (2) The general, technical, and business instructions must delineate 
all the essential information prospective offerors need to know in 
preparing their proposals (see 315.406-5(b)); and
    (3) The evaluation criteria must clearly indicate the technical, 
management, personnel, and cost or pricing factors which are to be the 
major considerations in selecting the successful offeror (see 315.406-
5(c)).
    (d) The RFP must require that proposals be submitted in two parts--a 
``Technical Proposal'' and a ``Business Proposal.'' Each part is to be 
separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be 
accomplished independently of the other.
    (e) The technical and business proposal instructions of the RFP must 
provide all the information deemed essential for proper evaluation of 
the proposals so that all prospective offerors are aware of all 
requirements, and so that differences in proposals will reflect each 
offeror's individual approach to the clear and unambiguous requirements 
and criteria stated in the RFP.
    (f) The RFP must inform prospective offerors of all evaluation 
criteria and of the relative importance or weight attached to each 
criterion. Evaluation criteria must be described sufficiently enough in 
the RFP to inform prospective offerors of the significant matters which 
should be addressed in the proposals. Only the evaluation criteria set 
forth in the RFP shall be used in the evaluation of proposals, and the 
criteria can only be modified by a formal amendment to the RFP.
    (g) Generally, the RFP will provide that the technical proposal not 
contain any reference to cost. However, resource information, such as 
data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, 
travel, computer time, etc., must be included in the technical proposal 
so that the offeror's understanding of the scope of work may be 
evaluated.
    (h) The project officer should be offered the opportunity to review 
the finalized RFP before it is printed and released.


<R05>
315.406-1  Uniform contract format.

    The uniform contract format specified in FAR 15.406-1 and Table 15-1

    (a) Section A, Solicitation/contract form.
    (3) Contracting activities are encouraged to use SF 33 for RFPs. In 
those instances where a contracting activity believes the SF 33 is not 
appropriate, a transmittal letter may be used. However, it is essential 
that the transmittal letter contain the pertinent information that must 
be brought to the attention of prospective offerors, so the information 
contained in FAR 15.406-2(a)(3) shall be included in it. The transmittal 
letter should also contain reference to the solicitation provision 
``Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Proposals or 
Quotations'' and stress the importance of timeliness. The last paragraph 
of the transmittal letter should provide the name and complete telephone 
number of a contract specialist who can provide information concerning 
the solicitation.

    (xx) 352.215-71, Employer's Identification Number.
    (b) Section L, Instructions, conditions, and notices to offerors and 
quoters. This section shall be comprised of the general instructions, 
technical proposal instructions, and business proposal instructions, as 
well as pertinent solicitation provisions (see FAR 15.407).
    (1) General instructions.
    (i) The general instructions provide basic guidance to prospective 
offerors that informs them of what is required in the preparation and 
submission of proposals. The general instructions must include the 
following statements and any instructions pertinent to the individual 
acquisition and applicable requirements of the OPDIV, agency, or 
regional office.

                          General Instructions

    The following instructions establish the acceptable minimum 
requirements for the format and content of proposals:
    Your special attention is directed to the requirements for technical 
and business proposals to be submitted in accordance with these 
instructions.
    Any resultant contract shall include the general provisions 
applicable to the selected offeror's organization and type of contract 
awarded. Copies of general provisions may be

[[Page 52]]

obtained by contacting the contracting officer. Any additional clauses 
required by public law, executive order, or acquisition regulations, in 
effect at the time of execution of the proposed contract, will be 
included.
    The proposal must be prepared in two parts: a ``Technical Proposal'' 
and a ``Business Proposal.'' Each of the parts shall be separate and 
complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished 
independently of evaluation of the other. The technical proposal must 
not contain reference to cost; however, resource information, such as 
data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, 
etc., must be contained in the technical proposal so that your 
understanding of the scope of the work may be evaluated. It must 
disclose your technical approach in sufficient detail to provide a clear 
and concise presentation that includes, but is not limited to, the 
requirements of the technical proposal instructions.
    The proposal must be signed by an official authorized to bind your 
organization. (Number) copies of your technical proposal and (number) 
copies of your business proposal must be submitted to: (Insert complete 
address indicating where the proposal is to be sent and how it is to be 
marked. Provide similar information for hand-delivered proposals.)
    You may, at your discretion, submit alternate proposals, or 
proposals which deviate from the requirements; provided, that you also 
submit a proposal for performance of the work as specified in the 
statement of work. These proposals may be considered if overall 
performance would be improved or not compromised, and if they are in the 
best interest of the Government. Alternate proposals, or deviations from 
any requirements of this RFP, must be clearly identified.
    The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with the 
evaluation criteria set forth in Section M of this request for 
proposals.
    It is understood that your proposal will become part of the official 
contract file.
    The RFP does not commit the Government to pay any cost for the 
preparation and submission of a proposal. In addition, the Contracting 
Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to 
the expenditure of public funds in connection with this proposed 
acquisition.

    (ii) Include either of the following in the General Instructions if 
prospective offerors are to be informed of the Government's estimate of 
the level of effort necessary to accomplish the requirement:

    The Government considers the level of effort to perform the 
resultant contract should take the following staff-hours: (insert a 
breakdown of the Government's staff-hour estimates by categories). These 
estimates are furnished for the offeror's information only and are not 
to be considered restrictive for proposal purposes; or
    To assist you in the preparation of your proposal, the Government 
considers the effort to perform this contract to be approximately 
(insert the total number) staff-hours. This number is furnished for the 
offeror's information only and is not considered restrictive for 
proposal purposes.

    Note: The first paragraph should only be used for term (e.g. level 
of effort task order), rather than completion type, contracts.)

    (iii) If the proposed contract will involve performance or services 
on a Government installation, insert the following in the General 
Instructions:

    Offerors are urged and expected to inspect the site where services 
are to be performed and to satisfy themselves as to all general and 
local conditions that may affect the cost of performance of the 
contract, to the extent such information is reasonably obtainable. In no 
event will failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for claims by 
the contractor after the award of a contract.

    (iv) If reference material is to be provided for use in preparation 
of proposals, insert either of the following:

    To assist offerors in preparing their proposals, reference material 
consisting of (insert title or description of publications, 
specifications, drawings, reports, or other documentation being made 
available as reference material) will be available for inspection at 
(insert name and address of building and room number).
    Offerors are expected to examine all reference material prior to 
preparation and submission of their proposals. Failure to do so will be 
at the offeror's risk; or
    To assist offerors in preparing their proposals, reference material 
consisting of (insert title or description of publications, 
specifications, drawings, reports, or other documentation being 
furnished as reference material) is enclosed. Offerors are expected to 
examine all reference material prior to preparation and submission of 
their proposal. Failure to do so will be at the offeror's risk.

    (v) If the reference material being provided is to be returned to 
the Government, include the following statement:

    All reference material furnished hereunder shall be returned within 
(insert number) days after the submission of proposals to (insert name 
and address of building and room number).


[[Page 53]]


    (vi) If an incentive type contract is being considered, a notice to 
the offeror of the Government's desire as to use of incentives 
considered applicable, objectives of the incentive performance goals, 
schedules, milestones, critical delivery parameters, and similar 
information must be included.
    (2) Technical proposal instructions.
    (i) The technical proposal instructions should clearly and concisely 
describe the information prospective offerors must provide in their 
technical proposals. The instructions should address the need for 
submission of a detailed work plan indicating how each aspect of the 
statement of work is to be accomplished, a discussion of how the work is 
to be organized, staffed, and managed, and statements of the 
qualifications and experience of the prospective offeror and its key 
personnel.
    (ii) The technical proposal instructions must be specific enough to 
convey the information the program office will require from offerors to 
allow the technical proposal evaluators to determine whether a proposal 
is acceptable. Therefore, it is essential that the instructions are 
written to elicit the information necessary to fully address all the 
elements of the work plan with particular emphasis on the evaluation 
criteria, so that evaluators may readily evaluate each offer in the 
pertinent areas. The instructions should not require the submission of 
excessive information since this will complicate the evaluation process 
and could cause unnecessary proposal preparation costs for offerors.
    (iii) The technical proposal instructions should require that 
technical proposals be prepared in a specified format to facilitate 
evaluation. A uniform format will minimize evaluators' efforts and 
should minimize the amount of extraneous and voluminous material 
sometimes included in proposals.
    (iv) Since specific instructions must be developed to suit the needs 
of the individual acquisition, detailed guidance concerning the contents 
of the technical proposal instructions is not presented here. However, 
the following represents a sampling of general statements which may be 
helpful in the preparation of the instructions:

                     Technical Proposal Instructions

    Proposals which merely offer to conduct a program in accordance with 
the requirements of the Government's scope of work will not be eligible 
for award. You must submit an explanation of the proposed technical 
approach in conjunction with the tasks to be performed in achieving the 
project objectives.
    A detailed work plan must be submitted indicating how each aspect of 
the statement of work is to be accomplished. Your technical approach 
should be in as much detail as you consider necessary to fully explain 
your proposed technical approach or method. The technical proposal 
should reflect a clear understanding of the nature of the work being 
undertaken.
    The technical proposal must include information on how the project 
is to be organized, staffed, and managed. Information should be provided 
which will demonstrate your understanding and management of important 
events or tasks. You must explain how the management and coordination of 
consultant and/or subcontractor efforts will be accomplished.
    The technical proposal must include a list of names and proposed 
duties of the professional personnel, consultants, and key subcontractor 
employees assigned to the project. Their resumes should be included and 
should contain information on education, background, recent experience, 
and specific scientific or technical accomplishments. The approximate 
percentage of time each individual will be available for this project 
must be included. The proposed staff hours for each of the above 
individuals should be allocated against each task or subtask for the 
project.
    The technical proposal must provide the general background, 
experience, and qualifications of the organization. Similar or related 
contracts, subcontracts, or grants should be included and contain the 
name of the customer, contract or grant number, dollar amount, time of 
performance, and the names and telephone numbers of the project officer 
and contracting/grants officer.
    The technical proposal must contain a discussion of present or 
proposed facilities and equipment which will be used in the performance 
of the contract.
    The technical proposal must be prepared and submitted in the 
following format:
    (Provide the required format.)

    (3) Business proposal instructions. Business proposal instructions 
consist of cost and pricing data and administrative and management data.
    (i) Cost and pricing data. Prospective offerors must be informed in 
the business proposal instruction that they are

[[Page 54]]

required to submit cost or pricing information in sufficient detail to 
allow a complete cost analysis. (See FAR 15.804 for requirements on cost 
or pricing data.) Categories and amounts of labor, materials, travel, 
computer time, overhead and other costs should be requested. Prospective 
offerors are to be provided Standard Form 1411, Contract Pricing 
Proposal Cover Sheet, for use in preparing the cost of pricing data, and 
are to be told to submit, as a minimum, cost proposals fully supported 
by cost and pricing data adequate to establish the reasonableness of the 
proposed amount. Prospective offerors are to comply with the instruction 
on the SF 1411 and fill in or check the appropriate boxes. In addition, 
they should be informed to itemize the cost for individual elements, 
each as analytical studies, reports, etc., and the estimated cost of 
each phase or segment of the offered performance.
    (ii) Administrative and management data.
    (A) The business proposal instructions must be written so that the 
contracting officer receives adequate information to evaluate each 
offeror's management capability and to determine whether each offeror is 
responsible. Therefore, under this section, information should be 
requested to allow the contracting officer to assess the following 
factors as they apply to the instant acquisition:
    (1) The offeror's financial capability;
    (2) The offeror's capability to meet delivery or performance 
schedules;
    (3) The offeror's record of past performance;
    (4) The offeror's record of business integrity;
    (5) The offerors's possession of necessary organization, experience, 
and technical skills, or the ability to obtain them;
    (6) The offeror's possession of required facilities; and
    (7) Any other special consideration involved in the instant 
acquisition.

In some cases, these factors may duplicate evaluation criteria and may 
be adequately addressed in the technical proposal instructions. However, 
the contracting officer must ensure that they are covered in both the 
business proposal instructions and the technical proposal instructions.
    (B) The contracting officer may determine that other administrative 
data in the form of additional business or cost information is 
necessary. Some examples of additional information include:
    (1) A copy of the current agreement on indirect cost rates;
    (2) A copy of the most recent financial statements;
    (3) A discussion on the extent of proposed subcontracting with small 
and disadvantaged business enterprises;
    (4) A request for pricing or cost breakdown tailored to the instant 
acquisition to provide information for a more thorough and complete cost 
analysis; and
    (5) A request for explicit instructions on pricing of options and 
individual line items.

However, care should be taken to request additional information only 
when necessary, to prevent excessive proposal preparation costs for 
offerors.
    (C) The following are required statements which must be included in 
the RFP.

    Your proposal must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the 
terms and conditions of this RFP. In addition, it must contain a 
statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least (insert 
number) days from the date of receipt by the Government.
    It is HHS policy that contractors provide all equipment and 
facilities necessary for performance of contracts; however, in some 
instances, an exception may be granted to furnish Government-owned 
property or to authorize purchase with contract funds. If additional 
equipment must be acquired, you must include in your proposal the 
description and estimated cost of each item, and whether you propose to 
furnish the item with your own funds.
    You must identify all Government-owned property in your possession 
and all property acquired from Federal funds, to which you have title, 
that is proposed to be used in the performance of the prospective 
contract.
    The management and control of Government property must be in 
accordance with HHS Publication (OS) 686 entitled, ``Contractor's Guide 
for Control of Government Property (1990),'' a copy of which will be 
provided upon request.

    (c) Section M, Evaluation factors for award--(1) General. (i) The 
evaluation criteria must be developed by the

[[Page 55]]

project officer and submitted to the contracting officer in the request 
for contract (RFC) for inclusion in the RFP. Development of these 
criteria and the assignment of the relative importance or weight to each 
criterion require the exercise of judgment on a case-by-case basis 
because they must be tailored to the requirements of the individual 
acquisition. Since the criteria will serve as a standard against which 
all proposals will be evaluated, it is imperative that they be chosen 
carefully to emphasize those factors considered to be critical in the 
selection of a contractor.
    (ii) The finalized evaluation criteria and indications of their 
relative importance or weights, as included in the RFP, cannot be 
changed except by a formal amendment to the RFP issued by the 
contracting officer. No factors other than those set forth in the RFP 
shall be used in the evaluation of proposals.
    (2) Review of evaluation criteria. (i) The evaluation criteria 
should be reviewed by the contracting officer in terms of the work 
statement. This review is not intended to dictate to the program office 
or project officer, but rather to ensure that the evaluation criteria 
are clear, concise, and fair so that all potential offerors are fully 
aware of the bases for proposal evaluation and are given an equal 
opportunity to compete.
    (ii) The project officer and the contracting officer should then 
review the evaluation criteria together to ascertain the following:
    (A) The criteria are described in sufficient detail to provide the 
offerors (and evaluators) with a total understanding of the factors to 
be involved in the evaluation process;
    (B) The criteria address the key programmatic concerns which the 
offerors must be aware of in preparing proposals;
    (C) The criteria are specifically applicable to the instant 
acquisition and are not merely restatements of criteria from previous 
acquisitions which are not relevant to this acquisition; and
    (D) The criteria are selected to represent only the significant 
areas of importance which must be emphasized rather than a multitude of 
factors. (All criteria tend to lose importance if too many are included. 
Using too many criteria will prove as detrimental as using too few.)
    (3) Examples of topics that form a basis for evaluation criteria. 
Typical examples of topics that form a basis for the development of 
evaluation criteria are listed in the following paragraphs. These 
examples are intended to assist in the development of actual evaluation 
criteria for a specific acquisition and should only be used if they are 
applicable to that acquisition. They are not to be construed as actual 
examples of evaluation criteria to be included in the RFP.
    (i) Understanding of the problem and statement of work;
    (ii) Method of accomplishing the objectives and intent of the 
statement of work;
    (iii) Soundness of the scientific or technical approach for 
executing the requirements of the statement of work (to include, when 
applicable, preliminary layouts, sketches, diagrams, other graphic 
representations, calculations, curves, and other data necessary for 
presentation, substantiation, justification, or understanding of the 
approach);
    (iv) Special technical factors, such as experience or pertinent 
novel ideas in the specific branch of science or technology involved;
    (v) Feasibility and/or practicality of successfully accomplishing 
the requirements (to include a statement and discussion of anticipated 
major difficulties and problem areas and recommended approaches for 
their resolution);
    (vi) Availability of required special research, test, and other 
equipment or facilities;
    (vii) Managerial capability (ability to achieve delivery or 
performance requirements as demonstrated by the proposed use of 
management and other personnel resources, and to successfully manage the 
project, including subcontractor and/or consultant efforts, if 
applicable, as evidenced by the management plan and demonstrated by 
previouis experience).
    (viii) Availability, qualifications, experience, education, and 
competence of

[[Page 56]]

professional, technical, and other personnel, to include proposed 
subcontractors and consultants (as evidenced by resumes, endorsements, 
and explanations of previous efforts); and
    (ix) Soundness of the proposed staff time or labor hours, propriety 
of personnel classifications (professional, technical, others), 
necessity for type and quantity of material and facilities proposed, 
validity of proposed subcontracting, and necessity of proposed travel.
    (4) Relative importance or weight.
    (i) A statement or indication of the relative importance or weight 
must be assigned to each evaluation criterion to inform prospective 
offerors (and evaluators) of the specific significance of each criterion 
in comparsion to the other criteria. Similarly, if a criterion is 
subdivided into parts, each of the parts must be assigned a statement or 
indication of the relative importance or weight.
    (ii) The two principal methods used to indicate the relative 
importance or weight are the numerical score and adjective description. 
The Department does not prescribe a single method for determining the 
relative importance or weight, but recommends the use of the numerical 
score method because it is more precise and informative. However, it is 
recognized that in some instances the use of the adjective description 
method be more appropriate and, hence, may be used when that 
determination is made.
    (iii) Cost or price is not generally included as one of the 
evaluation criteria and is not assigned an indication of relative 
importance or weight. However, a statement must be included in the RFP 
to reflect the relationship of cost or price in comparison to the other 
criteria. The contracting officer must ensure that this statement 
accurately reflects the appropriate balance between cost or price and 
the technical factors. The contracting officer and project officer 
should work together in arriving at the final determination regarding 
the relationship. The following are examples of statements that may be 
used to reflect this relationship. However, since these examples 
represent only the two extremes and the middle position, another 
statement may be developed to reflect the relationship which applies to 
the instant acquisition.
    (A) You are advised that paramount consideration shall be given to 
the evaluation of technical proposals rather then cost or price.
    (B) You are advised that paramount consideration shall be given to 
cost or price rather than the evaluation of technical proposals.
    (C) You are advised that the evaluation of technical proposals and 
cost or price are of approximately equal value.

<R05>
315.413-1  Alternate I.

    The Department shall not use Alternate I procedures.


<R05>
315.413-2  Alternate II.

    The Department shall use the Alternate II procedures as modified in 
this subsection and shall use the provision at 352.215-12, Restriction 
on Disclosure and Use of Data, rather than the similar provision at FAR 
15.215-12 (see 315.407(c)(8)). Any reference in the FAR to the provision 
at FAR 52.215-12 shall apply to the provision at 352.215-12.
    (b) The term data, as used in this section and in 352.215-12, refers 
to trade secrets, business data, and technical data. Trade secrets, 
within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 1905, include, for example, processes, 
formulas, and chemical compositions. Business data includes, for 
example, commercial information, financial information, and cost and 
pricing data. Technical data includes, for example, plans, designs, 
suggestions, improvements and concepts.

The Department recognizes that requests for proposals may require the 
offeror, including its prospective subcontractor(s), if any, to submit 
data which the offeror does not want used or disclosed for any purpose 
other than for evaluation of the proposal. Each proposal containing data 
which the offeror desires to restrict must be marked on the cover sheet 
by the offeror with the legend set forth at 352.215-12. Proposals, or 
portions of proposals, so marked shall be handled in accordance with the 
provisions of the legend.
    (c) Contracting officers receiving proposals which contain 
restrictive statements or legends not conforming to the referenced 
provision at 352.215-12 must carefully evaluate the form and substance 
of the restriction before making a determination to reject the proposal. 
Deviations in form which do not compromise the Government's rights may 
be accepted if approved by the activity's FOI official and the Office of 
General Counsel, Business and Administrative Law Division.
    (e) The Government notice shown in FAR 15.413-2(e) shall be used by 
this Department and is to be placed on the cover sheet of each proposal 
or quotation upon its receipt. The Government notice shall be completed 
by adding the following to the end of the last sentence: ``HHSAR 
paragraph 315.608-72.''
    (f) The Department sometimes finds it necessary (and in some 
instances is required by law) to seek evaluation of proposals outside 
the Department (see 315.608(d)(6)). All conditions required by FAR 
15.413-2(f) have been met and are covered in 315.608-72, Procedures for 
handling and disclosing proposals. In regard to item (f)(1) of FAR 
15.413-2, the Department has found that the procedure stated in the 
first sentence of paragraph 315.608-72 is best and considers it in 
compliance with the FAR requirement.

315.470  Review of RFP.

    The principal official responsible for acquisition shall establish 
procedures to ensure that an independent review of the RFP is made 
between the time the synopsis is sent to the Commerce Business Daily 
announcing the availability of the RFP and the release date of the RFP. 
The individual selected to conduct the review must possess the 
acquisition knowledge necessary to readily ascertain whether the RFP 
contains the required information to be in conformance with all laws, 
regulations, and internal procedures and instructions. The individual 
selected to conduct the review must be a person other than the preparer 
of the RFP.

                  Subpart 315.5--Unsolicited Proposals


<R05>
315.505  Content of unsolicited proposals.

    (d) Certification by offeror--To ensure against contacts between 
Department employees and prospective offerors which would exceed the 
limits of advance guidance set forth in FAR 15.504 resulting in an 
unfair advantage to an offeror, the principal official responsible for 
acquisition (or designee) shall ensure that the following certification 
is furnished to the prospective offeror and the executed certification 
is included as part of the resultant unsolicited proposal:

              Unsolicited Proposal Certification by Offeror

    This is to certify, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that:
    a. This proposal has not been prepared under Government supervision.
    b. The methods and approaches stated in the proposal were developed 
by this offeror.
    c. Any contact with employees of the Department of Health and Human 
Services has been within the limits of appropriate advance guidance set 
forth in FAR 15.504.
    d. No prior commitments were received from departmental employees 
regarding acceptance of this proposal.
Date:___________________________________________________________________
Organization:___________________________________________________________
Name:___________________________________________________________________
Title:__________________________________________________________________

(This certification shall be signed by a responsible official of the 
proposing organization or a person authorized to contractually obligate 
the organization.)


<R05>
315.506  Agency procedures.

    (a) The principal official responsible for acquisition is 
responsible for establishing procedures to comply with FAR 15.506(a).
    (b) The principal official responsible for acquisition or his/her 
designee shall be the point of contact for coordinating the receipt and 
handling of unsolicited proposals. Contacts made outside the contracting 
activity shall be promptly coordinated with the principal official 
responsible for acquisition or the designee.


<R05>
315.506-1  Receipt and initial review.

    (d) An unsolicited proposal shall not be refused consideration 
merely because it was initially submitted as a grant application. 
However, contracts shall not be awarded on the basis of unsolicited 
proposals which have been rejected for grant support on the ground that 
they lack scientific merit.


<R05>
315.509  Limited use of data.

    The legend, Use and Disclosure of Data, prescribed in FAR 15.509(a) 
is to be used by the offeror to restrict the use of data for evaluation 
purposes only. However, data contained within the unsolicited proposal 
may have to be disclosed as a result of a request submitted pursuant to 
the Freedom of Information Act. Because of this possibility, the 
following notice shall be furnished to all prospective offerors of 
unsolicited proposals whenever the legend is provided in accordance with 
FAR 15.504(b)(7):

    The Government will attempt to comply with the ``Use and Disclosure 
of Data'' legend. However, the Government may not be able to withhold a 
record (data, document, etc.) nor deny access to a record requested by 
an individual (the public) when an obligation is imposed on the 
Government under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as 
amended. The Government's determination to withhold or disclose a record 
will be based upon the particular circumstances involving the record in 
question and whether the record may be exempted from disclosure under 
the Freedom of Information Act. Records which the offeror considers to 
be trade secrets and commercial or financial information and privileged 
or confidential must be identified by the offeror as indicated in the 
referenced legend.


<R04>
                     Subpart 315.6--Source Selection


<R05>
315.602  Applicability.

    (b) This subpart does not apply to contracts for architect-engineer 
services or contracts awarded to the Small Business Administration under 
section 8(a) of the Small Business Act.


<R05>
315.604  Responsibilities.

    (d) Personnel participating in the evaluation process must not 
discuss or

[[Page 59]]

reveal information concerning the evaluations except to an individual 
participating in the same evaluation proceedings, and then only to the 
extent that the information is required in connection with the 
proceedings. Divulging information during the evaluation, selection, and 
negotiation phases of the acquisition to offerors or to personnel not 
having a need to know could jeopardize the resultant award. Therefore, 
the contracting officer must instruct personnel participating in the 
evaluations to observe these restrictions and insure that all personnel 
understand that unauthorized disclosure of information, no matter how 
innocent, could compromise the acquisition process and is prohibited.
    (e) Only the contracting officer or his/her authorized 
representative within the contracting office shall conduct discussions 
with offerors relative to any aspect of the acquisition.


<R05>
315.605  Evaluation factors.

    (e) The evaluation criteria included in the solicitation serve as 
the standard against which all proposals are evaluated. Prospective 
offerors rely upon the evaluation criteria in the solicitation in 
developing proposals, and they must be assured that the evaluation is 
conducted in accordance with those criteria. All personnel involved in 
the evaluation process must make sure that the evaluation criteria 
contained in the solicitation are the only criteria used in conducting 
the evaluation. See FAR 15.406-5(c) and 315.406-5(c) for detailed 
guidance on evaluation criteria.


<R05>
315.607  Disclosure of mistakes before award.

    (a) The contracting officer shall require that offerors' 
clarifications are in writing.
    (c)(3) The chief of the contracting office is authorized to make the 
written determination permitting a correction of a mistake in a 
proposal.


<R05>
315.608  Proposal evaluation.

    (a)(1) Cost of price evaluation. (See 315.608-77.)
    (2) Technical evaluation. (See 315.608-75 and 76.)
    (b) The determination required by FAR 15.608(b) shall be made by the 
chief of the contracting office.

at 51 FR 44294, Dec. 9, 1986]


<R05>
315.608-70  Technical evaluation plan.

    (a) A technical evaluation plan may be required by the contracting 
officer, at his/her discretion, when an acquisition is sufficiently 
complex as to warrant a formal plan.
    (b) The technical evaluation plan should include at least the 
following:
    (1) A list of technical evaluation panel members, their 
organizations as well as a list of their major consulting clients (if 
applicable), their qualifications, and curricula vitae (if available);
    (2) A justification for using non-Government technical evaluation 
panel members. (Justification is not required if non-Government 
evaluators will be used in accordance with standard contracting activity 
procedures or policies);
    (3) A statement that there is no apparent or actual conflict of 
interest regarding any panel member;
    (4) A copy of each rating sheet, approved by the contracting 
officer, to be used to assure consistency with the evaluation criteria; 
and
    (5) A brief description of the general evaluation approach.
    (c) The technical evaluation plan must be signed by an official 
within the program office in a position at least one level above the 
project officer or in accordance with contracting activity procedures.
    (d) The technical evaluation plan should be submitted to the 
contracting officer for review and approval before the solicitation is 
issued. The contracting officer shall make sure that the principal 
factors relating to the evaluation are reflected in the evaluation 
criteria when conducting the review of the plan.

<R05>
315.608-71  Technical evaluation panel.

    (a) General. (1) A technical evaluation panel is required for all 
acquisitions

[[Page 60]]

applicable to this subpart which are expected to exceed $300,000. The 
contracting officer has the discretion to require a technical evaluation 
panel for acquisitions not exceeding $300,000 based on the complexity of 
the acquisition.
    (2) The technical evaluation process requires careful consideration 
regarding the size, composition, expertise, and function of the 
technical evaluation panel. The efforts of the panel can result in the 
success or failure of the acquisition.
    (b) Role of the project officer. (1) The project officer is the 
contracting officer's technical representative for the acquisition 
action. The project officer may be a voting member of the technical 
evaluation panel, and may also serve as the chairperson of the panel, 
unless prohibited by law or contracting activity procedures.
    (2) The project officer is responsible for recommending panel 
members who are knowledgeable in the technical aspects of the 
acquisition and who are competent to identify strengths and weaknesses 
of the various proposals. The program training requirements specified in 
307.170 must be adhered to when selecting prospective panel members.
    (3) The project officer shall ensure that persons possessing 
expertise and experience in addressing issues relative to sex, race, 
national origin, and handicapped discrimination be included as panel 
members in acquisitions which address those issues. The intent is to 
balance the composition of the panel so that qualified and concerned 
individuals may provide insight to other panel members regarding ideas 
and approaches to be taken in the evaluation of proposals.
    (4) The project officer is to submit the recommended list of panel 
members to an official within the program office in a position at least 
one level above the project officer or in accordance with contracting 
activity procedures. This official will review the recommendations, 
appoint the panel members, and select the chairperson.
    (5) The project officer shall arrange for adequate and secure 
working space for the panel.
    (c) Role of the contracting officer. (1) The contracting officer is 
the Department's official representative with delegated acquisition 
authority to enter into and administer contracts. The term ``contracting 
officer,'' as used in this subpart, may be the contracting officer or 
his/her designated representative within the contracting office.
    (2) The contracting officer shall not serve as a member of the 
technical evaluation panel but should be available to:
    (i) Address the initial meeting of the technical evaluation panel 
(see 315.608-74(c));
    (ii) Provide assistance to the evaluators as required; and
    (iii) Ensure that the scores adequately reflect the written 
technical evaluation report comments (see 315.608-76).
    (d) Conflicts of interest. (1) If a panel member has an actual or 
apparent conflict of interest related to a proposal under evaluation, 
he/she shall be removed from the panel and replaced with another 
evaluator. If a suitable replacement is not available, the panel shall 
perform the review without a replacement.
    (2) For the purposes of this subpart, conflicts of interest are 
defined in the Department's Standards of Conduct set forth in 45 CFR 
part 73 which incorporates 5 CFR part 737, Post Employment Conflict of 
Interest. The Standards of Conduct shall be applicable to both in-house 
personnel and outside evaluators serving on the technical evaluation 
panel.
    (e) Continuity of evaluation process. (1) The technical evaluation 
panel is responsible for evaluating the original proposals, making 
recommendations to the chairperson regarding clarifications and 
deficiencies of proposals, and, if required by the contracting officer, 
assisting the contracting officer during discussions and negotiations, 
and reviewing supplemental, revised and/or ``best and final'' offers. To 
the extent possible, the same evaluators should be available throughout 
the entire evaluation and selection process to ensure continuity and 
consistency in the treatment of proposals. The following are examples of 
circumstances when it

[[Page 61]]

would not be necessary for the technical evaluation panel to evaluate 
revised proposals submitted during the acquisition:
    (i) The answers to questions do not have a substantial impact on the 
proposal (see 315.609(i));
    (ii) The ``best and final'' offers are not materially different from 
the original proposals; or
    (iii) The rankings of the offerors are not affected because the 
revisions to the proposals are relatively minor.
    (2) The chairperson, with the concurrence of the contracting 
officer, may decide not to have the panel evaluate the revised 
proposals. Whenever this decision is made, it must be fully documented 
by the chairperson and approved by the contracting officer.
    (3) When technical evaluation panel meetings are considered 
necessary by the contracting officer, the attendance of evaluators is 
mandatory. When the chairperson determines that an evaluator's failure 
to attend the meetings is prejudicial to the evaluation, the chairperson 
shall replace the individual after discussing the situation with the 
contracting officer and obtaining his/her concurrence and the approval 
of the program official responsible for appointing the panel members 
(see 315.608-71(b)(4)).
    (4) Whenever continuity of the evaluation process is not possible, 
and either new evaluators are selected or a reduced panel is decided 
upon, each proposal which is being reviewed at any stage of the 
acquisition shall be reviewed at that stage by all members of the 
revised panel unless it is impractical to do so because of the receipt 
of an unusually large number of proposals.
    (f) Use of outside evaluators. (1) The technical evaluation panel 
shall be composed of Government employees except when outside evaluators 
possess a required expertise which is not available within the 
Government, or as required by law.
    (2) The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Alcohol, Drug 
Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA) are required to have a 
peer review of research and development contracts in accordance with 
Pub. L. (Pub. L.) 93-352 as amended by Pub. L. 94-63; 42 U.S.C. 289 1-4. 
This legislation requires peer review of projects and proposals, and not 
more than one-fourth of the members of a peer review group may be 
officers or employees of the United States. NIH and ADAMHA are therefore 
exempt from the provisions of 315.608-71 to the extent that 42 U.S.C. 
289 1-4 applies.

at 53 FR 15563, May 2, 1988]


<R05>
315.608-72  Procedures for handling and disclosing proposals.

    (a) The procedures and notice specified in FAR 15.413-2 and 315.413-
2 shall be used in handling solicited proposals and for disclosing 
proposals outside the Government for evaluation purposes. (For 
unsolicited proposals, see FAR 15.509 and 315.509.)
    (b) Decisions to disclose proposals outside the Government for 
evaluation purposes shall be made by the chief official having 
programmatic responsibility for the acquisition, after consultation with 
the contracting officer and in accordance with operating division 
procedures. The decision to disclose either a solicited or unsolicited 
proposal outside the Government for the purpose of obtaining an 
evaluation shall take into consideration the avoidance of organizational 
conflicts of interest and any competitive relationship between the 
submitter of the proposal and the prospective evaluator(s).
    (c) When it is determined to disclose a solicited proposal outside 
the Government for evaluation purposes, the following or similar 
conditions shall be included in the written agreement with the 
evaluator(s) prior to disclosure (see FAR 15.413-2(f) and 315.413-2(f)). 
Also, a review must be made to ensure that the notice required by FAR 
15.413-2(e) is affixed to the proposal before it is disclosed to the 
evaluator(s).

                   Conditions for Evaluating Proposals

    The evaluator agrees to use the data (trade secrets, business data, 
and technical data) contained in the proposal only for evaluation 
purposes.
    This requirement does not apply to data obtained from another source 
without restriction.

[[Page 62]]

    Any notice or legend placed on the proposal by either the Department 
or the submitter of the proposal shall be applied to any reproduction or 
abstract provided to the evaluator or made by the evaluator. Upon 
completion of the evaluation, the evaluator shall return the Government-
furnished copy of the proposal or abstract, and all copies thereof, to 
the Departmental office which initially furnished the proposal for 
evaluation.
    Unless authorized by the Department's initiating office, the 
evaluator shall not contact the submitter of the proposal concerning any 
apsects of its contents.
    The evaluator will be obligated to obtain commitments from its 
employees and subcontractors, if any, in order to effect the purposes of 
these conditions.

<R05>
315.608-73  Receipt of proposals.

    (a) After the closing date set by the solicitation for the receipt 
of proposals, the contracting officer will use a transmittal memorandum 
to forward the technical proposals to the project officer or chairperson 
for evaluation. The business proposals will be retained by the 
contracting officer for evaluation (see 315.608-77).
    (b) The transmittal memorandum to the chairperson shall include at 
least the following:
    (1) A list of the names of the organizations submitting proposals;
    (2) A reference to 315.604(d) on the need to preserve the integrity 
of the source selection process;
    (3) A requirement for a technical evaluation report in accordance 
with 315.608-76; and
    (4) The establishment of a date for receipt of the technical 
evaluation report.

[50 FR 23131, May 31, 1985, and 50 FR 38004, Sept. 19, 1985]


<R05>
315.608-74  Convening the technical evaluation panel.

    (a) Normally, the technical evaluation panel will convene to 
evaluate the proposals. However, there may be situations when the 
contracting officer determines that it is not feasible for the panel to 
convene. Whenever this decision is made, care must be taken to assure 
that the technical review is closely monitored to produce acceptable 
results.
    (b) When a panel is convened, the chairperson is responsible for the 
control of the technical proposals provided to him/her by the 
contracting officer for use during the evaluation process. The 
chairperson will generally distribute the technical proposals at the 
initial panel meeting and will establish procedures for securing the 
proposals whenever they are not being evaluated to insure their 
confidentiality. After the evaluation is complete, all proposals must be 
returned to the contracting officer, destroyed or filed in an 
appropriate manner to maintain the confidential nature of the data.
    (c) The contracting officer shall address the initial meeting of the 
panel and state the basic rules for conducting the evaluation. The 
contracting officer shall provide written guidance to the panel if he/
she is unable to attend the initial panel meeting. The guidance should 
include:
    (1) An explanation of conflicts of interest (see 315.608-71(d));
    (2) The necessity to read and understand the solicitation, 
especially the statement of work and evaluation criteria, prior to 
reading the proposals;
    (3) The need for evaluators to restrict the review to only the 
solicitation and the contents of the technical proposals;
    (4) The need for each evaluator to review all the proposals;
    (5) The need to watch for ambiguities, inconsistencies, errors, and 
deficiencies which should be surfaced during the evaluation process;
    (6) An explanation of the evaluation process and what will be 
expected of the evaluators throughout the process;
    (7) The need for the evaluators to be aware of the requirement to 
have complete written documentation of the individual strengths and 
weaknesses which affect the scoring of the proposals; and
    (8) An instruction directing the evaluators that, until the award is 
made, information concerning the acquisition must not be disclosed to 
any person not directly involved in the evaluation process.

[[Page 63]]


<R05>
315.608-75  Rating and ranking of proposals.

    The evaluators will individually read each proposal, describe 
tentative strengths and weaknesses, and develop preliminary scores in 
relation to each evaluation criterion set forth in the solicitation. The 
evaluators will use the rating sheets either in the technical evaluation 
plan or approved by the contracting officer when a technical evaluation 
plan is not required (see 315.608-70). After this has been accomplished, 
the evaluators shall discuss in detail the individual strengths and 
weaknesses described by each evaluator and, if possible, arrive at a 
common understanding of the major strengths and weaknesses and the 
potential for correcting each offeror's weakness(es). Each evaluator 
will score each proposal, and then the technical evaluation panel will 
collectively rank the proposals. Generally, ranking will be determined 
by adding the numerical scores assigned to the evaluation criteria and 
finding the average for each offeror. The evaluators should then 
identify whether each proposal is acceptable or unacceptable. 
Predetermined cutoff scores shall not be employed.

<R05>
315.608-76  Technical evaluation report.

    A technical evaluation report shall be prepared and furnished to the 
contracting officer by the chairperson and maintained as a permanent 
record in the contract file. The report must reflect the ranking of the 
proposals and identify each proposal as acceptable or unacceptable in 
accordance with 315.608-75. The report must also include a narrative 
evaluation specifying the strengths and weaknesses of each proposal, a 
copy of each rating sheet, and any reservations, qualifications, or 
areas to be addressed that might bear upon the selection of sources for 
negotiation and award. Concrete technical reasons supporting a 
determination of unacceptability with regard to any proposal must be 
included. The report should also include specific points and questions 
which are to be raised in discussions or negotiations.

[50 FR 23132, May 31, 1985, and 50 FR 38004, Sept. 19, 1985]


<R05>
315.608-77  Evaluation of business proposals.

    (a) The contracting officer shall evaluate the business proposals 
concurrently with the evaluation of the technical proposals. The 
contracting officer must adhere to the requirements for cost or price 
analysis included in FAR 15.805-1 for each business proposal in the 
competitive range. An audit report may be required in accordance with 
FAR 15.805-5 and 315.805-5. The contracting officer must determine the 
extent of analysis in each case depending on the amount of the proposal, 
the technical complexity and related cost or price, and cost realism. 
The contracting officer should request the project officer to analyze 
such items as the number of labor hours proposed for various labor 
categories; the mix of labor hours and categories of labor in relation 
to the technical requirements of the project; the kinds and quantities 
of material, equipment, and supplies; types, numbers, and hours/days of 
proposed consultants; logic of proposed subcontracting; analysis of the 
travel proposed including number of trips, locations, purpose, and 
travelers; and kinds and quantities of data processing. The project 
officer shall provide his/her opinion as to whether these elements are 
necessary and reasonable for efficient contract performance. Exceptions 
to proposed elements shall be supported by adequate rationale to allow 
for effective negotiations. The contracting officer should also request 
the assistance of a cost/price analyst when considered necessary. In all 
cases, the negotiation memorandum (see 315.672) must include the 
rationale used in determining that the price or cost is fair and 
reasonable.
    (b) The contracting officer must appraise the management capability 
of the offeror to perform the required work in a timely manner. In 
making this appraisal, the contracting officer should consider factors 
such as the offeror's management organization,

[[Page 64]]

past performance, reputation for reliability, availability of the 
required facilities, and cost controls. This information is to be used 
by the contracting officer to determine the offeror's responsibility.

[50 FR 23132, May 31, 1975, and 50 FR 38004, Sept. 19, 1985]


<R05>
315.609  Competitive range.

    (a) A proposal must be included in the competitive range unless 
there is no real possibility that it can be improved to the point where 
it becomes the most acceptable.
    (e) In certain circumstances, when deciding which proposals should 
be included in the competitive range, the contracting officer may 
request that the technical evaluation panel review the cost or price 
data. Typical situations which may necessitate this review include a 
suspected ``buy-in,'' large differences in cost or price among the 
proposals, proposals receiving high technical ratings which have 
relatively high costs, and proposals receiving low technical ratings 
which have relatively low costs. The resultant comparison of cost or 
price to technical factors and the determination of cost or price 
realism should assist the contracting officer in deciding which 
proposals are to be included in the competitive range.
    (f) All determinations regarding the inclusion or exclusion of 
proposals in the competitive range must be completely documented, 
including the salient reasons for the determinations, and set forth in 
the negotiation memorandum.
    (g) Some of the factors which the contracting officer should 
consider in determining the competitive range are:
    (1) The relative importance of cost or price as compared to 
technical factors in accordance with the solicitation provisions 
required in 315.406-5(c);
    (2) The susceptibility of significantly reducing a proposal with an 
unreasonable high price or cost without undermining the technical merit 
if the offeror otherwise has a reasonable chance to receive an award; 
and
    (3) The likelihood of reducing cost or price of a proposal which 
exceeds the Government's requirements.
    (h) The contacting officer shall conduct a thorough review of the 
technical evaluation report to be assured that:
    (1) All determinations of unacceptability are supported by concrete 
and comprehensive statements that are factual and convincing and are 
consistent with the evaluation criteria set forth in the solicitation. 
Every statement should be reviewed carefully to eliminate any doubts as 
to the unacceptability of a proposal;
    (2) All recommendations to exclude proposals from the competitive 
range are supported by persuasive rationale and sufficient facts to 
substantiate a judgment that meaningful discussions are not possible or 
there is no reasonable chance of the proposal being selected for award;
    (3) Those cases where only one organization is found to be 
technically acceptable are fully scrutinized; and
    (4) Unacceptable proposals contain ``information'' deficiencies 
which are so material as to preclude any possibility of upgrading the 
proposal to a competitive level except through major revisions and 
additions which would be tantamount to the submission of another 
proposal.
    (i) The contracting officer and project officer should discuss the 
uncertainties and/or deficiencies that are included in the technical 
evaluation report for each proposal in the competitive range. Technical 
questions should be developed by the project officer and/or the 
technical evaluation panel and should be included in the technical 
evaluation report. The management and cost or price questions should be 
prepared by the contracting officer with assistance from the project 
officer and/or panel as required. The method of requesting offerors in 
the competitive range to submit the additional information will vary 
depending on the complexity of the questions, the extent of additional 
information requested, the time needed to analyze the responses, and the 
time frame for making the award. However, to the extent practicable, all 
questions and answers should be in writing. Each offeror in the 
competitive range shall be given an equitable period of time for 
preparation of responses to questions to the extent practicable. The 
questions

should be developed so as to disclose the ambiguities, uncertainties, 
and deficiencies of the offeror (see FAR 15.610(c)).


<R05>
315.610  Written or oral discussions.

    (b) The contracting officer, with the support of personnel who 
evaluated the technical proposals, and, if necessary, cost analysts, 
attorneys, etc., must conduct written or oral discussions with all 
responsible offerors within the competitive range.
    (d) Careful judgment must be exercised in determining the extent of 
discussions. In some cases, more than one round of discussions with all 
the offerors within the competitive range may be required. The time 
available, the expense and administrative limitations, and the 
complexity, size, and significance of the acquisition should all be 
considered in deciding on the type, duration, and depth of the 
discussions.


<R05>
315.611  Best and final offers.

    (b)(5) Notice that confirmation of a prior offer should be 
specifically stated as a final offer; and
    (6) Notice that all revisions to former offers should be submitted 
on Standard Form 1411, Contract Pricing Proposal Cover Sheet, and should 
be fully documented.
    (c) ``Best and final'' offers are subject to a final evaluation of 
price or cost and other salient factors by the contracting officer and 
project officer with assistance from a cost/price analyst, and an 
evaluation of technical factors by the technical evaluation panel, as 
necessary. Proposals may be technically rescored and reranked by the 
technical evaluation panel and a technical evaluation report prepared. 
To the extent practicable, the evaluation shall be performed by the same 
evaluators who reviewed the original proposals (see 315.670--).
    (e) Of particular importance in the award of research or development 
contracts, including those with educational institutions, is the 
competence of key personnel in the specific field of science or 
technology involved, as reflected in the proposal. However, awards 
should not be made for research and development capabilities that exceed 
those needed for the successful performance of the particular project.


<R05>
315.670  Negotiation with the selected source.

    (a) After selection of the successful proposal, a limited 
negotiation with the selected offeror may be conducted if deemed 
necessary. However, no factor which could have any effect on the 
selection process may be introduced into the negotiation after the 
common cutoff date for receipt of best and final offers. The negotiation 
shall not in any way prejudice the competitive interests or right of the 
unsuccessful offerors. Negotiations with the selected offeror shall be 
restricted to definitizing the final agreement on terms and conditions; 
e.g., assuming none of these factors were involved in the selection 
process, negotiation could include such topics as payment provisions, 
patent rights, rights in data, property provisions, labor rates, 
indirect cost rates, and fees. Prior to conducting the limited 
negotiation, the contracting officer shall approve a written 
determination citing both the specific issues to be discussed and the 
rationale showing that the negotiations shall not have any effect on the 
selection process.
    (b) Caution must be exercised by the contracting officer to insure 
that the negotiation is not used to change the requirement contained in 
the solicitation, nor to make any other changes which would impact on 
the source selection decision. Whenever a material change occurs in the 
requirements as a result of the negotiation, the competition must be 
reopened and all offerors submitting ``best and final'' offers must be 
given an opportunity to resubmit proposals based on the revised 
requirements. Whenever there is a question as to whether a change is 
material, the contracting officer should obtain the advice of technical 
personnel and legal counsel before reopening the competition. 
Significant changes in the offeror's cost proposal may also necessitate 
a reopening of competition if such changes alter the factors involved in 
the original selection process.
    (c) Should negotiations beyond those specified in (a) above be 
required for

[[Page 66]]

any reason, discussions must be reopened with all offerors submitting 
``best and final'' offers.
    (d) Upon completion of the negotiation, the contracting officer 
shall obtain a confirmation letter from the successful offeror which 
includes any revisions to the technical proposal, the agreed to price or 
cost, and, as applicable, a certificate of current cost or pricing data.

<R05>
315.671  Post negotiation contract preparation and award.

    (a) The contracting officer must perform the following actions after 
negotiations have been completed:
    (1) Prepare the negotiation memorandum in accordance with 315.672;
    (2) Prepare the contract containing all agreed to terms and 
conditions and clauses required by law or regulation;
    (3) Include in the contract file the pertinent documents referenced 
in FAR 4.803; and
    (4) Obtain the appropriate approval of proposed contract awards in 
accordance with subpart 304.71 and contracting activity procedures.
    (b) After receiving the required approvals, the contract should be 
transmitted to the prospective contractor for signature. The prospective 
contractor must be informed that the contract is not effective until 
accepted by the contracting officer.
    (c) The contract shall not be issued until the finance office 
certifies that the funds are available for obligation.


<R05>
315.672  Preparation of negotiation memorandum.

    The negotiation memorandum or summary of negotiations is a complete 
record of all actions leading to award of a contract and is prepared by 
the contract negotiator. It should be in sufficient detail to explain 
and support the rationale judgments, and authorities upon which all 
actions were predicated. The memorandum will document the negotiation 
process and reflect the negotiator's actions, skills, and judgments in 
concluding a satisfactory agreement for the Government. Negotiation 
memorandums shall contain discussion of the following or a statement of 
nonapplicability; however, information already contained in the contract 
file need not be reiterated. A reference to the document which contains 
the required information is satisfactory.
    (a) Description of articles and services and period of performance. 
A description of articles and services, quantity, unit price, total 
contract amount, and period of contract performance should be set forth 
(if Supplemental Agreement--show previous contract amount as revised, as 
well as information with respect to the period of performance).
    (b) Acquisition planning. Summarize any acquisition planning 
activities that have taken place. Include items such as meetings with 
program and staff personnel and the development of acquisition planning 
schedules.
    (c) Synopsis of proposed acquisition. A statement as to whether the 
acquisition has or has not been publicized in accordance with FAR 
subpart 5.2. A brief statement of explanation should be included with 
reference to the specific basis for exemption under the FAR, if 
applicable.
    (d) Contract type. Provide sufficient detail to support the type of 
contractural instrument recommended for the acquisition and cite any 
required D & F. If the contract is a cost-sharing type, explain the 
essential cost-sharing features.
    (e) Extent of competition. The extent to which full and open 
competition was solicited and obtained must be discussed. The discussion 
shall include the date of solicitation, sources solicited, and 
solicitation results. If a late proposal was received, discuss whether 
or not the late proposal was evaluated and the rationale for the 
decision. If the acquisition is to be awarded without full and open 
competition, discuss the rationale for the decision.
    (f) Technical evaluation. Summarize the results presented in the 
technical evaluation report and delineate the basis of acceptability or 
unacceptability of the proposals from a technical standpoint. Discussion 
should be in nontechnical terms.
    (g) Business evaluation. Summarize the results presented in the 
business report and delineate the basis for the determination of 
acceptability or

[[Page 67]]

unacceptability of the business proposals.
    (h) Competitive range. If full and open competition, describe how 
the zone of consideration or competitive range was determined and state 
the offerors who were included in the competitive range and the ones who 
were not. Explain why any offeror who submitted a technically acceptable 
proposal was not included in further discussions. Comment on any changes 
made in the offeror's proposal as a result of the discussions.
    (i) Cost breakdown and analysis. Include a complete cost breakdown 
together with the negotiator's analysis of the estimated cost by 
individual cost elements. The negotiator's analysis should contain such 
information as:
    (1) A comparison of cost factors proposed in the instant case with 
actual cost factors used in earlier contracts, using the same cost 
centers of the same supplier or cost centers or other sources having 
recent contracts for the same or similar item.
    (2) Any pertinent Government-conducted audit of the proposed 
contractor's records of any pertinent cost advisory report (see FAR 
15.805).
    (3) Any pertinent technical evaluation inputs as to necessity, 
allocability and reasonableness of labor, material and other direct 
expenses.
    (4) Any other pertinent information to fully support the basis for 
and rationale of the cost analysis.
    (5) If the contract is an incentive type, discuss the rationale for 
the following:
    (i) Cost-plus-award-fee.
    (A) Base fee.
    (B) Maximum fee.
    (C) Award fee.
    (ii) Cost-plus-incentive-fee.
    (A) Minimum fee.
    (B) Target fee.
    (C) Maximum fee.
    (D) Incentives relative to performance and/or delivery.
    (E) Sharing ratios.
    (iii) Fixed-price incentives.
    (A) Target profit.
    (B) Target price.
    (C) Ceiling price.
    (D) Sharing rations.
    (E) Incentives relative to performance and/or delivery.
    (6) A justification of the reasonableness of the proposed 
contractor's estimated profit or fixed fee, considering such factors as 
any competitive elements, established efficiency or performance, extent 
of the risk assumed by the proposed contractor, character of the 
proposed contractor's normal business, the extent of subcontracting in 
the instant case and the reasons, capital employed, and other factors as 
are appropriate, including type of organization.
    (j) Government-furnished property and Government-provided 
facilities. With respect to Government-furnished material or Government-
provided facilities, equipment, tooling, or other property, include the 
following: (A separate D & F is required for facilities construction.)
    (1) Where no property is to be provided, a statement to that effect.
    (2) Where property is to be provided, a full description, the 
estimated dollar value, the basis of price comparison with competitors, 
and the basis of rental charge, if rental is involved.
    (3) Where the furnishing of any property or the extent has not been 
determined and is left open for future resolution, a detailed 
explanation.
    (k) Negotiations. Include a statement as to the date and place 
negotiations were conducted, and identify members of both the Government 
and contractor negotiating teams by area of responsibility. Include 
negotiation details relative to the statement of work, terms and 
conditions, and special provisions. The results of cost or price 
negotiations must include the information required by FAR 31.109 and 
15.808. In addition, if cost or pricing data was required to be 
submitted and certified, the negotiation record must also contain the 
extent to which the contracting officer relied upon the factual cost or 
pricing data submitted and used in negotiating the cost or price.
    (l) Other considerations. Include coverage of areas such as:
    (1) Financial data with respect to a contractor's capacity and 
stability.
    (2) Determination of contractor responsibility.
    (3) Details as to why the method of payment, such as progress 
payment,

[[Page 68]]

advance payment, etc., is necessary. Also cite any required D & F's.
    (4) Information with respect to obtaining of a certificate of 
current cost or pricing data.
    (5) Other required special approvals, such as those referenced in 
307.105-2.
    (6) If the contract represents an extension of previous work, the 
status of funds and performance under the prior contract(s) should be 
reflected. Also, a determination should be made that the Government has 
obtained enough actual or potential value from the work previously 
performed to warrant continuation with the same contractor. (Project 
officer should furnish the necessary information.)
    (7) If the contract was awarded by full and open competition state 
where the unsuccessful offerors' proposals are filed.
    (8) State that equal opportunity provisions of the proposed contract 
have been explained to the contractor, and it is aware of its 
responsibilities. Also state whether or not a clearance is required.
    (9) If the contract is for services, a statement must be made, in 
accordance with FAR 37.103 and 337.103, that the services to be acquired 
are nonpersonal in nature.
    (m) Terms and conditions. Identify the general provisions and any 
special clauses and conditions that are contained in the contract, such 
as option arrangements, incremental funding, anticipatory costs, 
deviations from the standard clauses, etc. The basis and rationale for 
inclusion of any special terms and conditions must be stated and, where 
applicable, the document which granted approval for its use identified.
    (n) Recommendation. A brief statement setting forth the 
recommendations for award.
    (o) Signature. The memorandum must be signed by the contract 
negotiator who prepared the memorandum.

    (2) When some or all information sufficient to determine the 
reasonableness of the proposed cost or price is already available or can 
be obtained by phone from the cognizant audit agency, contracting 
officers may request less-than-complete field pricing support 
(specifying in the request the information needed) or may waive in 
writing the requirement for audit and field pricing support by 
documenting the file to indicate what information is to be used instead 
of the audit report and the field pricing report.
    (c)(1) When initiating audit and field pricing support, the 
contracting officer shall do so by sending a request to the cognizant 
administrative contracting officer (ACO), with an information copy to 
the cognizant audit office. When field pricing support is not available, 
the contracting officer shall initiate an audit by sending, in 
accordance with agency procedures, two (2) copies of the request to the 
OIG Office of Audits' Regional Audit Director. In both cases, the 
contracting officer shall, in the request:
    (i) Prescribe the extent of the support needed;
    (ii) State the specific areas for which input is required;
    (iii) Include the information necessary to perform the review (such 
as the offeror's proposal and the applicable portions of the 
solicitations, particularly those describing requirements and delivery 
schedules);
    (iv) Provide the complete address of the location of the offeror's 
financial records that support the proposal;

[[Page 69]]

    (v) Identify the office having audit responsibility if other than an 
HHS Regional Audit Office; and
    (vi) Specify a due date for receipt of a verbal report to be 
followed by a written audit report. (If the time available is not 
adequate to permit satisfactory coverage of the proposal, the auditor 
shall so advise the contracting officer and indicate the additional time 
needed.) Normally, the Office of Audits will need 30 days after receipt 
of the proposal for submission of oral results. However, the Office of 
Audits' ability to conduct reviews by the due date will be influenced by 
the OPDIV's ability to properly plan its acquisitions. If the Office of 
Audits requires additional time to conduct the review, the contracting 
officer has the option, at the time the auditor acknowledges receipt of 
the request, to accept the revised due date or cancel the request and 
use cost advisory services within the agency to satisfy the requirement. 
In such cases, the contracting officer shall immediately advise the OIG/
OA/Regional Audit Director and the OIG/OA/Division of Audit Coordination 
(OIG/OA/DAC) of the revised due date or cancellation of the request.
    (4) One copy of the audit request letter that was submitted to the 
Regional Audit Director and a complete copy of the contract price 
proposal shall be submitted to OIG/OA/DAC.
    (5) Whenever, an audit review has been conducted by the Office of 
Audits, two (2) copies of the memorandum of negotiation shall be 
forwarded to OIG/OA/DAC by the contracting officer (see FAR 15.808(b)).

                          Subpart 315.9--Profit


<R05>
315.900  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart--
    (c) Prescribes a structured approach for establishing the profit or 
fee portion of the Government prenegotiation objective in all contracts 
requiring cost analysis except as stated in 315.905-70(b). The profit 
analysis factors set forth at FAR 15.905 shall be used in all excepted 
contracts requiring cost analysis.


<R05>
315.905-70  Structured approach.

    (a) General. (1) The structured approach for determining profit or 
fee (hereafter referred to as profit) provides contracting officers with 
a technique that will ensure consideration of the relative value of the 
appropriate profit factors described in 315.905-71 in the establishment 
of a profit objective for the conduct of negotiations. The contracting 
officer's analysis of these profit factors is based on information 
available to him/her prior to negotiations. Such information is 
furnished in proposals, audit data, assessment reports, preaward surveys 
and the like. The structured approach also provides a basis for 
documentation of this objective, including an explanation of any 
significant departure from this objective in reaching an agreement. The 
extent of documentation should be directly related to the dollar value 
and complexity of the proposed acquisition.
    (2) The negotiation process does not require agreement on either 
estimated cost elements or profit elements. The profit objective is a 
part of an overall negotiation objective which, as a going-in objective, 
bears a distinct relationship to the cost objective and any proposed 
sharing arrangement. Since profit is merely one of several interrelated 
variables, the Government negotiator generally should not complete the 
profit negotiation without simultaneously agreeing on the other 
variables. Specific agreement on the exact weights or values of the 
individual profit factors is not required and should not be attempted.
    (b) Exceptions. (1) The profit-analysis factors set forth at FAR 
15.905 shall be used for establishing profit objectives under the 
following listed circumstances. Generally, it is expected that this 
method will be supported in a manner similar to that used in the 
structured approach (profit factor breakdown and documentation of the 
profit objective); however, factors within FAR 15.905 considered 
inapplicable to the acquisition will be excluded from the profit 
objective.
    (i) Contracts not expected to exceed $100,000;
    (ii) Architect-engineer contracts;

[[Page 70]]

    (iii) Management contracts for operation and/or maintenance of 
Government facilities;
    (iv) Construction contracts;
    (v) Contracts primarily requiring delivery of material supplies by 
subcontractors;
    (vi) Termination settlements; and
    (vii) Cost-plus-award-fee contracts (However, contracting officers 
may find it advantageous to perform a structured profit analysis as an 
aid in arriving at an appropriate fee arrangement).
    (2) Other exceptions may be made in the negotiation of contracts 
having unusual pricing situations. Such exceptions shall be justified in 
writing by the contracting officer in situations where the structured 
approach is determined to be unsuitable.
    (c) Limitation. The maximum profit objective shall be the percentage 
allowed pursuant to statute or regulation (see FAR 15.903(d)).
    (d) Profit objective. (1) A profit objective is that part of the 
estimated contract price objective or value which, in the judgment of 
the contracting officer, constitutes an appropriate amount of profit for 
the acquisition being considered. This objective should realistically 
reflect the total overall task to be performed and the requirements 
placed on the contractor.
    (2) Development of a profit objective should not begin until the 
following actions have been accomplished:
    (i) A thorough review of proposed contract work;
    (ii) A review of all available knowledge regarding the contractor 
pursuant to FAR subpart 9.1, including audit data, preaward survey 
reports and financial statements, as appropriate; and
    (iii) An analysis of the contractor's cost estimate and comparison 
with the Government's estimate or projection of cost.


<R05>
315.905-71  Profit factors.

    (a) The following factors shall be considered in all cases in which 
profit is to be negotiated. The weight ranges listed after each factor 
shall be used in all instances where the structured approach is used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      Profit factors                           ranges
                                                              (percent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contractor effort:
  Material acquisition....................................        1 to 5
  Direct labor............................................       4 to 15
  Overhead................................................        4 to 9
  General management (G&A)................................        4 to 8
  Other costs.............................................        1 to 5
Other factors:
  Cost risk...............................................        0 to 7
  Investment..............................................      -2 to +2
  Performance.............................................      -1 to +1
  Socioeconomic programs..................................    -.5 to +.5
  Special situations......................................  ............
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Under the structured approach, the contracting officer shall 
first measure ``Contractor Effort'' by the assignment of a profit 
percentage within the designated weight ranges to each element of 
contract cost recognized by the contracting officer. The amount 
calculated for the cost of money for facilities capital is not to be 
included for the computation of profit as part of the cost base.
    (c) The suggested categories under ``Contractor Effort'' are for 
reference purposes only. Often individual proposals will be in a 
different format, but since these categories are broad and basic, they 
provide sufficient guidance to evaluate all other items of cost.
    (d) After computing a total dollar profit for ``Contractor Effort,'' 
the contracting officer shall then calculate the specific profit dollars 
assigned for cost risk, investment, performance, socioeconomic programs, 
and special situations. This is accomplished by multiplying the total 
Government Cost Objective, exclusive of any cost of money for facilities 
capital, by the specific weight assigned to the elements within the 
``Other Factors'' category. Form HHS-674, Structured Approach Profit/Fee 
Objective, should be used, as appropriate, to facilitate the calculation 
of this profit objective. Form HHS-674 is illustrated in 353.370-674.
    (e) In making a judgment of the value of each factor, the 
contracting officer should be governed by the definition, description, 
and purpose of the factors together with considerations for evaluating 
them as set forth in 315.905-72 and 315.905-73.
    (f) The structured approach was designed for arriving at profit 
objectives for other than nonprofit organizations. However, if 
appropriate adjustments

[[Page 71]]

are made to reflect differences between profit and nonprofit 
organizations, the structured approach can be used as a basis for 
arriving at profit objectives for nonprofit organizations. Therefore, 
the structured approach, as modified in paragraph (f)(2) below, shall be 
used to establish profit objectives for nonprofit organizations.
    (1) For purposes of this section, nonprofit organizations are 
defined as those business entities organized and operated exclusively 
for charitable, scientific, or educational purposes, no part of the net 
earnings of which inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or 
individual, and which are exempt from Federal income taxation under 
Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (2) For contracts with nonprofit organizations where profit is 
involved, an adjustment of up to 3 percentage points will be subtracted 
from the total profit objective percentage. In developing this 
adjustment, it will be necessary to consider the following factors:
    (i) Tax position benefits;
    (ii) Granting of financing through advance payments; and
    (iii) Other pertinent factors which may work to either the advantage 
or disadvantage of the contractor in its position as a nonprofit 
organization.

<R05>
315.905-72  Contractor effort.

    (a) General. Contractor effort is a measure of how much the 
contractor is expected to contribute to the overall effort necessary to 
meet the contract performance requirement in an efficient manner. This 
factor, which is apart from the contractor's responsibility for contract 
performance, takes into account what resources are necessary and what 
the contractor must do to accomplish a conversion of ideas and material 
into the final service or product called for in the contract. This is a 
recognition that within a given performance output, or within a given 
sales dollar figure, necessary efforts on the part of individual 
contractors can vary widely in both value and quantity, and that the 
profit objective should reflect the extent and nature of the 
contractor's contribution to total performance. A major consideration, 
particularly in connection with experimental, developmental, or research 
work, is the difficulty or complexity of the work to be performed, and 
the unusual demands of the contract, such as whether the project 
involves a new approach unrelated to existing technology and/or 
equipment or only refinements to these items. The evaluation of this 
factor requires an analysis of the cost content of the proposed contract 
as follows:
    (1) Material acquisition. (Subcontracted items, purchased parts, and 
other material.) Analysis of these cost items shall include an 
evaluation of the managerial and technical effort necessary to obtain 
the required subcontracted items, purchased parts, material or services. 
The contracting officer shall determine whether the contractor will 
obtain the items or services by routine order from readily available 
sources or by detailed subcontracts for which the prime contractor will 
be required to develop complex specifications. Consideration shall also 
be given to the managerial and technical efforts necessary for the prime 
contractor to select subcontractors and to perform subcontract 
administration functions. In application of this criterion, it should be 
recognized that the contribution of the prime contractor to its 
purchasing program may be substantial. Normally, the lowest unadjusted 
weight for direct material is 2 percent. A weighting of less than 2 
percent would be appropriate only in unusual circumstances when there is 
a minimal contribution by the contractor.
    (2) Direct Labor (Professional, service, manufacturing and other 
labor). Analysis of the various labor categories of the cost content of 
the contract should include evaluation of the comparative quality and 
quantity of professional and semiprofessional talents, manufacturing and 
service skills, and experience to be employed. In evaluating 
professional and semiprofessional labor for the purpose of assigning 
profit dollars, consideration should be given to the amount of notable 
scientific talent or

[[Page 72]]

unusual or scarce talent needed in contrast to nonprofessional effort. 
The assessment should consider the contribution this talent will provide 
toward the achievement of contract objectives. Since nonprofessional 
labor is relatively plentiful and rather easily obtained by the 
contractor and is less critical to the successful performance of 
contract objectives, it cannot be weighted nearly as high as 
professional or semiprofessional labor. Service contract labor should be 
evaluated in a like manner by assigning higher weights to engineering or 
professional type skills and lower weights to semiprofessional or other 
type skills required for contract performance. Similarly, the variety of 
manufacturing and other categories of labor skills required and the 
contractor's manpower resources for meeting these requirements should be 
considered. For purposes of evaluation, categories of labor (i.e., 
quality control, receiving and inspection, etc.) which do not fall 
within the definition for professional, service or manufacturing labor 
may be categorized as appropriate. However, the same evaluation 
considerations as outlined above will be applied.
    (3) Overhead and general management (G&A). (i) Analysis of these 
overhead items of cost should include the evaluation of the makeup of 
these expenses and how much they contribute to contract performance. To 
the extent practicable, analysis should include a determination of the 
amount of labor within these overhead pools and how this labor would be 
treated if it were considered as direct labor under the contract. The 
allocable labor elements should be given the same profit considerations 
that they would receive if they were treated as direct labor. The other 
elements of these overhead pools should be evaluated to determine 
whether they are routine expenses, such as utilities and maintenance, 
and hence given lesser profit consideration, or whether they are 
significant contributing elements. The composite of the individual 
determinations in relation to the elements of the overhead pools will be 
the profit consideration given the pools as a whole. The procedure for 
assigning relative values to these overhead expenses differs from the 
method used in assigning values of the direct labor. The upper and lower 
limits assignable to the direct labor are absolute. In the case of 
overhead expenses, individual expenses may be assigned values outside 
the range as long as the composite ratio is within the range.
    (ii) It is not necessary that the contractor's accounting system 
break down overhead expenses within the classifications of research 
overhead, other overhead pools, and general administrative expenses, 
unless dictated otherwise by Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). The 
contractor whose accounting system reflects only one overhead rate on 
all direct labor need not change its system (if CAS exempt) to 
correspond with the above classifications. The contracting officer, in 
an evaluation of such a contractor's overhead rate, could break out the 
applicable sections of the composite rate which could be classified as 
research overhead, other overhead pools, and general and administrative 
expenses, and follow the appropriate evaluation technique.
    (iii) Management problems surface in various degrees and the 
management expertise exercised to solve them should be considered as an 
element of profit. For example, a contract for a new program for 
research or an item which is on the cutting edge of the state of the art 
will cause more problems and require more managerial time and abilities 
of a higher order than a follow-on contract. If new contracts create 
more problems and require a higher profit weight, follow-ons should be 
adjusted downward because many of the problems should have been solved. 
In any event, an evaluation should be made of the underlying managerial 
effort involved on a case-by-case basis.
    (iv) It may not be necessary for the contracting officer to make a 
separate profit evaluation of overhead expenses in connection with each 
acquisition action for substantially the same project with the same 
contractor. Where an analysis of the profit weight to be assigned to the 
overhead pool has been made, that weight assigned may be used for future 
acquisitions with the same contractor until there is a change in the 
cost composition of the overhead

[[Page 73]]

pool or the contract circumstances, or the factors discussed in (iii) 
above are involved.
    (b) Other costs. Analysis of this factor should include all other 
direct costs associated with contractor performance (e.g., travel and 
relocation, direct support, and consultants). Analysis of these items of 
cost should include:
    (1) The significance of the cost of contract performance;
    (2) Nature of the cost; and
    (3) How much they contribute to contract performance. Normally, 
travel costs require minimal administrative effort by the contractor 
and, therefore, usually receive a weight no greater than 1 percent. 
Also, the contractor may designate individuals as ``consultants'' but in 
reality these individuals may be obtained by the contractor to 
supplement its workforce in the performance of routine duties required 
by contract. These costs would normally receive a minimum weight. 
However, there will be instances when the contractor may be required to 
locate and obtain the services of consultants having expertise in such 
fields as medicine or human services. In these instances, the contractor 
will be required to expend greater managerial and technical effort to 
obtain such services and, consequently, such costs should receive a much 
greater weight.


<R05>
315.905-73  Other factors.

    (a) Contract cost risk. The contract type employed basically 
determines the degree of cost risk assumed by the contractor. For 
example, where a portion of the risk has been shifted to the Government 
through cost-reimbursement provisions, unusual contingency provisions, 
or other risk-reducing measures, the amount of profit should be less 
than where the contractor assumes all the risk. In developing the 
prenegotiation profit objective, the contracting officer will need to 
consider the type of contract anticipated to be negotiated and the 
contractor risk associated therewith when selecting the position in the 
weight range for profit that is appropriate for the risk to be borne by 
the contractor. This factor should be one of the most important in 
arriving at prenegotiation profit objectives.
    (1) Evaluation of this risk requires a determination of:
    (i) The degree of cost responsibility the contractor assumes;
    (ii) The reliability of the cost estimates in relation to the task 
assumed; and
    (iii) The complexity of the task assumed by the contractor. This 
factor is specifically limited to the risk of contract costs. Thus, such 
risks on the part of the contractor as reputation, losing a commercial 
market, risk of losing potential profits in other fields, or any risk 
which falls on the contracting office such as the risk of not acquiring 
a satisfactory report, are not within the scope of this factor.
    (2) The first and basic determination of the degree of cost 
responsibility assumed by the contractor is related to the sharing of 
total risk of contract cost by the Government and the contractor through 
the selection of contract type. The extremes are a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee 
contract requiring the contractor to use its best efforts to perform a 
task and a firm fixed-price contract for a service or a complex item. A 
cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract would reflect a minimum assumption of 
cost responsibility, whereas a firm fixed-price contract would reflect a 
complete assumption of cost responsibility. Where proper contract 
selection has been made, the regard for risk by contract type would 
usually fall into the following percentage ranges:

                                 Percent

Cost-reimbursement type contracts--0-3
Fixed-price type contracts--2-7

    (3) The second determination is that of the reliability of the cost 
estimates. Sound price negotiation requires well-defined contract 
objectives and reliable cost estimates. Prior experience assists the 
contractor in preparing reliable cost estimates on new acquisitions for 
similar related efforts. An excessive cost estimate reduces the 
possibility that the cost of performance will exceed the contract price, 
thereby reducing the contractor's assumption of contract cost risk.
    (4) The third determination is that of the difficulty of the 
contractor's task. The contractor's task can be difficult

[[Page 74]]

or easy, regardless of the type of contract.
    (5) Contractors are likely to assume greater cost risk only if 
contracting officers objectively analyze the risk incident to proposed 
contracts and are willing to compensate contractors for it. Generally, a 
cost-plus-fixed fee contract will not justify a reward for risk in 
excess of 0.5 percent, nor will a firm fixed-price contract justify a 
reward of less than the minimum in the structured approach. Where proper 
contract-type selection has been made, the reward for risk, by contract 
type, will usually fall into the following percentage ranges:
    (i) Type of contract and percentage ranges for profit objectives 
developed by using the structured approach for research and development 
and manufacturing contracts:

                                 Percent

Cost-plus-fixed fee--0 to 0.5
Cost-plus-incentive fee:
    With cost incentive only--1 to 2
    With multiple incentives--1.5 to 3
Fixed-price-incentive:
    With cost incentive only--2 to 4
    With multiple incentives--3 to 5
Prospective price redetermination--3 to 5
Firm fixed-price--5 to 7

    (ii) Type of contract and percentage ranges for profit objectives 
developed by using the structured approach for service contracts:

                                 Percent

Cost-plus-fixed fee--0 to 0.5
Cost-plus-incentive fee--1 to 2
Fixed-price incentive--2 to 3
Firm fixed-price--3 to 4

    (6) These ranges may not be appropriate for all acquisitions. For 
instance, a fixed-price-incentive contract that is closely priced with a 
low ceiling price and high incentive share may be tantamount to a firm 
fixed-price contract. In this situation, the contracting officer may 
determine that a basis exists for high confidence in the reasonableness 
of the estimate and that little opportunity exists for cost reduction 
without extraordinary efforts. On the other hand, a contract with a high 
ceiling and low incentive formula can be considered to contain cost-
plus-incentive-fee contract features. In this situation, the contracting 
officer may determine that the Government is retaining much of the 
contract cost responsibility and that the risk assumed by the contractor 
is minimal. Similarly, if a cost-plus-incentive-fee contract includes an 
unlimited downward (negative) fee adjustment on cost control, it could 
be comparable to a fixed-price-incentive contract. In such a pricing 
environment, the contracting officer may determine that the Government 
has transferred a greater amount of cost responsibility to the 
contractor than is typical under a normal cost-plus-incentive-fee 
contract.
    (7) The contractor's subcontracting program may have a significant 
impact on the contractor's acceptance of risk under a contract form. It 
could cause risk to increase or decrease in terms of both cost and 
performance. This consideration should be a part of the contracting 
officer's overall evaluation in selecting a factor to apply for cost 
risk. It may be determined, for instance, that the prime contractor has 
effectively transferred real cost risk to a subcontractor and the 
contract cost risk evaluation may, as a result, be below the range which 
would otherwise apply for the contract type being proposed. The contract 
cost risk evaluation should not be lowered, however, merely on the basis 
that a substantial portion of the contract costs represents subcontracts 
without any substantial transfer of contractor's risk.
    (8) In making a contract cost risk evaluation in an acquisition 
action that involves definitization of a letter contract, unpriced 
change orders, and unpriced orders under BOA's, consideration should be 
given to the effect on total contract cost risk as a result of having 
partial performance before definitization. Under some circumstances it 
may be reasoned that the total amount of cost risk has been effectively 
reduced. Under other circumstances it may be apparent that the 
contractor's cost risk remained substantially unchanged. To be 
equitable, the determination of profit weight for application to the 
total of all recognized costs, both those incurred and those yet to be 
expended, must be made with consideration to all attendant 
circumstances--not just the portion of costs incurred or percentage

[[Page 75]]

of work completed prior to definitization.
    (9) Time and material and labor hour contracts will be considered to 
be cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contracts for the purpose of establishing 
profit weights unless otherwise exempt under 315.905-70(b) in the 
evaluation of the contractor's assumption of contract cost risk.
    (b) Investment. HHS encourages its contractors to perform their 
contracts with the minimum of financial, facilities, or other assistance 
from the Government. As such, it is the purpose of this factor to 
encourage the contractor to acquire and use its own resources to the 
maximum extent possible. The evaluation of this factor should include an 
analysis of the following:
    (1) Facilities (Including equipment). To evaluate how this factor 
contributes to the profit objective requires knowledge of the level of 
facilities utilization needed for contract performance, the source and 
financing of the required facilities, and the overall cost effectiveness 
of the facilities offered. Contractors who furnish their own facilities 
which significantly contribute to lower total contract costs should be 
provided with additional profit. On the other hand, contractors who rely 
on the Government to provide or finance needed facilities should receive 
a corresponding reduction in profit. Cases between the above examples 
should be evaluated on their merits with either positive or negative 
adjustments, as appropriate, in profit being made. However, where a 
highly facilitized contractor is to perform a contract which does not 
benefit from this facilitization or where a contractor's use of its 
facilities has a minimum cost impact on the contract, profit need not be 
adjusted. When applicable, the prospective contractor's computation of 
facilities capital cost of money for pricing purposes under CAS 414 can 
help the contracting officer identify the level of facilities investment 
to be employed in contract performance.
    (2) Payments. In analyzing this factor, consideration should be 
given to the frequency of payments by the Government to the contractor. 
The key to this weighting is to give proper consideration to the impact 
the contract will have on the contractor's cash flow. Generally, 
negative consideration should be given for advance payments and payments 
more frequent than monthly with maximum reduction being given as the 
contractor's working capital approaches zero. Positive consideration 
should be given for payments less frequent than monthly with additional 
consideration given for a capital turn-over-rate on the contract which 
is less than the contractor's or the industry's normal capital turn-over 
rate.
    (c) Performance. (Cost-control and other past accomplishments.) The 
contractor's past performance should be evaluated in such areas as 
quality of service or product, meeting performance schedules, efficiency 
in cost control (including need for and reasonableness of cost 
incurred), accuracy and reliability of previous cost estimates, degree 
of cooperation by the contractor (both business and technical), timely 
processing of changes and compliance with other contractual provisions, 
and management of subcontract programs. Where a contractor has 
consistently achieved excellent results in the foregoing areas in 
comparison with other contractors in similar circumstances, such 
performance merits a proportionately greater opportunity for profit. 
Conversely a poor record in this regard should be reflected in 
determining what constitutes a fair and reasonable profit.
    (d) Federal socioeconomic programs. This factor, which may apply to 
special circumstances or particular acquisitions, relates to the extent 
of a contractor's successful participation in the Government sponsored 
programs such as small business, small disadvantaged business, labor 
surplus area, and energy conservation efforts. The contractor's policies 
and procedures which energetically support Government socioeconomic 
programs and achieve successful results should be given positive 
considerations. Conversely, failure or unwillingness on the part of the 
contractor to support Government socioeconomic programs should be viewed 
as evidence of poor performance for the purpose of establishing a profit 
objective.
    (e) Special situations. (1) Inventive and developmental 
contributions. The extent

[[Page 76]]

and nature of contractor-initiated and financed independent development 
should be considered in developing the profit objective, provided that 
the contracting officer has made a determination that such effort will 
benefit the contract. The importance of the development in furthering 
health and human services purposes, the demonstrable initiative in 
determining the need and application of the development, the extent of 
the contractor's cost risk, and whether the development cost was 
recovered directly or indirectly from Government sources should be 
weighed.
    (2) Unusual pricing agreements. Occasionally, unusual contract 
pricing arrangements are made with the contractor wherein it agrees to 
cost ceilings, e.g., a ceiling on overhead rates for conditions other 
than those discussed at FAR 42.707. In such circumstances, the 
contractor should receive favorable consideration in developing the 
profit objective.
    (3) Negative factors. Special situations need not be limited to 
those which only increase profit levels. A negative consideration may be 
appropriate when the contractor is expected to obtain spin-off benefits 
as a direct result of the contract (e.g., products or services with 
commercial application).

<R05>
315.905-74  Facilities capital cost of money.

    When facilities capital cost of money (cost of capital committed to 
facilities) is included as an item of cost in the contractor's proposal, 
a reduction in the profit objective shall be made in an amount equal to 
the amount of facilities capital cost of money allowed in accordance 
with the Facilities Capital Cost-of-Money Cost Principal. If the 
contractor does not propose this cost, a provision must be inserted in 
the contract that facilities capital cost of money is not an allowable 
cost.

<R05>
315.1000  General.

    Once a contract action has progressed through the evaluation 
process, and even after the selection of a contractor, all queries as to 
the relative merits of the submitted proposals shall be courteously but 
firmly directed to the contracting officer. All other personnel will 
avoid any exchange of comments with offerors.

[49 FR 13979, Apr. 9, 1984. Redesignated and amended at 50 FR 23132, May

<R05>
315.1003  Debriefing of unsuccessful offerors.

    (a) Any HHS employee who receives either a written or oral request 
for a debriefing from an unsuccessful offeror shall immediately, without 
any discussion regarding the merits or deficiencies of the unsuccessful 
offeror's proposal, refer the request to the contracting officer. If the 
request is made orally, the contracting officer shall require that the 
request be made in writing. The contracting officer or his/her designee 
shall be present at all debriefings and shall review written debriefings 
prior to release.
    (b) A debriefing is intended to:
    (1) Tell an unsuccessful offeror which areas of its proposal were 
judged to be weak and deficient and whether the weaknesses or 
deficiencies were factors in its not having been selected; and
    (2) Identify the factors which were the basis for selection of the 
successful contractor. If the quality of the successful offeror's 
proposal to satisfy the mission requirement was the basis, the 
unsuccessful offeror should be so informed, and given a general 
comparison of significant areas, but not a point-by-point comparison of 
all the elements considered in the evaluation criteria. If the 
successful offeror was selected on the basis of cost, the unsuccessful 
offeror should be told that was the case. If selection was based on 
other factors, they should be specified.

[[Page 77]]

    (d) If an unsuccessful offeror feels that its failure to obtain the 
award was not justified, it will rely, at least in part, on the 
information given in the debriefing to determine whether it should seek 
recourse. Accordingly, it is essential that a debriefing be conducted in 
a scrupulously fair, objective, and impartial manner, and that the 
information given the unsuccessful offeror be absolutely factual and 
consistent with the findings of the contracting officer and the basis on 
which the award was made.
    (e) In some cases, it may be necessary to arrange informal 
debriefings for an unsuccessful offeror's personnel by departmental 
technical evaluators. This determination will be made by, and meeting 
arrangements will be the responsibility of, the contracting officer.
    (f) It is very important that all departmental personnel engaged in 
the evaluation and selection processes be aware of the policies and 
procedures in FAR subpart 15.10 and this subpart 315.10. Detailed and 
complete records of the acquisition will be maintained by key technical 
and contracting personnel in a manner which will facilitate either a 
written or an oral debriefing of any unsuccessful offeror.

<R04>
                  Subpart 315.70--Requests for Contract


<R05>
315.7000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes the format and contents of the request for 
contract and provides procedures for the preparation and submission of 
the request for contract document.


<R05>
315.7001  General.

    The program office's preparation of the request for contract (RFC) 
and submission to the contracting activity finalizes the presolicitation 
phase of the acquisition planning process and commences the solicitation 
phase. The RFC is the formal document which initiates the preparation of 
the request for proposals by the contracting activity and sets the 
acquisition process in motion. It represents the results of planning by 
the project officer and contract negotiator and contains much of the 
pertinent information necessary for the development of a sound, 
comprehensive RFP.


<R05>
315.7002  Procedures.

    (a) Requests for contract are required to be prepared by the program 
office for all proposed negotiated acquisitions estimated to exceed the 
small purchase limitation.
    (b) The program office should submit the RFC as early as possible to 
the contracting activity. The proposed period of time between the date 
of submission of the RFC and the date of contract award (or date of 
delivery of the product, service, study, etc.) should be determined by 
the project officer, contract negotiator, and, if necessary, the 
contracting officer. The amount of leadtime should be determined on a 
case-by-case basis and should reflect the characteristics and 
complexities of the individual acquisition. When lengthy and/or involved 
clearances or special approval are required, for example, they must be 
taken into account when the leadtime is determined. If a formal 
acquisition planning document is used, (see subpart 307.1), the RFC 
should be submitted in accordance with the timetable set forth in that 
document. OPDIV, agency, and regional office contracting activities may 
prescribe specific leadtimes for submission of RFC's in their 
implementation of this subpart.

[49 FR 13979, Apr. 9, 1984, as amended at 53 FR 15563, May 2, 1988; 56 
FR 47003, Sept. 17, 1991]


<R05>
315.7003  Responsibilities.

    It is the responsibility of the project officer to prepare the RFC 
so that it

[[Page 78]]

complies with the requirements of this subpart and any OPDIV, agency, or 
regional office guidance issued in accordance with this subpart. Prior 
to the submission of the RFC to the contracting activity, the head of 
the program office sponsoring the project shall review the RFC to ensure 
that all required information is provided in the prescribed format and a 
technical review of the statement of work has been made. The level and 
extent of the technical review is to be commensurate with the estimated 
cost, importance, and complexity of the proposed acquisition, and must 
be thorough enough to ensure that vague and ambiguous language is 
eliminated, the statement of work is structured by phases or tasks, if 
appropriate, and methods are available for assessing the contractor's 
technical, cost, and delivery performances.


<R05>
315.7004  Transmittal.

    The RFC will be conveyed to the contracting activity by use of a 
covering memorandum or other form of transmittal. The transmittal 
document must be signed by the head of the sponsoring program office and 
include both a statement attesting to the conclusiveness of the review 
discussed in the preceding section and a list identifying all 
attachments to the RFC. A standard format for the transmittal document 
may be prescribed by the OPDIV, agency, or regional office contracting 
activity.


<R05>
315.7005  Format and content.

    The Department does not prescribe a standard format for the RFC 
document, but recommends the use of a format similar to what is provided 
in this section. The subject areas addressed in paragraphs (a) and (b) 
must be included in every RFC document, whereas the areas addressed in 
paragraph (c) need only be included if applicable. An OPDIV, agency, or 
regional office contracting activity may prescribe a standard format for 
the RFC document and may include additional subject areas that are 
pertinent to that activity's needs. Some of the information to be 
furnished in the RFC document may be repetitive of that found in the 
acquisition planning document. If this information has not changed since 
the development of the acquisition planning document, the RFC document 
may either restate the information as it appears in the acquisition 
planning document or cross reference the applicable portion where the 
information appears.
    (a) The RFC document must contain the following:
    (1) Purpose of contract. A brief, general description of 
requirements, including the citation of the legislation which authorizes 
the program or project, is to be provided, along with a statement as to 
the intended purpose/use of the proposed contract.
    (2) Background and need. The background history and necessity for 
the proposed contract are to be described. This section is to include 
prior, present, and planned efforts by the program office in the same or 
related areas, and a description of efforts by other departmental 
activities and Federal agencies in the same or related program areas, if 
known. In addition, specific project information such as the relevance 
or contribution to overall program objectives, reasons for the need, 
priority, and project overlap are to be provided.
    (3) Period of performance. The number of months (or other time 
period) required for total performance, and, if applicable, for each 
phase of work indicated in the statement of work, is to be specified. 
The program office must indicate the proposed starting date and the 
required date of delivery for each deliverable.
    (4) Estimated cost and fund citation. The project officer's estimate 
of the total cost of the proposed contract, and, if applicable, the 
estimate for each phase indicated in the statement of work, is to be 
provided. The project officer must provide a cost breakdown of all 
contributing cost factors, to include an estimate of the technical staff 
hours, direct materials, subcontracting, travel, etc. The project 
officer may consult with contracting and cost advisory personnel in 
developing this information. This section must include the certification 
of funds availability for the particular proposed acquisition, along 
with the appropriation and accounting information citations. When funds 
are not currently available

[[Page 79]]

but are anticipated, a statement indicating that the financial plan 
includes provision for the funds for the proposed acquisition but the 
funds are not yet available for obligation shall be included in lieu of 
the certification of funds availability. (Contracts cannot be awarded 
unless funds are available, but see FAR 32.703-2.)
    (5) Reference material. A list, by title and description, of study 
reports, plans, drawings, and other data to be made available to 
prospective offerors for use in preparation of proposals and/or the 
contractor for use in performance of the contract is to be provided. The 
project officer must indicate whether this material is currently 
available or when it will be available.
    (6) Technical evaluation criteria and instructions. The project 
officer is to include the technical evaluation criteria, which have been 
developed based on the requirements of the specific project, and any 
instructions and information which will assist in the preparation of 
prospective offerors' technical proposals. For example, critical areas 
discussed in the statement of work and the relative order of importance 
and weights assigned to each of these areas for technical evaluation 
purposes must be identified. These areas may include understanding of 
the problem, technical approach, experience, personnel, facilities, etc.
    (7) Sources for solicitation. The project officer is to develop and 
include a list of known potential sources by name and mailing address. 
The project officer is encouraged to use trade and professional journals 
and publications to identify new prospective sources to supplement the 
list of known sources. Efforts to identify set-aside possibilities, 
i.e., small, disadvantaged, and labor surplus areas, and women-owned 
businesses, must be explained.
    (8) Special approvals, clearances, and requirements. All special 
approvals, clearances, and requirements pertinent to the proposed 
acquisition are to be listed in this section. Copies of the actual 
documents are to be attached to the RFC. If the approval, clearance, or 
requirement has been requested and is being processed, a footnote to 
this effect, including all pertinent details, must be included in this 
section. A list of Government-wide and Department imposed approvals, 
clearances, and requirements is set forth in 307.105-2. Comprehensive 
checklists of these and any OPDIV, agency, regional office, etc. special 
approvals, clearances, and requirements shall be provided for reference 
purposes to program offices by the servicing contracting activity.
    (9) Identification and disposition of data. The project officer must 
identify the data expected to be generated by the acquisition and 
specify the data to be delivered to the Department (see 315.7005(b)(2)) 
and that to be retained by the contractor. The project officer must also 
include information relative to the use, maintenance, disclosure, and 
disposition of data. The project officer must include a statement as to 
whether or not another acquisition, based upon the data generated by the 
proposed acquisition, is anticipated. The project officer must also 
include a statement indicating whether the proposed acquisition is or is 
not subject to the Privacy Act (see FAR subpart 24.1 and subpart 324.1).
    (10) Project officer and alternate. The project officer's name, 
title, organization, mailing address, and telephone number are to be 
provided in this section, along with the same data for the project 
officer's alternate. In addition, a statement that the project officer 
has completed the Department's project officer training course is to be 
provided (see 307.170).
    (b) The following must be submitted with every RFC but are to be 
prepared as separate attachments so they may be readily adopted into the 
request for proposal format:
    (1) Statement of work or specification. The statement of work 
describes the requirements to be performed and may describe the methods 
to be used (see 307.105-3 and FAR 35.005 for a detailed explanation). A 
specification is used in lieu of a statement of work when a clear and 
accurate description of the technical requirements for a product, 
material, or service can be provided along with the procedure to 
determine that the requirements have been met. It is essential that a 
complete and comprehensive statement of work or specification be 
provided by the project officer.

[[Page 80]]

    (2) Schedule of deliverables or reporting requirements. The project 
officer must specifically describe what is to be delivered and when it 
is to be delivered to ensure proper contract monitoring. Usually, 
technical and financial progress reports and the final report are 
prescribed in this section. These reports should be tailored to the 
instant acquisition and should avoid unnecessary and burdensome 
reporting requirements.
    (c) The following may not be applicable to all RFC's but must be 
included as attachments whenever any do apply:
    (1) Government property. The project officer must identify, as 
referenced in the statement of work, the types, individual items, and 
quantities of Government property to be furnished to or allowed to be 
acquired by, the resultant contractor, if known. The project officer 
must specify when the Government property is to be made available to the 
resultant contractor.
    (2) Special terms and conditions. The project officer may suggest 
inclusion of any special terms and conditions applicable to the proposed 
acquisition not already covered in the statement of work or the 
applicable contract general provisions.
    (3) Justification for other than full and open competition. If the 
proposed acquisition is to be awarded using other than full and open 
competition, a justification, prepared in accordance with FAR subpart 
6.3 and subpart 306.3, must be submitted as an attachment to the RFC.
    (4) Privacy Act ``system notice.'' When the project officer has 
determined that the requirements of the Privacy Act are applicable to 
the proposed acquisition, a copy of the ``system notice'' must be 
attached to the RFC (see 324.103(d)).

<R05>
315.7006  Review.

    Upon receipt of the RFC, the contracting activity shall review the 
contents to ensure that all pertinent information has been provided by 
the program office. If pertinent information is missing or if there are 
discrepancies in previously agreed upon information, such as significant 
alterations in the statement of work, the contracting activity shall 
obtain or clarify the information so that the acquisition schedule is 
met. If the program office delays furnishing the information or 
clarification, the acquisition schedule may have to be changed. When 
this circumstance arises, the contracting activity should notify the 
head of the sponsoring program office of the problem, in writing, of the 
possible slippage in the acquisition schedule, and the need for an 
expeditious remedy. If the head of the sponsoring program office is not 
responsive to the request for expediency, the matter should be referred 
to higher management authorities for resolution.

all matters of a substantive nature, such as statements of work, 
delivery schedules, and general and special clauses have been resolved 
and agreed upon.


<R05>
316.603-3  Limitations.

    The principal official responsible for acquisition shall be the 
approving official who executes the prescribed written statement. 
However, if the principal official responsible for acquisition is to 
sign the letter contract as the contracting officer, the approving

obligation of funds represents. In rare instances where the obligation 
represents 50 percent or more of the proposed estimated cost of the 
acquisition, a justification for that obligation must be included which 
would indicate the basis and necessity for the obligation (e.g., the 
contractor requires a large initial outlay of funds for major 
subcontract awards or an extensive purchase of materials to meet an 
urgent delivery requirement). In every case, documentation must assure 
that the amount to be obligated is not in excess of an amount reasonably 
required to perform the work.
    (k) Period of effectiveness of the proposed letter contract. If more 
than 180 days, complete justification must be given.
    (l) Statement of any substantive matters that need to be resolved.

increased.
    (g) Complete justification as to why the period of effectiveness is 
increased beyond 180 days, if applicable.

than 50 percent of the estimated cost of the acquisition, the 
information required by 316.603-70(j) must be included.

    (f) Procedures. (1) Negotiation of basic agreements may be 
undertaken by OPDIV contracting activities on behalf of the Department. 
When an OPDIV contracting activity decides to negotiate a basic 
agreement with an organization, prior authorization must be requested, 
in writing, from the Director, Division of Acquisition Policy (DAP). 
When the Director, DAP, gives written authorization to the OPDIV 
contracting activity designated to conduct negotiations on behalf of the 
Department, all other OPDIVs will be notified of this designation. If 
another OPDIV elects, it may attend the negotiation or furnish special 
terms and conditions or provisions for inclusion in the proposed basic 
agreement by advising the designated negotiating activity in writing 
within ten (10) days from the date of the authorization. After review 
and resolution of all requests for inclusion of special terms and 
conditions or provisions, the designated negotiating activity will 
invite those OPDIVs which expressed an interest in attending the 
negotiations and make the necessary arrangements for the negotiation of 
the basic agreement.
    (2) Prior to the conclusion of negotiations, the designated 
negotiating activity shall furnish the OPDIVs a draft copy of the 
proposed basic agreement together with:
    (i) A resume of all salient features of the basic agreement which 
will facilitate review;
    (ii) Any of the negotiating OPDIV's guides or procedures which are 
being considered for incorporation into the basic agreement by 
reference;
    (iii) A listing of nonstandard clauses used, the genesis of such 
clauses, and the reasons for such clauses in the basic agreement; and
    (iv) The contractor's comments, including the basis for requesting 
any deviation from the HHSAR and the designated negotiating activity's 
position with respect thereto.

[[Page 84]]

    (3) The OPDIVs shall have fifteen (15) days from the date of the 
memorandum transmitting the information to submit comments on the draft 
copy of the basic agreement. After receipt, analysis, and resolution of 
the comments of the OPDIVs, the designated negotiating activity will 
proceed to conclude the negotiation of the basic agreement.
    (4) After conclusion of the negotiation, but prior to execution of 
the basic agreement, a copy of the basic agreement, together with the 
information specified in paragraph (f)(2) above, the comments of the 
OPDIVs, the designated negotiating activity's analysis of the OPDIV 
comments, and the basis for the action taken will be furnished to the 
Director, DAP for review by DPP and the Office of General Counsel. 
Approval by the Director, DAP must be given prior to the execution of 
the basic agreement. After approval and execution of the basic 
agreement, the designated negotiating activity will distribute the 
executed document to the OPDIVs, Office of General Counsel, and the 
Director, DAP. The basic agreement is mandatory for use by all 
activities of the Department for all acquisitions falling within the 
scope of the basic agreement.

<R05>
316.770  Unauthorized types of agreements.


<R05>
316.770-1  Letters of intent.

    A letter of intent is an informal unauthorized agreement between the 
Government and a prospective contractor which indicates that products or 
services will be produced after completion of funding and/or other 
contractual formalities. Letters of intent are often solicited by 
prospective contractors or may be originated by Government personnel. 
Letters of intent are not authorized by the FAR and are prohibited for 
use by Department personnel.


<R05>
316.770-2  Memorandums of understanding.

    A ``memorandum of understanding'' is an unauthorized agreement, 
usually drafted during the course of negotiations, to modify mandatory 
FAR and HHSAR provisions in such a manner as to make them more 
acceptable to a prospective contractor. It may be used to bind the 
contracting officer in attempting to exercise rights given the 
Government under the contract, or may contain other matters directly 
contrary to the language of the solicitation or prospective contractual 
document. Use of such memorandums of understanding is not authorized. 
Any change in a solicitation or contract shall be made by amendment or 
modification to that document. When a change to a prescribed contract 
clause is considered necessary, a deviation shall be requested.

operating concepts and policies relating to the Department's small 
business, disadvantaged business, and labor surplus area programs;
    (ii) Implementing policy decisions through the issuance of operating 
procedures (Operating Divisions (OPDIVs) may develop alternative

However, any change in procedures must be approved by the Under 
Secretary);
    (iii) Reviewing and evaluating the Department's policies, practices,

performance and quality of effort, including timely notification of 
significant problems, events, and accomplishments, and the need for 
changes in Department-wide objectives and policies; and
    (v) Providing technical assistance and support to the small and 
disadvantaged business utilization specialists.
    (2) The Director, OSDBU is authorized to:

controlling the manner in which the small business, disadvantaged 
business, and labor surplus area programs are conducted throughout the 
Department;
    (ii) Provide advice on proposed allocations of personnel, funds, and 
other resources in light of the total needs of the Department;

[[Page 88]]

    (iii) Prescribe, after coordination with appropriate concerned

performance. To the maximum extent, these reporting requirements will be 
satisfied through existing Department-wide reporting systems or by 
making modifications to them;
    (iv) Conduct surveys and review of operating practices in the OPDIVs 
and regional offices; and
    (v) Communicate directly with the small and disadvantaged business 
utilization specialists to assist them in carrying out their individual

319.201-70  Small and disadvantaged business utilization specialist.

    (a) The Head of each OPDIV shall appoint a qualified full time small 
and disadvantaged business utilization specialist (SADBUS) in the 
following activities: Office of Human Development Services (OHDS), 
Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), Social Security 
Administration (SSA), Public Health Service (PHS), to include the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Resources and Services 
Administration (HRSA) (and each regional Office of Engineering

disadvantaged business, women-owned business and labor surplus area 
business sources for current and future acquisitions, through SBA or by 
using other methods, establish appropriate source lists for each 
category, and work closely with contracting and small purchasing offices 
to ensure offers are solicited from firms on the source lists;
    (2) Coordinate inquiries and requests for advice from small 
business, disadvantaged business, women-owned business, and labor 
surplus area business concerns on acquisition matters, and counsel them 
with respect to business opportunities to enhance their potential 
participation in the Department's acquisition program;
    (3) Prior to the issuance of solicitations (or contract 
modifications for additional supplies or services) in excess of the 
small purchase limitation, which have not been reviewed, reserved, or 
set-aside by the contracting officer, review the contracting officer's 
justification for such action;
    (4) Assure that small business, disadvantaged business, women-owned 
business, and labor surplus area concerns are provided adequate 
specifications or drawings by initiating actions, in writing, with 
appropriate technical and contracting personnel to ensure that all 
necessary specifications or

[[Page 89]]

drawings for current and future acquisitions, as appropriate, are 
available;
    (5) Review proposed requirements for possible breakout of items 
suitable for acquisitions from small business, disadvantaged business, 
women-owned business, and labor surplus area concerns;
    (6) Assure that financial assistance, available under existing 
regulations, is offered, and that requests by small business concerns 
for proper assistance are not treated as a handicap in the award of 
contracts;
    (7) Participate in determinations concerning responsibility of 
prospective contractors whenever small business concerns are involved;
    (8) Participate in the evaluation of a prime contractor's small 
business, labor surplus area, and disadvantaged business subcontracting

    (ii) Developing and maintaining records and reports that reflect 
such compliance or noncompliance;
    (10) Review and make appropriate recommendations to the contracting 
officer on proposals to furnish Government-owned facilities to 
contractors if this action may enhance the small business program;
    (11) Assure that the participation of small businesses, 
disadvantaged businesses, women-owned business, and labor surplus area 
concerns is accurately reported;
    (12) Make available to SBA copies of solicitations when so 
requested;
    (13) When a bid or offer from a small business, disadvantaged 
business, women-owned business, or labor surplus area concern has been 
rejected for nonresponsiveness or nonresponsibility, upon request, aid, 
counsel and assist that firm in understanding requirements for 
responsiveness and responsibility so that the firm may be able to 
qualify for future awards;
    (14) Participate in government-industry conferences to assist small 
business, disadvantaged business, women-owned business, and labor

Seminars, and Business Opportunity Committee meetings;
    (15) Advise potential sources how they can obtain information about 
sealed bid and negotiated acquisitions;
    (16) Brief the head of the contracting activity at least once

and trade associations;
    (20) Be responsible for establishing an education and training

319.270  Federal acquisition conferences.

    The Department of Commerce is responsible for coordinating the 
participation of Federal civilian agencies in a continuing series of 
conferences which are sponsored by members of Congress. The objectives 
of these conferences are:
    (a) Location of additional acquisition sources to broaden the 
acquisition base of Federal agencies;
    (b) Stimulation of local, regional, and national economic growth, 
national security, and cost reduction;
    (c) Location of underutilized production capacity;
    (d) Prevention or elimination of pockets of underemployment; and
    (e) Assistance of small and small disadvantaged business concerns.

As notified by the OSDBU, contracting activities shall provide 
appropriate SADBUS or acquisition personnel to participate in person-to-
person counseling at these conferences. Ordinarily, participation by 
contracting activities will be restricted to conferences held within the 
geographical areas adjacent to their officers. The brochure, ``How To Do 
Business With DHHS'' should be of great assistance in this counseling as 
it has been specifically prepared to assist individuals, firms, and 
institutions who may wish to do business with this Department. It 
contains a brief description of the mission and programs of HHS and its 
Operating Divisions and provides a listing of contracting offices and 
the types of services and commodities acquired by each.


<R04>
              Subpart 319.5--Set-Asides for Small Business


<R05>
319.501  General.

    (c) Prior to the contracting officer's review, the SADBUS shall 
review each proposed acquisition to determine the feasibility of 
recommending award to the Small Business Administration (SBA) pursuant 
to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act. When it cannot be awarded to 
SBA pursuant to section 8(a), the SADBUS shall review the proposed 
acquisition to determine if it can be recommended as a set-aside under 
one of the set-aside priorities stated in FAR 19.504. The SADBUS's 
recommendation shall be entered on Form HHS-653, Small Business-Labor 
Surplus Set-Aside Review Form, with the reasons for the type of set-
aside recommended, or the reasons for not recommending a set-aside, and 
provided to the contracting officer. Upon receipt of the Form HHS-653, 
the contracting officer shall promptly concur or nonconcur with the 
SADBUS's recommendation. The contracting officer will make the final 
determination as to whether the proposed acquisition will be set-aside 
or not. If the contracting officer approves the SADBUS's set-aside 
recommendation, the proposed acquisition will be set-aside as specified. 
However, if the contracting officer disapproves the SADBUS's set-aside 
recommendation, the reasons must be documented on the Form HHS-653, and 
the form signed. (See 319.505 for options available to the SADBUS 
regarding the contracting officer's disapproval of a set-aside 
recommendation.) In all cases, the completed Form HHS-653 is to be 
retained by the contracting officer and placed in the contract file.

[57 FR 11690, Apr. 7, 1992]


<R05>
319.503  Setting aside a class of acquisitions.


<R05>
319.503-70  Small business class set-aside for construction, repair, and alteration work.

    A small business class set-aside is considered to have been made for 
each proposed acquisition for construction, repair, and alteration work 
in an estimated amount ranging from $2,500 to $2 million. Accordingly, 
the contracting officer shall set aside for small business each proposed 
acquisition. If, in his/her judgment, the particular acquisition falling 
within the dollar limits specified above is unsuitable for a set-aside 
for exclusive small business participation, the procedure set forth in 
FAR 19.506 shall apply. Proposed acquisitions for construction, repair, 
and alteration work in an estimated amount of more than $2 million shall 
be processed on a case by case basis.


<R05>
319.505  Rejecting set-aside recommendations.

    (a) If the contracting officer rejects the SADBUS's recommendation 
for a

[[Page 91]]

set-aside and an SBA procurement center representative (PCR) is not 
assigned or available, the SADBUS may appeal, in writing, to the head of 
the contracting activity (HCA) or his/her designee. The SADBUS shall 
provide the HCA or designee all the pertinent information concerning the 
set-aside disagreement, and the HCA shall respond in writing within 
seven business days. The HCA's decision is final and not appealable. The 
decision by the HCA shall be attached to the Form HHS-653 and placed in 
the contract file. After receipt of a final decision by the HCA, and if 
the decision approves the action of the contracting officer, the SADBUS 
shall forward, for information and management purposes, complete 
documentation of the case to the OSDBU Director. Documentation 
transmitted shall include, as a minimum, a copy of the appeal memorandum 
submitted to the HCA, a copy of the IFB or RFP, a list of proposed 
sources, a copy of the Form HHS-653 and attachments completed by the 
SADBUS and the contracting officer, a copy of the HCA's decision, and 
all other written material considered by the HCA in arriving at the 
decision. The SADBUS' transmittal memorandum shall contain an 
affirmative statement that the attachments constitute the complete file 
reviewed and considered by the HCA in making the final decision.

    If an SBA PCR is assigned or available and the SADBUS refers the 
case to that person, the SBA PCR may either concur with the decision of 
the contracting officer not to set-aside the proposed acquisition or 
recommend to the contracting officer that it be set-aside. For the SBA 
PCR to make a comprehensive review, at least the following should be 
provided as attachments to the Form HHS-653: the statement of work, 
evaluation criteria, Government cost estimate, source list including 
size of firms, and a copy of any justification for other than small 
business considerations that may be applicable. Once the case has been 
referred to the SBA PCR, no further appeal action shall be taken by the 
SADBUS. (Refer to FAR 19.505 for the procedures available to the SBA PCR 
if the contracting officer rejects the set-aside recommendation.)

<R05>
319.506  Withdrawing or modifying set-asides.

    (b) If an SBA PCR is not assigned, the disagreement between the 
contracting officer and the SADBUS shall be referred to the HCA for 
resolution.
    (d) Immediately upon notice from the contracting officer, the SADBUS 
shall provide telephone notification regarding all set-aside withdrawals 
to the OSDBU Director.


<R05>
319.570  Contract payments.

    Contract payments to small business concerns must be made on a 
timely basis. Payment of an invoice or voucher must be made within 30 
days after receipt of the invoice or voucher or from acceptance of the 
goods or services. Each invoice or voucher from a small business concern 
not sent directly to the servicing finance office, but received by the 
contracting activity, shall be stamped or otherwise identified for 
expedited payment before it is forwarded to the servicing finance 
office.

319.705  Responsibilities of the contracting officer under the subcontracting assistance program.


<R05>
319.705-2  Determining the need for a subcontracting plan.

    The dollar value of all proposed incremental funding actions shall 
be included in determining whether the acquisition meets the dollar 
threshold requiring a subcontracting plan. The subcontracting plan shall 
be based on the total value of the acquisition which will include the 
value of all option quantities or funding actions.


<R05>
319.705-3  Preparing the solicitation.

    The SBA PCR should be allowed a period of one to five business days 
for the review of the solicitation, depending

[[Page 92]]

upon the circumstances and complexity of the individual acquisition.

[49 FR 14007, Apr. 9, 1984, as amended at 57 FR 11690, Apr. 7, 1992]


<R05>
319.705-4  Reviewing the subcontracting plan.

    The offeror's/bidder's subcontracting plan for small business 
concerns shall be judged independently of the subcontracting plan for 
small disadvantaged business concerns. If a subcontracting plan is not 
obtained, the contracting officer must document the contract file to 
substantiate the reasons why the plan was not obtained. The contracting 
officer must obtain a satisfactory subcontracting plan prior to awarding 
the contract.
    (d) If the contracting officer determines that the subcontracting 
plan submitted reflects the best effort by the offeror/bidder to award 
subcontracts to small and small disadvantaged business concerns, but the 
SADBUS disagrees with the contracting officer's determination, a final 
determination shall be made by the principal official responsible for 
acquisition. The SADBUS shall submit this final determination to the 
Director, OSDBU with the appropriate supporting documentation.
    (1) The contracting officer may accept the terms of an overall or 
``master'' company subcontracting plan if it is incorporated by 
reference into a specific subcontracting plan submitted by the apparent 
successful offeror/bidder for a specific contract, if:
    (i) The master plan contains all the elements required by the 
statute;
    (ii) Subcontracting goals for small and small disadvantaged business 
concerns are specifically set forth in each contract or modification 
over the statutory thresholds;
    (iii) Any changes to the plan deemed necessary and required by the 
contracting officer in areas other than goals are specifically set forth 
in the contract or modification;
    (iv) The contracting officer has copies of the entire plan; and
    (v) The SBA PCR has had an opportunity to comment on the master 
plan.
    (2) If the prime contract is for a commercial product, the required 
subcontracting plan may relate to the company's production of the item 
generally (both for the Government contract and for regular commercial 
sale) rather than solely to the item being acquired under the Government 
contract. In such cases, the contractor shall be required to submit one 
company-wide, annual plan to be reviewed for approval by the first 
agency with which it enters into a prime contract (which requires a 
subcontracting plan) during the fiscal year. The approved plan will 
remain in effect for the entire fiscal year and is applicable to all 
deliveries made under contracts entered into during the contractor's 
fiscal year, even though these deliveries are made in a succeeding 
fiscal year. The contractor shall submit a new plan to the first agency 
with which it enters into a contract (over the statutory threshold) 
during a succeeding fiscal year. The new plan shall apply to all 
deliveries made under contracts entered into during the succeeding 
fiscal year, no matter when the deliveries are made.

[49 FR 14007, Apr. 9, 1984, as amended at 57 FR 11690, Apr. 7, 1992]


<R05>
319.705-5  Awards involving subcontracting plans.

    (a)(3) The SBA PCR shall be allowed a period of one to five business 
days to review the contract award package, depending upon the 
circumstances and complexity of the individual acquisition.


<R05>
319.705-6  Postaward responsibilities of the contracting officer.

    The SADBUS shall perform the distribution requirements stated in 
paragraphs (a) through (c) of FAR 19.705-6. A copy of any company-wide 
plans and associated approvals shall also be sent to the Director, OSDBU 
by the SADBUS. In addition, the SADBUS is responsible for summarizing 
and reporting to the Director, OSDBU, on a quarterly basis, all prime 
contracts $500,000 and over ($1 million for construction) using the 
following reporting format:
    (a) Name of the OPDIV and program office;
    (b) Number and dollar amount of contracts requiring subcontracting 
plans;
    (c) Number of contracts with subcontracting plans;

[[Page 93]]

    (d) Number of contracts without subcontracting plans;
    (e) Small and small disadvantaged business subcontracting goals; and
    (f) Statements citing reasons why small and small disadvantaged 
business subcontracting plans were not included in the contracts.


<R05>
 319.706  Responsibilities of the cognizant administrative contracting officer.

    (a) The contracting officer shall comply with the requirements of 
FAR 19.706(a), and shall use the Standard Form 294, Subcontracting 
Report for Individual Contracts, to monitor the contractor's progress in 
achieving both the small business and small disadvantaged business 
subcontracting goals. The contracting officer shall require the 
contractor to provide in the Remarks block of each Standard Form 294 
submitted a narrative of the progress in fulfilling the small business 
and small disadvantaged business subcontracting goals. The contracting 
officer shall require the contractor to report any difficulties in 
achieving the goals and the actions being taken by the contractor to 
overcome the difficulties. The contracting officer shall document the 
contract file whenever the contractor is experiencing difficulties in 
achieving the planned subcontracting goals, and shall indicate the 
actions taken by the contractor to resolve the difficulties and the 
actions taken by the contracting officer to remedy the situation. A copy 
of this documentation shall be provided to the SADBUS.
    (b) At the time of physical completion of the contract, the 
contracting officer shall prepare a memorandum for record for inclusion 
in the contract file indicating whether or not the contractor complied 
with the subcontracting plan and subcontracting provisions of the 
contract.
    (1) If the contractor achieved its subcontracting dollar goals for 
both small business and small disadvantaged business, the memorandum 
shall state that the contractor complied with the subcontracting plan 
and provisions of the contract. No other documentation is needed.
    (2) If the contractor failed to achieve its subcontracting dollar 
goals for either small business or small disadvantaged business, or 
both, the contracting officer shall indicate this failure in the 
memorandum and determine whether the contractor did or did not exercise 
its best efforts in attempting to achieve the goals.
    (i) If determined that the contractor exercised its best efforts, 
the contractor shall be found to have complied with the subcontracting 
plan and provisions of the contract. The rationale for this 
determination shall be documented in the memorandum.
    (ii) If determined that the contractor did not exercise its best 
efforts, the contractor shall be found to have not complied with the 
subcontracting plan and provisions of the contract. The reasons for this 
determination shall be documented in the memorandum, along with a 
description of specific actions taken by the contracting officer during 
the performance of the contracting to attempt to remedy the failure.
    (c) A copy of the memorandum pertaining to either situation 
described in paragraph (b)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section shall be sent 
to the Director, Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization.

forwarded to each small and disadvantaged business utilization 
specialist (SADBUS). These brochures are to be reviewed by the SADBUS to

with the capabilities of these concerns. The SADBUS will make the 
capabilities of these concerns known to program personnel and will 
obtain information, as needed, by contacting OSDBU or SBA.


<R05>
319.812  Contract administration.

    (b) The responsibility for subcontract administration and field 
inspection will, in most cases, be delegated by SBA to the contracting 
activity. The contracting activity may develop a tripartite agreement 
for execution by SBA, the 8(a) subcontractor, and the contracting 
activity instead of developing separate modifications for the SBA 
contract and the 8(a) subcontract.
    (c) Some 8(a) concerns may need additional management expertise for 
optimal performance and completion of a particular contract. Therefore, 
when subcontract administration is delegated to HHS by SBA, the 
contracting activity shall promptly apprise the SBA, the SADBUS, and 
OSDBU whenever the contractor is experiencing problems. SBA should 
provide necessary technical assistance so the contractor can 
successfully complete the contract.
    (d) The OSDBU, SADBUS, and SBA are to be notified prior to 
initiating final action to terminate an 8(a) contract.


<R05>
319.870  Liaison with the Small Business Administration.

    (a) Contracting activities will maintain a continuous liaison with 
the SBA to ensure that the overall goals of each activity are achieved. 
In the event there is a dispute between the contracting activity and a 
SBA representative regarding any aspect of 8(a) contracting, the 
contracting activity must promptly notify OSDBU.
    (b) The business development responsibility of SBA requires them to 
assist in and monitor the growth and development of all 8(a) concerns. 
Therefore, it is incumbent upon HHS to assist SBA in this effort by 
utilizing the source selection process in a manner that would make use 
of the largest possible number of 8(a) concerns.

             Subpart 324.1--Protection of Individual Privacy


<R05>
324.100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart implements 45 CFR part 5b, Privacy Act Regulations, and 
FAR subpart 24.1, Protection of Individual Privacy, which implement the 
Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579, December 31, 1974; 5 U.S.C. 552a) 
and OMB Circular No. A-108, July 9, 1975.


<R05>
324.102  General.

    (a) It is the Department's policy to protect the privacy of 
individuals to the maximum possible extent while permitting the exchange 
of records required to fulfill the Department's administrative and 
program responsibilities and its responsibilities for disclosing records 
to which the general public is entitled under the Freedom of Information 
Act (5 U.S.C. 552). The Privacy Act of 1974 and the Department's 
implementation under 45 CFR part 5b apply ``when an agency provides by a 
contract for the operation by or on behalf of the agency of a system of 
records to accomplish any agency function . . .'' The key factor is 
whether a departmental function is involved. Therefore, the Privacy Act 
requirements apply to a departmental contract when, under the contract, 
the contractor must maintain or operate a system of records to 
accomplish a departmental function.
    (e) The program official, and, as necessary, the official designated 
as the activity's Privacy Act Coordinator and the Office of General 
Counsel, shall determine the applicability of the Act to each proposed 
acquisition. The program official is required to include a statement in 
the request for contract indicating whether the Privacy Act is or is not 
applicable to the proposed acquisition.
    (f) Whenever the contracting officer is informed that the Privacy 
Act is not applicable, but the resultant contract will involve the 
collection of individually identifiable personal data by the contractor, 
the contracting officer shall include provisions to protect the 
confidentiality of the records and the privacy of individuals identified 
in the records (see subpart 324.70).


<R05>
324.103  Procedures.

    (a) All requests for contract shall be reviewed by the contracting 
officer to determine whether the Privacy Act requirements are 
applicable. If applicable, the contracting officer shall include the 
solicitation notification and contract clause required by FAR 24.104 in 
the solicitation, and the contract clause in the resultant contract. In 
addition, the contracting officer shall ensure that the solicitation 
notification, contract clause, and other pertinent information specified 
in this subpart are included in any contract modification

[[Page 96]]

which results in the Privacy Act requirements becoming applicable to a 
contract.
    (b)(1) The contracting officer shall identify the system(s) of 
records on individuals in solicitations, contracts, and contract 
modifications to which the Privacy Act and the implementing regulations 
are applicable.
    (2) The contracting officer shall include a statement in the 
contract notifying the contractor that the contractor and its employees 
are subject to criminal penalties for violations of the Act (5 U.S.C. 
552a(i)) to the same extent as employees of the Department. The 
statement shall require that the contractor assure that each contractor 
employee knows the prescribed rules of conduct, and each contractor 
employee is aware that he/she can be subjected to criminal penalties for 
violations of the Act. The contracting officer shall provide the 
contractor with a copy of the rules of conduct and other requirements 
set forth in 45 CFR 5b.
    (c) The contracting officer shall include in the contract the 
disposition to be made of the system(s) of records on individuals upon 
completion of performance of the contract. For example, the contract may 
require the contractor to completely destroy the records, to remove 
personal identifiers, to turn the records over to the Department, or to 
keep the records but take certain measures to keep the records 
confidential and protect the individuals' privacy.
    (d) Whenever an acquisition is determined to be subject to the 
Privacy Act requirements, a ``system notice,'' prepared by the program 
official and describing the Department's intent to establish a new 
system of records on individuals, to make modifications to an existing 
system, or to disclose information in regard to an existing system, is 
required to be published in the Federal Register. A copy of the ``system 
notice'' shall be attached to the request for contract or purchase 
request. If a ``system notice'' is not attached, the contracting officer 
shall inquire about its status and shall obtain a copy from the program 
official for inclusion in the contract file. If a ``system notice'' has 
not been published in the Federal Register, the contracting officer may 
proceed with the acquisition but shall not award the contract until the 
``system notice'' is published, and publication is verified by the 
contracting officer.


<R04>
                Subpart 324.2--Freedom of Information Act


<R05>
324.202  Policy.

    (a) The Department's regulation implementing the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, is set forth in 45 CFR 
part 5.
    (b) The contracting officer, upon receiving a FOIA request, shall 
follow Department and operating division procedures. As necessary, 
actions should be coordinated with the cognizant Freedom of Information 
(FOI) Officer and the Business and Administrative Law Division of the 
Office of General Counsel. The contracting officer must remember that 
only the FOI Officer has the authority to release or deny release of 
records. While the contracting officer should be familiar with the 
entire FOIA regulation in 45 CFR part 5, particular attention should be 
focused on sections 5.65 and 5.66; also of interest are sections 5.32, 
5.33, and 5.35.

             Subpart 324.70--Confidentiality of Information


<R05>
324.7001  General.

    In the performance of certain HHS contracts, it is necessary for the 
contractor to generate data, or be furnished data by the Government, 
which is about individuals, organizations, or Federal programs. This 
subpart and the accompanying contract clause require contractors to 
prudently handle disclosure of certain types of information not subject 
to the Privacy Act or the HHS human subject regulations set forth in 45 
CFR Part 46. This subpart and contract clause address the kinds of data 
to be generated by the contractor and/or data to be furnished by the 
Government that are considered confidential and how it should be 
treated.

[[Page 97]]


<R05>
324.7002  Policy.

    It is the policy of HHS to protect personal interests of 
individuals, corporate interests of non-governmental organizations, and 
the capacity of the Government to provide public services when 
information from or about individuals, organizations, or Federal 
agencies is provided to or obtained by contractors in performance of HHS 
contracts. This protection depends on the contractor's recognition and 
proper handling of such information. As a result, the ``Confidentiality 
of Information'' contract clause was developed.


<R05>
324.7003  Applicability.

    (a) The ``Confidentiality of Information'' clause, set forth in 
352.24-70, should be used in solicitations and resultant contracts 
whenever the need exists to keep information confidential. Examples of 
situations where the clause may be appropriate include:
    (1) Studies performed by the contractor which generate information 
or invlove Government-furnished information that is personally 
identifiable, such as medical records, vital statistics, surveys, and 
questionnaires;
    (2) Contracts which involve the use of salary structures, wage 
schedules, proprietary plans or processes, or confidential financial 
information of organizations other than the contractor's; and
    (3) Studies or research which may result in preliminary or 
unvalidated findings which, upon disclosure to the public, might create 
erroneous conclusions which, if acted upon, could threaten public health 
or safety.
    (b) With regard to protecting individuals, this subpart and contract 
clause are not meant to regulate or control the method of selecting 
subjects and performing studies or experiments involving them. These 
matters are dealt with in the HHS regulation entitled ``Protection of 
Human Subjects,'' 45 CFR part 46. If a system of records under contract, 
or portions thereof, is determined to be subject to the requirements of 
the Privacy Act, in accordance with FAR 24.1 and 324.1 and Title 45 CFR 
part 5b, the procedures cited in those references are applicable and the 
Privacy Act contract clause shall be included in the contract. If the 
contract also involves confidential information, as described herein, 
which is not subject to the Privacy Act, the contract shall include the 
``Confidentiality of Information'' clause in addition to the Privacy Act 
clause.


<R05>
324.7004  Required clause.

    The clause set forth in 352.224-70 shall be included in any RFP and 
resultant contract(s) where it has been determined that confidentiality 
of information provisions may apply. Any REP announcing the intent to 
include this clause in any resultant contract(s) shall indicate, as 
specifically as possible, the types of data which would be covered and 
requirements for handling such data.

head of the contracting activity. These determinations are required only 
in instances

[[Page 98]]

where it has been determined that only suppliers of foreign source end 
items shall be solicited. However, approvals and determinations covering 
individual acquisitions in the following categories may be made by the 
contracting officer:
    (1) Acquisition of spare and replacement parts for foreign 
manufactured items, if the acquisition must be restricted to the 
original manufacturer or its supplier; and
    (2) Acquisition of foreign drugs when it has been determined, in 
writing, by the responsible program official, that only the requested 
foreign drug will fulfill the requirement.

Formats for the above referenced written determinations are shown in 
325.108-70.


<R05>
325.108-70  Formats for nonavailability determinations.

    (a) The following is the format for a nonavailability determination 
made by a contracting officer:

                    Determination of Nonavailability

    Pursuant to the authority contained in section 2, Title III, of the 
Act of March 3, 1933, popularly called the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 
10(a-d)), and authority delegated to me by 325.108(b), I hereby find 
that:
    (a) (Insert a description of the item or items to be acquired, 
including unit, quantity, and estimated cost inclusive of duty and 
transportation costs to destination.)
    (b) (Enter the name and address of the proposed contractor or 
supplier, and country of origin of the item or items.)
    (c) (Include a statement of the necessity for the acquisition.)
    (d) (Include a statement of facts establishing the nonavailability 
of a similar item or items of domestic origin. If there is no known 
domestic item or items which can be used as a reasonable substitute, a 
statement to this effect will be made.)
    Based upon these findings, it is determined that the above-described 
item(s) is (are) not mined, produced, or manufactured, or the articles, 
materials, or supplies from which it (they) is (are) manufactured, are 
not mined, produced, or manufactured, as the case may be, in the United 
States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and 
of a satisfactory quality.
    Accordingly, the requirement of the Buy American Act that 
acquisition be made from domestic sources and that it be of domestic 
origin is not applicable to this acquisition, since the referenced 
acquisition is within the nonavailability exception stated in the Buy 
American Act. Authority is granted to acquire the above-described 
item(s) of foreign origin (country of origin) at an estimated total cost 
of $______, including duty and transportation cost to destination.

determination shall be signed by the preparing authority (contracting 
officer of official with contracting authority), and Part 2 shall be 
signed by the approving authority.

                    Determination of Nonavailability

    Pursuant to the authority contained in Section 2, Title III, of the 
Act of March 3, 1933, popularly called the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C.

    (a) (Insert a description of the item or items to be acquired, 
including unit, quantity, and estimated cost inclusive of duty and 
transportation costs to destination.)
    (b) (Insert a brief statement of the necessity for the acquisition.)
    (c) (Include a statement of facts establishing the nonavailability 
of a similar item or items of domestic origin.)
    Based upon the above showing of fact, it is determined that the 
above described item(s) is (are) not mined, produced, or manufactured, 
or the articles, materials, or supplies from which it (they) is (are) 
manufactured, are not mined, produced or manufactured, as the case may 
be, in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available 
commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality.

                                 Part 2

    The requirement of the Buy American Act that acquisition be made 
from domestic sources and that it be of domestic origin is not 
applicable to the above described acquisition, since the referenced 
acquisition is within the nonavailability exception stated in the Act. 
The feasibility of foregoing the requirement or providing a United 
States substitute has been considered. Authority is granted to acquire 
the above described item(s) of foreign origin (country of origin) at an 
estimated total cost of $______, including duty and transportation costs 
to destination.

advance payments, in reasonable amounts, unless otherwise prohibited by 
law.


<R05>
332.406  Letters of credit.

    (c)(1) A blanket determination and findings authorizing interest 
free advance payments under a single letter of credit has been executed 
and remains in effect for each of the nonprofit organizations listed in 
Attachment I ``Single Letter of Credit Recipients and Central Point 
Addressees.'' These determinations and findings are applicable to all 
existing and future contracts entered into by the Department, its 
operating divisions, OS staff offices, and regional offices. All 
contracts with the listed organizations which require advance payments 
(whether under section 305 of the Federal Property and Administrative 
Services Act of 1949, as amended, or other statutory authority) shall 
provide for payment to be made under the appropriate letter of credit. 
The clause set forth in 352.232-73 shall be included in all such 
contracts and the cognizant fiscal office shall be apprised of its 
inclusion.
    (2) In those instances where it is practical and feasible to finance 
an advance payment under a letter of credit other than one which is 
incorporated under a single letter of credit described in paragraph 
(c)(1) above, a determination and findings shall be executed by the PORA 
if the cited authority is to be section 305 of the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act. In cases where an authority other than 
section 305 is to be used, a determination and findings shall be 
submitted to the appropriate official authorized by the cited statute to 
approve the advance payment.
    (3) The Treasury Department's letter of credit method of financing 
advance payments shall be employed, whenever feasible. Department-wide 
blanket letters of credit, which apply to the financing of research 
contracts and grants between the institution and all activities of the 
Department, shall be utilized to the maximum extent practicable. Where a 
particular educational institution is supported by research contracts 
and grants with only one operating division of the Department, a single 
letter of credit, applicable to all research contracts and grants 
between the institution and that operating division may be employed.

                     Subpart 332.7--Contract Funding


<R05>
332.702  Policy.

    An incrementally funded contract is a contract in which the total 
work effort is to be performed over multiple time periods and funds are 
allotted to cover discernible phases or increments of performance.
    (a) Incremental funding may be applied to cost-reimbursement type 
contracts for the acquisition of research and development and other 
types of nonpersonal, nonseverable services. It shall not be applied to 
contracts for construction services, architect-engineer services, or 
severable services. Incremental funding allows nonseverable cost-
reimbursement contracts, awarded for more than one year, to be funded 
from succeeding fiscal years.
    (b) It is departmental policy that contracts for projects of 
multiple year duration be fully funded, whenever possible, to cover the 
entire project. However, incrementally funded contracts may be used 
when:
    (1) A project, which is part of an approved program, is anticipated 
to be of multiple year duration, but funds are not currently available 
to cover the entire project;
    (2) The project represents a valid need of the fiscal year in which 
the contract is awarded and of the succeeding fiscal years of the 
project's duration, during which additional funds may be obligated by 
increasing the allotment to the contract;
    (3) The project is so significant to the approved program that there 
is reasonable assurance that it will command a high priority for 
proposed appropriations to cover the entire multiple year duration; and
    (4) The statement of work is specific and is defined by separate 
phases or increments so that, at the completion of each, progress can be 
effectively measured.

    (1) The estimated total cost of the project (all planned phases or 
increments) is to be taken into consideration when determining the 
requirements which must be met before entering into the contract; i.e., 
justification for noncompetitive acquisition, approval of award, etc.
    (2) The RFP and resultant contract are to include a statement of 
work which describes the total project covering the proposed multiple 
year period of performance and indicating timetables consistent with 
planned phases or increments and corresponding allotments of funds.
    (3) Offerors will be expected to respond to RFPs with technical and 
cost proposals for the entire project indicating distinct break-outs of 
the planned phases or increments.
    (4) Negotiations will be conducted based upon the total project, 
including

[[Page 103]]

all planned phases or increments, and the multiple year period of 
performance.
    (5) Sufficient funds must be obligated under the basic contract to 
cover no less than the first year of performance, unless the contracting 
officer determines it is advantageous to the Government to fund the 
contract for a lesser period. In that event, the contracting officer 
shall ensure that the obligated funds are sufficient to cover a complete 
phase or increment of performance representing a material and measurable 
part of the total project, and the contract period shall be reduced 
accordingly.
    (6) Because of the magnitude of the scope of work and multiple year 
period of performance under an incrementally funded contract, there is a 
critical need for careful program planning. Program planning must 
provide for appropriate surveillance of the contractor's performance and 
adequate controls to ensure that projected funding will not impinge on 
the program office's ability to support, within anticipated 
appropriations, other equally important contract or grant programs.
    (7) An incrementally funded contract must contain precise 
requirements for progress reports to enable the project officer to 
effectively monitor the contract. The project officer should be required 
to prepare periodic performance evaluation reports to facilitate the 
program office's ultimate decision to allot additional funds under the 
contract.

    For detailed instruction regarding administrative actions in 
connection with anticipated cost overruns, see subpart 342.71.


<R05>
332.705  Contract clauses.


<R05>
332.705-2  Clauses for limitation of costs or funds.

    (c) (1) When using the Limitation of Funds clause (FAR 52.232-22) in 
the solicitation and resultant incrementally funded contract, the 
contracting officer shall insert the following legend between the clause 
title and the clause text:

    (This clause supersedes the Limitation of Cost clause found in the 
General Provisions of this contract.)

    (2) The contracting officer shall also include a clause reading 
substantially as that shown in 352.232-74 in the Special Provisions of 
the resultant incrementally funded contract.
    (3) The request for proposals must inform prospective offerors of 
the Department's intention to enter into an incrementally funded 
contract. Therefore, the contracting officer shall include the provision 
at 352.232-75 in the request for proposals whenever the use of 
incremental funding is contemplated.


<R04>
                      Subpart 332.9--Prompt Payment


<R05>
332.902  Definitions.

    Fiscal office means the office responsible for: (a) Determining 
whether interest penalties are due a contractor and, if so, the amount, 
(b) determining whether an invoice offers a financially advantageous 
discount, (c) maintaining records for and submission of prompt payment 
reports to the Deputy Assistant Secretary, Finance (DASF), ASMB, OS, and 
(d) processing payments to the Treasury Department to allow for payment 
to a contractor when due. The fiscal office shall fulfill the roles of 
the ``designated billing office'' and the ``designated payment office.''

[53 FR 43208, Oct. 26, 1988]


<R05>
332.905  Invoice payments.

    (a)(1)(ii), (b)(4), (c)(5). In most instances, the contracting 
officer will use the seven (7) day constructive acceptance period 
(specified in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of the Prompt Payment clause at FAR 
52.232-25, paragraph (a)(5)(i) of the Prompt Payment clause at FAR 
52.232-26, and paragraph (a)(4)(i) of the Prompt Payment clause at FAR 
52.232.-27) for solicitations and resultant contracts as the basis for 
the fiscal office's computation of interest penalties. However, where 
the contracting officer extends the constructive acceptance period, 
under the conditions described in FAR 32.905, the extension shall be 
coordinated with the fiscal office. A constructive acceptance period of 
less than seven (7) days is not authorized.

[[Page 104]]

    (j) When the contracting officer mistakenly receives an invoice 
first, or is specified in the contract as the first recipient of the 
invoice, and the contract requires payment with thirty (30) days from 
receipt of a ``proper invoice'' (as defined by FAR 32.902), the 
contracting officer shall review the invoice to determine whether or not 
it is proper; and, if so, shall approve the invoice and submit it to the 
fiscal office within sixteen (16) days from the date of receipt. When 
the contracting officer is the first recipient of the invoice and the 
contract establishes a payment due date of more than thirty (30) days 
after receipt, the contracting officer shall review, approve, and submit 
the ``proper invoice'' to the fiscal office at least fourteen (14) days 
prior to the payment due date (unless the contracting officer and fiscal 
office agree, prior to contract award, to a longer period).

333.101  Definitions.

    Filed, as used in this subpart, means receipt in the contracting 
office, the immediate Office of the Secretary, the General Accounting 
Office (GAO), or the General Services Board of Contract Appeals (GSBCA), 
as the case may be.


<R05>
333.102  General.

    (a) Contracting officers shall consider all protests or objections 
regarding the award of a contract, whether submitted before or after 
award, provided the protests are filed in a timely manner and are 
submitted by interested parties. To be considered timely, protests based 
on alleged improprieties in any type of solicitation which are apparent 
before bid opening or the closing date for receipt of proposals shall be 
filed prior to bid opening or the closing date for receipt of proposals. 
In the case of negotiated acquisitions, alleged improprieties which do 
not exist in initial solicitations, but which are subsequently 
incorporated by amendment, must be protested not later than the next 
closing date for receipt of proposals following the incorporation. In 
other cases, protests shall be filed not later than ten (10) Federal 
Government working days after the basis for protest is known or should 
have been known, whichever is earlier. Provided a timely protest has 
been filed initially with the contracting officer, any subsequent 
protest to the Secretary or GAO filed within ten (10) Federal Government 
working days of notification of adverse action will be considered. 
Written confirmation of all oral protests shall be requested from 
protestants and must be timely filed.
    (d)(1) Office of Acquisition and Grants Management (OAGM) has been 
designated as the headquarters office to serve as the liaison for 
protests lodged with GAO. Within OAGM, the Departmental Protest Control 
Officer (DPCO) has been designated as the individual to be contacted by 
GAO.
    (2) The Office of General Counsel--Business and Administrative Law 
Division (OGC-BAL) has been designated to serve as the liaison for 
protests lodged with the GSBCA.
    (3) Each contracting activity shall designate a protest control 
officer to serve as an advisor to the contracting officer and to monitor 
protests from the time of initial notification until the protest has 
been resolved. The protest control officer should be a senior

[[Page 105]]

acquisition specialist in the headquarters acquisition staff office. In 
addition, contracting activities should designate similar officials 
within their principal components to the extent practicable and 
feasible. A copy of each appointment and termination of appointment of 
protest control officers shall be forwarded to the Director, OAGM.

[50 FR 23133, May 31, 1985, as amended at 54 FR 24344, June 7, 1989; 56 
FR 47003, Sept. 17, 1991]


<R05>
333.103  Protests to the agency.

    (a)(2) The contracting officer is authorized to make the 
determination, using the criteria in FAR 33.103(a), to award a contract 
notwithstanding the protest after obtaining the concurrence of the 
contracting activity's protest control officer and OGC-BAL. If the 
protest has been lodged with the Secretary, is addressed to the 
Secretary, or requests referral to the Secretary, approval shall also be 
obtained from the Director, OAGM before making the award.
    (3) The contracting officer shall require written confirmation of 
any oral protest. To be considered timely, the written confirmation must 
be filed in accordance with the applicable provisions in 333.102(a). In 
the following cases, written protests received by the contracting 
officer before award shall be forwarded, through acquisition channels, 
to the DPCO for processing. Files concerning these protests shall be 
submitted, in duplicate, by the most expeditious means, marked 
``IMMEDIATE ACTION--PROTEST BEFORE AWARD'', and contain the 
documentation referenced in 333.104(a)(3).
    (i) The protestant requests referral to the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services;
    (ii) The protest is known to have been lodged with the Comptroller 
General or the Secretary, or is addressed to either; or
    (iii) The contracting officer entertains some doubt as to the proper 
action regarding the protest or believes it to be in the best interest 
of the Government that the protest be considered by the Secretary or the 
Comptroller General.

Otherwise, submissions of protests to the DPCO may be dispensed with by 
the contracting officer if he/she is reasonably satisfied that the 
protest is groundless. In this instance, the contracting officer, with 
the concurrence of the contracting activity's protest control officer 
and OGC-BAL, may disallow the protest.
    (4) Protests received after award shall be treated as indicated in 
333.103(a)(3), above; however, if the files are to be submitted to the 
DPCO for action, they shall be marked ``IMMEDIATE ACTION--PROTEST AFTER 
AWARD''.

<R05>
333.104  Protests to GAO.

    (a) General. (1) A protestor shall be required to furnish a copy of 
its complete protest to the contracting officer no later than the first 
working day after the protest is filed with GAO. Immediately upon 
receiving a copy of the complete protest, the contracting officer shall 
telephonically notify the contractng activity's protest control officer, 
who, in turn, shall immediately notify the DPCO. The contracting officer 
shall provide the name of the protestor, the solicitation number, the 
date and time the protest was received from the protestor, and any other 
significant information.
    (3) Protests lodged with GAO, whether before or after award, shall 
be processed by the DPCO. Protest files shall be prepared by the 
contracting office and distributed as follows: two copies to the DPCO, 
one copy to the contracting activity's protest control officer, and one 
copy to OGC-BAL. Files shall include the following documentation:
    (i) The contracting officer's statement of facts and circumstances, 
including a discussion of the merits of the protest, and conclusions and 
recommendations, including documentary evidence on which they are based.
    (ii) A copy of the IFB or RFP.
    (iii) A copy of the abstract of bids or proposals.
    (iv) A copy of the bid or proposal of the successful offeror to whom 
award

[[Page 106]]

has been made or is proposed to be made.
    (v) A copy of the bid or proposal of the protestant, if any.
    (vi) The current status of award. When award has been made, this 
shall include whether performance has commenced, shipment or delivery 
has been made, or a stop work order has been issued.
    (vii) A copy of any mutual agreement to suspend work on a no-cost 
basis, when appropriate (see FAR 33.104(c)(4)).
    (viii) Copies of the notice of protest given offerors and other 
parties when the notice is appropriate (see FAR 33.104(a)(4)).
    (ix) A copy of the technical evaluation report required by 315.608-
76, when applicable, and a copy of each evaluator's rating for all 
proposals.
    (x) A copy of the negotiation memorandum, when applicable (see 
315.672).
    (xi) The name and telephone number of the person in the contracting 
office who may be contacted for information relevant to the protest, and
    (xii) Any document which is referred to in the contracting officer's 
statement of facts.
    The files shall be assembled in an orderly manner and shall include 
an index of enclosures.
    (4) The contracting officer is responsible for making the necessary 
notifications referenced in FAR 33.104(a)(4). Copies of the views of 
interested parties submitted in response to the notifications shall be 
immediately provided to the DPCO upon receipt by the contracting 
officer.
    (5) The contracting officer shall furnish the protest file 
containing the documentation specified in 333.104(a)(3), except item 
(i), to the DPCO within twelve (12) work days from receipt of the 
protest. The contracting officer shall provide the documentation 
required by item (i) of 333.104(a)(3) to the DPCO within nineteen (19) 
work days from receipt of the protest. (The contracting activity's 
protest control officer may provide a written opinion and recommendation 
on the protest to the DPCO within nineteen (19) work days from receipt 
of the protest by the contracting officer.) The contracting officer 
shall clearly identify any documents or portions of documents he or she 
desires to withhold from the protester, and shall include justification 
for the withholding of each document or portion of a document in the 
contracting officer's statement of facts. Since the statute allows only 
a short time period in which to respond to protests lodged with GAO, the 
contracting officer shall handle each protest on a priority basis.
    The DPCO shall prepare the report and submit it and the protest file 
to GAO in accordance with FAR 33.104(a)(5).
    (6)(i) The DPCO shall take the necessary actions specified in FAR 
33.104(a)(6)(i) after receiving all the documentation required by 
333.104(a)(3) from the contracting officer.
    (ii) Since the DPCO will furnish the report to GAO, the protestor, 
and other interested parties, comments on the report from the protester 
and other interested parties will be requested to be sent to the DPCO.
    (7) The Office of Acquisition and Grants Management (OAGM) has been 
designated as the headquarters office, and the DPCO as the individual, 
that GAO should contact concerning all protests lodged with GAO.
    (b) Protests before award. (1) To make an award notwithstanding a 
protest, the contracting officer shall prepare a finding using the 
criteria in FAR 33.104(b)(1), have it executed by the principal official 
responsible for acquisition (PORA), and forward it, along with a written 
request for approval to make the award, to the Director, OAGM.
    (2) If the request to make an award notwithstanding the protest is 
approved by the Director, OAGM, the DPCO shall notify GAO. Whether the 
request is approved or not, the DPCO shall telephonically notify the 
contracting activity's protest control officer of the decision by the 
Director, OAGM, and the contracting activity's protest control officer 
shall immediately notify the contracting officer. The DPCO shall confirm 
the decision by memorandum to the contracting activity's protest control 
officer.
    (4) The contracting office shall prepare the protest file in 
accordance with 333.104(a)(2), and forward it, in duplicate, to the DPCO 
(see 333.104(a)(4)).

[[Page 107]]

The file shall be marked ``IMMEDIATE ACTION--PROTEST BEFORE AWARD.''
    (c) Protests after award. (2) If the contracting officer believes 
performance should be allowed to continue notwithstanding the protest, a 
finding shall be prepared by the contracting officer, executed by the 
PORA, and forwarded, along with a written request for approval, to the 
Director, OAGM. The same procedures for notification stated in 
333.104(b)(2), above shall be followed.
    (6) The contracting officer shall prepare the protest file in 
accordance with 333.104(a)(3), and forward it, in duplicate, to the DPCO 
(see 333.104(a)(5)). The file shall be marked ``IMMEDIATE ACTION--
PROTEST AFTER AWARD.''
    (d) Findings and notice. The contracting officer shall perform the 
actions required by FAR 33.104(d); however, notification to GAO shall be 
made by the DPCO.
    (g) Notice to GAO. The Director, Office of Acquisition and Grants 
Management shall be the official to comply with the requirements of FAR 
33.104(g).
    (i) Express option. When GAO invokes the express option, the 
contracting officer shall prepare the complete protest file as described 
in 333.104(a)(3), to include item (i), and deliver it (hand-carry, if 
necessary) to the DPCO no later than the close of business on the ninth 
work day after the express option is invoked. The contracting officer 
shall involve OGC-BAL as early as possible after receiving notification 
of the invocation of the express option, and obtain the concurrence of 
the cognizant OGC-BAL attorney prior to transmitting the protest file to 
the DPCO. The DPCO shall prepare the report and submit it and the 
protest file to GAO.

333.105  Protests to GSBCA.

    (a)(1) The contracting officer shall give telephone notification to 
the DPCO, OGC-BAL, and the contracting activity's protest control 
officer immediately upon notification of the protest.
    (2)(i) The contracting officer is responsible for complying with the 
requirement in FAR 33.105(a)(2)(i).
    (ii) The cognizant OGC-BAL attorney is responsible for complying 
with the requirement stated in FAR 33.105(a)(2)(ii).
    (b) As soon as possible but no later than six (6) work days after 
the filing of the protest, a copy of the protest file containing all 
documents (see FAR 33.105(b), especially (b)(7)), and labeled on the 
cover ``FOR USE BY DPCO ONLY'', shall be in the hands of the DPCO for 
review. Simultaneously, two copies of the same protest file provided to 
the DPCO shall be provided to the cognizant OGC-BAL attorney. These two 
copies shall be labeled on the cover ``FOR USE BY OGC-BAL.'' After 
consultation with the cognizant OGC-BAL attorney, the DPCO shall 
transmit the protest file to the GSBCA.
    (1) Rather than furnishing a decision, the contracting officer shall 
include a statement of facts and circumstances and a discussion of the 
merits of the protest, as well as conclusions and recommendations and 
documentary evidence on which they are based. These statements shall be 
reviewed by the cognizant OGC-BAL attorney before being finalized.
    (7) The DPCO shall provide all parties with a list of documents 
furnished to the GSBCA for in camera review.
    (10) The copies of the protest files to be provided to the DPCO and 
OGC-BAL shall also contain the documents or information specified in

orderly manner and include an index of enclosures.
    (c) The cognizant OGC-BAL attorney is responsible for complying with 
the requirement stated in FAR 33.105(c).
    (d)(1) If the protest requests a suspension of acquisition 
authority, the contracting officer must make this known to the DPCO, 
OGC-BAL, and the contracting activity's protest control officer at the 
time of the initial telephone notification of the filing of the protest 
to afford an opportunity for the DPCO, OGC-BAL, principal official 
responsible for acquisition (PORA), and contracting officer to take 
appropriate action.

[[Page 108]]

    (2) If it can be established that the conditions stated in FAR 
33.105(d)(1)(i) and (ii) are present, the contracting officer shall 
prepare a D&F setting forth the circumstances. The D&F shall be 
concurred in by the cognizant OGC-BAL attorney before being executed by 
the PORA (not delegable).
    (g) If an appeal is to be made by the Department regarding a final 
decision issued by the GSBCA, it shall be made by OGC-BAL.

<R05>
333.212  Contracting officer's duties upon appeal.

for the appellant, one for the Government Trial Attorney, and one for 
the contracting office.
    (d) At all times after the filing of an appeal, the contracting

contracting officer, acting under the guidance of the Government Trial 
Attorney, shall be responsible for arranging for the presence of 
Government witnesses and specified physical and documentary evidence at 
both the pre-hearing conference and the hearing.
    (e) If a contractor which has filed an appeal with the ASBCA elects 
to accept fully the decision from which the appeal was taken, or any 
modification to it, and gives written notification of acceptance to the 
Government Trial Attorney or the concerned contracting officer, the 
Government Trial Attorney will notify the ASBCA of the disposition of 
the dispute in accordance with Rule 27 of the ASBCA.
    (f) If the contractor has elected to appeal to the U.S. Claims 
Court, the U.S. Department of Justice will represent the Department. 
However, the contracting officer shall still coordinate all actions 
through OGC-BAL.

<R05>
335.070  Cost-sharing.


<R05>
335.070-1  Policy.

    (a) In addition to utilizing cost-sharing type contracts when 
required by statute, the desirability of utilizing this type of 
contract, when authorized should also be considered under certain 
circumstances when not required by statute. Contractors should be 
encouraged to contribute to the cost of performing research where there 
is a probability that the contractor will receive present or future 
benefits from participation, such as, increased technical know-how, 
training to employees, acquisition of equipment, use of background 
knowledge in future contracts, etc. Cost-sharing is intended to serve 
the mutual interest of the Government and the performing organization by 
helping to assure efficient utilization of the resources available for 
the conduct of research projects and by promoting sound planning and 
prudent fiscal policies by the performing organization. If cost-sharing 
is not required by statute, encouragement should be given to 
organizations to contribute to the cost of performing research under 
research contracts unless the contracting officer determines that a 
request for cost-sharing would not be appropriate because of the 
following circumstances:
    (1) The particular research objective or scope of effort for the 
project is specified by the Government rather than proposed by the 
performing organization. This would usually include any formal 
Government requests for proposals for a specific project.
    (2) The research effort has only minor relevance to the non-Federal 
activities of the performing organization, and the organization is 
proposing to undertake the research primarily as a service to the 
Government.
    (3) The organization has little or no non-Federal sources or funds 
from which to make a cost contribution. Cost-sharing should generally 
not be requested if cost-sharing would require the Government to provide 
funds through some other means (such as fees) to enable the organization 
to cost-share. It should be recognized that those organizations which 
are predominantly engaged in research and development and have little or 
no production or other service activities may not be in a favorable 
position to make a cost contribution.
    (b) Cost-sharing may be negotiated in either of two ways. When cost-
sharing is negotiated on a contract by contract basis, the 
responsibility for negotiating the cost-sharing arrangement is that of 
the contracting officer. In the case of institutional cost-sharing 
arrangements (see 335.070-4), the responsibility for negotiating cost-
sharing is that of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health. 
Each research contract file should show whether the contracting officer 
considered cost-sharing appropriate for that particular contract and, 
except when an institutional cost-sharing agreement is applicable, in 
what amount. If cost-sharing was not considered appropriate, the file 
must indicate the factual basis for that decision, e.g., ``Because the 
contractor will derive no

[[Page 112]]

benefits from this award that can be applied to its commercial 
activities, cost-sharing is not considered appropriate.'' The 
contracting officer may wish to coordinate with the project officer 
before documenting this decision.
    (c) If the contracting officer considers cost-sharing to be 
appropriate for a research contract and the contractor refuses to accept 
this type of contract, the award may be made without cost-sharing, 
except when cost-sharing is required by statute, if the contracting 
officer concludes that payment of the full cost of the research effort 
is necessary in order to obtain the services of that particular 
contractor.

[49 FR 14020, Apr. 9, 1984; 49 FR 36110, Sept. 14, 1984]


<R05>
335.070-2  Amount of cost-sharing.

    When cost-sharing is required by statute or determined to be 
appropriate, the following guidelines shall be utilized in determining 
the amount of cost participation by the contractor, except where an 
institutional cost-sharing agreement is applicable:
    (a) Cost participation by educational institutions and other not-
for-profit or nonprofit organizations should normally be at least 1 
percent of the total project cost. In many cases, cost-sharing of less 
than 5 percent of the total project cost would be appropriate in view of 
the organizations' nonprofit status and their normally limited ability 
to recover the cost of such participation from non-Federal sources. 
However, in some cases, it may be appropriate for educational 
institutions to provide a higher degree of cost-sharing, such as when 
the cost of the research consists primarily of the academic year salary 
of faculty members (or when the equipment acquired by the institution 
for the project will be of significant value to the institution in its 
educational activities). The percentages stated above are not intended 
as a substitution for those set forth in any legislation and are not to 
be used in lieu of those contained in that legislation.
    (b) The amount of cost participation by commercial or industrial 
organizations should depend to a large extent on whether the research 
effort or results are likely to enhance the performing organization's 
capability, expertise, or competitive position, and the value of such 
enhancement to the performing organization. It should be recognized that 
those organizations which are predominantly engaged in research and 
development and have little or no production or other service activities 
may not be in a favorable position to derive a monetary benefit from 
their research under Federal agreements. Therefore, cost participation 
by commercial or industrial organizations could reasonably range from as 
little as 1 percent or less of the total project cost, to more than 50 
percent of the total project cost.
    (c) If the performing organization will not acquire title to or the 
right to use inventions, patents, or technical information resulting 
from the research project, it would generally be appropriate to obtain 
less cost-sharing than in cases in which the performer acquires such 
rights.
    (d) When cost-sharing is required by statute, cost participation of 
less than 1 percent may be appropriate if consistent with the provisions 
of the statute, and:
    (1) A formal request for proposal is issued;
    (2) The contractor proposes to perform the research primarily as a 
service to the Government; or
    (e) The contractor has little or no non-Federal sources of funds 
from which to make a cost contribution.
    (3) A fee or profit will usually not be paid to the performing 
organization if the organization is to contribute to the cost of the 
research effort, but the amount of cost-sharing may be reduced to 
reflect the fact that the organization is foregoing its normal fee or 
profit in the research. However, if the research is expected to be of 
only minor value to the performing organization and if cost-sharing is 
not required by statute, it may be appropriate for the performer to make 
a contribution in the form of a reduced fee or profit rather than 
sharing the costs of the project.
    (f) The organization's participation may be considered over the 
total term of the project so that a relatively high contribution in one 
year may be offset

[[Page 113]]

by a relatively low contribution in another.
    (g) A relatively low degree of cost-sharing may be appropriate if, 
in the view of the operating divisions or their subordinate elements, an 
area of research requires special stimulus in the national interest.
    (h) In the final analysis, the amount of cost participation should 
reflect the mutual agreement of the parties, provided that it is 
consistent with any statutory requirements.


<R05>
335.070-3  Method of cost-sharing.

    Cost-sharing on individual contracts may be accomplished either by a 
contribution of part or all of one or more elements of allowable cost of 
the work being performed, or by a fixed amount or stated percentage of 
the total allowable costs of the project. Costs so contributed may not 
be charged to the Government under any other grant or contract 
(including allocations to other grants or contracts as part of any 
independent research and development program).

[49 FR 14020, Apr. 9, 1984. Correctly designated at 49 FR 36110, Sept. 
14, 1984]


<R05>
335.070-4  Institutional cost-sharing agreements.

    (a) An institutional cost-sharing agreement covers the aggregate of 
some or all of the research projects supported by HHS research contracts 
and grants at a given performing organization. With respect to 
contracts, these agreements will apply only to cost-sharing type 
contracts resulting from unsolicited proposals and awarded without fee 
or profit. Eligibility for institutional cost-sharing agreements is 
limited to nonprofit institutions of higher education and other public 
or private nonprofit or not-for-profit organizations. Usually, a single 
agreement will cover all applicable research projects at a given 
performing organization; however, in unusual cases, separate agreements 
for individual departments or locations of the performing organization 
may be negotiated if deemed advantageous.
    (b) The institutional cost-sharing agreements establish an overall 
sharing ratio applicable to the aggregate of all covered projects. 
Individual awards will incorporate the institutional agreement by 
reference, but will not establish a specific sharing ratio for the 
individual project. The amount of sharing on any particular project will 
therefore be left to the discretion of the performing organization, and 
relatively high contributions on some projects may offset relatively low 
contributions on other projects, provided that the agreed aggregate 
contribution is made during each of the contractor's fiscal years, and a 
contribution, even if nominal, is made to each covered project.
    (c) The Public Health Service shall be responsible for negotiating 
all HHS institutional cost-sharing agreements. Agreements, when 
negotiated, will be binding upon all HHS activities. Eligible 
contractors wishing to negotiate institutional cost-sharing agreements 
should contact the Division of Grants and Contracts, Office of Resource 
Management, Public Health Service, Room 18 A 19, Parklawn Building, 5600 
Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857.
    (1) All necessary implementing instructions to cover matters such as 
content of proposals, format of agreements, documentation, etc. shall be 
issued by the Public Health Service, subject to the prior approval of 
the Office of Acquisition and Grants Management.
    (2) The Public Health Service shall provide the Office of 
Acquisition and Grants Management, and the Department's operating 
divisions with current listings of all institutional cost-sharing 
agreements, indicating the date on which they became effective with 
respect to contracts. Copies of individual agreements will be made 
available to the Department's other activities upon request. Each 
activity shall designate only one individual who shall be authorized to 
make such requests.
    (d) The amount of cost-sharing negotiated under an institutional 
cost-sharing agreement will be determined in accordance with the 
appropriate guidelines contained in ``A Guide to Institutional Cost 
Sharing Agreements'' issued by the Office of Resource Management, PHS. 
The extent to which the performing organization shared in the costs of 
HHS-sponsored research in the

[[Page 114]]

past, and its anticipated ability to do so in the future, should also be 
taken into account.

<R05>
335.070-5  Contract clauses.

    Clauses for cost sharing in individually negotiated contracts or 
under institutional agreements are set forth in 352.232-71.


<R05>
335.070-6  Contract award.

    In consonance with the Department's objectives of competition and 
support of the small business program, award of contracts should not be 
made solely on the basis of ability or willingness to cost-share. Awards 
should be made primarily on the contractor's competence and only after 
adequate competition has been obtained among large and small business 
organizations whenever possible. The offeror's willingness to share 
costs should not be considered in the technical evaluation process but 
as a business consideration, which is secondary to selecting the best 
qualified source.

base the determination should be a joint effort between contracting and 
program personnel. The contracting officer shall request the advice of 
the Office of General Counsel and/or the personnel office before 
processing any request to acquire services if there is doubt as to 
whether an employer-employee relationship would be involved in 
performance of the contract.

FR 38004, Sept. 19, 1985]


<R05>
337.104  Personal services contracts.

    (a) As indicated in FAR 37.104, the paramount consideration in 
determining if an employer-employee relationship exists is the presence 
of direction or supervision by Government personnel of contractor 
employees, as a result of either the inherent nature of the service or 
the manner in which the service is provided. A personal service 
relationship exists if this direction or supervision is necessary to:
    (1) Adequately protect the Government's interest;
    (2) Retain control of the function involved; and/or
    (3) Retain full personal responsibility by a duly authorized Federal 
officer or employee for the function supported.

[[Page 115]]

    (c)(2) The degree of supervision necessary to establish an employer-
employee relationship is relatively continuous, close supervision. 
Sporadic supervision is not sufficient to constitute an employer-
employee relationship. (In determining whether the Government rather 
than the contractor exercises ``relatively continuous, close 
supervision'' of contractor personnel, the fact that an engineer, for 
example, may require less supervision and may exercise more independence 
of judgment than a food service worker is not itself determinative. If 
the Government takes over that degree of supervision that the contractor 
would otherwise exercise over either individual, the relationship 
created between the Government and either individual is tantamount to 
that of employer and employee.)
    (d) The likelihood of the existence of an employer-employee 
relationship increases as the number and extent of the elements in FAR 
37.104(d) increases. However, the mere existence of these elements does 
not constitute an employer-employee relationship unless continuous, 
close supervision exists. In determining the presence of the referenced 
elements, relevant factors including the following shall be considered:
    (1) The nature of the work. (i) If the Government can use Federal 
personnel to perform the required work, or if the Government has rights 
to the specialized knowledge or equipment which is needed to perform the 
work;
    (ii) Whether the services represent the discharge of a Government 
function which calls for the exercise of personal judgment and 
discretion on behalf of the Government. (This factor, if present in 
sufficient degree, may alone render the service personal in nature.); 
and/or
    (iii) If the services are to be a one-time occurrence (or a 
continuing requirement of short term duration).
    (2) Contractual provisions concerning the contractor's employees. 
(i) To what extent the Government specifies the qualifications of, or 
has the right to approve, individual contractor employees (other than 
the Government's right to approve or disapprove new key personnel, 
remove key personnel, grant or deny security clearances, and provide for 
necessary health qualifications). (Also, it is permissible for the 
Government to specify the technical and experience qualifications of 
contractor employees, if this is necessary to assure satisfactory 
performance.);
    (ii) To what extent the Government can assign tasks to, and prepare 
work schedules for, contractor employees during performance of the 
contract. (This does not preclude inclusion in the contract of work 
schedules for the contractor--but not individual employees--or the 
establishment of a time of performance for orders issued under a 
requirement or other indefinite delivery-type contract.);
    (iii) To what extent the Government can supervise or control the 
method in which the contractor performs the service, the number of 
people that will be employed, the specific duties of individual 
employees, and similar details. (However, it is permissible to require 
that contractor employees comply with regulations for the protection of 
life and property. Also, it is permissible to recommend a specific 
number of people the contractor may employ, if this is necessary to 
assure performance; but in that event, the contract must specify that 
this does not in any way minimize the contractor's obligation to use as 
many employees as are necessary for proper contract performance.);
    (iv) If the Government can review performance of each individual 
contractor employee (as opposed to reviewing the final product after 
completion of the work.); and/or
    (v) If the Government has the right to have contractor employees 
removed from the job for reasons other than misconduct or security.
    (3) Other provisions of the contract. (i) Whether the contractor 
undertakes a specific task or project that is definable either at the 
inception of the contract or at some point during performance, or 
whether the work is defined on a day-to-day basis. (However, this does 
not preclude use of a requirement or other indefinite delivery-type 
contract, provided the nature of the work is specifically described in 
the contract, and orders are formally issued to the contractor rather 
than to individual employees.);

[[Page 116]]

    (ii) Whether payment will be for results accomplished or solely 
according to time worked. (This is a factor which might be useful in a 
doubtful case, but should not in itself create doubt about services 
which are otherwise clearly nonpersonal.); and/or
    (iii) Whether Government office or working space, facilities, 
equipment, and supplies will be used for contract performance. (This is 
a factor which might be useful in a doubtful case, but should not in 
itself create doubt about services which are otherwise clearly 
nonpersonal.).
    (4) Administration of the contract. (i) If contractor employees are 
used interchangeably with Government personnel; and/or
    (ii) If contractor employees are integrated into the Government's 
organizational structure.
    (e) and (f) Reserved.
    (g) The following are examples of personal and nonpersonal services, 
but are illustrative only and are not to be used as the basis for 
determination in any specific case.
    (1) The following are examples of personal services contracts:
    (i) A contract to furnish ordinary, day-to-day, stenographic and 
secretarial services in a Government office under direct Government 
supervision.
    (ii) A contract for the testing of a substance where the project 
officer visits the contractor's facility several times each week to 
consult with the principal investigator, review data, specify methods of 
quality control, specify testing to be done, and provide instruction to 
investigators.
    (iii) A contract for the performance of a function which management 
must perform in order to retain essential control over the conduct of 
agency programs (e.g., negotiating contract amounts).
    (2) The following are examples of nonpersonal services contracts:
    (i) A contract for technical assistance work requiring specialized 
equipment and trained personnel unavailable to the Government. The 
contractor performs work described in the contract free of Government 
supervision, and does not act on behalf of the Government.
    (ii) A contract with an individual for delivery of lectures without 
Government supervision (even if they are to be given on specific dates, 
or on specialized subjects, or if payment will be by the hour).
    (iii) A fixed price contract for janitorial services which provides 
for specific tasks to be performed in specific places, free of 
Government direction, supervision, and control over the contractor's 
employees.
    (iv) A research and development contract providing for a level of 
effort which will be performed by the contractor independent of 
Government direction, supervision, and control.

ADP hardware, software packages, and services, and telecommunications 
equipment, which exceed the dollar thresholds stated in Chapter 4-10.
    (a) It is the responsibility of the program office to obtain written 
approval from OIRM on proposed ADP acquisitions which exceed the 
thresholds stated in Exhibit 4-10-A of Chapter 4-10 prior to submitting 
the request for contract to the contracting activity.
    (b) The OIRM approval document (delegation of procurement authority 
(DPA)) is to be attached to the request for contract when it is 
submitted by the program office to the contracting activity. The 
contracting activity shall not issue a solicitation based on the request 
for contract until a properly executed approval document (DPA) is 
obtained.

<R05>
339.7002  ADP systems security.

    (a) Program responsibilities. Whenever a proposed contract action 
requires the design, development, maintenance, or use of an ADP system 
or the use of ADP resources, the program office is required to designate 
a responsible individual to serve as the ADP system manager who is to 
ensure, in coordination with the cognizant systems security officer, 
that ADP security requirements are met and that each contractor 
maintains an acceptable security program. The project officer is 
responsible for setting forth the specific portions of Part 6, ADP 
Systems Security, of the HHS IRM Manual which are applicable to the 
instant acquisition.
    (b) Contracting responsibilities. (1) The contracting officer is 
responsible for ensuring that a certification of ADP systems security 
requirements, signed by both the ADP system manager and the ADP systems 
security officer, is submitted with the request for contract. The 
contracting officer shall not initiate action on the request for 
contract until the properly executed certification is received. The 
certification will state that the security requirements specified are 
reasonably sufficient for the intended application and that they comply 
with current Federal and HHS computer security policies, procedures, 
standards, and guidelines.
    (2) When developing the request for proposals, the contracting 
officer shall include in the technical proposal instructions a statement 
requiring that the offeror present a detailed outline of its proposed 
ADP system security program which complies with the requirements of the 
statement of work and applicable portions of Part 6, ADP Systems 
Security, of the HHS IRM Manual.
    (3) The contracting officer shall include a special provision 
reading substantially as follows in all applicable solicitations and 
resultant contracts:

    The Contractor agrees to comply with the ADP system security 
requirements set forth in the system of work and applicable portions of 
Part 6, ADP Systems Security, of the HHS IRM Manual. The Contractor 
further agrees to include this provision in any subcontract awarded 
pursuant to this prime contract.

    (4) The contracting officer shall ensure that a properly executed 
certification confirming that the offerors comply with the necessary 
security requirements is attached to the technical evaluation report 
received from the evaluation panel before proceeding

[[Page 118]]

with the acquisition process. This certification must be countersigned 
by the officials designated in paragraph (b)(1) above and must contain a 
similar statement of compliance.

<R05>
342.504  Postaward letters.

    To the extent practicable, contracting officers should use letters 
to accomplish postaward orientation objectives. A postaward orientation 
conference should only be arranged when letters cannot resolve key 
issues.

                   Subpart 342.7--Indirect Cost Rates


<R05>
342.705  Final indirect cost rates.

    The Director, Division of Cost Allocation of the Regional 
Administrative Support Center within each HHS regional office has been 
delegated the authority to establish indirect cost rates, research 
patient care rates, and, as necessary, fringe benefit, computer, and 
other special costing rates for use in contracts and grants awarded to 
State and local governments, colleges and universities, hospitals, and 
other nonprofit organizations.


<R04>
                   Subpart 342.70--Contract Monitoring


<R05>
342.7001  Purpose.

    Contract monitoring is an essential element of contract 
administration and the acquisition process. This subpart describes the 
Department's operating concepts regarding contract monitoring, performed 
jointly by the project officer and the contracting officer, to ensure 
that the required monitoring is performed, timely remedial action is 
taken when necessary, and a determination is made that contract 
objectives have been met.


<R05>
342.7002  Contract monitoring responsibilities.

    (a) Upon execution of the contract, the mutual obligations of the 
Government and the contractor are established by, and limited to, the 
written stipulations in the contract. Unless authorized by the 
contracting officer, HHS personnel shall not direct or request the 
contractor to assume any obligation or take any actions not specifically 
required by the contract. Only the contracting officer may impose a 
requirement which will result in a change to the contract. All contract 
changes must be directed in writing or confirmed in writing by the 
contracting officer.
    (b) The contracting officer is responsible for assuring compliance 
with all terms of the contract, especially the statutory, legal, 
business, and regulatory provisions. Whether or not a postaward 
conference is held, the contracting officer shall inform the contractor 
by letter (if not already stipulated by contract provisions) of the 
authorities and responsibilities of the Government personnel with whom 
the contractor will be dealing throughout the life of the contract.
    (c) The contracting officer must depend on program, technical, and 
other

[[Page 120]]

personnel for assistance and advice in monitoring the contractor's 
performance, and in other areas of postaward administration. The 
contracting officer must assure that responsibilities assigned to these 
personnel are understood and carried out. The individual roles and 
corresponding responsibilities typically involve, but are not limited 
to, the following:
    (1) The role of program and technical personnel in monitoring the 
contract to assist or advise the contracting officer (or act as his/her 
representative when so designated by the contracting officer) in 
activities such as:
    (i) Providing technical monitoring during contract performance, and 
issuing letters to the contractor and contracting officer relating to 
delivery acceptance, or rejection in accordance with the terms of the 
contract;
    (ii) Assessing contractor performance, including inspection and 
testing of products and evaluation of reports and data;
    (iii) Recommending necessary changes to the schedule of work and 
period of performance in order to accomplish the objectives of the 
contract. This shall be accomplished by a written request to the 
contracting officer, together with an appropriate justification and 
funds availability citation;
    (iv) Reviewing invoices/vouchers and recommending approval/
disapproval action by the contracting officer, to include comments 
regarding anything unusual discovered in the review;
    (v) Reviewing and recommending approval or disapproval of 
subcontracts, overtime, travel, and key personnel changes; and
    (vi) Participating, as necessary, in various phases of the contract 
closeout process.
    (2) The role of the project officer in performing required aspects 
of the contract monitoring process. In addition to those applicable 
activities set forth in (c)(1) above, the project officer shall:
    (i) Submit periodic reports to the contracting officer that 
concisely explain the status of the contract, and include recommended 
actions for any problems reported. Provide the contracting officer with 
written notification of evaluation and approval/disapproval of contract 
deliverables and of completion of tasks or phases. The contracting 
officer will, in turn, provide the contractor with written notification 
of approval or disapproval unless the responsibility has been delegated 
by the contracting officer, in which case the person responsible for 
such action will notify the contractor and provide a copy to the 
contracting officer for inclusion in the contract file;
    (ii) Monitor the technical aspects of the contractor's business and 
technical progress, identify existing and potential problems that 
threaten performance, and immediately inform the contracting officer of 
deviations from contract objectives, or from any technical or delivery 
requirements, so that remedial measures may be instituted accordingly;
    (iii) Provide immediate notification to the head of the program 
office responsible for the program whenever it is determined that 
program objectives are not being met, together with specific 
recommendations of action to be taken. A copy of the project officer's 
report and recommendations shall be transmitted to the contracting 
officer for appropriate action;
    (iv) Submit, within 120 days after contract completion, a final 
assessment report to the contracting officer. The report should include 
an analysis of the contractor's performance, including the contract and 
program objectives achieved and missed. A copy of the final assessment 
report shall be forwarded to the head of the program office responsible 
for the program for management review and followup, as necessary; and
    (v) Accompany and/or provide, when requested, technical support to 
the HHS auditor in the conduct of floor checks.
    (3) The role of the contract administrator, auditor, cost analyst, 
and property administrator in assisting or advising the contracting 
officer in postaward administration activities such as:
    (i) Evaluation of contractor systems and procedures, to include 
accounting policies and procedures, purchasing policies and practices, 
property accounting and control, wage and salary

[[Page 121]]

plans and rate structures, personnel policies and practices, etc.;
    (ii) Processing of disputes under the Disputes clause and any 
resultant appeals;
    (iii) Modification or termination of the contract; and
    (iv) Determination of the allowability of cost charges to incentive 
or cost-reimbursement type contracts and progress payments under fixed-
price contracts. This is especially important when award is made to new 
organizations or those with financial weaknesses.
    (d) The contracting officer is responsible for assuring that 
contractor performance and contract monitoring are carried out in 
conformance with contract provisions. If performance is not satisfactory 
or if problems are anticipated, it is essential that the contracting 
officer take immediate action to protect the Government's rights under 
the contract. The contracting officer shall notify his/her immediate 
supervisor of problems that cannot be resolved within contract 
limitations and whenever contract or program objectives are not met. The 
notification shall include a statement of action being taken by the 
contracting officer.
    (e) Contract cost and manpower reporting shall be required on all 
cost-reimbursement type contracts financed under letter of credit or 
Departmental Federal Assistance Financing System (DFAFS) methods of 
payment regardless of dollar value, and on all other cost-reimbursement 
type contracts of $100,000 or more. Financial reporting may be required 
on cost-reimbursement contracts under $100,000, when financed by other 
than the letter of credit or DFAFS methods, but only if it is necessary 
for effective contract administration. Financial and manpower 
information may be submitted either as a separate contract financial 
report or as an addendum to a public voucher, as prescribed by the 
contracting officer. Frequency, format (including instructions), extent, 
structure (including cost elements and labor categories), and 
distribution of reporting fall within the discretion of the contracting 
officer. The contracting officer shall set forth financial reporting 
requirements in all applicable RFPs and contracts, shall limit the 
requirements to those necessary for effectual cost and manpower 
management of the contract, and shall avoid the use of reporting 
requirements that are unduly burdensome on the contractor.

FR 47750, Nov. 16, 1989]


<R05>
342.7003  Withholding of contract payments.


<R05>
342.7003-1  Policy.

    (a) All solicitations and resultant contracts shall contain a 
withholding of contract payments clause and an excusable delays clause 
or a clause which incorporates the definition of excusable delays. These 
clauses are contained in the Department's contract general provisions.
    (b) The transmittal letter used to convey the contract to each 
contractor shall contain a notice which highlights the contractor's 
agreement with the withholding of contract payments clause.
    (c) No contract payment shall be made when any report required to be 
submitted by the contractor is overdue, or the contractor fails to 
perform or deliver work or services as required by the contract.
    (d) The contracting officer shall issue a ten-day cure notice or 
initiate appropriate termination action for any failure in the 
contractor's performance as stated in the preceding paragraph (c).


<R05>
342.7003-2  Procedures.

    (a) The contracting officer is responsible for initiating immediate 
action to protect the Government's rights whenever the contractor fails 
to comply with either the delivery or reporting provisions of the 
contract. Compliance with the reporting provisions includes those 
reports to be submitted directly to the payment office. If such a report 
is not submitted on time, the contracting officer is to be notified 
promptly by the payment office.
    (b) When the contract contains a termination for default clause, the 
contractor's failure to either submit any required report when due or 
perform or deliver services or work when required by the contract is to 
be considered a

[[Page 122]]

default in performance. In either circumstance, the contracting officer 
is to immediately issue a formal ten-day cure notice pursuant to the 
default clause. The cure notice is to follow the format prescribed in 
FAR 49.607 and is to include a statement to the effect that contract 
payments will be withheld if the default is not cured or is not 
determined to be excusable.
    (1) If the default is cured or is determined to be excusable, the 
contracting officer is not to initiate the withholding action.
    (2) If the default is not determined to be excusable or a response 
is not received within the allotted time, the contracting officer is to 
initiate withholding action on all contract payments and is to determine 
whether termination for default or other action would be in the best 
interest of the Government.
    (c) When the contract does not contain a termination for default 
clause, the contractor's failure to either submit any required report 
when due or perform or deliver services or work when required by the 
contract is to be considered a failure to perform. In either 
circumstance, the contracting officer is to immediately issue a written 
notice to the contractor specifying the failure and providing a period 
of ten days, or a longer period as determined necessary by the 
contracting officer, in which the contractor is to cure the failure or 
establish an excusable delay. The contracting officer is to include a 
statement in the written notice to the effect that contract payments 
will be withheld if the failure is not cured or is not determined to be 
excusable.
    (1) If the failure is cured or is determined to be excusable, the 
contracting officer is not to initiate the withholding action.
    (2) If the failure is not determined to be excusable or a response 
is not received within the allotted time, the contracting officer is to 
initiate withholding action on all contract payments and is to determine 
whether termination for convenience or other action would be in the best 
interest of the Government.
    (d) The contracting officer should consult FAR Subpart 49.4 for 
further guidance before taking any of the actions described in this 
section.


<R05>
342.7003-3  Withholding payments.

    (a) When making the determination that contract payments should be 
withheld in accordance with the Withholding of Contract Payments clause, 
the contracting officer is to immediately notify the servicing finance 
office in writing of the determination to suspend payments. The notice 
of suspension is to contain all elements of information required by the 
payment office to properly identify the contract and the applicable 
accounts involved.
    (b) The contracting officer is to immediately notify the contractor 
in writing that payments have been suspended until the default or 
failure is cured.
    (c) When the contractor cures the default or failure, the 
contracting officer is to immediately notify, in writing, all recipients 
of the notice of suspension that the suspension is to be lifted and 
contract payments are to be resumed.
    (d) When exercising actions regarding the withholding of payment 
procedures, the contracting officer must be careful not to waive any of 
the Government's rights when corresponding with the contractor or when 
taking any other actions.


<R04>
        Subpart 342.71--Administrative Actions for Cost Overruns


<R05>
342.7100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth the procedures to be followed when a cost 
overrun is anticipated; i.e., the allowable actual cost of performing a 
cost-reimbursement type contract is expected to exceed the total 
estimated cost specified in the contract.


<R05>
342.7101  Applicability.

    This subpart applies to the administration of cost-reimbursement 
type contracts and the cost-reimbursement portion of other types of 
contracts. Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to relieve 
contractors from compliance with the Limitation of Cost clause or any 
other provisions of contracts.

[[Page 123]]


<R05>
342.7102  General.

    Reimbursement for costs incurred under cost-reimbursement contracts 
shall not exceed the amount of funds obligated by the contract, unless 
increased by the contracting officer. Cost overruns shall be held to an 
absolute minimum, compatible with accomplishment of the statement of 
work.


<R05>
342.7103  Contract administration.


<R05>
342.7103-1  General.

    Upon receipt of information that a contractor's accumulated cost and 
projected expenditures will exceed the limit of funds obligated by the 
contract, the contracting officer shall coordinate immediately with the 
appropriate program office to determine whether the contract should be 
modified or terminated. If the contracting officer receives information 
from a source other than the contractor that a cost overrun is 
anticipated, the contracting officer shall verify the information with 
the contractor, and remind the contractor of the notification 
requirements of the Limitation of Cost clause.


<R05>
342.7103-2  Procedures.

    (a) Upon notification that a cost overrun is anticipated, the 
contracting officer shall inform the contractor to submit a request for 
additional funds which is to include:
    (1) Name and address of contractor.
    (2) Contract number and expiration date.
    (3) Contract item(s) and amount(s) creating the overrun.
    (4) The elements of cost which changed from the original estimate 
(i.e., labor, material, travel, overhead, etc.) to be furnished in the 
following format:
    (i) Original estimate,
    (ii) Costs incurred to date,
    (iii) Estimated cost to completion,
    (iv) Revised estimate, and
    (v) Amount of adjustment.
    (5) The factors responsible for the increase, i.e., error in 
estimate, changed conditions, etc.
    (6) The latest date by which funds must be available for commitment 
to avoid contract slippage, work stoppage, or other program impairment.
    (b) When the contractor submits a notice of an impending overrun, 
the contracting officer shall:
    (1) Immediately advise the appropriate program office and furnish a 
copy of the notice and any other data received;
    (2) Request audit or cost advisory services, and technical support, 
as necessary, for evaluation of information and data received; and
    (3) Maintain continuous follow-up with the program office in order 
to obtain a timely decision as to whether the work under the contract 
should be continued and additional funds provided, or the contract 
terminated. The decision of the program office must be supported by an 
appropriate written statement and funding authority, or a formal request 
for termination, when applicable. After a programming and funding 
decision is received from the program office, the contracting officer 
shall promptly notify the contractor in writing that:
    (i) A specified amount of additional funds has been allotted to the 
contract by a contractual instrument; or
    (ii) Work will be discontinued when the funds allotted to the 
contract have been exhausted, and that any work performed after that 
date is at the contractor's risk; or
    (iii) The Government is considering whether additional funds should 
be allotted to the contract and will notify the contractor as soon as 
possible, but that any work performed after the funds then allocated to 
the contract have been exhausted is at the contractor's risk.

Timely, formal notification of the Government's intention is essential 
in order to preclude loss of contractual rights in the event of dispute, 
termination, or litigation.
    (c) If program requirements permit, contracting officers should 
refrain from issuing any contractual documents which will require new 
work or an extension of time, pending resolution of an overrun or 
additional fund request.


<R05>
342.7104  Contract modifications.

    (a) Modifications to contracts containing the Limitation of Cost 
clause shall include either:

[[Page 124]]

    (1) A provision increasing the estimated or ceiling amount referred 
to in the Limitation of Cost clause of the contract and stating that the 
clause will thereafter apply in respect to the increase amount; or
    (2) A provision stating that the estimated or ceiling amount 
referred to in the contract is not changed by the modification and that 
the Limitation of Cost clause will continue to apply with respect to the 
amount in effect prior to the modification.
    (b) A fixed-fee provided in a contract shall not be changed when 
funding a cost overrun. Changes in fixed-fee will be made only to 
reflect changes in the scope of work which justify an increase or 
decrease in fee.

<R05>
345.370  Providing Government property (in general).

    (a) A contractor may be provided Government property or allowed to 
acquire such property at Government expense upon determination that:
    (1) No practicable or economical alternative exists; e.g., 
acquisition from other sources, utilization of subcontractors, rental of 
property, or modification of program project requirements, etc.;
    (2) The Government receives adequate consideration for providing the 
property; or
    (3) Furnishing Government property is likely to result in 
substantially lower cost to the Government for the items produced or 
services rendered when all costs involved (e.g., transportation, 
installation, modification, maintenance, etc.) are compared with the 
cost to the Government of the contractor's use of privately-owned 
property.
    (b) The determination that it is necessary to provide a contractor 
or subcontractor with property will be made by the contracting officer 
with the advice of the agency property official.
    (c) If the program office is aware, prior to the submission of the 
request for contract, that it will be necessary to provide prospective 
contractors with property, a written justification must accompany the 
request for contract to the contracting activity.


<R04>
     Subpart 345.4--Contractor Use and Rental of Government Property


<R05>
345.405  Contracts with foreign governments or international organizations.

    Upon the request of a foreign government or international 
organization, or a contractor certifying that it is acting on behalf of 
a foreign government or international organization, the contracting 
officer, with advice from the agency property official cognizant of 
Government property located in the United States, its possessions, or 
Puerto Rico, may give written approval for its use without charge on 
contracts or subcontracts thereunder if:
    (a) The foreign government or international organization would be 
authorized to place the contract with the activity concerned under the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, or such use is authorized by 
an agreement with the foreign government;
    (b) The foreign government's placement of the contract directly with 
the contractor is consistent with the best interests of the United 
States;
    (c) It appears that the foreign government will place the contract 
with the contractor whether or not use is authorized, and no competitive 
pricing advantage will accrue to the contractor by virtue of its use;
    (d) The contractor agrees that no charge for the use of the property 
will

[[Page 125]]

be included in the price charged the foreign government under the 
contract; and
    (e) The use will not interfere with foreseeable requirements of the 
United States.

352.216-70  Negotiated overhead rates--fixed.

    Insert the following clause in all cost-reimbursement contracts with 
educational institutions and nonprofit organizations when fixed rates 
subject to carryforward adjustments are used.

               Negotiated Overhead Rates--Fixed (APR 1984)

    (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of the clause entitled 
``Allowable Cost and Payment,'' the allowable indirect costs under this 
contract shall be obtained by applying negotiated fixed overhead rates 
for the applicable period(s) to bases agreed upon by the parties, as 
specified below. A negotiated fixed rate(s) is based on an estimate of 
the costs which will be incurred during the period for which the rate(s) 
applies. When the application of the negotiated fixed rates against the 
actual bases during a given fiscal period produces an amount greater or 
less than the indirect costs determined for such period, such greater or 
lesser amount(s) will be carried forward to a subsequent period.
    (b) The Contractor, as soon as possible but no later than six months 
after the close of its fiscal year, or such other period as may be 
specified in the contract, shall submit to the Secretary or the duly 
authorized representative, with a copy to the cognizant audit activity, 
a proposed fixed overhead rate or rates based on the Contractor's actual 
cost experience during the fiscal year, including adjustment, if any, 
for amounts carried forward, together with supporting cost data. 
Negotiation of fixed overhead rates, including carryforward adjustments, 
if any, by the Contractor and the Secretary, or the duly authorized 
representative, shall be undertaken as promptly as practicable after 
receipt of the Contractor's proposal.
    (c) Allowability of costs and acceptability of cost allocation 
methods shall be determined in accordance with Part 31 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) as in effect on the date of this contract.
    (d) The results of each negotiation shall be set forth in an 
amendment to this contract, which shall specify: (1) The agreed fixed 
overhead rates, (2) the bases to which the rates apply, (3) the fiscal 
year, unless the parties agreed to a different period, for which the 
rates apply, and (4) the specific items treated as direct costs or any 
changes in the items previously agreed to be direct costs.
    (e) Pending establishment of fixed overhead rates for any fiscal 
year or different period agreed to by the parties, the Contractor shall 
be reimbursed either at the rates fixed for the previous fiscal year or 
other period or at billing rates acceptable to the Contracting Officer, 
subject to appropriate adjustment when the final rates for that fiscal 
year or other period are established.
    (f) Any failure of the parties to agree on any fixed overhead rate 
or rates or to the amount of any carryforward adjustment under this 
clause shall not be considered a dispute concerning a question of fact 
for decision by the Contracting Officer within the meaning of the 
``Disputes'' clause of this contract. If for any fiscal year or other 
period specified in the contract, the parties fail to agree to a fixed 
overhead rate or rates, it is agreed that the allowable indirect costs 
under this contract shall be obtained by applying negotiated final 
overhead rates in accordance with the terms of the ``Allowable Cost and 
Payment'' clause set forth in FAR 52.216-7, as in effect on the date of 
this contract.
    (g) Submission of proposed fixed, provisional, and/or final overhead 
rates, together with appropriate data in support thereof, to the 
Secretary or the duly authorized representative and agreements on fixed, 
provisional, and/or final overhead rates entered into between the 
Contractor and the Secretary or the duly authorized representative, as 
evidenced by Negotiated Overhead Rate Agreements signed by both parties, 
shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b), (d), and 
(e), of this clause.

    As prescribed in 316.307(j), insert the following clause in all 
solicitations and resultant cost-reimbursement contracts with nonprofit 
organizations, as identified in OMB Circular A-122.

                  Additional Cost Principles (OCT 1990)

    (a) Bid and proposal costs. (1) Bid and proposal costs are the 
immediate costs of preparing bids, proposals, and applications for 
potential Federal and non-Federal contracts, grants, and agreements, 
including the development of scientific, cost, and other data needed to 
support the bids, proposals, and applications.
    (2) Bid and proposal costs of the current accounting period are 
allowable as indirect costs.
    (3) Bid and proposal costs of past accounting periods are 
unallowable in the current period. However, if the organization's 
established practice is to treat these costs by some other method, they 
may be accepted if they are found to be reasonable and equitable.
    (4) Bid and proposal costs do not include independent research and 
development costs covered by the following paragraph, or

[[Page 129]]

preaward costs covered by paragraph 33 of Attachment B to OMB Circular 
A-122.
    (b) Independent research and development costs. (1) Independent 
research and development is research and development conducted by an 
organization which is not sponsored by Federal or non-Federal contracts, 
grants, or other agreements.
    (2) Independent research and development shall be allocated its 
proportionate share of indirect costs on the same basis as the 
allocation of indirect costs to sponsored research and development.
    (3) The costs of independent research and development, including its 
proportionate share of indirect costs, are unallowable.

    The following clause is covered by the policy set forth in subpart 
324.70 and is to be used in accordance with the instructions set forth

information or data of a personal nature about an individual, or (2) 
proprietary information or data submitted by or pertaining to an 
institution or organization.
    (b) In addition to the types of confidential information described 
in (a)(1) and (2) above, information which might require special 
consideration with regard to the timing of its disclosure may derive 
from studies or research, during which public disclosure of preliminary 
unvalidated findings could create erroneous conclusions which might 
threaten public health or safety if acted upon.
    (c) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor may, by mutual 
consent, identify elsewhere in this contract specific information and/or 
categories of information which the Government will furnish to the 
Contractor or that the Contractor is expected to generate which is 
confidential. Similarly, the Contracting Officer and the Contractor may, 
by mutual consent, identify such confidential information from time to 
time during the performance of the contract. Failure to agree will be 
settled pursuant to the ``Disputes'' clause.
    (d) If it is established elsewhere in this contract that information 
to be utilized under this contract, or a portion thereof, is subject to 
the Privacy, Act, the Contractor will follow the rules and procedures of 
disclosure set forth in the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and 
implementing regulations and policies, with respect to systems of 
records determined to be subject to the Privacy Act.
    (e) Confidential information, as defined in (a)(1) and (2) above, 
that is information or data of a personal nature about an individual, or 
proprietary information or data submitted by or pertaining to an 
institution or organization, shall not be disclosed without the prior 
written consent of the individual, institution, or organization.
    (f) Written advance notice of at least 45 days will be provided to 
the Contracting Officer of the Contractor's intent to release findings 
of studies or research, which have the possibility of adverse effects on 
the public or the Federal agency, as described in (b) above. If the 
Contracting Officer does not pose any objections in writing within the 
45-day period, the Contractor may proceed with disclosure. Disagreements 
not resolved by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer will be 
settled pursuant to the ``Disputes'' clause.
    (g) Whenever the Contractor is uncertain with regard to the proper 
handling of material under the contract, or if the material in question 
is subject to the Privacy Act or is confidential information subject to 
the provisions of this clause, the Contractor should obtain a written 
determination from the Contracting Officer prior to any release, 
disclosure, dissemination, or publication.
    (h) Contracting Officer determinations will reflect the results of 
internal coordination with appropriate program and legal officials.
    (i) The provisions of paragraph (e) of this clause shall not apply 
when the information is subject to conflicting or overlapping provisions 
in other Federal, State or local laws.

or in paragraph (h) of this clause (if the clause has a paragraph (h)), 
the Contractor shall provide and maintain workers' compensation,

comprehensive automobile liability (bodily injury and property damage) 
insurance, and such other insurance as the Contracting Officer may 
require under this contract.
    (2) The Contractor may, with the approval of the Contracting

amount and for those periods as the Contracting Officer may require or 
approve and with insurers approved by the Contracting Officer.
    (b) The Contractor agrees to submit for the Contracting Officer's 
approval, to the extent and in the manner required by the Contracting 
Officer, any other insurance that is maintained by the Contractor in 
connection with performance of this contract and for which the 
Contractor seeks reimbursement.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this clause (if the 
clause has a paragraph (h)), the Contractor shall be reimbursed--

clause; and
    (2) For certain liabilities (and expenses incidental to such 
liabilities) to third persons not compensated by insurance or otherwise 
within the funds available under the Limitation of Cost or the 
Limitation of Funds clause of this contract. These liabilities must 
arise out of the performance of this contract, whether or not caused by 
the negligence of the Contractor or of the Contractor's agents, 
servants, or employees, and must be represented by final judgments or 
settlements approved in writing by the Government. These liabilities are 
for--

limited to the amounts reflected in final judgments, or settlements 
approved in writing by the Government, but in no event to exceed the

clause of this contract. Nothing in this contract shall be construed as 
implying that, at a later date, the Government will request, or the 
Congress will appropriate, funds sufficient to meet any deficiencies.
    (e) The Contractor shall not be reimbursed for liabilities (and 
expenses incidental to such liabilities)--
    (1) For which the Contractor is otherwise responsible under the 
express terms of any clause specified in the Schedule or elsewhere in

one plant or separate location in which this contract is being 
performed; or
    (iii) A separate and complete major industrial operation in 
connection with the performance of this contract.
    (f) The provisions of paragraph (e) of this clause shall not 
restrict the right of the Contractor to be reimbursed for the cost of 
insurance maintained by the Contractor in connection with the 
performance of this contract, other than insurance required in 
accordance with this clause: Provided, That such cost is allowable under 
the Allowable Cost and Payment clause of this contract.
    (g) If any suit or action is filed or any claim is made against the 
Contractor, the cost and expense of which may be reimbursable to the 
Contractor under this contract, and the risk of which is then uninsured 
or is insured for less than the amount claimed, the Contractor shall--
    (1) Immediately notify the Contracting Officer and promptly furnish 
copies of all pertinent papers received;

for the insurance carrier in settling or defending the claim when the 
amount of the liability claimed exceeds the amount of coverage; and
    (3) Authorize Government representatives to settle or defend the 
claim and to represent the Contractor in or to take charge of any 
litigation, if required by the Government, when the liability is not 
insured or covered by bond. The Contractor may, at its own expense, be 
associated with the Government representatives in any such claim or 
litigation.

The Contractor shall be reimbursed for the cost of such insurance and, 
to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, to liabilities 
to third persons for which the contractor has obtained insurance 
coverage as provided in this paragraph, but for which such coverage is 
insufficient in amount.

                             (End of clause)

at 52.228-6, Insurance-Immunity from Tort Liability, and the successful 
offeror represents in the offer that the offeror is totally immune from 
tort liability as a State agency or as a charitable institution, 
substitute the following paragraphs (a) and (b) for paragraphs (a) 
through (g) of the basic clause:

nor will the Government reimburse the Contractor for its liability to 
third persons, with respect to loss due to death, bodily injury, or

    Notwithstanding any other payment provisions of this contract, 
failure of the Contractor to submit required reports when due or failure 
to perform or deliver required work, supplies, or services, will result 
in the withholding of payments under this contract unless such failure 
arises out of causes beyond the control, and without the fault or

following clause shall be used: (See 332.406 for further instructions 
regarding use of the clause.)

             Method of payment--letter of credit (APR 1984)

    (a) The Contractor shall be paid with funds made available under the 
Federal Reserve Letter of Credit No. ____, established by ____________ 
Department of Health and Human Services, against which the Contractor 
will withdraw funds pursuant to Federal Reserve Letter of Credit 
procedures contained in Treasury Department Circular 1075 (31 CFR part 
205).
    (b) At the request of the Contractor and subject to the following 
conditions, the Government shall make an advance payment, or advance 
payments, from time to time, to the Contractor. No advance payment shall 
be made: (1) Without the approval of the office administering advance 
payments (hereinafter called the ``Administering Office'' and designated 
in paragraph (g)(2)) as to the financial necessity therefor (except in 
the case of educational institutions); (2) in an amount which, together 
with all advance payments made, exceeds the contract amount; and (3) 
without a properly certified invoice. The Contractor shall (1) initiate 
cash drawdowns only when actually needed for its disbursements, (2) 
report timely the case disbursements and balances as required by the 
Administering Office, and (3) impose the same standards of timing and 
amount upon any subcontractors including the furnishing of reports of 
cash disbursements and balances. Failure to adhere to these material 
provisions will be considered an event under paragraph (f) of this 
clause.
    (c) The funds drawn by the Contractor against the Federal Reserve 
Letter of Credit shall be only for current allowable expenditures 
necessary for the performance of this contract.
    (d) When requested in writing by the Contracting Officer, the 
Contractor shall repay to the Government such part of the unliquidated 
balance of the advance payments as shall, in the opinion of the 
Contracting Officer, be in excess of the Contractor's current needs or 
in excess of the contract price.
    (e) If, upon completion or termination of this contract, all amounts 
obtained by the Contractor under this letter of credit have not been 
fully liquidated by authorized charges under the contract, the balance 
thereof shall be deducted from any sums otherwise due to the Contractor 
from the Government, and any excess funds shall be repaid by the 
Contractor to the Government upon demand.
    (f) Upon the happening of any of the following events of default: 
(1) A finding by the Administering Office that the Contractor (i) has 
failed to observe any of the covenants, conditions, or warranties of 
these provisions or has failed to comply with any material provisions of 
this contract, or (ii) has so failed to make progress, or is in such 
unsatisfactory financial condition, as to endanger performance of this 
contract, or (iii) has allocated inventory to this contract 
substantially exceeding reasonable requirements, or (iv) is delinquent 
in payment of taxes or of the costs of performance of this contract in 
the ordinary course of business; (2) appointment of a trustee, receiver 
or liquidator for all or a substantial part of the Contractor's 
property, or institution of bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement or 
liquidation proceedings by or against the Contractor; (3) service of any 
writ of attachment, levy of execution, or commencement of garnishment 
proceedings; or (4) the commission of an act of bankruptcy; the 
Government, without limiting any rights it may otherwise have, may, in 
its discretion and upon written notice to the Contractor, withhold 
further withdrawals under the Letter of Credit and withhold further 
payments on this contract. Payment can also be stopped for lack of 
submission of timely and accurate reports in accordance with contract 
requirements. Upon the continuance of any such events of default for a 
period of thirty (30) days after such written notice to the Contractor, 
the Government may, in its discretion, and without limiting any other 
rights which the Government may have, take the following additional 
actions as it may deem appropriate in the circumstances:
    (1) Charge interest on advance payments outstanding during the 
period of any such default at the rate established by the Secretary of 
the Treasury pursuant to Public Law 92-41, 80 Stat. 97 for the 
Renegotiation Board;
    (2) Demand immediate repayment of the unliquidated balance of 
advance payments hereunder; and/or
    (3) Take possession of and, with or without advertisement, sell at 
public sale at which the Government may be purchaser, or at a private 
sale, all or any part of the property

[[Page 133]]

on which the Government has a lien under this contract, and after 
deducting any expenses incident to such sale, apply the net proceeds of 
such sale in reduction of the unliquidated balance of advance payments 
hereunder and in reduction of any other claims of the Government against 
the Contractor.
    (g)(1) No interest shall be charged for advance payments made 
hereunder, except interest during a period of default as provided in 
paragraph (f)(2). The Contractor shall charge interest at the rate 
established by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Public Law 92-
41 85 Stat. 97 for the Renegotiation Board on subadvances or 
downpayments to subcontractors and such interest will be credited to the 
account of the Government. However, interest need not be charged on 
subadvances on subcontracts with educational or research institutions 
provided such subcontracts are awarded without profit or fee for 
research, development or experimental work.

    The following provision shall be included in all requests for 
proposals whenever the use of incremental funding is contemplated:

                     Incremental Funding (APR 1984)

    (a) Sufficient funds are not presently available to cover the total 
cost of the complete multiple year project described in this 
solicitation. However, it is the Government's intention to negotiate and 
award a contract using the incremental funding concepts described in the 
clause entitled Limitation of Funds. Under that clause, which will be 
included in the resultant contract, initial funds will be obligated 
under the contract to cover the first year of performance. Additional 
funds are intended to be allotted to the contract by contract 
modification, up to and including the full estimated cost of the 
contract, to accomplish the entire project. While it is the Government's 
intention to progressively fund this contract over the entire period of 
performance up to and including the full estimated cost, the Government 
will not be obligated to reimburse the Contractor for costs incurred in 
excess of the periodic allotments, nor will the Contractor be obligated 
to perform in excess of the amount allotted.
    (b) The Limitation of Funds clause to be included in the resultant 
contract shall supersede the Limitation of Cost clause found in the 
General Provisions.

    The Contractor shall give the Contracting Officer immediate notice 
in writing of (a) any action, including any proceeding before an 
administrative agency, filed against the Contractor arising out of the 
performance of this contract, including, but not limited to the 
performance of any subcontract hereunder; and (b) any claim against the 
Contractor the cost and expense of which is allowable under the clause 
entitled ``Allowable Cost and Payment.'' Except as otherwise directed by 
the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish immediately to the 
Contracting Officer copies of all pertinent papers received by the 
Contractor with respect to such action or claim. To the extent not in 
conflict with any applicable policy of insurance, the Contractor may, 
with the Contracting Officer's approval, settle any such action or 
claim. If required by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall (a) 
effect an assignment and subrogation in favor of the Government of all 
the Contractor's rights and claims (except those against the

[[Page 134]]

Government) arising out of any such action or claim against the 
Contractors; and (b) authorize representatives of the Government to 
settle or defend any such action or claim and to represent the 
Contractor in, or to take charge of, any action. If the settlement or 
defense of an action or claim is undertaken by the Government, the 
Contractor shall furnish all reasonable assistance in effecting a 
settlement or asserting a defense. Where an action against the 
Contractor is not covered by a policy of insurance, the Contractor 
shall, with the approval of the Contracting Officer, proceed with the 
defense of the action in good faith. The Government shall not be liable 
for the expense of defending any action or for any costs resulting from 
the loss thereof to the extent that the Contractor would have been 
compensated by insurance which was required by law or regulation or by 
written direction of the Contracting Officer, but which the Contractor 
failed to secure through its own fault or negligence.
    In any event, unless otherwise expressly provided in this contract, 
the Contractor shall not be reimbursed or indemnified by the Government 
for any liability loss, cost or expense, which the Contractor may incur 
or be subject to by reason of any loss, injury, or damage, to the person 
or to real or personal property of any third parties as may accrue 
during, or arise from, the performance of this contract.

    (a) Except with respect to failures of subcontractors, the 
Contractor shall not be considered to have failed in performance of this 
contract if such failure arises out of causes beyond the control and 
without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.
    (b) Such causes may include, but are not restricted to, acts of God 
or of the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign 
or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine 
restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, and unusually severe weather, 
but in every case the failure to perform must be beyond the control and 
without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. If the failure to 
perform is caused by the failure of a subcontractor to perform, and if 
such failure arises out of causes beyond the control of both the 
Contractor and subcontractor, and without the fault or negligence of 
either of them, the Contractor shall not be deemed to have failed in 
performance of the contract, unless: (1) The supplies or services to be 
furnished by the subcontractor were obtainable from other sources, (2) 
The Contracting Officer shall have ordered the Contractor in writing to 
procure such supplies or services from such other sources, and (3) The 
Contractor shall have failed to comply reasonably with such order. Upon 
request of the Contractor, the Contracting Officer shall ascertain the 
facts and extent of such failure and, if he/she shall determine that any 
failure to perform was occasioned by any one or more of the said causes, 
the delivery schedule shall be revised accordingly, subject to the 
rights of the Government under the termination clause hereof. (As used 
in this clause, the terms ``subcontractor'' and ``subcontractors'' mean 
subcontractor(s) at any tier.)

    The following clause is to be used in accordance with 370.102:

  Accessibility of Meetings, Conferences, and Seminars to Persons with 
                         Disabilities (APR 1984)

    The Contractor agrees as follows:
    (a) Planning. The Contractor will develop a plan to assure that any 
meeting, conference, or seminar held pursuant to this contract will meet 
or exceed the minimum accessibility standards set forth below. This plan 
shall include a provision for ascertaining the number and types of 
disabled individuals planning to attend the meeting, conference, or 
seminar. The plan shall be submitted to the project officer for approval 
prior to initiating action. (A consolidated or master plan for contracts 
requiring numerous meetings, conferences, or seminars may be submitted 
in lieu of separate plans.)
    (b) Facilities. Any facility to be utilized for meetings, 
conferences, or seminars in performance of this contract shall be 
accessible to persons with disabilities. The Contractor shall determine, 
by an on-site inspection if necessary, that the following minimum 
accessibility requirements are met, or suitable modifications are made 
to meet these requirements, before the meeting:
    (1) Parking. (i) Where parking is available on or adjacent to the 
site, one 12' wide space must be set aside for the care of each mobility 
impaired attendee. The space need not be permanently striped but may be 
temporarily marked by signs, ropes, or other means satisfactory to carry 
out this provision.
    (ii) Where parking is not available on or adjacent to the site, 
valet parking or other alternative means to assist a person who has a 
mobility impairment may be used. Alternate means must be satisfactory in 
the judgment of the Government project officer.
    (2) Entrances. (i) ``Entrances'' shall include at least one 
accessible entrance from the street/sidewalk level, and at least one 
accessible entrance from any available parking facility.
    (ii) The entrance shall be level or accessible by ramp with an 
incline that allows independent negotiation by a person in a wheelchair. 
In general, the slope of the incline shall be no more than 1'' rise per 
foot of ramp length (1:12).
    (iii) Entrance doorways shall be at least 30'' in clear width and 
capable of operation by persons with disabilities. Revolving doors, 
regardless of foldback capability, will not meet this requirement.
    (3) Meeting Rooms. (i) Meeting room access from the main entrance 
area must be level or at an independently negotiable incline 
(approximately 1:12) and/or served by elevators from the main entrance 
level. All elevators shall be capable of accommodating a wheelchair 29'' 
wide by 45'' long.
    (ii) Meeting rooms shall be on one level or, if on different levels, 
capable of being reached by elevators or by ramps that can be 
independently negotiated by a person in a wheelchair. Doorways to all 
meeting rooms shall be at least 30'' in clear width.
    (iii) The interior of the meeting room shall be on one level or 
ramped so as to be independently negotiable for a person in a 
wheelchair.
    (iv) Stages, speaker platforms, etc. which are to be used by persons 
in wheelchairs must be accessible by ramps or lifts. When used, the 
ramps may not necessarily be independently negotiable if space does not 
permit. However, any slope over 1:12 must be approved by the project 
officer. Each case is to be judged on its own merits.
    (v) If a meeting room with fixed seating is utilized, seating 
arrangements for persons in wheelchairs shall be made so that these 
persons are incorporated into the group rather than isolated on the 
perimeter of the group.
    (4) Restrooms. (i) Restrooms shall have level access, signs 
indicating accessibility, and doorways at least 30'' in clear width.
    (ii) Sufficient turning space within restrooms shall be provided for 
independent use by a person in a wheelchair 29'' wide by 45'' long. A 
space 60'' by 60'' or 63'' by 56'' of unobstructed floor space as 
measured 12'' above the floor is acceptable by standard; other layouts 
will be accepted if it can be demonstrated that they are usable as 
indicated.
    (iii) There will be a restroom for each sex or a unisex restroom 
with at least one toilet stall capable of accommodating a wheelchair 
29'' wide by 45'' long (by standard, the minimum is 3'-0'' by 4'-8'') 
with outswinging doors or privacy curtains. Wall mounted grab bars are 
required.
    (iv) When separate restrooms have been set up for mobility impaired 
persons, they shall be located adjacent to the regular restrooms and 
shall be fully accessible.
    (5) Eating Facilities. (i) Eating facilities in the meeting facility 
must be accessible under the same general guidelines as are applied to 
meeting rooms.
    (ii) If the eating facility is a cafeteria, the food service area 
(cafeteria line) must allow sufficient room for independent wheelchair 
movement and accessibility to food for persons in wheelchairs, and 
cafeteria staff shall be available to assist disabled persons.
    (6) Overnight Facilities. If overnight accommodations are required:
    (i) Sufficient accessible guest rooms to accommodate each attendee 
who is disabled shall be located in the facility where the meeting, 
conference, or seminar is held, or in a facility housing the attendees 
which is

[[Page 136]]

conveniently located nearby, whichever is satisfactory to the project 
officer.
    (ii) Overnight facilities shall provide for the same minimum 
accessiblity requirements as the facility utilized for the meeting, 
conference, or seminar. In addition, guest room access from the main 
entrance area shall be level, ramped at an independently negotiable 
incline (1:12), and/or served by elevators capable of accommodating a 
wheelchair 29'' wide by 45'' long.
    (iii) Doorways to guest rooms, including the doorway to the 
bathroom, shall be at least 30'' in clear width.
    (iv) Bathrooms shall have wall mounted grab bars at the tub and 
water closet.
    (v) Guest rooms for persons with a disability shall be provided at 
the same rate as a guest room for other attendees.
    (7) Water Fountains. Water fountains shall be accessible to disabled 
persons, or have cup dispensers for use by persons in wheelchairs.
    (c) Provisions of Services for Sensory Impaired Attendees. (1) The 
Contractor, in planning the meeting, conference, or seminar, shall 
include in all announcements and other materials pertaining to the 
meeting, conference, or seminar a notice indicating that services will 
be made available to sensory impaired persons attending the meeting, if 
requested within five (5) days of the date of the meeting, conference, 
or seminar. The announcement(s) and other material(s) shall indicate 
that sensory impaired persons may contact a specific person(s), at a 
specific address and phone number(s), to make their service requirements 
known. The phone number(s) shall include a teletype number for the 
hearing impaired.
    (2) The Contractor shall provide, at no cost to the individual, 
those services required by persons with sensory impairments to insure 
their complete participation in the meeting, conference, or seminar.
    (3) As a minimum, when requested in advance, the Contractor shall 
provide the following services:
    (i) For hearing impaired persons, qualified interpreters. Provisions 
will also be made for volume controlled phone lines and, if necessary, 
transportation to local teletype equipment to enable hearing impaired 
individuals to receive and send meeting related calls. If local teletype 
equipment is not available, the Contractor shall provide on site 
teletype equipment. Also, the meeting rooms will be adequately 
illuminated so signing by interpreters can be easily seen.
    (ii) For vision impaired persons, readers and/or cassette materials, 
as necessary, to enable full participation. Also, meeting rooms will be 
adequately illuminated.
    (iii) Agenda and other conference material(s) shall be translated 
into a usable form for the visually and hearing impaired. Readers, 
braille translations, and/or tape recordings are all acceptable. These 
materials shall be available to sensory impaired individuals upon their 
arrival.
    (4) The Contractor is responsible for making every effort to 
ascertain the number of sensory impaired individuals who plan to attend 
the meeting, conference, or seminar. However, if it can be determined 
that there will be no sensory impaired person (deaf and/or blind) in 
attendance, the provision of those services under paragraph (c) for the 
nonrepresented group, or groups, is not required.

    (a) The Contractor agrees to give preference in employment 
opportunities under this contract to Indians who can perform required 
work, regardless of age (subject to existing laws and regulations), sex, 
religion, or tribal affiliation. To the extent feasible and consistent 
with the efficient performance of this contract, the Contractor further 
agrees to give preference in employment and training opportunities under 
this contract to Indians who are not fully qualified to perform 
regardless of age (subject to existing laws and regulations), sex,

``Equal Opportunity.''
    (d) If no Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises 
are available under reasonable terms and conditions, including price, 
for awarding of subcontracts in connection with the work performed under 
this contract, the Contractor agrees to comply with the provisions of 
this contract involving utilization of small business concerns, small

[[Page 137]]

controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, or 
labor surplus area concerns.
    (e) As used in this clause:
    (1) ``Indian'' means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe. If

    (2) ``Indian Tribe'' means an Indian Tribe, pueblo, band, nation, or 
other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village 
or regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant 
to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 
1601) which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and 
services provided by the United States to Indians because of their 
status as Indians.
    (3) ``Indian organization'' means the governing body of any Indian 
Tribe or entity established or recognized by such governing body in 
accordance with the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 77; 25 U.S.C. 
1451); and
    (4) ``Indian-owned economic enterprise'' means any Indian-owned 
commercial, industrial, or business activity established or organized 
for the purpose of profit, provided that such Indian ownership shall 
constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise, and that 
ownership shall encompass active operation and control of the 
enterprise.
    (f) The Contractor agrees to include the provisions of this clause, 
including this paragraph (f), in each subcontract awarded at any tier 
under this contract.
    (g) In the event of noncompliance with this clause, the Contracting 
Officer may terminate the contract in whole or in part or may impose any 
other sanctions authorized by law or by other provisions of the 
contract.

    The following clause shall be used as prescribed in 370.202(b):

                  Indian Preference Program (APR 1984)

    (a) In addition to the requirements of the clause of this contract 
entitled ``Indian Preference,'' the Contractor agrees to establish and 
conduct an Indian preference program which will expand opportunities for 
Indians to receive perference for employment and training in connection 
with the work to be performed under this contract, and which will expand 
the opportunities for Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic 
enterprises to receive a preference in the awarding of subcontracts. In 
this connection, the Contractor shall:
    (1) Designate a liaison officer who will (i) Maintain liaison with 
the Government and the Tribe(s) on Indian perference matters; (ii) 
Supervise compliance with the provisions of this clause; and (iii) 
Administer the Contractor's Indian perference program.
    (2) Advise its recruitment sources in writing and include a 
statement in all advertisements for employment that Indian applicants 
will be given preference in employment and training incident to such 
employment.
    (3) Not more than twenty (20) calendar days after award of the 
contract, post a written notice in the Tribal office of any reservations 
on which or near where the work under this contract is to be performed 
that sets forth the Contractor's employment needs and related training 
opportunities. The notice shall include the approximate numbers and 
types of employees needed; the approximate dates of employment; the 
experience or special skills required for employment, if any; training 
opportunities available; and other pertinent information necessary to 
advise prospective employees of any other employment requirements. The 
Contractor shall also request the Tribe(s) on or near whose 
reservation(s) the work is to be performed to provide assistance to the 
Contractor in filling its employment needs and training opportunities. 
The Contracting Officer will advise the Contractor of the name, 
location, and phone number of the Tribal officials to contact in regard 
to the posting of notices and requests for Tribal assistance.
    (4) Establish and conduct a subcontracting program which gives 
preference to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises 
as subcontractors and suppliers under this contract. The Contractor 
shall give public notice of existing subcontracting opportunities and, 
to the extent feasible and consistent with the efficient performance of 
this contract, shall solicit bids or proposals only from Indian 
organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises. The Contractor shall 
request assistance and information on Indian firms qualified as 
suppliers or subcontractors from the Tribe(s) on or near whose 
reservation(s) the work under the contract is to be performed. The 
Contracting Officer will advise the contractor of the name, location, 
and phone number of the Tribal officials to be contacted in regard to 
the request for assistance and information. Public notices and 
solicitations for existing subcontracting opportunities shall provide an 
equitable opportunity for Indian firms to submit bids or proposals by 
including:
    (i) A clear description of the supplies or services required, 
including quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules which 
facilitate the participation of Indian firms; (ii) A statement 
indicating that preference will

[[Page 138]]

be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises 
in accordance with section 7(b) of Public Law 93-638 (88 Stat. 2205; 25 
U.S.C. 450e(b)); (iii) Definitions for the terms ``Indian organization'' 
and ``Indian-owned economic enterprise'' as prescribed under the 
``Indian Preference'' clause of this contract; (iv) A representation to 
be completed by the bidder or offeror that it is an Indian organization 
or ``Indian-owned economic enterprise; and (v) A closing date for 
receipt of bids or proposals which provides sufficient time for 
preparation and submission of a bid or proposal. If after soliciting 
bids or proposals from Indian orgnizations and Indian-owned economic 
enterprises, no responsive bid or acceptable proposal is received, the 
Contractor shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of the 
``Indian Preference'' clause of this contract. If one or more responsive 
bids or acceptable proposals are received, award shall be made to the 
low responsible bidder or acceptable offeror if the price is determined 
to be reasonable. If the low responsive bid or acceptable proposal is 
determined to be unreasonable as to price, the Contractor shall attempt 
to negotiate a reasonable price and award a subcontract. If a reasonable 
price cannot be agreed upon, the Contractor shall comply with the 
requirements of paragraph (d) of the ``Indian Preference'' clause of 
this contract. (5) Maintain written records under this contract which 
indicate: (i) The numbers of Indians seeking employment for each 
employment position available under this contract; (ii) the number and 
types of positions filled by Indians and non-Indians, and the total 
number of Indians employed under this contract; (iii) For those 
positions where there are both Indian and non-Indian applicants, and a 
non-Indian is selected for employment, the reason(s) why the Indian 
applicant was not selected; (iv) Actions taken to give preference to 
Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises for 
subcontracting opportunities which exist under this contract; (v) 
Reasons why preference was not given to Indian firms as subcontracators 
or suppliers for each requirement where it was determined by the 
Contractor that such preference would not be consistent with the 
efficient performance of the contract; and (vi) The number of Indian 
organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises contacted, and the 
number receiving subcontract awards under this contract.
    (6) Submit to the Contracting Officer for approval a quarterly 
report which summarizes the Contractor's Indian preference program and 
indicates the number and types of available positions filled by Indians 
and non-Indians, and the dollar amounts of all subcontracts awarded to 
Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises, and to all 
other firms.
    (7) Maintain records pursuant to this clause and keep them available 
for review by the Government until expiration of one (1) year after 
final payment under this contract, or for such longer period as may be 
required by any other clause of this contract or by applicable law or 
regulation.
    (b) For purposes of this clause, the following definitions of terms 
shall apply:
    (1) The terms ``Indian,'' ``Indian Tribe,'' ``Indian Organization,'' 
and ``Indian-owned economic enterprise'' are defined in the clause of 
this contract entitled ``Indian Preference.''
    (2) ``Indian reservation'' includes Indian reservations, public 
domain Indian Allotments, former Indian reservations in Oklahoma, and 
land held by incorporated Native groups, regional corporations, and 
village corporations under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)
    (3) ``On or near an Indian Reservation'' means on a reservation or 
reservations or within that area surrounding an Indian reservation(s) 
where a person seeking employment could reasonably be expected to 
commute to and from in the course of a workday.
    (c) Nothing in the requirements of this clause shall be interpreted 
to preclude Indian Tribes from independently developing and enforcing 
their own Indian preference requirements. Such requirements must not 
conflict with any Federal statutory or regulatory requirement dealing 
with the award and administration of contracts.
    (d) The Contractor agrees to include the provisions of this clause, 
including this paragraph (d), in each subcontract awarded at any tier 
under this contract and to notify the Contracting Officer of such 
subcontracts.
    (e) In the event of noncompliance with this clause, the Contracting 
Officer may terminate the contract in whole or in part or may impose any 
other sanctions authorized by law or by other provisions of the 
contract.

352.270-7  Paperwork Reduction Act.

    Insert the following clause in all solicitations and contracts.

                   Paperwork Reduction Act (APR 1984)

    (a) In the event that it subsequently becomes a contractual 
requirement to collect or record information calling either for answers 
to identical questions from 10 or more persons other than Federal 
employees, or information from Federal employees which is outside the 
scope of their employment, for use by the Federal government or 
disclosure to third parties, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. 
L. 96-511) shall apply to this contract. No plan, questionnaire, 
interview guide or other similar device for collecting information 
(whether repetitive or single-time) may be used without first obtaining 
clearance from the Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget (ASMB) 
within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB). Contractors and Project Officers should 
be guided by the provisions of 5 CFR part 1320, Controlling Paperwork 
Burdens on the Public, and seek the advice of the HHS operating division 
or Office of the Secretary Reports Clearance Officer to determine the 
procedures for acquiring ASMB and OMB clearance.
    (b) The Contractor shall obtain the required ASMB and OMB clearance 
through the Project Officer before expending any funds or making public 
contacts for the collection of data. The authority to expend funds and 
proceed with the collection of information shall be in writing by the 
Contracting Officer. The Contractor must plan at least 120 days for ASMB 
and OMB clearance. Excessive delay caused by the Government which arises 
out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of 
the Contractor will be considered in accordance with the Excusable 
Delays or Default clause of this contract.

 Subpart 370.1--Accessibility of Meetings, Conferences, and Seminars to 
                        Persons With Disabilities


<R05>
370.101  Policy.

    (a) It is the policy of HHS that all meetings, conferences, and 
seminars be accessible to individuals with disabilities. For the 
purposes of this policy, accessibility is defined as both physical 
access to meeting, conference, and seminar sites, and aids and services 
to enable individuals with sensory disabilities to fully participate in 
meetings, conferences, and seminars.
    (b) In regard to acquisition, the policy is applicable to all 
contracts where the statement of work requires the contractor to conduct 
meetings, conferences, or seminars that are open to the public or 
involve HHS personnel, but not to ad hoc meetings that may be necessary 
or incidental to contract performance.


<R05>
370.102  Responsibilities.

    (a) The contracting officer shall include the clause in 352.270-1 in 
every solicitation and resulting contract when the statement of work 
requires the contractor to conduct meetings, conferences, or seminars in 
accordance with 370.101(b).
    (b) The project officer shall be responsible for obtaining, 
reviewing, and approving the contractor's plan, which is to be submitted 
in response to paragraph (a) of the contract clause in 352.270-1. A 
consolidated or master plan for contracts requiring numerous meetings, 
conferences, or seminars will be acceptable. The project officer, prior 
to approving the plan, shall consult with the Office of Engineering 
Services serving the region where the meeting, conference, or seminar is 
to be held, to assure that the contractor's plan meets the accessibility 
requirements of the contract clause. The Office of Engineering Services 
shall make a determination on the adequacy of the contractor's plan, and 
notify the project officer, in writing, within ten (10) working days of 
receiving the request from the project officer.

370.201  Statutory requirements.

    Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education 
Assistance Act, Public Law 93-638, 88 Stat. 2205; 25 U.S.C. 450e(b) 
requires:

    Any contract, subcontract, grant, or subgrant pursuant to this Act, 
the Act of April 16, 1934 (48 Stat. 596), as amended, or any other Act 
authorizing Federal contracts with or grants to Indian organizations or 
for the benefit of Indians, shall require that to the greatest extent 
feasible--
    (1) Preferences and opportunities for training and employment in 
connection with the administration of such contracts or grants shall be 
given to Indians; and
    (2) Preference in the award of subcontracts and subgrants in 
connection with the administration of such contracts or grants shall be 
given to Indian organizations and to Indian-owned economic enterprises 
as defined in section 3 of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 
77).

[[Page 144]]


<R05>
370.202  Applicability.

    The Indian Preference clause set forth in 352.270-2 and the Indian 
Preference Program clause set forth in 352.270-3 have been developed to 
implement section 7(b) of Public Law 93-638 for all activities of the 
Department. The clauses shall be used by any affected departmental 
contracting activity as follows, except solicitations issued and 
contracts awarded pursuant to Title I of Public Law 93-638 (25 U.S.C. 
450 et seq.) are exempted:
    (a) The Indian Preference clause (352.270-2) shall be included in 
each solicitation and resultant contract, regardless of dollar amount:
    (1) When the contract is to be awarded pursuant to an act 
specifically authorizing contracts with Indian organizations; or
    (2) Where the work to be performed under the contract is 
specifically for the benefit of Indians and is in addition to any 
incidental benefits which might otherwise accrue to the general public.
    (b) The Indian Preference Program clause (352.270-3) shall be 
included in each solicitation and resultant contract when:
    (1) The dollar amount of the acquisition is expected to equal or 
exceed $50,000 for nonconstruction work or $100,000 for construction 
work;
    (2) The Indian Preference clause is to be included in the 
solicitation and resultant contract; and
    (3) The determination is made, prior to solicitation that the work 
to be performed under the resultant contract will take place in whole or 
in substantial part on or near an Indian reservation(s). In addition, 
the Indian Preference Program clause may be included in any solicitation 
and resultant contract below the $50,000 or $100,000 level for 
nonconstruction or construction contracts, respectively, but which meet 
the requirements of paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section, and, in 
the opinion of the contracting activity, offer substantial opportunities 
for Indian employment, training, and subcontracting.


<R05>
370.203  Definitions.

    For purposes of this Subpart 370.2, the following definitions shall 
apply:
    (a) Indian means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe. If the 
contractor has reason to doubt that a person seeking employment 
preference is an Indian, the contractor shall grant the preference but 
shall require the individual to provide evidence within thirty (30) days 
from the Tribe concerned that the person is a member of that Tribe.
    (b) Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, pueblo, band, nation, or 
other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village 
or regional or village corporation or village corporation as defined in 
or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 
Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601) which is recognized as eligible for the 
special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians 
because of their status as Indians.
    (c) Indian organization means the governing body of any Indian Tribe 
or entity established or recognized by such governing body in accordance 
with the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 77; 25 U.S.C. 1451).
    (d) Indian-owned economic enterprise means any Indian-owned 
commercial, industrial, or business activity established or organized 
for the purpose of profit, provided that such Indian ownership shall 
constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise, and that 
ownership shall encompass active operation and control.
    (e) Indian reservation includes Indian reservations, public domain 
Indian allotments, former Indian reservations in Oklahoma, and land held 
by incorporated Native groups, regional corporations, and village 
corporations under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement 
Act (85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.).
    (f) On or near an Indian Reservation means on a reservation or 
reservations or within that area surrounding an Indian reservation(s) 
where a person seeking employment could reasonably be expected to 
commute to and from in the course of a work day.


<R05>
370.204  Compliance enforcement.

    (a) The concerned contracting activity shall be responsible for 
conducting periodic reviews to insure contractor compliance with the 
requirements of

[[Page 145]]

the clauses set forth in 352.270-2 and 352.270-3. These reviews may be 
conducted with the assistance of the Indian Tribe(s) concerned.
    (b) Complaints of noncompliance with the requirements of the clauses 
set forth in 352.270-2 and 352.270-3 which are filed in writing with the 
contracting activity shall be promptly investigated and resolved by the 
contracting officer.


<R05>
370.205  Tribal preference requirements.

    (a) Where the work under a contract is to be performed on an Indian 
reservation, the contracting activity may supplement the clause set 
forth in 352.270-3 by adding specific Indian preference requirements of 
the Tribe on whose reservation the work is to be performed. The 
supplemental requirements shall be jointly developed for the contract by 
the contracting activity and the Tribe. Supplemental preference 
requirements must represent a further implementation of the requirements 
of section 7(b) of Public Law 93-638 and must be approved by the 
affected program director and approved for legal sufficiency by the 
Business and Administrative Law Division, OGC, or a regional attorney 
before being added to a solicitation and resultant contract. Any 
supplemental preference requirements to be added to the clause in 
352.270-3 shall be included in the solicitation and clearly identified 
in order to ensure uniform understanding of the additional requirements 
by all prospective bidders or offerors.
    (b) Nothing in these regulations shall be interpreted to preclude 
Tribes from independently developing and enforcing their own tribal 
preference requirements. Such independently developed tribal preference 
requirements shall not, except as provided in paragraph (a) above, 
become a requirement in contracts covered under this Subpart 370.2, and 
must not conflict with any Federal statutory or regulatory requirement 
concerning the award and administration of contracts.

\1\ Central Registry-System Entity Identification Number (CRS-EIN).
CRS-EIN is a twelve digit number used to identify a recipient
  organization/individual in the HHS Central Registry System (CRS). This
  system utilizes a standard identification number within HHS to
  identify recipients of Federal assistance-like programs. The first
  digit identifies whether the recipient is an organization (1) or
  individual (2). The next nine (9) digits uniquely associate the
  organization/individual to an Employer Identification Number assigned
  by the Internal Revenue Service in the case of an organization, or a
  Social Security Number assigned by the Social Security Administration
  in the case of an individual. A two character suffix code is assigned
  by the Central Registry System, HHS, to identify component levels
  within the recipient organization, such as: School of Medicine,
  Research Division, Department of Biology, etc. A suffix is not applied
  to a Social Security Number since that number is unique to each
  individual.

             Subpart PHS 301.1--Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
PHS 301.101  Purpose.

    (a) The Public Health Service Acquisition Regulation (PHSAR) is 
issued to establish uniform acquisition policies and procedures 
throughout PHS which are necessary to implement or supplement the 
Department of Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR).
    (b) PHS issuances do not reiterate material published in the HHSAR 
or the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
    (c) The PHSAR implements and supplements the HHSAR. Implementing 
material expands upon or indicates the manner of compliance with the 
related HHSAR. Supplementing material is new material which has no 
counterpart in the HHSAR. The omission of sections or subsections in 
PHSAR means no further explanation or qualification is necessary for 
implementation within PHS. Therefore, in order to obtain comprehensive 
coverage and assure consideration of all acquisition policies and 
procedures pertinent to PHS, the FAR, HHSAR, and PHSAR should be read.


<R05>
PHS 301.102  Authority.

    (a) The HHSAR authorizes supplementation or implementation of the 
FAR and HHSAR in accordance with prescribed procedures (see 301.301) in 
order to publish essential acquisition instructions, policies, and 
procedures that do not conflict with, supersede or duplicate that 
prescribed by the FAR and the HHSAR.


<R05>
PHS 301.103  Applicability.

    The FAR, HHSAR and PHSAR issuances apply to all acquisitions made by 
PHS procuring activities as defined in FAR 1.103.


<R05>
PHS 301.104  Issuance.

<R05>
PHS 301.470  Procedure.

    (a) Requests for deviations from the FAR, HHSAR or any PHSAR 
issuance for implementation or supplementation shall be submitted in 
writing by the PHS agency principal official responsible for acquisition 
to the Director, Division of Grants and Contracts, ORM/OM/PHS for 
approval and/or further processing as may be required. When it is

solicitation, the request for deviation must be processed and approved 
prior to release of the solicitation. When completion of a contract 
action is contingent on approval of a deviation, the request for 
deviation must be processed and approval granted by the appropriate 
level, prior to contract execution. In an exigency situation, initial 
verbal contact should be made with the Chief, Contracts Management 
Branch, DGC/ORM/OM/PHS or his/her designee. Only deviations to the PHSAR 
may be granted by the Director, Division of Grants and Contracts.
    (b) Each request for deviation shall provide sufficient information 
to permit PHS compliance with the HHSAR. Generally, such requests shall 
contain the following in addition to the information required by 
301.470(b):
    (1) The name of the contractor and contract number, or the name of 
the

[[Page 163]]

proposed contractor and the solicitation number.
    (2) A statement indicating whether or not the deviation had been 
previously requested. If so, outline the circumstances involved and the 
disposition of that request.

304.7101(c), internal reviews are to be conducted of acquisitions made 
by the following contracting offices in the National Institutes of 
Health for contract awards that fall below the dollar threshold for

review actions will be maintained and will include documentation of the 
resolution of any significant issue raised by the review.

of the dollar value. The certification must state that only NAS can 
provide the measure of expertise, independence, objectivity, and

    Various statutes and regulations (e.g., Walsh-Healey Act; Service 
Contract Act) require adherence to minimum safety and health standards 
by contractors engaged in potentially hazardous work. Positive action to 
reduce accidents and conditions hazardous to health under all contracts 
is in the Government's interest since the cost of such accident and 
health hazards is borne by the Government through higher prices and 
sometimes by direct indemnification of contractors against liability 
claims.


<R05>
PHS 323.7002  Policy.

    (a) The guidance contained in FAR Subpart 23.3 shall be used for 
hazardous material as the primary reference. When that guidance is 
judged insufficient or does not meet the safety and health situation in 
the instant acquisition, this subpart shall be followed.
    (b) Whenever the performance of a contract will require use of 
hazardous materials or operations, the contracting activity shall 
require the prime contractor and subcontractors to:
    (1) Provide protection for the life and health of PHS employees, 
contractor employees, other persons involved with work on PHS programs 
and projects, and the public;
    (2) Avoid accidental work interruptions which could delay progress 
of PHS programs and project;
    (3) Maintain controls for the prevention of damage and loss to 
property; and
    (4) Accumulate and provide data necessary for analysis of risk and 
loss factors relating to PHS programs and projects.


<R05>
PHS 323.7003  Actions required.

    (a) Contracting activities. Contracting activities shall use the 
clause set forth in PHS 352.223-70 as a guide in developing appropriate 
safety and health clauses for use in prospective contracts involving the 
following:
    (1) Services or products;
    (2) Research, development, or test projects;
    (3) Transportation of hazardous materials; and
    (4) Construction, including construction of facilities on the 
contractor's premises.
    (b) Safety officers. OPDIV safety officers shall advise and assist 
initiators of acquisition requests and contracting officers in:
    (1) Determining whether safety and health provisions should be 
included in a prospective contract;
    (2) Selecting or developing safety and health clause provisions for 
incorporation in a prospective contract;
    (3) Evaluating a prospective contractor's safety and health 
programs; and
    (4) Conducting post-award review and surveillance to the extent 
deemed necessary.
    (c) Initiators. Initiators of acquisition requests for items 
described in paragraph (a) of this section shall:
    (1) During the preparation of a request for contract, and in the RFP 
or IFB:

[[Page 170]]

    (i) Ensure that hazardous materials and operations to be utilized in 
the performance of the contract are clearly identified; and
    (ii) Coordinate with the appropriate safety officer to ensure that 
all hazardous materials and operations are evaluated and that adequate 
safety requirements are established in the RFP or IFB.
    (2) During the period of performance:
    (i) Apprise the contracting officer of any noncompliance with safety 
and health provisions identified in the contract; and
    (ii) Cooperate with the safety officer in conducting review and 
surveillance activities.


<R05>
PHS 323.7004  Contract clause.

    All contracts which require the use of hazardous materials or 
operations shall include a clause to provide adherence to minimum safety 
and health standards. The clause set forth in PHS 352.223-70 may be used 
or appropriately modified to meet the needs of the individual contract.


<R05>
PHS 323.7005  Solicitation notice--construction.

    The contracting officer shall include the clause in PHS 352.223-71 
in all solicitations and resultant contracts for construction and 
construction services.

    (a) The contracting officer shall ensure that the agency financial 
management officer has identified and certified that design funds have 
been appropriated and apportioned prior to the release of a synopsis or 
solicitation for architect-engineer services for the types of 
acquisitions specified in PHS 336.680. New facilities, replacement 
facilities, and building additions must only be acquired with funds 
appropriated for that specific project as evidenced by either (1) 
specific language in an appropriations act, or (2) Congressional 
appropriations intent as reflected in appropriations committee reports 
or Congressional budget justification.
    (b) In the case of ADAMHA, FDA, HRSA, and NIH, the referenced agency 
financial management officer is the Director of the agency's Division of 
Financial Management. In the case of CDC, this official is the Director 
of the Financial Management Office. Subject to HRSA concurrence, funding 
for projects of the Indian Health Service/HRSA may be certified by the 
designated financial management officer within the IHS Office of 
Administration.
    (c) The funding source certification shall include identification of 
the title, appropriation symbol, and fiscal year of the appropriation 
plus any relevant project or activity description in the appropriation 
act or reports.
    (d) In an unusual circumstance where time is critical, a synopsis or 
solicitation for architect-engineer services may be issued after the POR 
has been approved if the agency financial management officer certifies 
that appropriation and apportionment of proper funds as set forth in 
paragraph (a) above are expected within 60 days. In such cases, the 
synopsis or solicitation must specify that award is subject to the 
availability of funds. In these circumstances the contracting officer 
shall ensure that contract award is not made until the agency financial 
management officer has certified in writing

[[Page 173]]

that proper funds have been appropriated and apportioned. Other 
exceptions to the funding requirements set forth in paragraph (a) above, 
must be specifically approved in writing by the Office of the Assistant 
Secretary for Health prior to the release of a synopsis or solicitation 
for architect-engineer services for new facilities, replacement 
facilities, and building additions.

standards: (Insert codes, standards, and criteria (including any 
applicable State and local requirements) prescribed by the Safety 
Officer.)
    Further, the Contractor shall take or cause to be taken such 
additional safety measures as the Contracting Officer may determine to 
be reasonably necessary; Provided, that, if compliance with such 
additonal safety measures results in a material increase in the cost or 
time of performance of the contract, an equitable adjustment will be 
made in accordance with the clause of this contract entitled 
``Changes.''
    (b) Prior to commencement of work, the Contractor will submit in

such stop order shall be the subject of claim for extension of time or 
for costs or damages by the Contractor.
    (f) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each 
subcontract involving the use of hazardous materials or operations. 
Compliance with the provisions of this clause by subcontractors will be

    The policy and procedures to be followed whenever individuals may be 
involved as subjects in research activities supported or conducted by 
the Department under a contract are provided in Subpart PHS 380.1 and 45 
CFR Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects.
    (a) The following provisions shall be included in solicitations 
expected to involve human subjects:

  Notice To Offerors Of Requirements Of 45 CFR Part 46, Protection Of 
                        Human Subjects (SEP 1985)

    (a) Copies of the Department of Health and Human Services 
(Department) regulations for the protection of human subjects, 45 CFR 
part 46, are available from the Office for Protection from Research 
Risks (OPRR), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. 
The regulations provide a systematic means, based on established ethical 
principles, to safeguard the rights and welfare of individuals who 
participate as subjects in research activities supported or conducted by 
the Department.
    (b) The regulations define a human subject as a living individual 
about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting 
research obtains (1) data through intervention of interaction with the 
individual, or (2) identifiable private information. The regulations 
extend to the use of human organs, tissue, and body fluids from 
individually identifiable human subjects as well as to graphic, written, 
or recorded information derived from individually identifiable human 
subjects. The use of autopsy materials is governed by applicable State 
and

[[Page 176]]

local law and is not directly regulated by 45 CFR part 46.
    (c) Activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will 
be in one or more of the categories set forth in 45 CFR 46.101(b)(1-6) 
are exempt from coverage.
    (d) Inappropriate designations of the non-involvement of human 
subjects or of exempt categories of research in a project may result in 
delays in the review of a proposal. The Public Health Service will make 
a final determination of whether the proposed activities are covered by 
the regulations or are in an exempt category, based on the information 
provided in the proposal. In doubtful cases, prior consultation with 
OPRR, (telephone: 301-496-7014), is recommended.
    (e) In accordance with 45 CFR part 46, prospective Contractors being 
considered for award shall be required to file with OPRR an acceptable 
Assurance of Compliance with the regulations, specifying review 
procedures and assigning responsibilities for the protection of human 
subjects. The initial and continuing review of a research project by an 
institutional review board shall assure that the rights and welfare of 
the human subjects involved are adequately protected, that the risks to 
the subjects are reasonable in relation to the potential benefits, if 
any, to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained, 
and that informed consent will be obtained by methods that are adequate 
and appropriate. Prospective Contractors proposing research that 
involves human subjects shall be contacted by OPRR and given detailed 
instructions for establishing an institutional review board and filing 
an Assurance of Compliance.
    (f) It is recommended that OPRR be consulted for advice or guidance 
concerning either regulatory requirements or ethical issues pertaining 
to research involving human subjects.

                           (End of provision)

    (b) The following clause shall be included in contracts involving 
human subjects:

                 Protection of Human Subjects (OCT 1986)

    (a) The Contractor agrees that the rights and welfare of human 
subjects involved in research under this contract shall be protected in 
accordance with 45 CFR part 46 and with the Contractor's current 
Assurance of Compliance on file with the Office for Protection for 
Research Risks, National Institutes of Health, Public Health Service. 
The Contractor further agrees to provide certification at least annually 
that the institutional review board has reviewed and approved the 
procedures which involve human subjects in accordance with 45 CFR part 
46 and the Assurance of Compliance.
    (b) The Contractor shall bear full responsibility for the 
performance of all work and services involving the use of human subjects 
under this contract in a proper manner and as safely as is feasible. The 
parties hereto agree that the Contractor retains the right to control 
and direct the performance of all work under this contract. Nothing in 
this contract shall be deemed to constitute the Contractor or any 
subcontractor, agent or employee of the Contractor, or any other person, 
organization, institution, or group of any kind whatsoever, as the 
agency or employee of the Government. The Contractor agrees that it has 
entered into this contract and will discharge its obligations, duties, 
and undertakings and the work pursuant thereto, whether requiring 
professional judgement or otherwise, as an independent Contractor 
without imputing liability on the part of the Government for the acts of 
the Contractor or its employees.
    (c) If at any time during performance of this contract, the 
Contracting Officer determines, in consultation with the Office for 
Protection from Research Risks (OPRR), National Institutes of Health 
(NIH), that the Contractor is not in compliance with any of the 
requirements and/or standards stated in paragraphs (a) and (b), above, 
the Contracting Officer may immediately suspend, in whole or in part, 
work and further payments under this contract until the Contractor 
corrects such noncompliance. Notice of the suspension may be 
communicated by telephone and confirmed in writing. If the Contractor 
fails to complete the corrective action within the period of time 
designated in the Contracting Officer's written notice of suspension, 
the Contracting Officer may, in consultation with OPRR, NIH, terminate 
this contract in whole or in part, and the Contractor's name may be 
removed from the list of those Contractors with approved Department of 
Health and Human Services Human Subject Assurances.

PHS 352.280-2  Care of laboratory animals.

    The policies and procedures to be used when contracts involve live 
vertebrate animals are provided in Subpart PHS 380.2, and in the PHS 
Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by Awardee 
Institutions and accompanying implementation instructions published in a 
special edition of the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts, Vol. 14, No.

[[Page 177]]

    (a) The following provision shall be included in solicitations 
expected to involve vertebrate animals:

 Notice To Offerors of Requirement for Adequate Assurance of Protection 
                of Vertebrate Animal Subjects (SEP 1985)

    The PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by 
Awardee Institutions establishes a number of requirements for research 
activities involving animals. Before a PHS award may be made to an 
applicant organization, the organization shall file, with the Office for 
Protection from Research Risks (OPRR), National Institutes of Health 
(NIH), PHS, a written Animal Welfare Assurance which commits the 
organization to comply with the provisions of the PHS Policy on Humane 
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by Awardee Institutions, the Animal 
Welfare Act, and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 
prepared by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources. In accordance 
with the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by 
Awardee Institutions, applicant organizations must establish a 
committee, qualified through the experience and expretise of its 
members, to oversee the institution's animal program, facilities and 
procedures. No PHS award involving the use of animals shall be made 
unless the Animal Welfare Assurance has been approved by OPRR. Prior to 
award, the contracting officer will notify Contractor(s) selected for 
projects that involve live vertebrate animals that an Animal Welfare 
Assurance is required. The contracting officer will request that OPRR 
negotiate an acceptable Animal Welfare Assurance with those 
Contractor(s). For further information, OPRR may be contacted at NIH, 
Bethesda, Maryland 20892 (301-496-7041).

                           (End of provision)

    (b) The following clause shall be included in all contracts 
involving research on vertebrate animals:

               Care of Live Vertebrate Animals (OCT 1986)

    (a) Before undertaking performance of any contract involving 
research on live vertebrate animals, the Contractor shall register with 
the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States in accordance with 7 
U.S.C. 2316 and 9 CFR 2.25-2.28. The Contractor shall furnish evidence 
of such registration to the Contracting Officer.
    (b) The Contractor shall acquire vertebrate animals used in research 
from a dealer licensed by the Secretary of Agriculture under 7 U.S.C. 
2133 and 9 CFR 2.1-2.11, or from a source that is exempt from licensing 
under those sections.
    (c) The Contractor agrees that the care and use of any live 
vertebrate animals used or intended for use in the performance of this 
contract will conform with the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of 
Laboratory Animals by Awardee Institutions, the current Animal Welfare 
Assurance, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared 
by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources and the pertinent laws 
and regulations of the United States Department of Agriculture (see 7 
U.S.C. 2131 et seq. and 9 CFR subchapter A, parts 1-4). In case of 
conflict between standards, the more stringent standard shall be used.
    (d) If at any time during performance of this contract, the 
Contracting Officer determines, in consultation with the Office for 
Protection from Research Risks (OPRR), National Institutes of Health 
(NIH), that the Contractor is not in compliance with any of the 
requirements and/or standards stated in paragraphs (a) and (c), above, 
the Contracting Officer may immediately suspend, in whole or in part, 
work and further payments under this contract until the Contractor 
corrects such noncompliance. Notice of the suspension may be

fails to complete corrective action within the period of time designated 
in the Contracing Officer's written notice of suspension, the 
Contracting Officer may, in consultation with OPRR, NIH, terminate this

Contracting Officer's decision.
    (b) This ``Disputes'' clause does not preclude consideration of law

               Clause No. 3--Limitation of Cost (JUN 1977)

    (a) It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the 
performance of this contract will not exceed the estimated cost set 
forth in this contract and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts 
to perform all work and all obligations under this contract within such 
estimated costs. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe 
that the costs which it expects to incur in the performance of this 
contract in the next succeeding sixty (60) days, when added to all costs 
previously incurred, will exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the 
estimated cost set forth in the contract, or, if at any time the 
Contractor has reason to believe that the total cost to the Government, 
for the performance of this contract, will be substantially greater or 
less than the estimated cost thereof, the Contractor shall notify the 
Contracting Officer in writing to that effect, giving its revised 
estimate of such total cost for the performance of this contract.
    (b) The Government shall not be obligated to reimburse the 
Contractor for costs incurred in excess of the estimated cost set forth 
in the contract and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue 
performance under the contract or to incur costs in excess of such 
estimated cost unless and until the Contracting Officer shall have 
notified the Contractor in writing that such estimated cost has been 
increased and shall have specified in such notice a revised estimated 
cost which shall thereupon constitute the estimated cost of performance 
of this contract. When and to the extent that the estimated cost set 
forth in this contract has been increased by the Contracting Officer in 
writing, any costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of such 
estimated cost prior to the increase in estimated cost shall be 
allowable to the same extent as if such costs had been incurred after 
such increase in estimated cost.

                             (End of clause)

                 Clause No. 4--Allowable Cost (JUN 1977)

    (a) Compensation for Contractor's performance. Payment for the 
allowable cost, as herein defined and as actually incurred by the 
Contractor shall constitute full and complete compensation for the 
performance of the work under this contract.
    (b) Allowable cost. The allowable cost of performing the work under 
this contract shall be the cost actually incurred by the Contractor, 
either directly incident or properly allocable to the contract, in the 
performance of this contract in accordance with its terms. The allowable 
cost, direct and indirect, including acceptability of cost allocation 
methods, shall be determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance 
with:
    (1)(i) ``A Guide for Nonprofit Institutions Establishing Indirect 
Cost Rates for Research Grants and Contracts with the Department of 
Health and Human Services, HHS Publication OASC-5'' or (ii) ``A Guide 
for Hospitals, Grants and Contracts with the Department of Health and 
Human Services, HHS Publication OASC-3,'' or (iii) Subpart 1-15.7 of the 
Federal Procurement Regulations (41 CFR subpart 1-15.7) if the contract 
is with a state or local government agency, or (iv) Subpart 1-15.4 of 
the Federal Procurement Regulations (41 CFR subpart 1-15.4) if the

                             (End of clause)

           Clause No. 5--Negotiated Overhead Rates (JUN 1977)

    (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of the clause of this contract 
entitled, ``Allowable Cost,'' the allowable indirect costs shall be 
obtained by applying negotiated overhead rates to bases agreed upon by 
the parties, as specified below.
    (b) The Contractor, as soon as possible, but not later than six (6) 
months after the expiration of each of the Contractor's financial years 
or such period as may mutually be agreed upon by the Government and the 
Contractor, shall submit to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the 
cognizant audit agency, a proposed final overhead rate or rates for that 
period based on the Contractor's cost experience during that period, 
together with supporting cost data. Negotiation of final overhead rates 
by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer shall be undertaken as 
promptly as practicable after receipt of the Contractor's proposal.
    (c) Allowability of costs and acceptability of cost allocation 
methods shall be determined in accordance with the applicable cost 
principles set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of Clause 4, as in effect on 
the date of this contract, and the same hereby incorporated herein by 
reference.
    (d) The results of each negotiation shall be set forth in an 
amendment to this contract, which shall specify (1) the agreed final 
rate,

[[Page 180]]

(2) the bases to which the rates apply, and (3) the periods for which 
the rates apply.
    (e) Pending establishment of final overhead rates for any period, 
the Contractor shall be reimbursed either at negotiated provisional 
rates as provided in this contract or at billing rates acceptable to the 
Contracting Officer, subject to appropriate adjustment when the final 
rates for that period are established. To prevent substantial over or 
under payment, the provisional or billing rates may, at the request of 
either party, be revised by mutual agreement, either retroactively or 
prospectively. Any such revision of negotiated provisional rates 
provided in this contract shall be set forth in an amendment to this 
contract.
    (f) Any failure by the parties to agree on any final rate or rates 
under this clause shall be considered a dispute concerning a question of 
fact for decision by the Contracting Officer within the meaning of the 
clause of this contract entitled ``Disputes.''
    (g) Submission of proposed provisional and/or final overhead rates, 
together with appropriate data in support thereof, to the Secretary or 
his/her duly authorized representative, and agreements on provisional 
and/or final overhead rates entered into between the Contractor and the 
Secretary or his/her duly authorized representative, as evidenced by 
Negotiated Overhead Rate Agreements signed by both parties, shall be 
deemed to satisfy the requirements of (b), (d) and (e) above.

                             (End of clause)

                    Clause No. 6--Payment (JUN 1977)

    (a) Payment on account of allowable cost. Once each month (or at 
more frequent intervals if approved by the Contracting Officer) the 
Contractor may submit to the Contracting Officer, in such form and 
reasonable detail as may be required, an invoice or voucher supported by 
a statement of costs incurred by the Contractor in the performance of 
this contract and claimed to constitute allowable costs. Promptly after 
receipt of each invoice or voucher, the Government shall, subject to the 
provisions of (b) below, make payment thereon as approved by the 
Contracting Officer.
    (b) Audit Adjustments. At any time or times prior to settlement 
under this contract the Contracting Officer may have invoices or 
vouchers and statements of cost audited. Each payment theretofore made 
shall be subject to reduction for amounts included in the related 
invoice or voucher which are found by the Contracting Officer, on the 
basis of such audit, not to constitute allowable cost. Any payment may 
be reduced for overpayment, or increased for underpayments on preceding 
invoices or vouchers.
    (c) Completion voucher. On receipt and approval of the invoice or 
voucher designated by the Contractor as the ``completion invoice'' or 
``Completion Voucher'' and upon compliance by the Contractor with all 
the provisions of this contract (including without limitation, the 
provisions relating to patents and provisions of (d) below) the 
Government shall promptly pay to the Contractor any balance of allowable 
cost. The completion invoice or voucher shall be submitted by the 
Contractor promptly following completion of the work under this contract 
but in no event later than 6 months (or such longer period as the 
Contracting Officer may in his/her discretion approve in writing) from 
the date of such completion.
    (d) Applicable credits. The Contractor agrees that any refunds, 
rebates, credits, or other amounts (including any interest thereon) 
accruing to or received by the Contractor or any assignee under this 
contract shall be paid by the Contractor to the Government, to the 
extent that they are properly allocable to costs for which the 
Contractor has been reimbursed by the Government under this contract. 
Reasonable expenses incurred by the Contractor for the purpose of 
securing such refunds, rebates, credits, or other amounts shall be 
allowable cost hereunder when approved by the Contracting Officer.
    (e) Financial settlement. Prior to final payment under this 
contract, the Contractor and each assignee under this contract whose 
assignment is in effect at the time of final payment under this contract 
shall execute and deliver:
    (1) An assignment to the Government in form and substance 
satisfactory to the Contracting Officer, of refunds, rebates, credits, 
or other amounts (including any interest thereon) properly allocable to 
costs for which the Contractor has been reimbursed by the Government 
under this contract, and
    (2) A release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and 
employees from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of 
or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions:
    (i) Specified claims in stated amounts or in estimated amounts where 
the amounts are susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor;
    (ii) Claims, together with reasonable expenses incidental thereto, 
based upon liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of 
the performance of this contract; Provided, That such claims are not 
known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release; And 
provided further, That the Contractor gives notice of such claims in 
writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date 
of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the 
Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier; and
    (iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the 
Contractor by

[[Page 181]]

reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent 
liability), including reasonable expenses incidental thereto, incurred 
by the Contractor under the provisions of this contract relating to 
patents.

                             (End of clause)

                Clause No. 7--Advance Payments (JUN 1977)

    (a) Amount of Advance. At the request of the Contractor, and subject 
to the conditions hereinafter set forth, the Government shall make an 
advance payment, or advance payments from time to time, to the 
Contractor. No advance payment shall be made (1) without the approval of 
the office administering advance payments (hereinafter called the 
``Administering Office'' and designated in paragraph (k)(4) as with all 
advance payments theretofore made, shall exceed the amount stated in 
paragraph (k)(1) hereof; and (3) without a properly certified invoice or 
invoices.
    (b) Special Bank Account. Until all advance payments made hereunder 
are liquidated and the Administering Office approves in writing the 
release of any funds due and payable to the Contractor, all advance 
payments and all other payments under the contract shall be made by 
check payable to the Contractor, and be marked for deposit only in a 
Special Bank Account with the bank designated in paragraph (k)(2) 
hereof. No part of the funds in the Special Bank Account shall be 
mingled with other funds of the Contractor prior to withdrawal thereof 
from the Special Bank Account as hereinafter provided. Except as 
hereinafter provided, each withdrawal shall be made only by check of the 
Contractor countersigned on behalf of the Government by the Contracting 
Officer or such other person or persons as he/she may designate in 
writing (hereinafter called the ``Countersigning Agent''). Until 
otherwise determined by the Administering Office, countersignature on 
behalf of the Government will not be required.
    (c) Use of Funds. The funds in the Special Bank Account may be 
withdrawn by the Contractor solely for the purposes of making payments 
for items of allowable cost or to reimburse the Contractor for such 
items of allowable cost, and for such other purposes as the 
Administering Office may approve in writing. An interpretation required 
as to the proper use of funds shall be made in writing by the 
Administering Office.
    (d) Return of Funds. The Contractor may at any time repay all or any 
part of the funds advanced hereunder. Whenever so requested in writing 
by the Administering Office, the Contractor shall repay to the 
Government such part of the unliquidated balance of advance payments as 
shall in the opinion of the Administering Office be in excess of current 
requirements, or (when added to total advance previously made and 
liquidated) in excess of the amount specified in paragraph (k)(1) 
hereof. In the event the Contractor fails to repay such part of the 
unliquidated balance of advance payments when so requested by the 
Administering Office, all or any part thereof may be withdrawn from the 
Special Bank Account by checks payable to the Treasurer of the United 
States signed solely by the Countersigning Agent and applied in 
reduction of advance payments then outstanding hereunder.
    (e) Liquidation. If not otherwise liquidated, the advance payments 
made hereunder shall be liquidated as herein provided. When the sum of 
all payments under this contract, other than advance payments, plus the 
unliquidated amount of advance payments are equal to the total estimated 
cost for the work under this contract or such lesser amount to which the 
total estimated cost under this contract may have been reduced, plus 
increases, if any, in this total estimated cost not exceeding, in the 
aggregate (including, without limitation, reimbursable costs incident to 
termination for cause and retrocession as estimated by the Contracting 
Officer), the Government shall thereafter withhold further payments to 
the Contractor and apply the amounts withheld against the Contractor's 
obligation to repay such advance payments until such advance payments 
shall have been fully liquidated. If upon completion, termination, or 
retrocession of the contract all advance payments have not been fully 
liquidated, the balances therefor shall be deducted from any sums 
otherwise due or which may become due to the Contractor from the 
Government, and any deficiency shall be paid by the Contractor to the 
Government upon demand.
    (f) Bank Agreement. Before an advance payment is made hereunder, the 
Contractor shall transmit to the Administering Office, in the form 
prescribed by such office, an Agreement in triplicate from the bank in 
which the Special Bank Account is established, clearly setting forth the 
special character of the account and the responsibilities of the bank 
thereunder. Wherever possible, such bank shall be a member bank of the 
Federal Reserve System, or an ``insured'' bank within the meaning of the 
Act creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Act of August 23, 
1935, 49 Stat. 685, as amended (12 U.S.C. 264).
    (g) Lien on Special Bank Account. The Government shall have a lien 
upon any balance in the Special Bank Account paramount to all other 
liens, which lien shall secure the repayment of any advance payments 
made hereunder.
    (h) Lien on Property Under Contract. Any and all advance payments 
made under this contract shall be secured, when made, by a lien in favor 
of the Government, paramount to all other liens, upon the supplies or 
other

[[Page 182]]

things covered by this contract and on all material and other property 
acquired for or allocated to the performance of this contract, except to 
the extent that the Government by virtue of any other provision of this 
contract, or otherwise, shall have valid title to such supplies, 
materials, or other property as against other creditors of the 
Contractor. The Contractor shall identify, by marking or segregation, 
all property which is subject to a lien in favor of the Government by 
virtue of any provision of this contract in such a way as to indicate 
that it is subject to such lien and that it has been acquired for or 
allocated to the performance of this contract. If for any reason such 
supplies, materials, or other property are not identified by marking or 
segregation, the Government shall be deemed to have a lien to the extent 
of the Government's interest under this contract on any mass of property 
with which such supplies, materials, or other property are commingled. 
The Contractor shall maintain adequate accounting control over such 
property on its books and records. If at any time during the progress of 
the work on the contract it becomes necessary to deliver any item or 
items and materials upon which the Government has a lien as aforesaid to 
a third person, the Contractor shall notify such third person of the 
lien herein provided and shall obtain from such third person a receipt, 
in duplicate, acknowledging, inter alia, the existence of such lien. A 
copy of each receipt shall be delivered by the Contractor to the 
Contracting Officer. If this contract is terminated in whole or in part 
and the Contractor is authorized to sell or retain termination inventory 
acquired for or allocated to this contract, such sale or retention shall 
be made only if approved by the Contracting Officer, which approval 
shall constitute a release to the Government's lien hereunder to the 
extent that such termination inventory is sold or retained, and to the 
extent that the proceeds of the sale, or the credit allowed for such 
retention on the Contractor's termination claim, is applied in reduction 
of advance payments then outstanding hereunder.
    (i) Insurance. The Contractor represents and warrants that it is now 
maintaining with responsible insurance carriers, (1) insurance upon its 
own plant and equipment against fire and other hazards to the extent 
that like properties are usually insured by others operating plants and 
properties of similar character in the same general locality; (2) 
adequate insurance against liability on account of damage to persons or 
property; and (3) adequate insurance under all applicable workmen's 
compensation laws. The Contractor agrees that, until work under this 
contract has been completed and all advance payments made hereunder have 
been liquidated, it will (i) maintain such insurance; (ii) maintain 
adequate insurance upon any materials, parts, assembles, subassemblies, 
supplies, equipment and other property acquired for or allocable to this 
contract and subject to the Government lien hereunder; and (iii) furnish 
such certificates with respect to its insurance as the Administering 
Office may from time to time require.
    (j) Prohibition Against Assignment. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this contract, the Contractor shall not transfer, pledge, 
or otherwise assign this contract, or any interest therein, or any claim 
arising thereunder, to any party or parties, bank, trust company, or 
other financing institution.
    (k) Designations and Determinations. (1) Amount. The amount of 
advance payments at any time outstanding hereunder shall not exceed 
$________.
    (2) Depository. The bank designated for the deposit of payments made 
hereunder shall be:
    (3) Interest Charge. No interest shall be charged for advance 
payments made hereunder. The Contractor shall charge interest at the 
rate of 6 percent per annum on subadvances or down payments to 
subcontractors, and such interest will be credited to the account of the 
Government. However, interest need not be charged on subadvances on 
nonprofit subcontracts with nonprofit educational or research 
institutions for experimental, research or development work.
    (4) Administering Office. The office administering advance payments 
shall be the office designated as having responsibility for awarding the 
contract.
    (l) Other Security. The terms of this contract shall be considered 
adequate security for advance payments hereunder, except that if at any 
time the administering office deems the security furnished by the 
Contractor to be inadequate, the Contractor shall furnish such 
additional security as may be satisfactory to the administering office, 
to the extent that such additional security is available.

                             (End of clause)

             Clause No. 8--Examination of Records (JUN 1977)

    (a) This clause is applicable if the amount of this contract exceeds 
$2,500 and was entered into by means of negotiation including small 
business restricted advertising, but is not applicable if this contract 
was entered into by means of formal advertising.
    (b) The Contractor agrees that the Comptroller General of the United 
States and the Secretary, or any of their duly authorized 
representatives, shall until expiration of 3 years after final payment 
under this contract or of the time period for the particular records in 
Part 1-20 of the Federal Procurement Regulations (41 CFR part 1-20) 
whichever expires earlier, have access to and the

[[Page 183]]

right to examine any directly pertinent books, documents, papers, and 
records of the Contractor involving transactions related to this 
contract.
    (c) The Contractor further agrees to include in all its subcontracts 
hereunder a provision to the effect that the subcontractor agrees that 
the Comptroller General of the United States, or his/her duly authorized 
representatives shall, until expiration of 3 years after final payment 
under the subcontract or of the time periods for the particular records 
specified in Part 1-20 of the Federal Procurement Regulations (41 CFR 
part 1-20) whichever expires earlier, have access to and the right to 
examine any directly pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of 
such subcontractor, involving transactions related to the subcontract. 
The term ``subcontract'' as used in this clause excludes (1) purchases 
orders not exceeding $2,500 and (2) subcontracts or purchase orders for 
public utility services at rates established for uniform applicability 
to the general public.
    (d) The periods of access and examination described in (b) and (c) 
above, for records which relate to (1) appeals under the ``Disputes'' 
clause of this contract, (2) litigation or the settlement of claims 
arising out of the performance of this contract, or (3) costs and 
expenses of this contract as to which exception has been taken by the 
Comptroller General or any of his/her duly authorized representatives, 
shall continue until such appeals, litigation, claims, or exceptions 
have been disposed of.

             Clause No. 9--Inspection and Reports (JUN 1977)

inspect the work and activities under this contract, including without 
limitation, premises where any Government property may be located at 
such reasonable times and in such manner as it may deem appropriate and 
the Contractor shall afford the Government proper facilities and 
assistance for such inspection.
    (b) Reports. The Contractor shall furnish such progress reports, 
schedules, financial and cost reports, and other reports, concerning the 
work under this contract as specified elsewhere in this contract. Cost

the contract effort, the following clause will apply:

                      Reports to the Indian People

    The contractor, as a recipient of Federal financial assistance,

or represented by the contractor. Such reports will reflect how the 
Federal assistance funds were utilized to the benefit of the Indian 
people served or represented as follows: (specific reporting 
requirements, formats and methods of distribution to the Indian people 
will be prescribed in the scope of the contract.)
    (d) Annual Reporting.
    (1) For each fiscal year during which a tribal organization receives 
or expends funds pursuant to a contract under this Part, the tribe which 
requested the contract must submit a report to the Contracting Officer. 
The report shall include, but not be limited to, an accounting of the 
amounts and purposes for which the contract funds were expended and 
information on the conduct of the program or services involved. The 
reports shall include any other information requested by the Contracting 
Officer and may be submitted as follows:
    (i) When the contract is with the governing body of an Indian tribe, 
the tribe shall submit the report to the Contracting Officer.
    (ii) When the contract is with a tribal organization other than the 
governing body of the tribe, the tribe has the option of having the 
tribal organization prepare the report and submit it to the tribe for 
review and approval before the tribe submits it to the Contracting 
Officer.
    (iii) When the contract benefits more than one tribe, the tribal 
organization shall prepare and submit the report to each of the tribes 
benefiting under the contract. Each tribe shall endorse the report 
before submitting it to the Contracting Officer.
    (2) The annual report shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer 
within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year in which the contract was 
performed. However, the period for submitting the report may be extended 
if there is just cause for such extension.
    (3) In addition to the yearly reporting requirement given in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the tribal contractor shall 
furnish other reports when and as required by the Secretary.

                             (End of clause)

                Clause No. 10--Subcontracting (JUN 1977)

    (a) Prior approval required. Except as provided in (c) below, the 
Contractor shall not enter into any subcontract or purchase order not 
otherwise expressly authorized elsewhere in this contract without the 
prior written approval of the Contracting Officer and subject to such 
conditions as the Contracting Officer may require.

[[Page 184]]

    (b) Request for approval. The Contractor's request for approval to 
enter into a subcontract pursuant to this clause shall include: (1) A 
description of the supplies or services to be called for by the 
subcontract; (2) identification of the proposed subcontractor and an 
explanation of why and how the proposed subcontractor was selected, 
including the degree of competition obtained; (3) the proposed 
subcontract price, together with the Contractor's cost or price analysis 
thereof; (4) identification of the type of subcontract to be used; (5) a 
copy or draft of the proposed subcontract, if available; and (6) any 
other information which the Contracting Officer may require.
    (c) Certain purchases of property and services. Prior written 
approval shall not be required for firm fixed-price subcontracts for the 
purchase or rental of items of personal property having a unit 
acquisition cost of less than $200 or for subcontracts in a total amount 
less than $1,000 unless otherwise specified elsewhere in this contract: 
Provided, however, That advance notification shall be given by the 
Contractor of any subcontract which exceeds in dollar amount 5 percentum 
of the total estimated cost of this contract.
    (d) Contractor's procurement system. The contractor shall use 
methods, practices or procedures in subcontracting or purchasing 
(hereinafter referred to as the Contractor's ``procurement system'') 
acceptable to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may, at 
any time during the performance of this contract, require the Contractor 
to provide information concerning its procurement system.
    (e) Effect of subcontracting. Subcontracts shall be made in the name 
of the Contractor and shall not bind nor purport to bind the Government. 
The making of subcontracts hereunder shall not relieve the Contractor of 
any requirement under this contract (including, but not limited to, the 
duty to properly supervise and coordinate the work of subcontracts, and 
the duty to maintain and account for property pursuant to the clause of 
this contract entitled ``Government Property''). Approval of the 
provisions of any subcontract by the Contracting Officer shall not be 
construed to constitute a determination of the allowability of any cost 
under this contract, unless such approval specifically provides that it 
constitutes a determination of the allowability of such cost. In no 
event shall approval of any subcontract by the Contracting Officer be 
construed as effecting any increase in the estimated cost set forth in 
this contract. No subcontract placed under this contract shall provide 
for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis.
    (f) Procurements from contractor-controlled sources. Procurement or 
transfer of equipment, materials, supplies, or services from contractor-
controlled source (any division or other organizational component of the 
prime contractor, exclusive of the contracting component, and any 
subsidiary or affiliate of the Contractor under a common control) shall 
be considered a subcontract for the purpose of this clause.

                             (End of clause)

          Clause No. 11--Accounts, Audit and Records (JUN 1977)

    (a) The Contractor shall maintain books, records, documents, and 
other evidence, accounting procedures, and practices, sufficient to 
reflect properly all direct and indirect costs of whatever nature 
claimed to have been incurred and anticipated to be incurred for the 
performance of this contract. The foregoing constitutes ``records'' for 
the purposes of this clause.
    (b) The Contractor's facility(ies), or such part thereof as may be 
engaged in the performance of this contract, and its records shall be 
subject at all reasonable times to inspection and audit by the 
Contracting Officer or his/her authorized representative.
    (c) The contractor shall preserve and make available its records (1) 
until the expiration of 3 years from the date of final payment under 
this contract, or the time periods for the particular records specified 
in (41 CFR part 1-20), whichever expires earlier and (2) for such longer 
period, if any, as is required by applicable statute, or by other clause 
of this contract, or by (i) or (ii) below.
    (i) If this contract is completely or partially retroceded or 
reassumed by the Government, the records relating to the work terminated 
shall be preserved and made available for a period of 3 years from the 
date of any resulting final settlement.
    (ii) Records which relate to (A) appeals under the ``Disputes'' 
clause of this contract, (B) litigation or the settlement of claims 
arising out of the performance of this contract, or (C) costs and 
expenses of this contract to which exception has been taken by the 
Contracting Officer or any of his/her duly authorized representatives, 
shall be retained until such appeals, litigation, claims, or exceptions 
have been disposed of.
    (d) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, 
including this paragraph (d), in each subcontract hereunder that is not 
firm fixed-price or fixed-price with escalation. When so inserted, 
changes shall be made to designate the higher-tier subcontractor at this 
level involved in place of the Contractor: to add ``of the Government 
prime contract'' in place of ``this contract'' in (B) of subparagraph 
(c)(ii) above.

              Clause No. 12--Government Property (JUN 1977)

    (a) Government furnished property. (1) The Government reserves the 
right to furnish any property or services required for the performance 
of the work under this contract.
    (2) The Government shall deliver to the Contractor, for use in 
connection with and under the terms of this contract, the property 
described elsewhere in this contract, together with such related data 
and information as the Contractor may request and as may reasonably be 
required for the intended use of such property (such property to be 
referred to as ``Government furnished property'').
    In the event that Government furnished property is not delivered to 
the contractor by the time or times as stated, or if not stated, in 
sufficient time to enable the Contractor to meet such delivery or 
performance dates under this contract, the Contracting Officer shall, 
upon timely written request made by the Contractor, make a determination 
of the delay occasioned the Contractor and make appropriate equitable 
adjustments to any contractual provisions affected by any such delay in 
accordance with the provisions of the clause of this contract entitled 
``Changes.''
    In the event that Government furnished property is received by the 
Contractor in a condition not suitable for the intended use, the 
Contractor shall, immediately upon receipt thereof, notify the 
Contracting Officer of such fact, and, as directed by the Contracting 
Officer either (i) return or otherwise dispose of such property, or (ii) 
effect repairs or modifications thereto. Upon completion of (i) or (ii) 
above, the Contracting Officer, upon timely written request of the 
Contractor, shall make appropriate equitable adjustments to any 
contractual provisions affected thereby in accordance with the 
provisions of the clause of this contract entitled ``Changes.'' The 
foregoing provisions for adjustment are exclusive and the Government 
shall not be liable to suit for breach of contract by reason of any 
delay in delivery of Government furnished property or delivery of such 
property in a condition not suitable for its intended use.
    (b) Title. (1) Title to all property furnished by the Government 
shall remain in the Government. Title to all property purchased by the 
Contractor, the cost of which the Contractor is entitled to be 
reimbursed as a direct item of cost under this contract, shall pass to 
and vest in the Government upon delivery of such property by the vendor. 
Title to other property, the cost of which is reimbursable to the 
Contractor under this contract, shall pass and vest in the Government 
upon (i) issuance for use of such property in the performance of this 
contract, or (ii) commencement of processing or use of such property in 
the performance of this contract, or (iii) reimbursement of the cost 
thereof by the Government in whole or in part, whichever first occurs. 
All Government furnished property, together with all property acquired 
by the Contractor, title to which vests in the Government under this 
paragraph, are subject to the provisions of this clause and are 
hereinafter collectively referred to as ``Government property.''
    (2) Title to the Government property shall not be affected by the 
incorporation or attachment thereof to any property now owned by the 
Government, nor shall such Government property, or any part thereof, be 
or become a fixture or lose its identity or personality by reason of 
affixation to any realty.
    (c) Use of Government property. Government property shall, unless 
otherwise provided herein or approved by the Contracting Officer, be 
used only for the performance of this contract.
    (d) Property management and control. The Contractor shall maintain 
and administer in accordance with sound business practice a program for 
the maintenance repair, protection, and preservation, control of and 
accountability for Government property, so as to assure its full 
availability and usefulness for the performance of this contract. The 
Contractor shall comply with Federal, State, and local laws, codes, 
ordinances, regulations, and orders pertaining to standards of 
construction, safety, environment quality, energy conservation, historic 
site preservation, facilities for the handicapped, emergency 
preparedness, and other requirements that are applicable to the physical 
characteristics, operation, and maintenance of Government property. The 
Contractor agrees to promptly receipt for all Government property in a 
form and manner as prescribed by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor 
further agrees to take all reasonable steps to comply with all 
directions or instructions which the Contracting Officer may prescribe 
regarding the management and control of Government property.
    (e) Risk or loss. (1) The Contractor shall not be liable for any 
loss of or damage to Government property, or for expenses incidental to 
such loss or damage, except that the Contractor shall be responsible for 
any such loss or damage (including expenses incidental thereto);
    (i) Which results from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on 
the part of any of the Contractor's directors or officers, or on the 
part of any of its managers, superintendents, or other equivalent 
representatives, who have supervision or direction of
    (A) all or substantially all of the Contractor's operations at any 
one plant, laboratory or separate location in which this contract is 
being performed or

[[Page 186]]

    (B) a separate and complete major organization, industrial or 
otherwise in connection with the performance of this contract;
    (ii) Which results from a failure on the part of the Contractor, due 
to willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of any of its 
directors, officers, or other representatives mentioned in subparagraph 
(i) above, (A) to maintain and administer, in accordance with sound 
business practice, the program for maintenance, repair, protection, and 
preservation of Government property as required by paragraph (d) hereof, 
or (B) to take all reasonable steps to comply with any appropriate 
written directions of the Contracting Officer under paragraph (4) 
hereof;
    (iii) For which the Contractor is otherwise responsible under the 
express terms of this contract;
    (iv) Which results from a risk expressly required to be insured 
under this contract, but only to the extent of the insurance so required 
to be procured and maintained, or to the extent of insurance actually 
procured and maintained, whichever is greater; or
    (v) Which results from a risk which is in fact covered by insurance 
or for which the Contractor is otherwise reimbursed, but only to the 
extent of such insurance or reimbursement; Provided That, if more than 
one of the above exceptions shall be applicable in any case, the 
Contractor's liability under any one exception shall not be limited by 
any other exception.
    (2) If the Contractor transfers Government property to the 
possession and control of a subcontractor the transfer shall not affect 
the liability of the Contractor for loss or destruction of or damage to 
Government property as set forth in (1) above. The Contractor shall 
require the subcontractor to assume the risk of and be responsible for 
any loss or destruction of or damage to Government property while in the 
latter's possession or control, and the subcontract shall contain 
appropriate provisions requiring the return of all Government property 
in as good condition as when received (except for reasonable wear and 
tear or for the utilization of the property in accordance with the 
provisions of this contract). Provided, however, That the subcontractor 
may be relieved from such liability only to the extent that the 
subcontract, with the prior approval of the Contracting Officer, so 
provides.
    (3) The Contractor shall not be reimbursed for, and shall not 
include as an item of overhead, the cost of insurance, or any provisions 
for a reserve, covering the risk of loss or damage to the Government 
property, except to the extent that the Government may have required the 
Contractor to carry such insurance under any other provision of this 
contract.
    (4) Upon the happening of loss or destruction of or damage to the 
Government property, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer 
thereof, and shall take all reasonable steps to protect the Government 
property from further damage, separate the damaged and undamaged 
Government property, put all the Government property in the best order, 
and furnish to the Contracting Officer a statement of:
    (i) The lost, destroyed, and damaged Government property;
    (ii) The time and origin of the loss, destruction or damage;
    (iii) All known interests in commingled property of which the 
Government property is a part; and
    (iv) The insurance, if any, covering any part of or interest in such 
commingled property.

The Contractor shall make repairs and renovation of the damaged 
Government property, or take such other actions as the Contracting 
Officer directs.
    (5) In the event the Contractor is indemnified, reimbursed, or 
otherwise compensated for any loss or destruction of or damage to the 
Government property, it shall use the proceeds to repair, renovate, or 
replace the Government property involved, or shall credit such proceeds 
against the cost of the work covered by the contract, or shall otherwise 
reimburse the Government, as directed by the Contracting Officer. The 
loss, destruction or damage and, upon the request of the Constracting 
Officer, shall, at the Government's expense, furnish to the Government 
all reasonable assistance and cooperation (including assistance in the 
prosecution of suit and the execution of instruments of assignment in 
favor of the Government) in obtaining recovery. In addition, where a 
subcontractor has not been relieved from liability for any loss or 
destruction of or damage to Government property, the Contractor shall 
enforce the liability of the subcontractor for such loss or destruction 
of or damage to the Government property for the benefit of the 
Government.
    (f) Disposition of Government property.
    (1) During the period of performance of this contract, the 
Contractor shall promptly and regularly report to the Contracting 
Officer, in such form and manner as the Contracting Officer may direct, 
concerning the status of Government property under the contract, 
including all Government property in the Contractor's possession which 
is not in use or which is excess to the needs of the contract. The 
Contractor shall make such disposition of Government property as the 
Contracting Officer may direct. The Contractor shall in no way be 
relieved of responsibility for Government property without the prior 
written approval of the Contracting Officer.
    (2) Upon completion or expiration of this contract, or at such 
earlier date as may be fixed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor 
shall render an accounting, as prescribed by the Contracting Officer, of 
all

[[Page 187]]

Government property which had come into the possession or custody of the 
Contractor under this contract. Such accounting shall include inventory 
schedules covering all items of Government property not consumed in the 
performance of this contract, or not theretofore delivered to the 
Government, or for which the Contractor has not otherwise been relieved 
of responsibility. The Contractor shall deliver or make such other 
disposition of Government property covered in such inventory schedules 
as the Contracting Officer may direct.
    (3) The net proceeds of any disposition of Government property, in 
accordance with (1) and (2) above, shall be credited to the cost of the 
work covered by the contract or shall be paid in such manner as the 
Contracting Officer may direct.
    (g) Restoration of premises. Unless otherwise provided herein, the 
Government shall not be under any duty or obligation to restore or 
rehabilitate, or to pay the costs of the restoration or rehabilitation 
of the Contractor's facility or any portion thereof which is affected by 
removal of any Government property.

                             (End of clause)

                    Clause No. 13--Changes (JUN 1977)

    The Contracting Officer may at any time, with the consent of the 
Contractor, by a written order, and without notice to the sureties, if 
any, make changes, within the general scope of this contract, in any one 
or more of the following: (a) Drawings, designs, or specifications; (b) 
method of shipment or packing; (c) place of inspection, delivery, or 
acceptance; and (d) the amount of Government furnished property. If any 
such change causes an increase or decrease in the estimated cost of, or 
the time required for performance of this contract, or otherwise affects 
any other provisions of this contract, whether changed or not by any 
such order, an equitable adjustment shall be made (a) in the estimated 
cost or delivery schedule, or both, and (b) in such other provisions of 
the contract as may be so affected, and the contract shall be modified 
in writing accordingly. Any claim by the Contractor for adjustment under 
this clause must be asserted within thirty (30) days from the date of 
receipt by the Contractor of the notification of change: Provided, 
however, That the Contracting Officer, if he/she decides that the facts 
justify such action, may receive and act upon any such claim asserted at 
any time prior to final payment under this contract. Where the cost of 
property made obsolete or excess as a result of a change is included in 
the Contractor's claim for adjustment, the Contracting Officer shall 
have the right to prescribe the manner of disposition of such property. 
Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a 
question of fact within the meaning of the clause of this contract 
entitled ``Disputes.'' However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the 
Contractor from proceeding with the contract as changed.

                             (End of clause)

      Clause No. 14--Notice to the Government of Delays (JUN 1977)

    Whenever the Contractor has knowledge that any actual or potential 
situation, including, but not limited to, labor disputes, is delaying or 
threatens to delay the timely performance of the work under this 
contract, the Contractor shall immediately give written notice thereof, 
including all relevant information with respect thereto, to the 
Contracting Officer.

                             (End of clause)

                 Clause No. 15--Retrocession (JUN 1977)

    (a) The Indian Tribe that initially requested this contract may also 
request its retrocession, notwithstanding the fact that the Contractor 
may be a tribal organization other than the Tribe.
    (b) Should the Tribe request retrocession of the contract and the 
Contractor is other than the Tribe, the Contracting Officer will notify 
the Contractor of the request and in consultation with the Tribe and the 
Contractor establish the effective date of the retrocession. The 
retrocession will become effective no later than 120 days after the 
Contracting Officer receives the Tribe's request unless the Tribe and 
the Contracting Officer mutually agree on a later date.
    (c) Immediately after receipt of the request for retrocession and 
where applicable notifying the Contractor, the Contracting Officer will 
meet with the Contractor and, where applicable, the tribal governing 
body or bodies, mutually agree to:
    (1) A plan for the orderly transfer of responsibilities;
    (2) A plan for inventorying materials and supplies on hand;
    (3) An accounting for funds, including but not limited to current 
and anticipated obligations;
    (4) The cost of operation until retrocession; and,
    (5) The identification of all records relating to the contract and 
the contracted function.

                                  1977)

    (a) When the Director or his/her delegate determines that the 
performance of a Contractor under these regulations involves (1)

[[Page 188]]

the violation of the rights or endangerment of the health, safety, or 
welfare of any persons, or (2) gross negligence or the mismanagement in 
the handling or use of funds under the contract, he/she will, in 
writing, notify the contractor of such determinations and will request 
that the Contractor take such corrective action within such period of 
time as the Director or his/her delegate may prescribe.
    (b) When the Director or his/her delegate determines that a 
Contractor has not taken corrective action (as prescribed by him/her 
under paragraph (a) of this section) to his/her satisfaction, he/she 
may, after the Contractor has been provided an opportunity for a hearing 
in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, rescind the contract 
in whole or in part and, if he/she deems it appropriate, assume or 
resume control or operation of the program, activity, or service 
involved.
    (c)(1) When the Director or his/her delegate has made a 
determination described in paragraph (b) of this section, he/she shall 
in writing notify the Contractor of such determination and of the 
Contractor's right to request a review of such determination and of the 
determination described in paragraph (a) of this section. Such 
notification by the Director or his/her delegate shall set forth the 
reasons for the determination in sufficient detail to enable the 
Contractor to respond and shall inform the Contractor of its right to a 
hearing on the record before a Contract Appeals Board described in 
paragraph (d) of this section. Upon the request of the Contractor for a 
hearing, the Board, established pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section shall in writing within 10 days of the establishment notify the 
Contractor of the time, place and date of the hearing which will be held 
not later than 45 days after the request for a hearing.
    (2) Where the Director or his/her delegate determines that a 
Contractor's performance under a contract awarded under this subpart 
poses an immediate threat to the safety of any person, he/she may 
immediately rescind the contract in whole or in part and, if he/she 
deems it appropriate, assume or resume control or operation of the 
program, activity, or service involved. Upon such a decision he/she will 
immediately notify the Contractor of such action and the basis therefor; 
and offer the Contractor an opportunity for a hearing on the record 
before the Contract Appeals Board established pursuant to paragraph (d) 
of this section to be held within 10 days of each action.
    (d)(1) The Contract Appeals Board shall be composed of 3 persons 
appointed by the Director, Indian Health Service. Such persons may not 
be selected from the immediate office of any person participating in the 
determination at issue. The Board shall afford the Contractor the right:
    (i) To notice of the issues to be considered;
    (ii) To be represented by counsel;
    (iii) To present witnesses on Contractor's behalf;
    (iv) To cross-examine other witnesses either orally or through 
written interrogatories; and
    (v) To compel the appearance of Indian Health Service personnel or 
to take depositions of such persons at reasonable times and places.
    (2) The Contract Appeals Board shall make an initial written 
decision which shall become final within 20 days unless the Director, 
Indian Health Service or his/her representative modifies or reverses the 
decision. Any such decision by the Director of the Indian Health Service 
or his/her representative shall be in writing, shall be specific as to 
the reasons for such decision, and shall be considered final.
    (3) Where the Board is considering issues arising under paragraph 
(2) of this section, the Board shall within 25 days after the conclusion 
of the hearing, notify all parties in writing of its decision.
    (c) In any case where the officer has rescinded a contract under 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, he/she may decline to enter into a 
new contract agreement with the Contractor until such time as he/she is 
satisfied that the basis for the recision has been corrected.
    Nothing in this section shall be construed as contravening the 
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1590), as amended 
(29 U.S.C. 651).

                 Clause No. 17--Key Personnel (JUN 1977)

    Where ``key personnel'' have been identified in this contract, it 
has been determined that such named personnel are necessary for the 
successful performance of the work under this contract; and the 
Contractor agrees to assign such personnel to the performance of the 
work under this contract, and shall not reassign or remove any of them 
without the consent of the Contracting Officer. Whenever, for any 
reason, one or more of the aforementioned personnel is unavailable for 
assignment for work under the contract, the Contractor shall immediately 
notify the Contracting Officer to that effect and shall, subject to the 
approval of the Contracting Officer without formal modification to the 
contract, replace such personnel with personnel of substantially equal 
ability and qualifications.

                             (End of clause)

             Clause No. 18--Litigation and Claims (JUN 1977)

    The Contractor shall give the Contracting Officer immediate notice 
in writing of (a)

[[Page 189]]

any action, including any proceeding before an administrative agency, 
filed against the Contractor arising out of the performance of this 
contract, including, but not limited to, the performance of any 
subcontract hereunder; and (b) any claim against the Contractor the cost 
and expense of which is allowable under the clause entitled ``Allowable 
Cost,'' except as otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, the 
Contractor shall furnish immediately to the Contracting Officer copies 
of all pertinent papers received by the Contractor with respect to such 
action or claim. To the extent not in conflict with any applicable 
policy of insurance, the Contractor may, with the Contracting Officer's 
approval, settle any such action or claim. If required by the 
Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall (a) effect an assignment and 
subrogation in favor of the Government of all the Contractor's rights 
and claims (except those against the Government) arising out of any such 
action or claim against the Contractor; and (b) authorize 
representatives of the Government to settle or defend any such action or 
claim and to represent the Contractor in, or to take charge of, any 
action. If the settlement or defense of an action or claim is undertaken 
by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all reasonable 
assistance in effecting a settlement or asserting a defense. Where an 
action against the Contractor is not covered by a policy of insurance, 
the Contractor shall, with the approval of the Contracting Officer, 
proceed with the defense of the action in good faith. The Government 
shall not be liable for the expense of defending any action or for any 
cost resulting from the loss thereof to the extent that the Contractor 
would have been compensated by insurance which was required by law or 
regulation or by written direction of the Contracting Officer, but which 
the Contractor failed to secure through its own fault or negligence.
    In any event, unless otherwise expressly provided in this contract, 
the Contractor shall not be reimbursed or indemnified by the Government 
for any liability loss, cost or expense, which the Contractor may incur 
or be subject to by reason of any loss, injury, or damage, to the person 
or to real or personal property of any third parties as may accrue 
during, or arise from, the performance of this contract.

Government against any or all loss, cost, damage, claim, expense or 
liability whatsoever, because of accident or injury to persons or 
property or others occurring in connection with any program included as 
a part of this contract, by providing where applicable, the insurance 
described below:
    (b) The Contractor shall secure, pay the premium for, and keep in 
force until the expiration of this contract, or any renewal period 
thereof, insurance as provided below. Such insurance policies shall 
specifically include a provision stating the liability assumed by the 
Contractor under this contract.

any laborer or mechanic in any workweek in which he/she is employed on 
such work to work in excess of eight hours in any calendar day or in

liquidated damages. Such liquidated damages shall be computed with 
respect to each individual laborer or mechanic employed in violation of 
the provisions of paragraph (a) in the sum of $10 for each calendar day 
on which such employee was required or permitted to be employed on such 
work in excess of eight hours or in excess of the standard workweek of 
forty hours without payment of the overtime wages required by paragraph 
(a).
    (c) Withholding for unpaid wages and liquidated damages. The

as follows:
    (a) The Contractor will not discriminate against any employee or 
applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, or national 
origin. The Contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that

origin. Such action shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
Employment, upgrading, demotion, or transfer; recruitment or recruitment 
advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of 
compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship. The 
Contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees

[[Page 192]]

provided by the Contracting Officer setting forth the provisions of this 
Equal Opportunity clause.
    (b) The Contractor will, in all solicitations or advertisements for 
employees placed by or on behalf of the Contractor, state that all 
qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without 
regard to race, creed, color, or national origin.
    (c) The Contractor will send to each labor union or representative 
of workers with which it has a collective bargaining agreement or other 
contract or understanding, a notice, to be provided by the agency 
Contracting Officer, advising the labor union or workers' representative 
of the Contractor's commitments under this Equal Opportunity clause, and 
shall post copies of the notice in conspicuous places available to 
employees and applicants for employment.
    (d) The Contractor will comply with all provisions of Executive 
Order No. 11246 of September 24, 1965, and the rules, regulations, and 
relevant orders of the Secretary of Labor.
    (e) The Contractor will furnish all information and reports required 
by Executive Order No. 11246 of September 24, 1965, and by the rules, 
regulations, and orders of the Secretary of Labor, or pursuant thereto, 
and will permit access to its books, records, and accounts by the 
contracting agency and the Secretary of Labor for purposes of 
investigation to ascertain compliance with such rules, regulations, and 
orders.
    (f) In the event of the Contractor's noncompliance with the Equal 
Opportunity clause of this contract or with any of the said rules, 
regulations, or orders, this contract may be cancelled, terminated, or 
suspended, in whole or in part, and the Contractor may be declared 
ineligible for further Government contracts in accordance with 
procedures authorized in Executive Order No. 11246 of September 24, 
1965, and such other sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked as 
provided in Executive Order No. 11246 of September 24, 1965, or by rule, 
regulation, or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as otherwise provided 
by law.
    (g) The Contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (a) 
through (g) in every subcontract or purchase order unless exempted by 
rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant 
to section 204 of Executive Order No. 11246 of September 24, 1965, so 
that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. 
The Contractor will take such action with respect to any subcontract or 
purchase order as the contracting agency may direct as a means of 
enforcing such provisions, including sanctions for noncompliance: 
Provided, however, That in the event the Contractor becomes involved in, 
or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor or vendor as a 
result of such direction by the contracting agency, the Contractor may 
request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the 
interests of the United States.

 Clause No. 29--Indian Preference in Training and Employment (JUN 1977)

    (a) The Contractor shall give preference in employment for all work 
performed under the contract, including subcontracts thereunder, to

extent feasible consistent with the efficient performance of the 
contract, provide employment and training opportunities to Indians, 
regardless of age, religion, or sex, that are not fully qualified to

Opportunity clause of this contract.
    (c) The Contractor agrees to include this clause or one similar 
thereto in all subcontracts issued under the contract.

                             (End of clause)

    Clause No. 30--Certificate of Nonsegregated Facilities (JUN 1977)

    By signing the contract the Contractor certifies that it does not 
maintain or provide for its employees any segregated facilities at any 
of its establishments, and that it does not permit its employees to 
perform their services at any location, under its control, where 
segregated facilities are maintained. It certifies further that it will 
not maintain or provide for its employees any segregated facilities at 
any of its establishments, and that it will not permit its employees to 
perform their services at any location, under its control, where 
segregated facilities are maintained. The Contractor agrees that a 
breach of this certification is a violation of the Equal Opportunity 
clause in this contract. As used in this certification, the term 
``segregated facilities'' means any waiting rooms, work areas, rest 
rooms, and wash rooms, restaurants and other eating areas, time clocks, 
locker rooms and other storage or dressing areas, parking lots, drinking 
fountains, recreation or entertainment areas, transportation, and 
housing facilities provided for employees which are segregated

[[Page 193]]

by explicit directive or are in fact segregated on the basis of race, 
color, religion, or national origin, because of habit, local custom or 
otherwise. It further agrees that (except where it has obtained 
identical certifications from proposed subcontractors for specific time 
periods) it will obtain identical certifications from proposed 
subcontractors prior to the award of subcontracts exceeding $10,000 
which are not exempt from the provisions of the Equal Opportunity 
clause; that it will retain such certifications in its files; and that 
it will forward the following notice to such proposed subcontractors 
(except where the proposed subcontractors have submitted identical 
certifications for specific time periods):
    Notice to prospective subcontractors of requirement for 
certifications of nonsegregated facilities. A certificate of 
Nonsegregated Facilities must be submitted prior to the award of a 
subcontract exceeding $10,000 which is not exempt from the provisions of 
the Equal Opportunity clause. The certification may be submitted either 
for each subcontract or for all subcontracts during a period (i.e., 
quarterly, semiannually, or annually).

September 10, 1965 (18 U.S.C. 4082(c)(2)), and Executive Order No. 
11755, December 29, 1973.

                             (End of clause)

           Clause No. 32--Officials Not To Benefit (JUN 1977)

    No member of or delegate to Congress, or resident commissioner,

benefit that may arise therefrom; but this provision shall not be 
construed to extend to this contract if made with a corporation for its 
general benefit.

    (a) In acquiring end products, the Buy American Act (41 U.S. Code 
10a-d) provides that the Government give preference to domestic source 
end products. For the purpose of this clause:
    (i) ``Components'' means those articles, materials, and supplies 
which are directly incorporated in the end products;
    (ii) ``End products'' means those articles, materials, and supplies 
which are to be acquired under this contract for public use; and
    (iii) A ``domestic source end product'' means (A) an unmanufactured 
end product which has been mined or produced in the United States and 
(B) an end product manufactured in the United States if the cost of the 
components thereof which are mined, produced, or manufactured in the 
United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. For 
the purpose of this (a)(iii) (B), components of foreign origin of the 
same type or kind as the products referred to in (b) (ii) or (iii) of 
this clause shall be treated as components mined, produced or 
manufactured in the United States.
    (b) The Contractor agrees that there will be delivered under this 
contract only domestic source end products, except end products:
    (i) Which are for use outside the United States;
    (ii) Which the Government determines are not mined, produced, or 
manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available 
commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality;
    (iii) As to which the Secretary determines the domestic preference 
to be inconsistent with the public interest; or
    (iv) As to which the Secretary determines the cost to the Government 
to be unreasonable.
    (The foregoing requirements are administered in accordance with 
Executive Order No. 10582, dated December 17, 1954).

other things prohibits the payment, directly or indirectly, by or on 
behalf of a subcontractor in any tier under any Government negotiated 
contract of any fee, gift or gratuity to the prime contractor or any 
higher tier subcontractor or any officer, agent, partner or employee 
thereof, as an inducement or acknowledgment for the award of a 
subcontact or order.
    (b) The provisions of Public Law 86-695 are applicable to this 
contract and any subcontracts entered into under the contract.

        Clause No. 35--Use of Indian Business Concerns (JUN 1977)

    (a) As used in this clause, the term ``Indian business concern'' 
means Indian organizations or an Indian-owned economic enterprise as 
defined in 42 FR 36.204(i).
    (b) The contractor agrees to give preference to qualified Indian 
business concerns in the awarding of any subcontracts entered

[[Page 194]]

into under the contract consistent with the efficient performance of the 
contract. The contractor shall comply with any preference requirements 
regarding Indian business concerns established by the Tribe(s) receiving 
services under the contract to the extent that such requirements are 
consistent with the purpose and intent of this paragraph.
    (c) If no Indian business concerns are available under the 
conditions in paragraph (b) above, the Contractor agrees to accomplish 
the maximum amount of subcontracting, as the Contractor determines is 
consistent with its efficient performance of the contract, with small 
business concerns, labor surplus area concerns or minority business 
enterprises, the definitions for which are contained in Subparts 1-1.7, 
1-1.8, and 1-1.13 of the Federal Procurement Regulations. The Contractor 
is not, however, required to establish a small business, labor surplus, 
or minority business subcontracting program as described in sections 1-
1.710-3(b), 1-1.805-3(b), and 1-1.1310-2(b), respectively, of the

  Clause No. 36--Payment of Interest on Contractor's Claims (JUN 1977)

    (a) If an appeal is filed by the Contractor from a final decision of 
the Contracting Officer under the Disputes clause of this contract, 
denying a claim arising under the contract, simple interest on the 
amount of the claim finally determined owed by the Government shall be 
payable to the Contractor. Such interest shall be at the rate determined 
by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to P.L. 92-41, 85 Stat. 97, 
from the date the Contractor furnished to the Contracting Officer his 
written appeal under the Disputes clause of this contract, to the date 
of (1) a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction, or (2) 
mailing to the Contractor of a supplemental agreement for execution 
either confirming completed negotiations between the parties or carrying 
out a decision of a board of contract appeals.
    (b) Notwithstanding (a), above, (1) interest shall be applied only 
from the date payment was due, if such date is later than the filing of 
appeals, and (2) interest shall not be paid for any period of time that 
the Contracting Officer determines the Contractor has unduly delayed in 
pursuing its remedies before a board of contract appeals or a court of 
competent jurisdiction.
    The Contractor further agrees to comply with any rules, regulations 
and reporting requirements which may be imposed by the HHS Office for 
Civil Rights for purposes of insuring the proper exercise of this 
authority. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all 
subcontract(s) under this contract.

                             (End of clause)

   Clause No. 37--Fair and Equal Treatment of Indian People (JUN 1977)

    (a) The Contractor agrees consistent with medical needs to make no 
discriminatory distinctions among Indian patients or beneficiaries of 
this contract. For the purpose of this contract discriminatory 
distinctions include but are not limited to the following:
    (i) denying a patient any service or benefit or availability of a 
facility;
    (ii) providing any service or benefit to a patient which is 
different, or is provided in a different manner or at a different time 
from that provided to other patients under this contract; subjecting a 
patient to segregation or separate treatment in any manner related to 
his/her receipt of any service; restricting a patient in any way in the 
enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any 
service or benefit; treating a patient differently from others in 
determining whether he/she satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, 
eligibility membership, or other requirements of condition which 
individuals must meet in order to be provided any service or benefit; 
the assignment of times or places for the provision of services on the 
basis of discriminatory distinctions which may be made of the patients 
to be served.
    (b) The Government reserves the right to reassume this contract in 
whole or in part whenever the Contractor fails to comply with the 
requirements of this clause.

                             (End of clause)

    Clause No. 38--Price Reduction for Defective Cost or Pricing Data

    The following clause applies to all contracts where cost and pricing 
data is required in accordance with P.L. 87-653.

      Price Reduction for Defective Cost or Pricing Data (JUN 1977)

    (a) If the Contracting Officer determines that any price negotiated 
in connection with this contract or any cost reimbursable under this 
contract was increased by any significant sums because the Contractor, 
or any subcontractor pursuant to the Clause of this contract entitled 
``Subcontractor Cost or Pricing Data'' or ``Subcontractor Cost or 
Pricing Data-Price Adjustments,'' or any subcontract clause therein 
required, furnished incomplete or inaccurate cost or pricing data or 
data not current as certified in its Contractor's Certificate of Current 
Cost or Pricing Data, then such price or cost shall be reduced 
accordingly and the contract shall be modified in writing to reflect 
such reduction.

[[Page 195]]

    (b) Failure to agree on a reduction shall be a dispute concerning a 
question of fact within the meaning of the ``Disputes'' clause of this 
contract.

    Note: Since this contract is subject to reduction under this clause 
by reason of defective cost or pricing data submitted in connection with 
certain subcontracts, it is expected that the Contractor may wish to 
include a clause in each such subcontract requiring the subcontractor to 
appropriately indemnify the Contractor. It is also expected that any 
subcontractor subject to such indemnification will generally require 
substantially similar indemnification for defective cost or pricing data 
required to be submitted by its lower tier subcontractors.)

                             (End of clause)

           Clause No. 39--Subcontractor Cost and Pricing Data

    The following clauses should be included in all contracts, when the 
subcontracts of the type and size described therein are contemplated.

             Subcontractor Cost and Pricing Data (JUN 1977)

    (a) The Contractor shall require subcontractors hereunder to submit 
in writing cost or pricing data under the following circumstances:
    (1) Prior to award of any cost-reimbursed type, time and material,

for the performance of any major function contemplated under this 
contract to be performed by the Contractor, and Provided, further, 
however, That no provision of this clause and no such approval by the 
Contracting Officer of any subcontract shall be deemed in any event or

age, religion, or sex, that are not fully qualified to perform under the 
contract. The Contractor shall comply with any Indian preference 
requirements established by the tribe receiving services under the 
contract to the extent that such requirements are consistent with the 
purpose and intent of this paragraph.
    (b) If the Contractor or any of its subcontractors is unable to fill 
its employment openings after giving full consideration to Indians as 
required in paragraph (a) above, these employment openings may then be 
filled by other than Indians under the conditions set forth in the Equal 
Opportunity clause of this contract.
    (c) The Contractor agrees to include this clause or one similar 
thereto in all subcontracts issued under this contract.

                  Clause No. 18--Inspection (JUN 1977)

    The Government, through any authorized representatives, has the 
right, at all reasonable times, to inspect, or otherwise evaluate the 
work performed or being performed hereunder and the premises in which it 
is being performed. If any inspection, or evaluation is made by the 
Government on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the 
Contractor shall provide and shall require its subcontractors to provide 
all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safety and convenience 
of the Government representatives in the performance of their duties. 
All inspections and evaluations shall be performed in such a manner as 
will not unduly delay the work.

                    Clause No. 19--Changes (JUN 1977)

    The Contracting Officer may at any time, with the consent of the 
Contractor, by a written order, and without notice to the sureties, if 
any, make changes, within the general scope of this contract, in any one 
or more of the following (i) drawings, designs, or specifications, (ii) 
place of inspection, delivery, or acceptance, and (iii) the amount of 
Government-furnished property. If any such change causes an increase or 
decrease in the cost of, or the time required for performance of, this 
contract, or otherwise affects any other provisions of this contract, 
whether changed or not changed by any such order, an equitable 
adjustment shall be made (i) in the contract price or time of 
performance, or both, and (ii) in such provisions of the contract as may 
be so affected, and the contract shall be modified in writing 
accordingly. Any claim by the Contractor for adjustment under this 
clause must be asserted within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt 
by the Contractor of the notification of change; Provided, however, That 
the Contracting Officer, if he/she decides that the facts justify such 
action, may receive and act upon any such claim asserted at any time 
prior to final payment under this contract. Where the cost of property 
made obsolete or excess as a result of a change is included in the 
Contractor's claim for adjustment, the Contracting Officer shall have 
the right to prescribe the manner of disposition of such property. 
Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a 
question of fact within the meaning of the clause of this contract 
entitled ``Disputes.'' However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the 
Contractor from proceeding with the contract as changed.

                             (End of clause)

                 Clause No. 20--Retrocession (JUN 1977)

         Clause No. 23--Government-Furnished Property (JUN 1977)

    (a) The Government shall deliver to the Contractor, for use in 
connection with and under the terms of this contract, the property 
described elsewhere in this contract, together with such related data 
and information as the Contractor may request and as may reasonably be 
required for the intended use of such property (hereinafter referred to 
as ``Government-Furnished Property''). The delivery or performance dates 
for the supplies or services to be furnished by the Contractor under 
this contract are based upon the expectation that Government-Furnished 
Property suitable for use will be delivered to the Contractor at the 
times stated elsewhere in this contract or, if not so stated, in 
sufficient time to enable the Contractor by such time or times, to meet 
such delivery or performance dates. In the event that Government-
Furnished Property is not delivered to the Contractor to meet such 
delivery or performance dates, the Contracting Officer shall, upon 
timely written request made by the Contractor, make a determination of 
the delay occasioned the Contractor and shall equitably adjust the 
delivery or performance dates, or the contract price, or both, and any 
other contractual provision affected by the delay. In the event that 
Government-Furnished Property is received by the Contractor in a 
condition not suitable for its intended use, the Contractor shall, upon 
receipt thereof, notify the Contracting Officer of such fact and, as 
directed by the Contracting Officer, either (1) return such property at 
the Government's expense or otherwise dispose of such property, or (2) 
effect repairs or modifications. Upon completion of (1) or (2) above, 
the Contracting Officer upon timely written request of the Contractor 
shall equitably adjust the delivery or performance dates of the contract 
price, or both, and any other contractual provision effected by the 
return, disposition, repair, or modification. The foregoing provisions 
for adjustment are exclusive and the Government shall not be liable to 
suit for breach of contract by reason of any delay in delivery of 
Government-Furnished Property or delivery of such property in a 
condition not suitable for its intended use.
    (b) By notice in writing the Contracting Officer may decrease the 
property furnished or to be furnished by the Government under this 
contract. In any such case, the Contracting Officer upon timely written 
request of the Contractor shall equitably adjust the delivery or 
performance date or the contract price, or both, and any other 
contractual provisions affected by the decrease.
    (c) Title to the Government-Furnished Property shall remain in the 
Government. Title to Government-Furnished Property shall not be affected 
by the incorporation or attachment thereof to any property not owned by 
the Government, nor shall such Government-Furnished Property, or any 
part thereof, be or become a fixture or lose its identity as personality 
by reason of affixation to any realty.
    (d) The Government-Furnished Property, unless otherwise specifically 
provided herein, and except as otherwise approved or directed by the 
Contracting Officer in writing, shall be used exclusively for the 
performance of this contract.
    (e) The Contractor shall maintain and administer, in accordance with 
sound business practice, a program for the maintenance, repair, 
protection and preservation of Government-Furnished Property, until 
disposed of by the Contractor in accordance with this clause. In the 
event that any damage occurs to Government-Furnished Property the risk 
of which has been assumed by the Government under this contract, the 
Government shall replace such items or the Contractor shall make such 
repair of the property, as the Government directs; Provided, however, 
That if the Contractor cannot effect such repair within the time 
required, the Contractor may reject such property. The contract price 
includes no compensation to the Contractor for the performance of any 
repair or replacement for which the Government is responsible; and an 
equitable adjustment will be made in the contract price for any such 
repair or replacement of Government-Furnished Property made at the 
direction of the Government. Any repair or replacement for which the 
Contractor is responsible under the provisions of this contract shall be 
accomplished by the Contractor at its own expense.
    (f) The Contractor also agrees to maintain and administer, in 
accordance with sound business practice, a property control system which 
will provide the following: Contract number; nomenclature of item; 
quantity received; issued; and balance on hand; posting reference to 
include date received, issued unit price and location; marking or 
identification of item; adequate maintenance, storage, and security of 
Government-Furnished Property, until disposed of by the Contractor in 
accordance with this clause. The Contractor further agrees to receipt 
promptly for all Government property in a form and manner as prescribed 
by the Contracting Officer.
    (g) The Contractor agrees to make available to authorized 
representatives of the Contracting Officer at all reasonable times at 
the office of the Contractor all of its property records under this 
contract, and access to any premises where any of the Government-
Furnished Property is located.
    (h) (i) The Contractor shall not be liable for any loss or damage to 
the Government-

except that the Contractor shall be liable for any such loss or damage 
(including expenses incidental thereto):
    (A) Which results from willful misconduct r lack of good faith on 
the part of any of the Contractor's directors or officers, or on the 
part of any of its managers, superintendents, or other equivalent 
representatives who have supervision or direction of all or 
substantially all of the Contractor's business, or all or substantially 
all of the Contractor's operations at any one plant, laboratory, or 
separate location in which this contract is being performed; or
    (B) Which results from a failure on the part of the Contractor, due 
to the willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of any of 
its directors, officers, or other representatives mentioned in 
subparagraph (A) above, to maintain and administer, in accordance with 
sound business practice, the program for maintenance, repair, protection 
and preservation of Government-Furnished Property as required by 
subparagraph (e) above; or
    (C) For which the Contractor is otherwise responsible under the 
express terms of the clause or clauses designated in this contract; or
    (D) Which results from a risk expressly required to be insured under 
some other provision of this contract, or of the schedules or task 
orders thereunder, but only to the extent of the insurance so required 
to be procured and maintained or to the extent of insurance actually 
procured and maintained, whichever is greater; or
    (E) Which results from a risk which is in fact covered by insurance 
or for which the Contractor is otherwise reimbursed but only to the 
extent of such insurance or reimbursement; Provided, That, if more than 
one of the above exceptions shall be applicable in any case, the 
Contractor's liability under any one exception shall not be limited by 
any other exception.
    (ii) The Contractor represents that it is not including the price 
hereunder, and agrees that it will not hereafter include in any price to 
the Government, any charge or reserve for insurance (including self-
insurance funds or reserves) covering loss or destruction of or damage 
to the Government-Furnished Property, except the extent that the risk of 
loss is imposed on the Contractor under (i)(C) above, or insurance has 
been required under (i)(D) above.
    (iii) Upon the happening of loss or destruction of or damage to any 
Government-Furnished Property, the Contractor shall notify the 
Contracting Officer thereof and shall take all reasonable steps to 
protect the Government-Furnished Property from further damage, separate 
the damaged and undamaged Government-Furnished Property in the best 
possible order, and furnish to the Contracting Officer a statement of:
    (A) The lost, destroyed and damaged Government-Furnished Property;
    (B) The time and origin of the loss, destruction or damage;
    (C) All known interest in commingled property of which the 
Government-Furnished Property is a part; and
    (D) The insurance, if any, covering any part of or interest in such 
commingled property.
    The Contractor shall be reimbursed for the expenditures made by it 
in performing its obligations under the subparagraph (iii), to the 
extent approved by the Contracting Officer and set forth in a 
supplemental agreement or amendment to this contract.
    (iv) With the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer 
after loss or destruction of or damage to Government-Furnished Property, 
and subject to such conditions and limitations as may be imposed by the 
Contracting Officer, the Contractor may, in order to minimize the loss 
to the Government or in order to permit resumption of business or the 
like, sell for the account of the Government any item of Government-
Furnished Property which has been damaged beyond practicable repair, or 
which is so commingled or combined with property of other, including the 
Contractor, that separation is impracticable.
    (v) Except to the extent of any loss or destruction of or damage to 
Government-Furnished Property for which the Contractor is relieved of 
liability under the foregoing provisions of this clause, and except for 
reasonable wear and tear or depreciation, or the utilization of the 
Government-Furnished Property in accordance with the provisions of this 
contract, the Government-Furnished Property (other than property 
permitted to be sold) shall be returned to the Government in as good 
condition as when received by the Contractor in connection with this 
contract, or as repaired under paragraph (e) above.
    (vi) In the event the Contractor is reimbursed or compensated for 
any loss or destruction of or damage to the Government-Furnished 
Property, it shall equitably reimburse the Government. The Contractor 
shall do nothing to prejudice the Government's rights to recover against 
third parties for any such loss, destruction or damage and, upon the 
request of the Contracting Officer shall at the Government's expense, 
furnish to the Government all reasonable assistance and cooperation 
(including assistance in the prosecution of suit and the execution of 
instruments of assignment in favor of the Government) in obtaining 
recovery.
    (i) Upon completion or expiration of this contract, any Government 
property which has not been consumed in the performance of this contract 
or which has not been previously disposed of in accordance with the

[[Page 205]]

provisions of this clause, or for which the Contractor has not otherwise 
been relieved of responsibility, shall be disposed of as the Contracting 
Officer may direct. The Contractor shall in no way be relieved of 
responsibility for Government property without the prior written 
approval of the Contracting Officer.
    (j) If the Contracting Officer determines that the interests of the 
Government require removal of any Government-Furnished Property, or if 
the Contractor determines any Government-Furnished Property to be in 
excess of its need under this contract such Government-Furnished 
Property shall be disposed of in the same manner as covered by paragraph 
(i) above. In the event that the Contracting Officer requires the 
removal of any Government-Furnished Property under this paragraph (j) or 
paragraph (i) above, upon timely written request of the Contractor, an 
equitable adjustment shall be made in the contract price to cover the 
direct cost to the Contractor of such removal and of any property damage 
occasioned thereby.

                   Clause No. 29--Printing (JUN 1977)

    Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the Contractor shall 
not engage in, nor subcontract for, any printing (as that term is 
defined in Title I of the Government Printing and Binding Regulations in 
effect on the effective date of this contract) in connection with the 
performance of work under this

[[Page 207]]

contract: Provided, however, That performance of a requirement under 
this contract involvingthe reproduction of less than 5,000 production 
units of any one page, or less than 25,000 production units in the 
aggregate of multiple pages, will not be deemed to be printing. A 
production unit is defined as one sheet, size 8 by 10 and \1/2\ inches, 
one side only, one color.

                             (End of clause)

      Clause No. 30--Price Reduction for Defective Cost or Pricing

    The following clause applies to all contracts where cost and pricing 
data is required in accordance with P.L. 87-653.

     Price Reduction for Defective Cost or Pricing Data (June 1977)

    (a) If the Contracting Officer determines that any price negotiated 
in connection with this contract or any cost reimbursable under this 
contract was increased by any significant sums because the Contractor, 
or any subcontractor pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled 
``Subcontractor Cost, or Pricing Data'' or ``Subcontractor Cost or 
Pricing Data--Price Adjustments,'' or any subcontract clause therein 
required, furnished incomplete or inaccurate cost or pricing data or 
data not current as certified in its Contractor's Certificate of Current 
Cost or Pricing Data, then such price or cost shall be reduced 
accordingly and the contract shall be modified in writing to reflect 
such reduction.
    (b) Failure to agree on a reduction shall be a dispute concerning a 
question of fact within the meaning of the ``Disputes'' clause of this 
contract.

    (Note: Since the contract is subject to reduction under this clause 
by reason of defective cost or pricing data submitted in connection with 
certain subcontracts, it is expected that the Contractor may wish to 
include a clause in each such subcontract requiring the subcontractor to 
appropriately indemnify the Contractor. It is also expected that any 
subcontractor subject to such indemnification will generally require 
substantially similar indemnification for defective cost or pricing data 
required to be submitted by its lower tier subcontractors).

                             (End of clause)

           Clause No. 31--Subcontractor Cost and Pricing Data

    The following clause should be included in all contracts when the 
subcontracts of the type and size described therein are contemplated.

             Subcontractor Cost and Pricing Data (JUN 1977)

    (a) The Contractor shall require subcontractors hereunder to submit 
in writing cost or pricing data under the following circumstances:
    (1) Prior to award of any cost-reimbursed type, time and material, 
labor-hour, incentive, or price redeterminable subcontract the price of 
which is expected to exceed $100,000; and
    (2) Prior to the award of any other subcontract, the price of which 
is expected to exceed $100,000, or to the pricing of any subcontract 
change or other modification for which the price adjustment is expected 
to exceed $100,000, where the price or price adjustment is not based on 
adequate price competition, established catalog or market prices of 
commercial items sold in substantial quantities to the general public, 
or prices set by law or regulation.
    (b) The Contractor shall require subcontractors to certify, 
substantially the same form as that used in the certificate by the Prime 
Contractor to the Government, that, to the best of their knowledge and 
belief, the cost and pricing data submitted under (a) above are 
accurate, complete, and current as of the date of the execution, which 
date shall be as close as possible to the date of agreement on the 
negotiated price of the subcontract or subcontract change or 
modification.
    (c) The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause 
including this paragraph (c) in each of its cost-reimbursement type, 
time and material, labor-hour, price redeterminable, or incentive 
subcontracts hereunder, and in any other subcontract hereunder which 
exceeds $100,000 unless the price thereof is based on adequate price 
competition, established catalog or market prices of commercial items 
sold in substantial quantities to the general public, or prices set by 
law or regulation. In each such excepted subcontract hereunder which 
exceeds $100,000, the Contractor shall insert the substance of the 
following clause:

          Subcontractor Cost and Pricing Data--Price Adjustment

    (a) Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this clause shall become operative 
only with respect to any change or other modification made pursuant to 
one or more provisions of this contract which involves a price 
adjustment in excess of $100,000. The requirements of this clause shall 
be limited to such price adjustments.
    (b) The Contractor shall require subcontractors hereunder to submit 
cost or pricing data under the following circumstances:
    (1) Prior to award of any cost-reimbursement type, time and 
material, labor-hour,

[[Page 208]]

incentive, or price redeterminable subcontract, the price of which is 
expected to exceed $100,000; and
    (2) Prior to award of any other subcontract, the price of which is 
expected to exceed $100,000, or to the pricing of any subcontract change 
or other modification for which the price adjustment is expected to 
exceed $100,000, where the price or price adjustment is not based on 
adequate price competition, established catalog or market prices of 
commercial items sold in substantial quantities to the general public, 
or prices set by law or regulation.
    (c) The Contractor shall require subcontractors to certify, in 
substantially the same form as that used in the Certificate by the Prime 
Contractor to the Government, that, to the best of their knowledge and 
belief, the cost and pricing data submitted under (b) above are 
accurate, complete, and current as of the date of the execution, which 
date shall be as close as possible to the date of agreement on the 
negotiated price of the contract modification.
    (d) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause 
including this paragraph (d) in each subcontract hereunder which exceeds 
$100,000.

                             (End of clause)

                Clause No. 32--Advance Payment (JUN 1977)

    (a) Amount of Advance. At the request of the Contractor, and subject 
to the conditions hereinafter set forth, the Government shall make an 
advance payment, or advance payments from time to time, to the 
Contractor. No advance payment shall be made (1) without the approval of 
the office administering advance payments (hereinafter called the 
``Administering Office'' and designated in paragraph (k)(4) hereof) as 
with all advance payments theretofore made, shall exceed the amount 
stated in paragraph (k)(1) hereof; and (3) without a properly certified 
invoice or invoices.
    (b) Special Bank Account. Until all advance payments made hereunder 
are liquidated and the Administering Office approves in writing the 
release of any funds due and payable to the Contractor, all advance 
payments and all other payments under the contract shall be made by 
check payable to the Contractor, and be marked for deposit only in a 
Special Bank Account with the bank designated in paragraph (k)(2) 
hereof. No part of the funds in the Special Bank Account shall be 
mingled with other funds of the Contractor prior to withdrawal thereof 
from the Special Bank Account as hereinafter provided. Except as 
hereinafter provided, each withdrawal shall be made only by check of the 
Contractor countersigned on behalf of the Government by the Contracting 
Officer or such other person or persons as he/she may designate in 
writing (hereinafter called the ``Countersigning Agent''). Until 
otherwise determined by the Administering Office, countersignature on 
behalf of the Government will not be required.
    (c) Use of Funds. The funds in the Special Bank Account may be 
withdrawn by the Contractor solely for the purpose of making payments 
for items of allowable cost or to reimburse the Contractor for such 
items of allowable cost, and or such other purposes as the Administering 
Office may approve in writing. Any interpretation required as to the 
proper use of funds shall be made in writing by the Administering 
Office.
    (d) Return of Funds. The Contractor may at any time repay all or any 
part of the funds advanced hereunder. Whenever so requested in writing 
by the Administering Office, the Contractor shall repay to the 
Government such part of the unliquidated balance of advance payments as 
shall in the opinion of the Administering Office be in excess of current 
requirements, or (when added to total advance previously made and 
liquidated) in excess of the amount specified in paragraph (k)(1) 
hereof. In the event the Contractor fails to repay such part of the 
unliquidated balance of advance payments when so requested by the 
Administering Office, all or any part thereof may be withdrawn from the 
Special Bank Account by checks payable to the Treasurer of the United 
States signed solely by the Countersigning Agent and applied in 
reduction of advance payments then outstanding hereunder.
    (e) Liquidation. If not otherwise liquidated, the advance payments 
made hereunder shall be liquidated as herein provided. When the sum of 
all payments under this contract, other than advance payments, plus the 
unliquidated amount of advance payments are equal to the total estimated 
cost for the work under this contract or such lesser amount to which the 
total estimated cost under this contract may have been reduced, plus 
increases, if any, in this total estimated cost not exceeding, in the 
aggregate (including, without limitation, reimbursable costs incident to 
termination for cause and retrocession as estimated by the Contracting 
Officer), the Government shall thereafter withhold further payments to 
the Contractor and apply the amounts withheld against the Contractor's 
obligation to repay such advance payments until such advance payments 
shall have been fully liquidated. If upon completion, termination, or 
retrocession of the contract all advance payments have not been fully 
liquidated, the balances therefor shall be deducted from any sums 
otherwise due or which may become due to the Contractor from the 
Government, and any deficiency shall be paid by the Contractor to the 
government upon demand.
    (f) Bank Agreement. Before an advance payment is made hereunder, the 
Contractor shall transmit to the Administering Office,

[[Page 209]]

in the form prescribed by such office, an Agreement in triplicate from 
the bank in which the Special Bank Account is established, clearly 
setting forth the special character of the account and the 
responsibilities of the bank thereunder. Wherever possible, such bank 
shall be a member bank of the Federal Reserve System, or an ``insured'' 
bank within the meaning of the Act creating the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation Act of August 23, 1935, 49 Stat. 685, as amended 
(12 U.S.C. 264).
    (g) Lien on Special Bank Account. The Government shall have a lien 
upon any balance in the Special Bank Account paramount to all other 
items, which lien shall secure the repayment or any advance payments 
made hereunder.
    (h) Lien on Property under Contract. Any and all advance payments 
made under this contract shall be secured, when made, by a lien in favor 
of the Government, paramount to all other liens, upon the supplies or 
other things covered by this contract and on all material and other 
property acquired for or allocated to the performance of this contract, 
except to the extent that the Government by virtue of any other 
provision of this contract, or otherwise, shall have valid title to such 
supplies, materials, or other property as against other creditors of the 
Contractor. The Contractor shall identify, by marking or segregation, 
all property which is subject to a lien in favor of the Government by 
virtue of any provision of this contract in such a way as to indicate 
that it is subject to such lien and that it has been acquired for or 
allocated to the performance of this contract. If for any reason such 
supplies, materials, or other property are not identified by marking or 
segregation, the Government shall be deemed to have a lien to the extent 
of the Government's interest under this contract on any mass of property 
with which such supplies, materials, or other property are commingled. 
The Contractor shall maintain adequate accounting control over such 
property on its books and records. If at any time during the progress of 
the work on the contract it becomes necessary to deliver any item or 
items and materials upon which the Government has a lien as aforesaid to 
a third person, the Contractor shall notify such third person of the 
lien herein provided and shall obtain from such third person a receipt, 
in duplicate, acknowledging, inter alia the existence of such lien. A 
copy of each receipt shall be delivered by the Contractor to the 
Contracting Officer. If this contract is terminated in whole or in part 
and the Contractor is authorized to sell or retain termination inventory 
acquired for or allocated to this contract, such sale or retention shall 
be made only if approved by the Contracting Officer, which approval 
shall constitute a release of the Government's lien hereunder to the 
extent that such termination inventory is sold or retained, and to the 
extent that the proceeds of the sale, or the credit allowed for such 
retention on the Contractor's termination claim, is applied in reduction 
of advance payments then outstanding hereunder.
    (i) Insurance. The Contractor represents and warrants that it is now 
maintaining with responsible insurance carriers, (1) insurance upon its 
own plant and equipment against fire and other hazards to the extent 
that like properties are usually insured by other operating plants and 
properties of similar character in the same general locality; (2) 
adequate insurance against liability on account of damage to persons or 
property; and (3) adequate insurance under all applicable workmen's 
compensation laws. The Contractor agrees that, until work under this 
contract has been completed and all advance payments made hereunder have 
been liquidated, it will (i) maintain such insurance; (ii) maintain 
adequate insurance upon any materials, parts, assemblies, subassemblies, 
supplies, equipment and other property acquired for or allocable to this 
contract and subject to the Government lien hereunder; and (iii) furnish 
such certificates with respect to its insurance as the Administering 
Office may from time to time require.
    (j) Prohibition against Assignment. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this contract, the Contractor shall not transfer, pledge, 
or otherwise assign this contract, or any interest therein, or any claim 
arising thereunder, to any party or parties, bank, trust company, or 
other financing institution.
    (k) Designations and Determinations. (1) Amount. The amount of 
advance payments at any time outstanding hereunder shall not exceed 
$______.
    (2) Depository. The bank designated for the deposit of payments made 
hereunder shall be:
    (3) Interest Charge. No interest shall be charged for advance 
payments made hereunder. The Contractor shall charge interest at the 
rate of 6 percent per annum on subadvances or down payments to 
subcontractors, and such interest will be credited to the account of the 
Government. However, interest need not be charged on subadvances on 
nonprofit subcontracts with nonprofit educational or research 
institutions for experimental, research or development work.
    (4) Administering Office. The office administering advance payments 
shall be the office designated as having responsibility for awarding the 
contract.
    (l) Other Security. The terms of this contract shall be considered 
adequate security for advance payments hereunder, except that if at any 
time the administering office deems the security furnished by the 
Contractor to be inadequate, the Contractor shall furnish

[[Page 210]]

such additional security as may be satisfactory to the administering 
office, to the extent that such additional security is available.

                             (End of clause)

           Clause No. 33--Effect on Existing Rights (JUN 1977)

    (a) Nothing in this contract shall be construed as:
    (1) Affecting, modifying, diminishing, or otherwise impairing the 
sovereign immunity for suit enjoyed by an Indian tribe; or
    (2) Authorizing or requiring the termination of any existing trust 
responsibility of the United States with respect to the Indian people.

                             (End of clause)

        Clause No. 34--Federal, State, and Local Taxes (JUN 1977)

    (a) Except as may be otherwise provided in this contract, the 
contract price includes all applicable Federal, State, and local taxes 
and duties.
    (b) Nevertheless, with respect to any Federal excise tax or duty on 
the transactions or property covered by this contract, if a statute, 
court decision, written ruling, or regulation takes effect after the 
contract date, and (1) Results in the Contractor being required to pay 
or bear the burden of any such Federal excise tax or duty or increase in 
the rate thereof which would not otherwise have been payable on such 
transactions or property, the contract price shall be increased by the 
amount of such tax or duty or rate increase; Provided, That the 
Contractor if requested by the Contracting Officer, warrants in writing 
that no amount for such newly imposed Federal excise tax or duty or rate 
increase was included in the contract price as a contingency reserve or 
otherwise; or
    (2) Results in the Contractor not being required to pay or bear the 
burden of, or in its obtaining a refund or drawback of, any such Federal 
excise tax or duty which would otherwise have been payable on such 
transactions or property or which was the basis of an increase in the 
contract price, the contract price shall be decreased by the amount of 
the relief, refund, or drawback, or the amount shall be paid to the 
Government, as directed by the Contracting Officer. The contract price 
shall be similarly decreased if the Contractor, through its fault or 
negligence or its failure to follow instructions of the Contracting 
Officer, is required to pay or bear the burden of, or does not obtain, a 
refund or drawback of, any such Federal excise tax or duty.
    (c) No adjustment pursuant to paragraph (b) above will be made under 
this contract unless the aggregate amount thereof is or may reasonably 
be expected to be over $100.
    (d) As used in paragraph (b) above, the term ``contract date'' means 
the date set for the bid opening, or if this is a negotiated contract, 
the date of this contract. As to additional supplies or services 
procured by modification to this contract, the term ``contract date'' 
means the date of such modification.
    (e) Unless there does not exist any reasonable basis to sustain an 
exemption, the Government, upon request of the Contractor, without 
further liability, agrees, except as otherwise provided in this 
contract, to furnish evidence appropriate to establish exemption from 
any tax which the Contractor warrants in writing was excluded from the 
contract price. In addition, the Contracting Officer may furnish 
evidence to establish exemption from any tax that may, pursuant to this 
clause, give rise to either an increase or decrease in the contract 
price. Except as otherwise provided in this contract, evidence 
appropriate to establish exemption from duties will be furnished only at 
the direction of the Contracting Officer.
    (f) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of 
matters which will result in either an increase or decrease in the 
contract price, and shall take action with respect thereto as directed 
by the Contracting Officer.

PHS 352.280-6  Demurrage charge provisions for reusable cylinders and containers.

    The clause set forth below shall be inserted in solicitations and 
resultant contracts when delivery of the items may be in contractor-
furnished reusable gas cylinders or other containers.

 Demurrage Charge Provisions for Reusable Cylinders and Containers (APR 
                                  1984)

    (a) Reusable gas cylinders or other containers identified below by 
offereors shall remain the property of the Contractor (except as 
provided in (c) below), and will be loaned without charge to the 
Government for the period stipulated below. In computing the period 
involved, such free loan period shall commence on the first day after 
date of delivery of each container to the herein specified f.o.b. 
point(s). Offerors who specify less than ________ days (to be determined 
by the Contracting Officer in accordance with trade custom), shall have 
their offers increased for

[[Page 211]]

evaluation purposes only by an amount arrived at by multiplying the 
number of days less than the established free loan period by the daily 
rental charge. In the event the offeror does not specify a free loan 
period, such period shall be ________ days (insert the same number of 
days as the established free loan period). Beginning with the first day 
after expiration of the free loan period to and including the date the 
containers are delivered to the Contractor's designated carrier, the 
Government shall pay the Contractor demurrage (rental) in the amount 
specified below. No demurrage shall accrue to the Contractor in excess 
of the herein specified container's replacement value. For each 
container lost or damaged beyond repair while in the Government's 
possession, the Government shall pay to the Contractor the herein 
specified replacement value less allocable demurrage paid therefor. Such 
lost or damaged containers paid for by the Government shall become the 
property of the Government.
    (b) Empty containers will be delivered to the Contractor's 
designated carrier (offeror to identify applicable carrier below) f.o.b. 
points of original delivery specified in this solicitation/contract.

                 Offerors Shall Furnish the Following Information, as Applicable, for Containers

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) When the offeror indicates that containers have a replacement 
value of less than $10, the Government shall have the option to purchase 
containers and add the cost to the offered price. When purchase option 
is exercised, offers shall be evaluated accordingly. In this event, the 
container shall become the property of the Government.

    It is the policy of PHS to require institutions to establish and 
maintain proper measures to ensure the appropriate care and use of all 
animals involved in research, research training and biological testing 
(hereinafter referred to as activities) supported by PHS. PHS endorses 
the ``U.S. Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of 
Vertebrate Animals Used in

[[Page 215]]

Testing, Research and Training'' developed by the Interagency Research 
Animal Committee (IRAC). This policy is intended to implement and 
supplement those Principles.


<R05>
PHS 380.204  Applicability.

    (a) This policy is applicable to all PHS-supported activities 
involving animals, whether the activities are performed at an awardee 
institution, or any other institution, in the United States, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of the 
United States. Institutions in foreign countries receiving PHS support 
for activities involving animals shall comply with this policy, or 
provide evidence to PHS that acceptable standards for the humane care 
and use of the animals in PHS-supported activities will be met.
    (b) No PHS support for an activity involving animals will be 
provided to an individual unless that individual is affiliated with or 
sponsored by an institution which can and does assume responsibility for 
compliance with this policy for PHS-supported activities, or unless the 
individual makes other arrangements with PHS.
    (c) This policy does not supercede or preempt applicable State or 
local laws or regulations which impose more stringent standards for the 
care and use of laboratory animals. All institutions are required to 
comply, as applicable, with the Animal Welfare Act, and other Federal 
statutes and regulations relating to animals.


<R05>
PHS 380.205  Contractor implementation.

    (a) Animal Welfare Assurance. No activity involving animals will be 
supported by PHS until the institution conducting the activity has 
provided a written Assurance acceptable to PHS, setting forth compliance 
with the policy in this subpart for PHS-supported activities. Assurances 
shall be submitted to OPRR, Office of the Director, National Institutes 
of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Building 31, Room 4B09, Bethesda, 
Maryland 20892. The Assurance shall be typed on the institution's 
letterhead and signed by an institutional official. OPRR will provide 
the applicant institution with necessary instructions and an example of 
an acceptable Assurance. All Assurances submitted to PHS in accordance 
with the policy will be evaluated by OPRR to determine the adequacy of 
the institution's proposed program for the care and use of animals in 
PHS-supported activities. On the basis of this evaluation, OPRR may 
approve or disapprove the Assurance, or negotiate an acceptable 
Assurance with the institution. Approval of an Assurance will be for a 
specified period of time (no longer than five years) after which time 
the institution must submit a new Assurance to OPRR. OPRR may limit the 
period during which any particular approved Assurance shall remain 
effective or otherwise condition, restrict, or withdraw approval. 
Without an applicable PHS approved Assurance, no PHS-supported activity 
involving animals at the institution will be permitted to continue.
    (1) Institutional program for animal care and use. The Assurance 
shall fully describe the institution's program for the care and use of 
animals in PHS-supported activities. PHS requires institutions to use 
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Guide) as a basis 
for developing and implementing an institutional program for activities 
involving animals. The program description must include the following:
    (i) A list of every branch and major component of the institution, 
as well as a list of every branch and major component of any institution 
which is to be included under the Assurance;
    (ii) The lines of authority and responsibility for administering the 
program and ensuring compliance with this policy;
    (iii) The qualifications, authority and responsibility of the 
veterinarian(s) who will participate in the program;
    (iv) The membership list of the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee(s) (IACUC) \1\ established in accordance with the requirements 
set forth in this subpart;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The name Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) as 
used in this policy is intended as a generic term for a committee whose 
function is to ensure that the care and use of animals in PHS-supported 
activities is appropriate and humane in accordance with this policy. 
However, each institution may identify the committee by whatever name it 
chooses. Membership and responsibilities of the IACUC are set forth in 
PHS 380.205(d).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 216]]

    (v) The procedures which the IACUC will follow to fulfill the 
requirements set forth in this subpart;
    (vi) The health program for personnel who work in laboratory animal 
facilities or have frequent contact with animals;
    (vii) The gross square footage of each animal facility (including 
satellite facilities), the species housed therein and the average daily 
inventory, by species, of animals in each facility; and
    (viii) Any other pertinent information requested by OPRR.
    (2) Institutional status. Each institution must assure that its 
program and facilities are in one of the following categories:
    (i) Category 1-- Accredited by the American Association for the 
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). All of the 
institution's programs and facilities (including satellite facilities) 
for activities involving animals have been evaluated and accredited by 
AAALAC, or another accrediting body recognized by PHS.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ As of the issuance date of this policy the only accrediting body 
recognized by PHS is the American Association for Accredidation of 
Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Category 2-- Evaluated by the Institution. All of the 
institution's programs and facilities (including satellite facilities) 
for activities involving animals have been evaluated by the IACUC and 
will be reevaluated by the IACUC at least once each year. The IACUC 
shall use the Guide as a basis for evaluating the institution's program 
and facilities.

A report of the IACUC evaluation shall be submitted to the institutional 
official and updated on an annual basis.\3\ The initial report shall be 
submitted to OPRR with the Assurance. Annual reports of the IACUC 
evaluation shall be maintained by the institution and made available to 
OPRR upon request. The report must contain a description of the nature 
and extent of the institution's adherence to the Guide and this 
policy.\4\ The report must identify specifically any departures from 
provisions of the Guide and this policy, and state the reasons for each 
departure. If program or facility deficiencies are noted, the report 
must contain a reasonable and specific plan and schedule for correcting 
each deficiency. The report must distinguish significant deficiencies 
from minor deficiencies. A significant deficiency is one which, in the 
judgment of the IACUC and the institutional official, is or may be a 
threat to the health or safety of the animals. Failure of the IACUC to 
conduct an annual evaluation and submit the required report to the 
institutional official may result in PHS withdrawal of its approval of 
the Assurance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The IACUC may, at its discretion, determine the best means of 
conducting an evaluation of the institution's programs and facilities. 
The IACUC may invite ad hoc consultants to conduct or assist in 
conducting the evaluation. However, the IACUC remains responsible for 
the evaluation and report.
    \4\ If some of the institution's facilities are accredited by AAALAC 
or other accrediting body recognized by PHS, the report should identify 
those facilities and need not contain any further information about 
evaulation of those facilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). (i) Each 
institution shall appoint an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
(IACUC), qualified through experience and expertise of its members, to 
oversee the institution's animal program, facilities and procedures.
    (ii) The Assurance must include the names, position titles and 
credentials of the IACUC chairperson and the members. The committee 
shall consist of not less than five members, and shall include at least:
    (A) One Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, with training or experience 
in laboratory animal science and medicine, who has direct or delegated 
program responsibility for activities involving animals at the 
institution;
    (B) One practicing scientist experienced in research involving 
animals;
    (C) One member whose primary concerns are in a nonscientific area 
(for example, ethicist, lawyer, member of the clergy); and
    (D) One individual who is not affiliated with the institution in any 
way

[[Page 217]]

other than as a member of the IACUC, and is not a member of the 
immediate family of a person who is affiliated with the institution.
    (iii) An individual who meets the requirements of more than one of 
the categories detailed in PHS 380.205(d)(2)(i)-(iv) above, may fulfill 
more than one requirement. However, no committee may consist of less 
than five members.
    (b) Functions of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. As 
an agent of the institution, the IACUC shall, will respect to PHS-
supported activities:
    (1) Review at least annually the institution's program for humane 
care and use of animals;
    (2) Inspect at least annually all of the institution's animal 
facilities, including satellite facilities;
    (3) Review concerns involving the care and use of animals at the 
institution;
    (4) Make recommendations to the institutional official regarding any 
aspect of the institution's animal program, facilities or personnel 
training;
    (5) Review and approve, require modifications in (to secure 
approval), or withhold approval of those sections of PHS applications or 
proposals related to the care and use of animals, as specified in PHS 
380.205(f) of this subpart;
    (6) Review and approve, require modifications in (to secure 
approval), or withhold approval of proposed significant changes 
regarding the use of animals in ongoing activities; and
    (7) Be authorized to suspend an activity involving animals in accord 
with specifications set forth in this subpart.
    (c) Review of applications and proposals. In order to approve 
applications and proposals or proposed changes in ongoing activities, 
the IACUC shall conduct a review of those sections related to the care 
and use of animals and determine that the proposed activities are in 
accordance with this policy. In making this determination, the IACUC 
shall confirm that the activity will be conducted in accordance with the 
Animal Welfare Act insofar as it applies to the activity, and that the 
activity is consistent with the Guide, unless the IACUC determines that 
acceptable justification for a departure is presented. Furthermore, the 
IACUC shall determine that the activity conforms with the institution's 
Assurance and meets the following requirements:
    (1) Procedures with animals will avoid or minimize discomfort, 
distress and pain to the animals, consistent with sound research design.
    (2) Procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or 
distress to the animals will be performed with appropriate sedation, 
analgesia, or anesthesia, unless the procedure is justified for 
scientific reasons in writing by the investigator.
    (3) Animals that would otherwise experience severe or chronic pain 
or distress that cannot be relieved will be painlessly sacrificed at the 
end of the procedure or, if appropriate, during the procedure.
    (4) The living conditions of animals will be appropriate for their 
species and contribute to their health and comfort. The housing, feeding 
and nonmedical care of the animals will be directed by a veterinarian or 
a scientist trained and experienced in the proper care, handling and use 
of the species being maintained or studied.
    (5) Medical care for animals will be available and provided as 
necessary by a qualified veterinarian.
    (6) Personnel conducting procedures on the species being maintained 
or studies will be appropriately qualified and trained in those 
procedures.
    (7) Methods of euthanasia used will be consistent with the 
recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) 
Panel of Euthanasia \5\, unless a deviation is justified for scientific 
reasons in writing by the investigator.

      Subpart PHS 380.3--Acquisition of Drugs and Medical Supplies


<R05>
PHS 380.301  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart provides policies and procedures pertaining to the 
acquisition of drug products and medical supplies by PHS or PHS's 
contractors.


<R05>
PHS 380.302  Acquisition of drugs.


<R05>
PHS 380.302-1  Policy.

    (a) Drugs shall be acquired at the lowest possible price consistent 
with acceptable standards of identity, strength, quality, purity, safety 
and effectiveness, and with due regard for the welfare of the patient 
and the professional judgment of the prescriber.
    (b) Contracting activities shall ensure that drugs are acquired by 
generic name on a competitive basis whenever it is possible to obtain 
therapeutically effective drugs of established quality. However, the 
professional judgment of the prescriber to request drugs by brand name 
or house designation must be recognized when the best interest of the 
patient requires it. Similarly, scientific investigators have the 
prerogative to request drugs having end-product characteristics 
considered necessary for the conduct of research or investigations.
    (c) Prior to taking any acquisition action, the contracting officer 
shall ensure that the requested drug products are not available from 
mandatory sources such as Federal Supply Schedules. Part 103-26 of the 
HHS Material Management Manual describes sources of supply for drugs.


<R05>
PHS 380.302-2  Solicitation and contract requirements.

    The contracting officer should consider including statements similar 
to the following in solicitations and resultant contracts pertaining to 
drug products:
    (a) The offeror (contractor) guarantees that all requirements 
established by the Food and Drug Administration, HHS, have been met. 
These requirements include: plant sanitation, manufacturing, packaging,

PHS 380.304  Effectiveness of drug products.


<R05>
PHS 380.304-1  General.

    (a) The National Academy of Sciences National Research Council (NAS-
NRC) has established effectiveness classifications for the indication of 
drug products, based upon the following criteria:
    (1) Factual information that is freely available in scientific 
literature;
    (2) Factual information that is available from the Food and Drug 
Administration, the manufacturer, or other sources; and
    (3) Experience and informed judgment of the members of NAS-NRC 
panels.
    (b) The indications mentioned in the following categories refer to 
``the effect the drug purports or is represented to have under the 
conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed 
labeling.'' That is, the indications are the claims noted in the 
labeling of a given drug product.
    (1) Category A--Effective. For the presented indication, the drug is 
effective on the basis of the criteria cited in PHS 380.304-1(a) above.
    (2) Category B--Probably Effective. For the indication presented, 
effectiveness of the drug is probable on the basis of the criteria cited 
in PHS 380.304-1(a) but additional evidence is required before it can be 
assigned to Category A.
    (3) Category C--Possibly Effective. In relation to the indication in 
question, there is little evidence of effectiveness under any of the 
criteria cited in PHS

[[Page 220]]

380.304-1(a). The possibility that additional supporting evidence might 
be developed should not be ruled out, however.
    (4) Category D--Ineffective. In relation to the indication in 
question, there is no acceptable evidence under any of the criteria 
cited in PHS 380.304-1(a) to support a claim of effectiveness.


<R05>
PHS 380.304-2  Policy.

    (a) It is PHS policy to not acquire drug products classified 
``ineffective'' or ``possibly effective'' for use in its direct care 
programs. However, there are two exceptions to this policy:
    (1) Drug products categorized as ``ineffective'' and ``possibly 
effective'' may be acquired for use in the pursuit of approved clinical 
research products.
    (2) Drug products categorized as ``possibly effective'' may be 
acquired when no alternate means of therapy with drug products in the 
``probably effective'' or ``effective'' categories are available.
    (b) This policy applies to similar drug products marketed by the 
same or other firms.


<R05>
PHS 380.304-3  Procedures.

    (a) The contracting officer, prior to initiating action on a 
purchase request or request for contract for drug products, shall ensure 
that the items are screened against current lists of products identified 
by the Pharmacy Liaison Officer, Public Health Service, to determine 
whether acquisition of the items is prohibited, and that the individual 
actually performing the screening has annotated and initialed the 
request.
    (b) When the request is received for a drug product which is 
allowable under the exceptions stated in PHS 380.304-2, the contracting 
officer shall ensure that the appropriate justification is provided, 
that it is signed by the responsible program official, and that it is 
included in the contract or purchase request file.
    (c) When the request for a restricted drug product cannot be 
resolved by the substitution of another item, the contracting officer 
shall consider the request as a deviation and process it in accordance 
with Subpart 301.4.


<R05>
PHS 380.304-4  Distribution of information.

    (a) The Pharmacy Liaison Officer, Public Health Service, has

effective'' prior to publication in the Federal Register, and will be 
provided a monthly list of these drug products following publication in 
the Federal Register.
    (b) The principal official responsible for acquisition shall 
establish procedures for the distribution of information on the 
effectiveness of drug products and implement other controls necessary to

    Contracts with tribal organizations resulting from the submission of 
Indian Self-Determination Contract Proposals as authorized in Public Law 
93-638 shall be in accordance with 41 CFR Chapters 1 and 3, except as 
otherwise provided herein. If this subpart conflicts with any of the

<R05>
PHS 380.402  Waivers.

    (a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) waives Federal

submission of an Indian Self-Determination Contract Proposal will be 
effected without competition.
    (d) Proposed contracts under section 103 of the Indian Self-
Determination Act are exempted from the synopsis requirements of 41 CFR

terms set out in PHS 352.280-4(a).
    (b) Fixed-price contracts may be used in only these instances where 
costs can be precisely established. In addition to other provisions as 
the Secretary may from time to time require, the fixed-price contracts 
shall contain the terms set out in PHS 352.280-4(b).

year except that contracts may be made for a longer term up to three 
years subject to the availability of appropriations under the following 
circumstances:

indicate the desired term of the contract in the Self-Determination 
Contract Proposal.
    (b) Contract made for a term of more than one year may be 
renegotiated annually to reflect factors which include, but need not be 
limited to, cost increases beyond the control of the tribal contractor. 
Proposed changes in the services provided under the contract which 
reflect changes in program emphasis may be considered during the annual 
renegotiation if the changes fall within the general scope of the 
contract.


<R05>
PHS 380.407  Exemption from bonds.

    A tribal organization is not required to furnish performance and 
payment bonds before carrying out a contract under this subpart for the 
construction of public buildings or works as required by the Miller Act

organization shall require each of its subcontractors other than tribal 
organizations, to furnish both performance and payment bonds as follows:
    (a) A performance bond with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the 
approving official, and in an amount he/she deems adequate, for the 
protection of the United States.
    (b) A payment bond with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the

not more than $5,000,000, the payment bond shall be 40 percent of the 
total amount payable by the terms of the contract. Whenever the total 
amount payable by the terms of the contract is more than $5,000,000, the 
payment bond shall be $2,500,000.

conditions of these contracts when negotiated with an Indian tribe or 
tribal organization pursuant to the Act shall, to the extent applicable, 
be in accordance with the requirements set forth in 41 CFR Part 1-18 and 
Subpart 1-4.10. However, if there is a conflict between 41 CFR Part 1-18 
and Subpart 1-4.10, and any provision of the Act or 42 CFR Part 36, the 
Act or 42 CFR Part 36 shall govern. In addition these contracts shall 
include the special provisions identified in PHS 380.410.
    (b) Exceptions. (1) Subpart 1-18.10 of this title is not applicable.
    (2) The contract clauses required by 1-18.703-1 of this title shall

this title.
    (3) In all cases, the contracting officer shall obtain and insert 
the Wage Determination Decision issued by the Secretary of Labor in the 
contract prior to award of any contract for construction that falls 
within the purview of the Davis-Bacon Act. The Wage Determination 
Decision should be furnished sufficiently in advance of the contract 
award date to permit full consideration by the tribal organization and 
any prospective subcontractors.

<R04>
        Subpart PHS 380.5--Acquisitions Under the Buy Indian Act


<R05>
PHS 380.500  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth the policy on preferential acquisition from 
Indians under the negotiation authority of the Bay Indian Act. 
Applicability of this subpart is limited to acquisitions made by or on 
behalf of the Indian Health Service of the Public Health Service.

[[Page 224]]


<R05>
PHS 380.501  Policy.

    (a) The Indian Health Service will utilize the negotiation authority 
of the Buy Indian Act to give preference to Indians whenever the use of 
that authority is authorized and is practicable. The Buy Indian Act was 
enacted as a proviso to Section 23 of the Act of June 25, 1910, Chapter 
431, Pub. L. 313, 61st Congress, 36 Stat. 861,and prescribes the 
application of the advertising requirements of section 3709 of the 
Revised Statutes to the acquisition of Indian supplies. As set out in 25 
U.S.C. 47, the Buy Indian Act provides as follows:

    So far as may be practicable Indian labor shall be employed, and 
purchases of the products of Indian industry may be made in open market 
in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior.

    (b) The functions, responsibilities, authorities, and duties of the 
Secretary of the Interior for maintenance and operation of hospital and 
health facilities for Indians and for the conservation of the health of 
Indians were transferred to the Secretary of Health, Education, and 
Welfare, on July 1, 1955 by Pub. L. 568, 83rd Congress, 42 U.S.C. 2001 
et seq. Accordingly, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is 
authorized to use the Buy Indian Act in the acquisition of products of 
Indian industry in connection with the maintenance and operation of 
hospital and health facilities for Indians and for the conservation of 
the health of Indians. This authority has been delegated exclusively to 
the Indian Health Service and is not available for use by any other HHS 
component (unless that component is making an acquisition on behalf of 
the Indian Health Service).
    (c) Use of the Buy Indian Act negotiation authority has been 
emphasized in subsequent legislation, particularly Pub. L. 94-437 and 
Pub. L. 96-537.


<R05>
PHS 380.502  Definitions.


<R05>
PHS 380.502-1  Indian.

    Indian means a member of any tribe, pueblo, band, group, village or 
community that is recognized by the Secretary of the Interior as being 
Indian or any individual or group of individuals that is recognized by 
the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services in making such 
determinations may take into account the determination of the tribe with 
which affiliation is claimed.


<R05>
PHS 380.502-2  Indian firm.

    Indian firm means a sole enterprise, partnership, corporation, or 
other type of business organization owned, controlled, and operated by 
one or more Indians (including, for the purpose of sections 301 and 302 
of Pub. L. 94-437, former or currently federally recognized Indian 
tribes in the State of New York) or by an Indian firm; or a nonprofit 
firm organized for the benefit of Indians and controlled by Indians (see 
PHS 380.503(a)).


<R05>
PHS 380.502-3  Product of Indian industry.

    Product of Indian industry means anything produced by Indians 
through physical labor or by intellectual effort involving the use and 
application of skills by them.


<R05>
PHS 380.502-4  Buy Indian contract.

    Buy Indian contract means any contract involving activities covered 
by the Buy Indian Act that is negotiated under the provisions of 41 
U.S.C. 252(c)(15) and 25 U.S.C. 47 between an Indian firm and a 
contracting officer representing the Indian Health Service.


<R05>
PHS 380.502-5  Buy Indian restricted advertising.

    Buy Indian restricted advertising is a special method of negotiated 
acquisition conducted in the same manner as a formally advertised 
acquisition, except that competition and award are restricted to Indian 
firms (see FAR 19.101). Thus, a Buy Indian acquisition may be considered 
an acquisition set-aside for Indian firms in the manner that some 
acquisitions are set-aside for small business concerns (see FAR 19.101). 
Set-aside acquisitions are, technically, negotiated acquisitions but 
should be conducted as if they were formally advertised acquisitions in 
instances where the formal advertising method would be used if the set-
aside was not in effect.

[[Page 225]]


<R05>
PHS 380.503  Requirements.

    (a) Indian ownership. The degree of ownership that is called for by 
PHS 380.502-2 shall be 100 percent during the period covered by a Buy 
Indian contract unless a deviation from that 100 percent requirement is 
approved on an individual basis by the cognizant Area or Program Office 
Director of the Indian Health Service. Such a deviation, which may be to 
not less than 51 percent, must be accompanied by an appropriate 
justification for the deviation.
    (b) Joint ventures. An Indian firm may enter into a joint venture 
with other entities for specific projects as long as the Indian firm is 
the managing partner. However, the joint venture must be approved by the 
contracting officer prior to the award of a contract under the Buy 
Indian Act.
    (c) Bonds. In the case of contracts for the construction, 
alteration, or repair of public buildings or pubic works, performance 
and payment bonds are required by the Miller Act (40 U.S.C. 270a) and 
Part 28 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR Ch. 1). In the 
case of contracts with Indian tribes or public nonprofit organizations 
serving as governmental instrumentalities of an Indian tribe, bonds are 
not required. However, bonds are required when dealing with private 
business entities which are owned by an Indian tribe or members of an 
Indian tribe. Bonds may be required of private business entities which 
are joint ventures with, or subcontractors of, an Indian tribe or a 
public nonprofit organization serving as a governmental instrumentality 
of an Indian tribe. A bid guarantee or bid bond is required only when a 
performance or payment bond is required.
    (d) Indian preference in employment, training and subcontracting. 
Contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act are subject to the 
requirements of section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and 
Education Assistance Act (Pub. L. 93-638), which requires that 
preference be given to Indians in employment, training, and 
subcontracting. Subpart 370.2 and the contract clauses in 352.270-2 and 
352.270-3 represent the Department's implementation of section 7(b). The 
Indian Preference clause set forth in 352.270-2 shall be included in all 
Buy Indian solicitations and resultant contracts. The Indian Preference 
Program clause set forth in 352.270-3 shall be used as specified in 
370.202(b). All requirements set forth in Subpart 370.2 which are 
applicable to the instant Buy Indian acquisition shall be followed by 
the contracting officer, e.g., sections 370.204 and 370.205.
    (e) Subcontracting. Not more than 50 percent of the work to be 
performed under a prime contract awarded pursuant to the Buy Indian Act 
shall be subcontracted to other than Indian firms. For this purpose, 
work to be performed does not include the provision of materials, 
supplies, or equipment.
    (f) Wage rates. A determination of the minimum wage rates by the 
Secretary of Labor as required by the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a-5) 
shall be included in all contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act for 
over $2,000 for construction, alteration, or repair, including painting 
and decorating, of public buildings and public works, except contracts 
with Indian tribes or public nonprofit organizations serving as 
governmental instrumentalities of an Indian tribe. The wage rate 
determination is to be included in contracts with private business 
entities even if they are owned by an Indian tribe or members of an 
Indian tribe and in connection with joint ventures with, or 
subcontractors of, an Indian tribe or a public nonprofit organization 
serving as a governmental instrumentality of an Indian tribe.


<R05>
PHS 380.504  Competition.

    (a) Contracts to be awarded under the Buy Indian Act shall be 
subject to competition among Indians or Indian concerns to the maximum 
extent that competition is determined by the contracting officer to be 
practicable, pursuant to FAR 14.101 and FAR 15.105. When competition is 
determined not to be practicable, a Justification for Noncompetitive 
Acquisition shall be prepared in accordance with 315.7105 and 
subsequently retained in the contract file.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Subpart 315.71, a request for 
approval of noncompetitive acquisitions to be negotiated under the Buy 
Indian Act may, if $25,000 or less, be approved by

[[Page 226]]

the chief of the contracting office,or, if over $25,000, by the 
cognizant Area or Program Office Director. Approval shall be in the form 
of a Justification for Noncompetitive Acquisition.
    (c) Solicitations must be synopsized and publicized in the Commerce 
Business Daily (see FAR 5.2 and Subpart 305.2) and copies of the 
synopses sent to the tribal office of the Indian tribal government 
directly concerned with the proposed acquisition as well as to Indian 
concerns and others having a legitimate interest. The synopsis should 
state that the acquisition is restricted to Indian firms under the Buy 
Indian Act.


<R05>
PHS 380.505  Responsibility determinations.

    (a) A contract may be awarded under the Buy Indian Act only if it is 
first determined that the project or function to be contracted for is 
likely to be satisfactorily performed under such a contract and that the 
project or function is likely to be properly completed or maintained 
under that contract.
    (b) The determination called for by paragraph (a), to be made prior 
to the award of a contract, will be made in writing by the contracting 
officer reflecting an analysis of the standards set forth in FAR 9.104-
1, 309.104-1 of this chapter and PHS 380.502-2.

<R05>
401.000  Scope of part.

    This part presents basic policies and general information about the 
Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Acquisition Regulation, subsequently 
referred to as the AGAR. The AGAR is an integral part of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulations System.


<R04>
               Subpart 401.1--Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
401.101  Purpose.

    (a) The AGAR provides for the codification and publication of 
uniform policies and procedures for acquisitions by contracting 
activities within USDA.
    (b) The purpose of the AGAR is to implement the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR), where further implementation is needed, and to 
supplement the FAR when coverage is needed for subject matter not 
covered in the FAR. The AGAR is not by itself a complete document, as it 
must be used in conjunction with the FAR.


<R05>
401.103  Authority.

    The AGAR and amendments thereto are issued under 5 U.S.C. 301 and 40 
U.S.C. 486(c). The Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) has the delegated 
authority to promulgate Departmental acquisition regulations.


<R05>
401.104  Applicability.

    The FAR and AGAR apply to all USDA acquisitions of supplies and 
services (including construction) which obligate appropriated funds, 
unless otherwise specified in this chapter or excepted by law.


<R05>
401.105  Issuance.


<R05>
401.105-1  Publication and code arrangement.

    (a) The AGAR is codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as 
Chapter 4 of Title 48, Federal Acquisition Regulations System, to 
implement and supplement Chapter 1 which constitutes the FAR. Parts 400 
through 499 have been assigned to USDA by the Office of the Federal 
Register.
    (b) The AGAR and its subsequent changes are published in:

[[Page 230]]

    (1) Daily issues of the Federal Register,
    (2) Cumulative form in the CFR, and
    (3) Loose-leaf form for distribution within USDA.
    (c) Section 553(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 
553, provides an exception from the standard public rulemaking 
procedures to the extent that the rule involves a matter relating to 
agency management or personnel or to public property, loans, grants, 
benefits, or contracts. OFPP Policy Letter 83-2 requires rulemaking for 
substantive acquisition rules but allows discretion in the matter for 
other than significant issues meeting the stated criteria. The AGAR has 
been promulgated and may be revised from time to time in accordance with 
the rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act and OFPP 
Policy Letter 83-2.


<R05>
401.105-2  Arrangement of regulations.

    AGAR coverage parallels the FAR in format, arrangement, and 
numbering system. However, subdivisions below the section and subsection 
levels may not always correlate directly to FAR designated paragraphs 
and subparagraphs.


<R05>
401.105-3  Copies.

    Copies of the AGAR published in CFR form may be purchased from the 
Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
D.C. 20402. Requests should reference Chapter 4 of Title 48 CFR.


<R05>
401.106  OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

    The following OMB control numbers apply to USDA solicitations and 
specified information collections within the AGAR:

otherwise controlling the relationship between USDA (including any of 
its contracting activities) and contractors or prospective contractors.
    (b) Each designated head of a contracting activity (HCA) is 
authorized to issue or authorize the issuance of, at any organizational 
level, internal guidance which does not have a significant effect beyond 
the internal operating procedures of the activity, or a significant cost 
or administrative impact on offerors or contractors. Internal guidance 
issued by contracting activities will not be published in the Federal

System to determine applicability to other agencies and for recommending 
coverage to the FAR Secretariat for inclusion in the FAR.
    (e) Recommendations for revision of existing FAR coverage or new FAR 
coverage shall be submitted by the HCA to the SPE for further action.


<R05>
401.370  Exclusions.

    Subject to the policies of FAR subpart 1.3, certain USDA acquisition 
policies and procedures may be excluded from the AGAR under

months.
    (b) Subject matter which is instituted on an experimental basis for 
a reasonable period.
    (c) Acquisition procedures instituted on an interim basis to comply 
with the requirements of statute, regulation, Executive Order, OMB 
Circular, or OFPP Policy Letter.


<R05>
401.371  AGAR Advisories.

    The SPE may issue AGAR Advisories, consistent with the policies of 
the FAR and the AGAR, for the following purposes:
    (a) To communicate Department-wide policy and/or procedural guidance

    (c) To establish internal policy and procedures on an interim basis, 
prior to incorporation in the AGAR or in a Departmental Directive.


<R05>
401.372  Departmental directives.

    Subject to the policies of FAR 1.3, USDA from time to time may issue

include Departmental Regulations (DR's), Departmental Notices, and 
Secretary's Memoranda.

[[Page 232]]


<R04>
             Subpart 401.4--Deviations From the FAR and AGAR


<R05>
401.402  Policy.

    Requests for authority to deviate from the provisions of the FAR or 
the AGAR shall be submitted in writing as far in advance as the 
exigencies of the situation will permit. Each request for deviation 
shall contain the following:
    (a) A statement of the deviation desired, including identification 
of the specific paragraph number(s) of the FAR and AGAR;
    (b) The reason why the deviation is considered necessary or would be 
in the best interest of the Government;
    (c) If applicable, the name of the contractor and identification of 
the contract affected;
    (d) A statement as to whether the deviation has been requested 
previously and, if so, circumstances of the previous request;
    (e) A description of the intended effect of the deviation;
    (f) A statement of the period of time for which the deviation is 
needed; and
    (g) Any pertinent background information which will contribute to a 
full understanding of the desired deviation.


<R05>
401.403  Individual deviations.

    In individual cases, deviations from either the FAR or the AGAR will 
be authorized only when essential to effect a necessary acquisition or 
where special circumstances make such deviations clearly in the best 
interest of the Government. Except for cost principles, HCA's may 
approve individual deviations from the AGAR, after coordinating with the 
General Counsel and the SPE. No deviations from the FAR or AGAR may be 
authorized at the contracting office level. A copy of each deviation and 
its supporting documentation shall be provided to the SPE. Deviations 
from the FAR shall not be made unless such action is authorized by the 
SPE after consultation with the Office of the General Counsel and any 
other appropriate office, on the basis of a written justification 
stating clearly the special circumstances involved.


<R05>
401.404  Class deviations.

    Where deviations from the FAR or AGAR are considered necessary for 
classes of contracts, requests for authority to deviate shall be 
submitted in writing to the SPE for approval. The SPE may authorize 
class deviations from the FAR without consulting the Chairperson of the 
Civilian Agency Acquisition Council where urgency precludes 
consultation. The SPE shall subsequently inform the Chairperson of the 
Civilian Agency Acquisition Council of the deviation including the 
circumstances under which it was required.


<R04>
        Subpart 401.6--Contracting Authority and Responsibilities


<R05>
401.601  General.

    (a) The authority and responsibility vested in the Secretary to 
manage USDA's acquisition function is delegated through the Assistant 
Secretary for Administration to the SPE. This broad authority includes, 
but is not limited to, the following responsibilities:
    (1) Prescribing and publishing Departmental acquisition policies, 
regulations, and procedures.
    (2) Taking any necessary actions consistent with policies, 
regulations, and procedures with respect to purchases, contracts, 
leases, and other transactions.
    (3) Designating contracting officers.
    (4) Establishing clear lines of contracting authority.
    (5) Evaluating and monitoring the performance of USDA's acquisition 
system.
    (6) Managing and enhancing career development of the contracting 
work force.
    (7) Participating in the development of Government-wide acquisition 
policies, regulations, and standards; and determining specific areas 
where government-wide performance standards should be established and 
applied.
    (8) Determining areas of Department-unique standards and developing 
unique Department-wide standards.
    (9) Certifying to the Secretary that the acquisition system meets 
approved standards.

[[Page 233]]

    (b) The SPE may delegate contracting authority to the Heads of 
Contracting Activities (HCA's) and the responsibility to manage their 
acquisition function.
    (c) Unless prohibited by the FAR, the AGAR, or by other applicable 
statutes and regulations, the SPE may redelegate to HCA's the authority 
to make determinations as the agency head in order to implement the 
policies and procedures of the FAR. Such delegations shall be in 
writing, but need not be published.
    (d) Unless prohibited by the FAR, the AGAR, or by other applicable 
statutes or regulations, each HCA may designate one individual from the 
contracting activity to carry out the functions of the HCA (HCAD). The 
HCAD may exercise all authority delegated to the HCA.


<R05>
401.602  Contracting officers.


<R05>
401.602-3  Ratification of unauthorized commitments.

    (a) Definitions. Ratification, as used in this section, means the 
signed, documented action taken by an authorized official to approve and 
sanction a previously unauthorized commitment.
    Unauthorized commitment, as used in this section, means an agreement 
made by a Government representative who lacked the authority to enter 
into a contract on behalf of the Government.
    (b) Policy. The HCA may delegate ratification authority to the chief 
of the contracting office.
    (c) Procedure. Whenever an official of the cognizant contracting 
activity who is authorized to ratify unauthorized commitments learns 
that a person or firm has assumed work as a result of an unauthorized 
commitment, that official shall take the following actions:
    (1) Immediately inform any person who is performing work as a result 
of an unauthorized commitment that the work is being performed at that 
person's risk;
    (2) Inform the individual who made the unauthorized commitment of 
the seriousness of the act and the possible consequences;
    (3) Ensure that the individual who made the unauthorized commitment 
furnishes all records and documents concerning the commitment and a 
complete, written statement of facts, including, but not limited to: a 
statement as to why a contracting officer was not used; why the vendor 
was selected and a list of sources considered; a description of work to 
be performed or products to be furnished; the estimated or agreed price; 
whether an appropriation is available for the work; and whether 
performance has begun. Under exceptional circumstances, such as when the 
individual who made the unauthorized commitment is no longer available 
to attest to the circumstances of the unauthorized commitment, the 
ratifying official may waive these requirements; and
    (4) Decide whether ratification is proper and proceed as follows:
    (i) If ratification is not justifiable, provide the cognizant 
program office, contracting office, and the unauthorized contractor with 
an explanation of the decision not to ratify.
    (ii) If ratification appears adequately justified, ratify the action 
and retain or assign the contract to a successor contracting officer if 
necessary.
    (iii) Maintain related approval, decisional, and background 
documents in the contract file for audit purposes.
    (iv) Notify the cognizant program supervisor or line officer about 
the final disposition of the case; the notification may include a 
recommendation that the unauthorized commitment should be further 
considered a violation of USDA's employee conduct regulations.


<R05>
401.603  Selection, appointment, and termination of appointment.


<R05>
401.603-1  General.

    An HCA may delegate contracting authority to the extent authorized 
by the SPE in a general delegation of acquisition authority, by 
appointing qualified individuals as contracting officers, in accordance 
with the USDA Contracting Officer Warrant System, Departmental 
Regulation 5001-1.

authority in 7 CFR 2.24, the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) is 
designated as the debarring official (Department Debarring Officer) with 
the following exceptions:
    (a) For commodity contracts awarded on behalf of the Commodity 
Credit Corporation (CCC), the Executive Vice President, CCC, or his 
designee is designated as the debarring official pursuant to 7 CFR part 
1407.
    (b) For contracts awarded under the School Lunch and Surplus Removal 
Programs (42 U.S.C. 1755 and 7 U.S.C. 612c), the Department Debarring 
Officer has delegated debarring authority to the Agricultural Marketing 
Service (AMS).

[63 FR 26995, May 15, 1998]


<R05>
409.404  List of parties excluded from Federal procurement and nonprocurement programs.

    The Department Debarring Officer is USDA's single point of contact 
with GSA for debarment and suspension actions taken under this subpart. 
The debarring official for AMS shall notify the Department Debarring 
Officer of each debarment and suspension action by promptly submitting a 
copy of the debarment or suspension notice and any later changes to the 
debarment or suspension status. The Department Debarring Officer will 
forward a copy of each notice to GSA for inclusion in the Government-
wide list.


<R05>
409.405  Effect of listing.

    Compelling reasons are considered to be present where failure to 
contract with the debarred or suspended contractor would seriously harm 
the agency's programs and prevent accomplishment of mission 
requirements. The SPE is authorized to make the determinations under FAR 
9.405. Requests for such determinations shall be submitted through the 
head of the contracting activity (HCA) to the SPE.


<R05>
409.405-1  Continuation of current contracts.

    The HCA is authorized to make the determinations under FAR 9.405-1.


<R05>

<R05>
409.406  Debarment.


<R05>
409.406-3  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. When a contracting officer becomes 
aware of possible irregularities or any information which may be 
sufficient cause for debarment, the case shall be immediately referred 
through the HCA to the debarring official. The case must be accompanied 
by a complete statement of the facts (including a copy of

[[Page 243]]

any criminal indictments, if applicable) along with a recommendation for 
action. Where the statement of facts indicates the irregularities to be 
possible criminal offenses, or for any other reason further 
investigation is considered necessary, the matter shall be referred to 
the HCA who should consult with the Office of Inspector General to 
determine if further investigation is required prior to referring to the 
debarring official.
    (b) Decision-making process. If, after reviewing the recommendations 
and consulting with the Office of Inspector General and Office of the 
General Counsel, as appropriate, the debarring official determines 
debarment is justified, the debarring official shall initiate the 
proposed debarment in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and notify the HCA 
of the action taken.
    (c) Fact-finding proceeding. For actions listed under FAR 9.406-
3(b)(2), the contractor shall be given the opportunity to appear at an 
informal hearing. The hearing should be held at a location and time that 
is convenient to the parties concerned, if at all possible. The 
contractor and any specifically named affiliates may be represented by 
counsel or any duly authorized representative. Witnesses may be called 
by either party. The proceedings shall be conducted expeditiously and in 
such a manner that each party will have an opportunity to present all 
information considered pertinent to the proposed debarment. The 
contractor shall be provided a copy of a transcript of the proceedings 
under the conditions established in FAR 9.406-3(b)(2)(ii).


<R05>
409.407  Suspension.


<R05>
409.407-3  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. When a contracting officer becomes 
aware of possible irregularities or any information which may be 
sufficient cause for suspension, the case shall be immediately referred 
through the HCA to the debarring official. The case must be accompanied 
by a complete statement of the facts along with a recommendation for 
action. Where the statement of facts indicates the irregularities to be 
possible criminal offenses, or for any other reason further 
investigation is considered necessary, the matter shall be referred to 
the HCA who should consult with the Office of Inspector General to 
determine if further investigation is required prior to referring it to 
the debarring official.
    (b) Decision-making process. If, after reviewing the recommendations 
and consulting with the Office of Inspector General and Office of the 
General Counsel, as appropriate, the debarring official determines 
suspension is justified, the debarring official shall initiate the 
proposed suspension in accordance with FAR 9.407-3(c) and notify the HCA 
of the action taken.
    (c) Fact-finding proceedings. For actions listed under FAR 9.407-
3(b)(2), the contractor shall be given the opportunity to appear at an 
informal hearing, similar in nature to the hearing for debarments as 
discussed in 409.406-3(c).

official's decision by mailing or otherwise furnishing a written notice 
within 90 days from the date of the decision to the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals, Washington, DC 20250. A copy of 
the notice of appeal shall be furnished to the debarring officer from 
whose decision the appeal is taken. Appeals under subpart 409.4 shall be 
governed by the rules and procedures of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals set forth in 7 CFR part 24.

    (2) An analysis of the potential conflict, including the benefits 
and detriments to the Government and prospective contractors;

[[Page 244]]

or mitigated; and
    (4) Advice of counsel obtained under FAR 9.504(b).

    (a) Throughout the source selection process, agency personnel and 
non-Government evaluators with access to proposal information shall 
disclose neither the number of offerors nor their identity except as 
authorized by FAR subpart 15.5. (See also FAR 5.403.)
    (b) The contracting officer shall obtain the following written 
agreement from the non-Government evaluator prior to the release of any 
proposal to that evaluator.

         AGREEMENT GOVERNING THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PROPOSALS

RFP_____________________________________________________________________
Offeror_________________________________________________________________
    1. To the best of my knowledge and belief, no conflict of interest 
exists that may diminish my capacity to perform an impartial and 
objective review of the offeror's proposal, or may otherwise result in a 
biased opinion or an unfair advantage. If a potential conflict of 
interest arises or if I identify such a conflict, I agree to notify the 
Government promptly concerning the potential conflict. In determining 
whether any potential conflict of interest exists, I agree to review 
whether my or my employer's relationships with other persons or 
entities, including, but not limited to, ownership of stocks, bonds, 
other outstanding financial interests or commitments, employment 
arrangements (past, present, or under consideration), and, to the extent 
known by me, all financial interests and employment arrangements of my 
spouse, minor children, and other members of my immediate household, may 
place me in a position of conflict, real or apparent, with the 
evaluation proceedings.
    2. I agree to use proposal information only for evaluation purposes. 
I understand that any authorized restriction on disclosure placed upon 
the proposal by the prospective contractor or subcontractor or by the 
Government shall be applied to any reproduction or abstracted 
information of the proposal. I agree to use my best effort to safeguard 
such information physically, and not to disclose the contents of, or 
release any information relating to, the proposal(s) to anyone outside 
of the Source Evaluation Board or other panel assembled for this 
acquisition, the Contracting Officer, or other individuals designated by 
the Contracting Officer.
    3. I agree to return to the Government all copies of proposals, as 
well as any abstracts, upon completion of the evaluation.

       ``AGREEMENT GOVERNING THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PROPOSALS''

RFP#____________________________________________________________________
Offeror_________________________________________________________________

    1. To the best of my knowledge and belief, no conflict of interest 
exists that may diminish my capacity to perform an impartial and 
objective review of the offeror's proposal, or may otherwise result in a 
biased opinion or an unfair advantage. If a potential conflict of 
interest arises or if I identify such a conflict, I agree to notify the 
Government promptly concerning the potential conflict. In determining 
whether any potential conflict of interest exists, I agree to review 
whether me or my employer's relationships with other persons or 
entities, including, but not limited to, ownership of stocks, bonds, 
other outstanding financial interests or commitments, employment 
arrangements (past, present, or under consideration), and, to the extent 
known by me, all financial interests and employment arrangements of my 
spouse, minor children, and other members of my immediate household, may 
place me in a position of conflict, real or apparent, with the 
evaluation proceedings.
    2. I agree to use proposal information only for evaluation purposes. 
I understand that any authorized restriction on disclosure placed upon 
the proposal by the prospective contractor or subcontractor or by the 
Government shall be applied to any reproduction or abstracted 
information of the proposal. I agree to use my best effort to safeguard 
such information physically, and not to disclose the contents of, or 
release any information relating to, the proposal(s) to anyone outside 
of the Source Evaluation Board or other panel assembled for this 
acquisition, the

[[Page 251]]

Contracting Officer, or other individuals designated by the Contracting 
Officer.
    3. I agree to return to the Government all copies of proposals, as 
well as any abstracts, upon completion of the evaluation.

<R05>
419.201  General policy.

    It is the policy of USDA to provide a fair portion of its 
contracting and subcontracting opportunities to small, disadvantaged, 
minority, and women-owned businesses.


<R05>
419.201-70  Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU).

    The Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) 
develops rules, policy, procedures and guidelines for the effective 
administration of USDA's small and disadvantaged business procurement 
preference program to include minority and women-owned business.


<R05>
419.201-71  Small business coordinators.

    The head of the contracting activity (HCA) or a representative of 
the HCA shall designate in writing a small business coordinator in each 
contracting office. Supervisors of small business coordinators are 
encouraged to provide sufficient time for the coordinators to carry out 
their small business program duties. Coordinators' duties shall include, 
but not be limited to, the following:
    (a) Review each proposed acquisition expected to exceed the 
simplified acquisition threshold prior to its solicitation. The 
coordinator shall:
    (1) Recommend section 8(a) action and identify potential 
contractors, or
    (2) Identify available minority and women-owned businesses to be 
solicited by competitive procedures. Coordinators shall document the 
contract file with recommendations made and actions taken.
    (b) Participate in goal-setting procedures and planning activities 
and establish aggressive minority and women-owned business goals based 
on the annual review of advance acquisition plans.
    (c) Participate in the review of those contracts which require the 
successful offeror to submit written plans for the utilization of small 
and small disadvantaged businesses as subcontractors.
    (d) Ensure that purchases exceeding $2,500 and not exceeding the 
simplified acquisition threshold are reserved exclusively for small 
businesses, including minority and women-owned businesses. This policy 
shall be implemented unless the contracting officer is unable to obtain 
offers from two or more small business concerns that are competitive 
with market prices and in terms of quality and delivery of the goods or 
services being purchased.
    (e) Maintain comprehensive source listings of small businesses.
    (f) Upon written request, provide small, minority and women-owned 
businesses the bidders mailing lists of individuals receiving 
solicitations which will contain the subcontracting clause entitled 
``Utilization of Small Business Concerns and Small Disadvantaged 
Business Concerns.'' These lists may be limited to those supplies or 
services of major interest to the requesting firms.

[[Page 255]]

    (g) Develop a program of contacts with local, small, minority, and 
women-owned trade, business, and professional associations and 
organizations and Indian tribal councils to apprise them of USDA's 
program needs and recurring contract requirements.
    (h) Periodically meet with program managers to discuss requirements 
of the small business preference program, explore the feasibility of 
breaking large complex requirements into smaller lots suitable for 
participation by small firms, and encourage program managers to meet 
with these firms so that their capabilities can be demonstrated.
    (i) Establish internal operating procedures which implement the 
requirements of the regulations as set forth in this part 419. Compile 
data and prepare all reports pertaining to the small, minority and 
women-owned business activities. Ensure that these reports are accurate, 
complete and up-to-date.
    (j) Assist and counsel small business firms and especially those 
found to be nonresponsive or nonresponsible to help qualify them for 
future awards.
    (k) Review proposed large contract requirements to determine the 
potential for breaking out components suitable for purchase from small 
business firms.
    (l) Ensure that the SBA Resident Procurement Center Representative 
(PCR) is provided an opportunity and reasonable time to review any 
solicitation that meets the dollar threshold for small business and 
small disadvantaged business subcontracting plans.

or more AR&WPP Coordinators in writing to represent the mission area, 
serve on the Council of Coordinators, and work in conjunction with the 
USDA Environmental Executive.
    (2) Each USDA organization periodically will conduct an audit 
(survey or inventory) of the waste stream generated by the organization. 
The goals of the audit are:
    (i) To identify and measure the elements of waste generated in its 
operations;
    (ii) To identify processes, equipment, techniques, or materials 
which generate waste in energy or materials;
    (iii) To identify actions which can be taken to reduce and to 
recycle or recover the wastes generated; and
    (iv) To assign time frames to accomplish those actions.
    (3) Each USDA organization will implement an avoidance or recovery 
or recycling program based on the results of the waste stream audit.
    (4) Each USDA organization will implement a plan to install on-going 
waste prevention techniques.

preparation, implementation, and monitoring of its affirmative 
procurement program is shared between program personnel and procurement 
personnel.
    (6) Each USDA organization will establish measurable goals by which 
the effectiveness of its participation in AR&WPP can be assessed on an 
annual basis.
    (7) Each USDA organization will sponsor annual awards to recognize 
the most innovative environmental program of the year.
    (d) Acquisition and administration. (1) Each USDA organization will 
annually review its product descriptions to enhance the use of recovered 
materials and environmentally preferable products and services by 
eliminating from the product description:
    (i) Any exclusion of recovered materials, and
    (ii) Any requirement that items be manufactured from virgin 
materials.
    (2) Each USDA organization will create a promotion program to 
internally and externally promote its desire to buy recycled products.
    (3) Each USDA organization will implement the USDA electronic 
acquisition system to reduce waste by eliminating unnecessary paper 
transactions and to foster accurate data collection and reporting of 
acquisitions.
    (4) Each USDA organization will establish an affirmative procurement 
program specifically for the needs and requirements of its own 
organization, to maximize environmental benefits, consistent with price, 
performance, and availability considerations.
    (5) Each USDA organization will ensure that the on-going inspection 
and production surveillance systems in place will monitor the production 
or the testing of goods and services to verify the recovered material 
contents reported.
    (6) Each USDA organization will include
    (i) Requirements in contracts for contractor operation of 
Government-owned or leased facilities to provide for waste prevention 
activities and the recycling of materials and
    (ii) Environmental and recycling factors in the selection process 
for the acquisition and management of real property.

<R04>
        Subpart 426.70--Preference for Selected Biobased Products


<R05>
426.7000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart supplements the FAR to implement the set-asides and 
preferences described in section 1665 of the Food, Agriculture, 
Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 5909).


<R05>
426.7001  Applicability.

    This subpart applies to USDA and all of its components, including 
corporations.


<R05>
426.7002  Authority.

    Section 1665 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 
1990 (7 U.S.C. 5909) authorizes USDA to establish set-asides and other 
preferences for products that have been assisted by the Alternative 
Agricultural Research and Commercialization Corporation (AARCC).


<R05>
426.7003  Policy.

    (a) AARCC provides financial assistance to private companies and 
other parties to commercialize nonfood, nonfeed products made from 
agricultural and forestry materials and animal by-products (biobased 
products). Biobased products by their nature are environmentally

aspect of this requirement prior to contract award.

    (As used in this provision, the term ``brand name'' includes 
identification of products by make and model.)
    (a) If items called for by this solicitation have been identified by 
a ``brand name or equal'' description, such identification is intended 
to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality 
and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Offers of 
``equal'' products (including products of the brand name manufacturer 
other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award 
if such products are clearly identified in the offer (see clause 
452.211-2) and are determined by the Contracting Officer to meet fully 
the salient characteristics requirements listed in the solicitation.

[[Page 284]]

    (b) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that it is 
offering an ``equal'' product, the offeror shall be considered as 
offering the brand name product(s) referenced in the solicitation.

products, the brand name(s), if any, and any other required information 
about the product(s) to be furnished shall be inserted in the space 
provided in the solicitation. The evaluation of offers and the 
determination as to the equality of the product(s) offered shall be the 
responsibility of the Government and will be based on information 
furnished by the offeror or identified in its offer as well as other 
information reasonably available to the contracting activity. Caution to 
offerors: The contracting activity is not responsible for locating or 
securing any information which is not identified in the offer and is not 
reasonably available to the contracting activity. Accordingly, to assure 
that sufficient information is available, the offeror must furnish as a 
part of its offer all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, 
drawings, or other information) necessary for the contracting activity 
to (i) determine whether the product offered meets the salient 
characteristics requirement of the solicitation, and (ii) establish 
exactly what the offeror proposes to furnish and what the Government 
would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information 
furnished may include specific reference to information previously 
furnished or to information otherwise available to the contracting 
activity.
    (2) If an offeror proposes to modify a product so as to make it 
conform to the requirements of the solicitation, the offer shall include 
(i) a clear description of such proposed modifications and (ii) clearly 
marked descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.

categories, materials, subcontracts, etc.) must be contained in the 
technical proposal so that the contractor's understanding of the 
statement of work may be evaluated.
    (2) Offerors may, at their discretion, submit alternate proposals or 
proposals which deviate from the requirement; provided, that an offeror 
also submit a proposal for performance of the work as specified in the 
statement of work. Any ``alternate'' proposal may be considered if 
overall performance would be improved or not compromised, and if it is 
in the best interest of the Government. Alternate proposals, or 
deviations from any requirement of this RFP, must be clearly identified.
    (3) The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with the 
evaluation criteria set forth in Section M of this RFP.

through K of the solicitation package)

    (c) ______* copies of the business/cost proposal
    (b) Technical Proposal Instructions. The technical proposal will be

the proposal will meet the requirements of the Government. Therefore, 
the technical proposal must present sufficient information to reflect a 
thorough understanding of the requirements and a detailed, description 
of the techniques, procedures and program for achieving the objectives 
of the specifications/statement of work. Proposals which merely 
paraphrase the requirements of the Government's specifications/ 
statement of work, or use such phrases as ``will comply'' or ``standard 
techniques will be employed'' will be considered unacceptable and will 
not be considered further. As a minimum, the proposal must clearly 
provide the following:
    (Contracting Officer shall identify in this section the minimum 
information required to evaluate each technical evaluation factor listed 
in Section M.)
    (c) Business Proposal Instructions.
    (1) Cost Proposal.

base bid item, plus or minus (in the order of priority listed in the 
schedule) those additive or deductive bid items providing the most 
features of the work within the funds determined by the government to be 
available before bids are opened. If addition of another bid item in the 
listed order of priority would make the award exceed such funds for all 
bidders, it shall be skipped and the next subsequent additive bid item 
in a lower amount shall be added if award therein can be made within 
such funds. For example, when the amount available is $100,000 and a 
bidder's base bid and four successive additives are $85,000, $10,000, 
$8,000, $6,000, and $4,000, the aggregate amount of the bid for purposes 
of award would be $99,000 for the base bid plus the first and fourth 
additives, the second and third additives being skipped because of each 
of them would cause the aggregate bid to exceed $100,000. In any case 
all bids shall be evaluated on the basis of the same additive or 
deductive bid items, determined as above provided. The listed order of 
priority need be followed only for determining the low bidder. After 
determination of the low bidder as stated, award in the best interests 
of the Government may be made on the selected first or base bid item and 
any combination of additive or deductive items for which funds are 
determined to be available at the time of the award, provided that award 
on such combination of bid items does not exceed the amount offered by 
any other conforming responsible bidder for the same combination of bid 
items.

<R04>
               Subpart 501.1--Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
501.101  Purpose.

    (a) The General Services Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) contains 
agency acquisition policies and practices, contract clauses, 
solicitation provisions, and forms that control the relationship between 
GSA and contractors and prospective contractors.
    (b) GSAR address rules directly to you, the contracting officer, 
unless otherwise indicated.


<R05>
501.103  Authority.

    GSA's Senior Procurement Executive issues the GSAR under the 
authority of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 
1949, as amended.


<R05>
501.104  Applicability.

    (a) General. The GSAR applies to contracts for suppliers or 
services, including construction.
    (b) Acquisition of leasehold interests in real property. Part 570 
establishes rules for the acquisition of leasehold interests in real 
property. Other provisions of 48 CFR chapter 5 (GSAR) do not apply to 
leases of real property unless specifically cross-reference in part 570.
    (c) Relationship to state. Some GSAR rules implement and interpret 
laws and other authorities affecting procurement. A GSAR rule 
specifically directed by statute has the force and effect of law.
    (d) GSAR/FAR Relationship. The GSAR may deviate from the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) if authorized. If the GSAR does not 
implement the FAR, the FAR alone governs.


<R05>
501.105  Issuance.


<R05>
501.105-1  Publication and code arrangement.

    The GSAR is published in the following sources:
    (a) Daily issue of the Federal Register.
    (b) Annual Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), as Chapter 5 of Title 
48.
    (c) GSA Acquisition Manual distributed within GSA.
    (d) GSA Home Page at http://www/gas.gov. Click on either 
``Government Agencies'' or on ``Business and Industry,'' the click on 
``Acquisition.''


<R05>
501.105-2  Arrangement of regulations.

    (a) The GSAR numbers and captions policies and procedures to 
correspond to how they appear in the FAR, e.g., 1.104 in the FAR is 
501.104 in the GSAR.
    (b) GSAR rules not implementing the FAR have numbers beginning with 
70, e.g., part 570, subsection 515.209-70.
    (c) The GSAR may have gaps in its numbering scheme because a FAR 
rule may not require GSAR implementation.


<R05>
501.105-3  Copies.

    The GSAR in CFR form may be purchased from: Superintendent of 
Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.

following actions:
    (a) Develop and test new procedures and techniques.
    (b) Adopt alternate procedures in the public interest for unique 
programmatic or managerial requirements
    (c) Deviate from a regulatory provision implementing a statutory 
requirement provided the deviation does not violate the underlying 
statute. Deviations must not be used to defeat the FAR and GSAR approval 
requirements.


<R05>
501.403  Individual deviations.

    (a) The Contracting Director approves individual deviations from the 
FAR and GSAR.
    (b) If GSA delegates authority to another agency and requires 
compliance with the GSAR as a condition of the delegation, the 
Contracting Director in the agency receiving the delegation may approve 
individual deviations from the GSAR unless the agency head receiving the 
delegation designates another official.
    (c) Send a copy of each deviation to GSA's Senior Procurement 
Executive (MV).


<R05>
501.404  Class deviations.

    (a) HCAs approve class deviations from the FAR and GSAR.
    (b) If GSA delegates authority to another agency and requires 
compliance with the GSAR as a condition of the delegation, the HCA in 
the agency receiving the delegation may approve class deviations from 
the GSAR unless the agency head receiving the delegation designates 
another official.
    (c) Send a copy of each deviation to GSA's Senior Procurement 
Executive (MV).
    (d) A request for class deviations must be supported by statements 
that fully describe the need for and the nature of the deviation.
    (e) Class deviations from the GSAR:
    (1) Expire in 12 months if not extended.
    (2) May be rescinded earlier by GSA's Senior Procurement Executive 
or by officials designated under paragraph (a) of this section without 
prejudice to any action taken previously.

present evidence of mitigating factors to the Senior Procurement 
Executive, or designee, either orally or in writing, in accordance with

rescinding official makes this referral if the dispute of fact relates 
to any of the following:
    (i) Contracts affected by the final conviction.
    (ii) Amounts expended and property transferred by the Government 
under the affected contracts.
    (iii) Identity and value of any tangible benefits received by the 
Government under the affected contracts.
    (4) The voiding and rescinding official issues GSA's final decision 
under FAR 3.705(e) after receiving the fact-finding official's report,

   Subpart 504.4--Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry


<R05>
504.402  General.

    (a) This subpart:
    (1) Prescribes procedures for safeguarding classified information 
required to be disclosed to contractors in connection with the 
solicitation of offers, and the award, performance, and termination of 
contracts.
    (2) Implements the requirements of the Department of Defense's 
Industrial Security Regulation (ISR) and Industrial Security Manual for 
Safeguarding Classified Information (ISM). By agreement, the Department 
of Defense (DOD) will act for, and on behalf of, GSA in rendering 
security services required for safeguarding classified information 
released by GSA to U.S. industry.
    (b) As used in this subpart, the term:
    (1) ``Contractor(s)'' means prospective contractors, subcontractors, 
vendors, and suppliers.
    (2) ``U.S. industry'' means those industries (including educational 
and research institutions) located within the United States, its 
possessions, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.


<R05>
504.475  Return of classified information.

    (a) You must recover classified information unless it has been 
destroyed as provided in paragraph 19 of the ISM. The Government agency 
that provided classified information to a GSA contractor is responsible

prospective offerors, offerors, or contractors is returned immediately 
after any of the following:
    (1) After bid opening or closing date for receipt of proposals by 
non-responding offerors.
    (2) After contract award by unsuccessful offerors.
    (3) Upon termination or completion of the contract.
    (4) Upon notification that authorization to release classified 
information has been withdrawn.

    (i) Does not have adequate means to safeguard classified 
information.
    (ii) Has had its security clearance revoked or inactivated.
    (6) Whenever otherwise instructed by the authority responsible for 
the security classification.


<R04>
            Subpart 504.5--Electronic Commerce in Contracting

504.500  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart provides policy and procedure for use of GSA's 
Electronic Posting System (EPS).


<R05>
504.502  Policy.

    (a) The EPS is GSA's primary vehicle for disseminating synopses and 
written solicitations. GSA intends that the EPS will substitute for, not 
supplement, paper copies of solicitations. (Note that FAR 2.101 defines 
``in writing'' or ``written'' to include ``electronically transmitted 
and stored information.'')
    (b) This policy does not apply to orders placed against existing

504.570  Procedures for using the EPS.

    (a) You must use the EPS to issue any synopsis required by FAR part 
5 or GSAR part 505.

[[Page 305]]

    (b) You must issue each written solicitation on the EPS, except as 
provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (d) of this section.
    (c) Although GSA intends that the EPS will substitute for paper 
copies of solicitations, web-based transactions are not practical in 
some industries or in some geographic areas at this time.
    (1) If you expect that electronic access to a solicitation will 
result in adequate competition, distribute the solicitation only through 
the EPS. Include the following notice in the related synopsis:

    GSA is issuing this solicitation only electronically. Interested 
parties may access the solicitation at http://www.eps.gov. This site 
provides instructions for downloading the solicitation file.

    (2) If you believe that distribution of paper copies is necessary to 
ensure adequate competition, document the file to justify distribution 
of paper copies. Include the notice in paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
in the related synopsis, leaving out the first sentence.
    (d) In some cases, release of construction drawings must be 
controlled to ensure adequate security. In other cases, an exhibit or 
attachment incorporated in a solicitation may not be available 
electronically. In either of these cases, you must explain in both the 
synopsis and the solicitation how interested parties may obtain a copy. 
In addition to the notice required by paragraph (c), include a notice 
substantially the same as follows in both the synopsis and solicitation. 
Tailor the notice as necessary for the particular acquisition.

    This solicitation incorporates documents which are not available 
electronically. See [Identify the solicitation section that lists the 
subject documents]. Interested parties may request copies of these 
documents by writing the Contracting Officer at the address in [Identify 
address block in the solicitation].

    (e) The Electronic Posting System Manual provides detailed 
instructions for using the EPS. The Manual is available at http://
www.eps.gov/buyer.html.

    (b) Due to the potential for de facto debarment, avoid making 
repeated determinations of nonresponsiblity based on the same past 
performance information.
    (c) To provide for timely consideration of the need to institute 
action to debar a contractor, submit a copy of each nonresponsibility 
determination, other than those based on capacity or financial 
capability, to the debarring official.

    (a) Investigation and referral.
    (1) Refer to the debarring official matters involving serious 
contract improprieties or performance deficiencies. Performance 
deficiencies that continue over a period of time or apply to more than 
one contract may warrant debarment consideration.

[[Page 310]]

    (2) Refer possible criminal or fraudulent activities to the Office 
of the Inspector General (OIG). See 5 CFR 6701.107, Reporting Waste, 
Fraud, Abuse, and Corruption. If, after investigation, the OIG believes 
a cause for debarment exists, it will refer the matter to the debarring 
official for consideration of debarment action.
    (b) Reports. Include in referrals to the debarring official a report 
that contains at least the following:
    (1) The recommendation and supporting rationale.
    (2) A list of parties to be considered for possible debarment,

testimony.
    (5) GSA's acquisition history with the contractor. Include recent 
experience, copies of the pertinent contracts, and an explanation of 
impact debarment would have on GSA programs. OIG referrals do not 
require this explanation; the debarring official will obtain the 
information directly from the contracting activity(s).
    (6) A list of any known active or potential criminal investigations, 
criminal or civil proceedings, or administrative claims before the Board 
of Contract Appeals.
    (7) A statement regarding the impact of the debarment action on GSA 
programs. This statement is not required for referrals by the Inspector 
General; the debarring official will obtain a statement directly from 
the contracting activity(s).
    (c) Review. The debarring official will review the report, and after 
coordinating with assigned legal counsel, either:
    (1) Initiate debarment action.
    (2) Decline debarment action.
    (3) Request additional information.
    (4) Refer the matter to the OIG for further investigation and 
development of a case file.
    (d) Decisionmaking process.
    (1) The debarring official will provide:
    (i) Notice of declinations, proposed debarments, and decisions to 
the referring activity.
    (ii) Notice of proposed debarment to each party being considered for 
debarment.
    (iii) Decision notices to each party after considering information 
in the administrative record and information and argument submitted by 
the affected party or parties.
    (2) A party proposed for debarment:
    (i) Has 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice to respond to 
the debarring official or the debarment becomes final.
    (ii) May request and receive a copy of the administrative record 
that was the basis for the proposed debarment. If information is 
withheld, the party will be notified and provided the reason.
    (iii) May request the opportunity to present information and 
argument in person to the debarring official. The debarring official 
will schedule an oral presentation within 20 calendar days of receipt of 
the request, unless a longer period of time is requested by the party. 
An oral presentation is informal and a transcript usually is not made. 
The party may supplement the oral presentation with written information 
and arguments.
    (iv) May identify to the debarring official material facts in 
dispute and the bases. For an action other than one based on a 
conviction of civil judgment, a party may request review and a written 
finding by a fact-finding official.
    (3) The debarring official will determine whether there is a genuine 
dispute of material fact. If so, the debarring official refers the 
matter to a fact-finding official, who will take the following action as 
appropriate:
    (i) Schedule a hearing within 20 calendar days after receipt of a 
request to resolve disputed facts.
    (ii) Grant extensions for good cause.
    (iii) Provide notice of scheduled hearing.
    (iv) Conduct hearings under rules consistent with FAR 9.406-3(b)(2).

finding official provides the written findings of fact (together with a 
transcription of the proceeding, unless waived) within 20 calendar days 
after the hearing record closes.

<R05>
509.407-3  Procedures.

    (a) General. The procedures in 509.406-3 apply to suspension actions 
except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Fact-finding.
    (1) Fact-finding will not be conducted in an action:
    (i) Based on an indictment.
    (ii) When the suspending official finds no genuine dispute of 
material facts.
    (2) If the action is not based on an indictment, the suspending 
official must coordinate with the Department of Justice or state 
prosecutorial authority through OIG. Based on the advice received, the 
suspending official will determine if fact-finding would impair 
substantial interests of the Federal or state Government. In an action 
not based on an indictment, a suspended party may:
    (i) Identify to the suspending official material facts in dispute 
and the bases.
    (ii) Request review and a written finding by a fact-finding official 
to resolve genuine disputes of material fact. For procedures involving a 
genuine dispute of material fact, see 509.406-3(d)(3).

    (1) Include the clause at 552.211-73, Marking, in solicitations and 
contracts for supplies when deliveries may be made to both civilian and 
military activities and the contract amount is expected to exceed the 
simplified acquisition threshold.
    (2) Include the clause at 552.211-74, Charges for Marking, in 
solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 552.211-73 or a 
similar clause.
    (3) Include the clause at 552.211-75, Preservation, Packaging and 
Packing, in solicitations and contracts for supplies expected to exceed 
the simplified acquisition threshold. You may also include the clause in 
contracts estimated to be at or below the simplified acquisition 
threshold when appropriate.
    (4) Insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 552.211-
76, Charges for Packaging and Packing, in solicitations and contracts 
for supplies to be delivered to GSA distribution centers.
    (d) Supply contracts. Include the clause at 552.211-77, Packing 
List, in solicitations and contracts for supplies, including purchases 
over the micropurchase threshold.


<R04>
            Subpart 511.4--Delivery or Performance Schedules


<R05>
511.404  Contract clauses.

    (a) Supply contracts.
    (1) Single award schedules. Insert 552.211-8, Time of Delivery, in 
solicitations and contracts instead of the clause at FAR 52.211-8. If 
you need to show different delivery times for different items or groups 
of items, use Alternate I.
    (2) Multiple award schedules. Insert 552.211-78, Commercial Delivery 
Schedule (Multiple Award Schedule), in solicitations issued and 
contracts awarded under the multiple award schedule program.
    (3) Shelf-life items. Use the following clauses in solicitations and 
contracts that require delivery of shelf-life items within a specified 
number of months from the date of manufacture or production (see 101-
27.206-2 of the Federal Property Management Regulation):
    (i) Insert 552.211-79, Acceptable Age of Supplies, if the required 
shelf-life period is 12 months or less, and lengthy acceptance testing 
may be involved. For items having a limited shelf-life, substitute 
Alternate I when required by the director of the commodity center 
concerned.
    (ii) Insert 552.211-80, Age on Delivery, if the required shelf-life 
period is more than 12 months, or when source inspection can be 
performed within a short time period.
    (4) Stock replenishment contracts. Insert 552.211-81, Time of 
Shipment, in solicitations and stock replenishment contracts that do not 
include the Availability for Inspection, Testing and Shipment/Delivery 
clause at 552.211-83 and require shipment within 45 calendar days after 
receipt of the order. If shipment is required in more than 45 days, use 
Alternate I.
    (5) Notice of shipment. Include 552.211-82, Notice of Shipment, in 
solicitation and contracts for supplies when you need to have a notice 
of shipment from the contractor.
    (6) Indeterminate testing time. Insert 552.211-83, Availability for 
Inspection, Testing and Shipment/Delivery, in solicitations and 
contracts that provide for source inspection by Government personnel and 
that require lengthy

[[Page 313]]

testing for which time frames cannot be determined in advance. If the 
contract is for stock items, use Alternate I.
    (b) Construction contracts. Insert the clause at 552.211-84, Non-
Compliance with Contract Requirements, in solicitations and contracts 
for construction when you expect the contract amount to exceed the 
simplified acquisition threshold.

  Subpart 512.3--Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses for the 
                     Acquisition of Commercial Items


<R05>
512.301  Solicitation provisions and contract clauses for the acquisition of commercial items.

    (a) Solicitation provisions and clauses. Insert these provisions or 
clauses in solicitations or solicitations and contracts, respectively, 
in accordance with the instructions provided:
    (1) 552.212-70, Preparation of Offer (Multiple Award Schedule), in 
solicitations and contracts issued under the multiple award schedule 
program.
    (2) 552.213-71, Contract Terms and Conditions Applicable to GSA 
Acquisition of Commercial Items, when listed clauses apply. The clause 
provides for incorporation by reference of terms and conditions which 
are, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with customary 
commercial practice. If necessary, tailor this clause.
    (3) 552.212-72, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement 
Statutes of Executive Orders Applicable to GSA Acquisitions of 
Commercial Items, when listed clauses apply.
    (i) The clause provides for the incorporation by reference of terms 
and conditions required to implement provisions of law or executive 
orders that apply to commercial item acquisitions.
    (ii) As a result of the General Services Administration Board of 
Contract Appeals (GSBCA) decision in the protest of International 
Business Machines Corporation GSBCA 90-2 BCA P22,924, May 18, 1990, GSA 
solicitations and contracts will deviate from FAR 52.225-8, Buy American 
Act-Trade Agreements-Balance of Payments Program Certificate. 
Incorporate 552.225-8, Buy American Act-Trade Agreements-Balance of 
Payments Program Certificate, and 552.225-9, Buy American Act-Trade 
Agreements-Balance of Payments Program, in solicitations and contracts 
subject to the Trade Agreement Act. Use them instead of FAR 52.225-8 and 
52.225-9 (referenced in FAR 52.212-3 and 52.212-5 respectively).
    (4) 552.213-73, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Multiple Award 
Schedule), in multiple award schedule solicitations. Use this provision 
instead of FAR 52.212-2.
    (b) Use of required provisions and clauses. Use only those 
provisions and clauses prescribed in this part. Unless the use of a 
provision or clause prescribed elsewhere in the GSAR is consistent with 
customary commercial practice for the item being acquired, disregard 
contrary instructions. Provisions and clauses prescribed in this part 
will be revised to reflect the applicability of new statutes and 
executive orders.
    (c) Discretionary use of GSAR provisions and clauses. Consistent 
with the limitations contained in FAR 12.302(c), include in 
solicitations and contracts by addendum other GSAR provisions and 
clauses.
    (d) Use of additional provisions and clauses. The Senior Procurement 
Executive must approve the use of a provision or clause that is either 
not:
    (1) Prescribed in the FAR or GSAR for use in contracts for 
commercial items.
    (2) Consistent with customary commercial practice.

                   Subpart 514.2--Solicitation of Bids


<R05>
514.201  Preparation of invitations for bids.


<R05>
514.201-1  Uniform contract format.

    Include the following notice in each solicitation:

    The information collection requirements contained in this 
solicitation/contract, are either required by regulation or approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act and assigned OMB Control No. 3090-0162.


<R05>
514.201-2  Part I--The Schedule.

    (a) When you use Standard Form 33, Solicitation, Offer and Award, 
include the following cautionary notice:

    Notice to Bidders--Use Item 13 of the Standard Form 33, 
Solicitation, Offer and Award, to offer prompt payment discounts. The 
Prompt Payment clause of this solicitation sets forth payment terms. Do 
not insert any statement in Item 13 which requires payment sooner than 
the time stipulated in the Prompt Payment clause. Example: If you insert 
``NET 20'' in Item 13, GSA will reject your offer as nonresponsive 
because the entry contradicts the 30 day payment terms specified in the 
Prompt Payment clause.

    (b) When you use any other authorized form (e.g., Standard Form 
1447, Solicitation/Contract), include the notice in paragraph (a) of 
this section. Change the reference to the form number, form title, and 
item number accordingly.


<R05>
Sec. 514.201-6  Solicitation provisions.

    When you will consider all or none bids, insert the provision at 
552.214-70, ``All or None'' Offers, in the solicitation. For 
requirements or indefinite quantity contracts, use Alternate I. Do not 
include this provision in solicitations when you require the bidder to 
submit bids on all items and will make only one award.


<R05>
514.201-7  Contract clauses.

    (a) Stock replenishment contracts. For some stock replenishment 
contracts, individual contractors may be unable to furnish the 
Government's monthly requirements. You may determine that progressive 
awards will be more expedient. In such cases, insert a clause 
substantially the same as the clause 552.214-71, Progressive Awards and 
Monthly Quantity Allocations, in the solicitation and contract.
    (b) Examinations of Records.
    (1) Insert 552.214-70, Examination of Records by GSA, in 
solicitations and contracts for supplies or services that exceed 
$100,000, and acquisitions of leasehold interests in real property that 
exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, that meet at least 
one of the following conditions:
    (i) Involve the use or disposition of Government-furnished property.
    (ii) Provide for advance payments, progress payments based on cost, 
or guaranteed loan.
    (iii) Contain a price warranty or price reduction clause.
    (iv) Include an economic price adjustment clause where the 
adjustment is not based solely on an established, third party index.
    (v) Are requirements, indefinite-quantity, or letter contracts as 
defined in FAR part 16.
    (vi) Contain the provision at FAR 52.223-4, Recovered Materials 
Certification.
    (2) You may modify the clause to define the specific area of audit 
(e.g., the

[[Page 316]]

use or disposition of Government-furnished property). Legal Counsel and 
the Assistant Inspector General--Auditing or Regional Inspector 
General--Auditing, as appropriate, must concur in any modifications to 
the clause.


<R05>
514.202  General rules for solicitation of bids.


<R05>
514.202-4  Bid samples.

    (a) Solicitation requirements.
    (1) When you require bid samples, require bidders to submit samples 
produced by the manufacturer whose products will be supplied under the 
contract.
    (2) The FAR limits use of bid samples to cases where you cannot 
describe some characteristics of a product adequately in the 
specification or purchase description. This usually applies to 
subjective characteristics. You may determine that you need to examine 
objective characteristics of bid samples to determine the responsiveness 
of a bid. Base your determination on past experience or other valid 
considerations. In the solicitation, separately list ``Subjective 
Characteristics'' and ``Objective Characteristics.''
    (3) A sample provision appears at 552.214-72, Bid Sample 
Requirements. You may use this provision as shown or modify it to fit 
the circumstances of a procurement.
    (b) Handling and disposition of samples.
    (1) Retain samples from accepted bids for the period of contract 
performance. If you have no outstanding claims regarding the contract, 
dispose of the samples at the end of the contract term following the 
bidder's instructions.
    (2) If you anticipate a claim regarding the contract, retain the bid 
samples until the claim is resolved.
    (3) Retain samples from unsuccessful bids until you make award. 
After award, dispose of these samples following the bidder's 
instructions.
    (c) Using bid samples. Include the information required by FAR 
14.202-4(e) in the solicitation. Provide the number, size, and full 
description of samples with instructions on how to submit bids. List the 
characteristics that you will examine. The list needs to include any 
aspect of the bid sample the acquisition team will examine to determine 
the product(s) acceptability.


<R05>
514.203  Methods of soliciting bids.


<R05>
514.203-1  Transmittal to prospective bidders.

    Prospective bidders, as used in FAR 14.203-1, include both the 
following:
    (a) The incumbent contractor, except when its written response to 
the notice of contract action under FAR subpart 5.2 states a negative 
interest.
    (b) Bidders that responded to recent solicitations for the same or 
similar items.


<R05>
514.270  Aggregate awards.


<R05>
514.270-1  Definition.

    Aggregate award means an arrangement whereby two or more separately-
priced line items are combined for award to that bidder whose bid will 
result in the lowest overall cost to the Government for the line items 
as a group. The individual price for each item does not have to be the 
lowest bid received. (See also the definition of a ``line item'' in FAR 
3.302.)


<R05>
514.270-2  Guidelines for use.

    (a) GSA usually solicits prices and reserves the right to make award 
for individual line items. In some cases it serves GSA's best interest 
to combine two or more line items for an aggregate award. Such cases 
include when:
    (1) Users desire uniformity of design, style, and finish (e.g., 
suites of household furniture).
    (2) The articles will be assembled and used as a unit, and different 
manufacturers' components may not be interchangeable.
    (3) Users have high demand for certain articles, but demand for 
related articles is insufficient to attract competitive bids (e.g., 
various sized of socket wrenches). Awarding the low-demand articles in 
conjunction with the high-demand articles may encourage competition.
    (4) One location (delivery point) has a large requirement, and 
another location has a requirement too small to individually attract 
competitive bids.

[[Page 317]]

    (5) Awarding and administering numerous small contracts for similar 
articles or services is impractical.
    (b) Before deciding to combine items for aggregate award, consider 
the following factors:
    (1) The capability of bidders to furnish the types and quantities of 
supplies or services in the aggregate.
    (2) How grouping delivery points will affect bidders.
    (3) Which combinations will accurately project the lowest overall 
cost to the Government.
    (c) Do not use an aggregate award if it will significantly restrict 
the number of eligible bidders.


<R05>
514.270-3  Evaluation factors for award.

    Clearly state in the solicitation the basis for evaluating bids for 
aggregate award. Require bidders to submit a price on each item within 
the group or a percentage to be added or subtracted from a list price. 
Advise bidders that failure to submit prices as required within a group 
makes a bid ineligible for award for that group.


<R05>
514.270-4  Grouping line items for aggregate award.

    (a) Type of contract. While this section addresses supply contracts 
(articles and delivery points), the same principles apply to service 
contracts (types of services and service areas).
    (b) Effect on compeition. Provide for full and open competition when 
you group items for award. Grouping items for award may preclude a 
significant of firms from bidding. This occurs if firms are unable to 
provide all the types or quanities of supplies or services, or make 
deliveries to the various delivery points included in the prospective 
aggregate group.
    (c) Grouping different articles. Include only related articles in an 
aggregate group. Related articles are those normally manufactured or 
produced by a majority of prospective bidders. Grouping unrelated 
articles often restricts competition unnecessarily.
    (d) Grouping geographic locations or delivery points. Consider the 
following guidelines before deciding to group different geographic 
locations or delivery points:
    (1) A delivery point may have sufficient requirements so that 
individual shipments involve economic production runs and carload or 
truckload quanities. In this case, list it as a separate line item.
    (2) The types of bidders (i.e., small or large firms, manufacturers 
or distributors, etc.) who respond to previous solicitations can provide 
important information. For example, if previous bidders are distributors 
with franchises in certain territories, grouping different territories 
could tend to restrict competition.
    (3) Transportation costs can affect competition and pricing. They 
may constitute a significant portion of the total delivered cost. Obtain 
the advice and assistance of transportation specialists before grouping 
geographic locations or delivery points. Depending upon the supplies 
being acquired:
    (i) Grouping widespread geographic locations or delivery points may 
reduce competition or result in higher prices. It can cause you to lose 
``area pricing'' advantages provided by a supplier with a single 
production point.
    (ii) Conversely, for many small commercial items (hand tools, locks, 
etc.), manufacturers may quote the same price for delivery anywhere in 
the U.S..
    (iii) Tariff boundaries can also affect how manufacturers price 
deliveries to different areas.


<R05>
514.270-5  Evaluation methodologies for aggregate awards.

    (a) Definite quantity contracts without options. For definite 
quantity contracts without options, the evaluated bid price is the total 
bid price, as adjusted for any price-related factors identified in the 
solicitation. This reflects the actual cost to the Government and will 
identify the most advantageous bid.
    (b) Indefinite quantity contracts, requirements contracts, and 
options. Indefinite quantity and requirements contracts use estimated 
quantities. Options involve the probability of whether and when the 
options will be exercised. These situations may result in unbalanced 
bids (see FAR 15.404-1(g)), leading to inaccurate evaluation of the 
projected cost and award to other than the most advantageous bid. To 
avoid

[[Page 318]]

unbalanced bids, GSA has two preferred methods for evaluating bids for 
aggregate awards: weight factors and price list.
    (1) Weight factors method. Assign a weight to each item in a group. 
The weight is based on the portion of quantities that item represents. 
To evaluate bids, multiply each unit price by its weight factor, then 
total the results.
    (2) Price list method. Establish prices for bidders to use as a base 
for preparing their bids. Prepare a list that identifies a base price 
for each item in a group. Bidders bid a percentage factor to add to or 
subtract from the base price.


<R05>
514.270-6  Guidelines for using the weight factors method.

    (a) Use the weight factors method when you have reliable estimates 
for the quantities needed in an acquisition. Reliable estimates of 
quantities form the foundation for:
    (1) Accurate evaluation of the projected cost of each bid.
    (2) An appropriate determination of which bid is most advantageous 
to the Government for the aggregate group.
    (b) Assign a weight factor to each item in a group. Develop the 
weight factor by calculating the portion of the total quantity in a 
defined group that each item represents.
    (c) To evaluate bid prices, first multiply the price bid for each 
item (unit price X quantity) by its weight factor. Then, add the 
subtotals together to project the cost for the aggregate group.
    (d) You may reduce estimated quantities to smaller numbers by a 
common denominator. This may help facilitate the computations involved 
in evaluating bids.
    (e) Consider all price-related factors you identified in the 
solicitation. Award to the responsive and responsible bidder with the 
lowest evaluated overall cost to the Government for the aggregate group. 
This represents the most advantageous bid.


<R05>
514.270-7  Guidelines for using the price list method.

    (a) General. The price list method helps avoid unbalanced bidding 
when you need to make aggregate awards, but lack accurate estimates of 
anticipated quantities. This method establishes base prices for bidders 
to use in preparing their bids.
    (b) Solicitation requirements. When you use the price list methods, 
in the solicitation:
    (1) Include the price list.
    (2) Include an estimate of requirements.
    (3) Require the bidder to express its price as ``net'' or as a 
percentage added to or subtracted from the list prices for each group. 
Require the bidder to quote only one percentage factor for each group. 
This means that the bidder provides one percentage factor that applies 
to every item in a group; not a separate percentage for each item. 
``Net'' indicates the bidder chooses to submit the list prices as its 
bid.
    (4) Identify the percentage factor in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section as a price related evaluation factor.
    (c) Developing list prices. You may develop price lists using one or 
more of the following sources:
    (1) Industry published prices.
    (2) Industry surveys.
    (3) Government cost estimates based on knowledge of the supplies or 
services and previous contract prices.
    (d) First time use for an item or service. The first time you use 
list prices for an item or service, give prospective bidders an 
opportunity to review the proposed list. Also provide information on how 
GSA will use the list prices. You may provide this information in a 
draft solicitation.
    (e) Balanced prices. Ensure that the list prices for the grouped 
items bear a reasonable and balanced relationship to one another. You 
may use prices from previous awards made using the weight factors method 
to develop price lists. Review those prices first to ensure they did not 
result from unbalanced bidding.
    (f) Evaluation and award. Consider all price-related factors 
identified in the solicitation. Award to the responsive and responsible 
bidder whose percentage factor produces the most favorable price to the 
Government. This represents the most advantageous bid.
    (g) Example. The following illustrates a bidding schedule 
arrangement for a

[[Page 319]]

group of items for aggregate award under the price list method:

 Drills, Twist, High Speed, Under Federal Specification (No. and Date), and Amendment (No. and Date), Amendment

    The bid on each item above is the list price shown minus/plus ____ 
percent. (Bidder, insert ``net'' or a single percentage amount in the 
blank space and cross out minus or plus, as appropriate.)
    (h) Special considerations for contracts for store stock items. Show 
estimated quantities only if estimates of demand for each item within a 
group can be derived from Government records or verified contractor 
sales reports. Use only current estimates. If you cannot estimate the 
Government's needs, the solicitation may include past orders. (See CG 
Decision, B-209037, 82-2 CPD para 323 (1982).)
    (i) Special considerations for repair and alteration contracts. In 
the solicitation:
    (1) List the estimated quantities for work to be performed during 
both normal working hours and outside of normal working hours.
    (2) State the percent of work anticipated to be performed during 
normal working hours.
    (3) List the unit prices for work to be performed during both normal 
working hours and outside of normal working hours.
    (4) Define ``normal'' in terms of hours and days of the week.
    (5) Advise bidders of the previous year's total expenditures or 
portions of that total attributable to the listed items.
    (6) If you provide quantity estimates, state that the estimates are 
for information only and do not constitute guarantees or commitments to 
order items under the contract.
    (7) Solicit two percentage factors for the line item unit prices 
listed: one for the unit prices for work performed during normal working 
hours and the second for the unit prices for work performed outside of 
normal working hours.
    (8) You may require multiple percentages when the solicitation 
further groups unit prices by trade or business category.
    (9) For the evaluated bid price, add together the following 
percentages:
    (i) The percentage of work performed during normal work hours 
multiplied by the total estimate adjusted by the bidder's percentage 
factor for that portion of the work, plus
    (ii) The percentage of work performed during other than normal 
working hours multiplied by the total estimate adjusted by the bidder's 
percentage factor for that portion of the work.
    (10) Consider other price-related factors identified in the 
solicitation. Make award to the responsible and responsive bidder 
submitting the lowest overall evaluated bid price for the aggregate 
group. This represents the most advantageous bid.

     Conflict of Interest Acknowledgment and Nondisclosure Agreement

    For proposals submitted in response to GAS solicitation no. 
________, I agree to the following:
    (a) To the best of my knowledge and belief, no conflict of interest 
exists that may either:
    (1) Diminish my capacity to impartially review the proposals 
submitted.
    (2) Or result in a biased opinion or unfair advantage.
    (b) In making the above statement, I have considered all the 
following factors that might place me in a position of conflict, real or 
apparent, with the evaluation proceedings:

    (d) I have a continuing obligation to disclose any circumstances 
that may create an actual or apparent conflict of interest. If I learn 
of any such conflict, I will report it immediately to the Contracting 
Officer. I will perform no more duties related to evaluating proposals 
until I receive instructions on the matter.
    (e) I will use proposal information for evaluation purposes only. I 
understand that any authorized restriction on disclosure placed on the 
proposal by the prospective contractor, prospective subcontractor, or 
the Government applies to any reproduction or abstracted information of 
the proposal.
    (f) I will use my best efforts to safeguard proposal information 
physically. I will not disclose the contents of, nor release any

    (g) After completing evaluation, I will return to the Government all 
copies of the proposals and any abstracts.

disclosure of Congress); section 1034 of title 10, United States Code,

based on an established catalog or market price during the previous 12-
month period or the offerors last fiscal year: $________. State

    (3) Based on your written discounting policies (standard commercial 
sales practices in the event you do not have written discounting 
policies), are the discounts and any concessions which you offer the 
Government equal to or better than your best price (discount and 
concessions in any combination) offered to any customer acquiring the 
same items regardless of quantity or terms and conditions? YES____ 
NO____ (See definition of ``concession'' and ``discount'' in 552.212-
70.)
    (4)(a) Based on your written discounting policies (standard 
commercial sales practices in the event you do not have written

commercial sales practices disclosed in the above chart ever result

[[Page 324]]

in better discounts (lower prices) or concessions than indicated? YES__ 
NO__. If YES, explain deviations in accordance with the instructions at 
Figure 515.4, which is provided in this solicitation for your 
convenience.
    (5) If you are a dealer/reseller without significant sales to the 
general public, you should provide manufacturers' information required 
by paragraphs (1) through (4) above for each item/SIN offered, if the 
manufacturer's sales under any resulting contract are expected to exceed 
$500,000. You must also obtain written authorization from the 
manufacturer(s) for Government access, at any time before award or 
before agreeing to a modification, to the manufacturer's sales records 
for the purpose of verifying the information submitted by the 
manufacturer. The information is required in order to enable the 
Government to make a determination that the offered price is fair and 
reasonable. To expedite the review and processing of offers, you should 
advise the manufacturer(s) of this requirement. The contracting officer 
may require the information be submitted on electronic media with 
commercially available spreadsheet(s). The information may be provided 
by the manufacturer directly to the Government. If the manufacturer's 
item(s) is being offered by multiple dealers/resellers, only one copy of 
the requested information should be submitted to the Government. In 
addition, you must submit the following information along with a listing 
of contact information regarding each of the manufacturers whose 
products and/or services are included in the offer (include the 
manufacturer's name, address, the manufacturer's contact point, 
telephone number, and FAX number) for each model offered by SIN:
    (a) Manufacturer's Name.
    (b) Manufacturer's Part Number.
    (c) Dealer's/Reseller's Part Number.
    (d) Product Description.

    (c) Include the instructions for completing the commercial sales 
practices format in Figure 515.4 in solicitations issued under the MAS 
program.

    Figure 515.4--Instructions for Commercial Sales Practices Format

    If you responded ``yes'' to question (3), on the Commercial Sales 
Practices Format in paragraph (b) of this section, complete the chart in 
question (4)(a) for the customer(s) who receive your best discount. If 
you responded ``no'', complete the chart in question (4)(a) showing your 
written policies or standard sales practices for all customers or 
customer categories to whom you sell at a price (discounts and 
concessions in combination) that is equal to or better than the price(s) 
offered to the Government under this solicitation or with which the 
Offeror has a current agreement to sell at a discount which equals or 
exceeds the discount(s) offered under this solicitation. Such agreement 
shall be in effect on the date the offer is submitted or contain an 
effective date during the proposed multiple award schedule contract 
period. If your offer is lower than your price to other customers or 
customers categories, you will be aligned with the customer or category 
of customer that receives your best price for purposes of the Price 
Reductions clause at 552.238-75. The Government expects you to provide 
information required by the format in accordance with these instructions 
that is, to the best of your knowledge and belief, current, accurate, 
and complete as of 14 calender days prior to its submission. You must 
also disclose any changes in your price list(s), discounts and/or 
discounting policies which occur after the offer is submitted, but 
before the close of negotiations. If your discount practices vary by 
model or product line, the discount information should be by model or 
product line as appropriate. You may limit the number of models or 
product lines reported to those which exceed 75% of actual historical 
Government sales (commercial sales may be substituted if Government 
sales are unavailable) value of the special item number (SIN).

   Column 1--Identify the Applicable Customer or Category of Customer

    A ``customer'' is any entity, except the Federal Government, which 
acquires supplies or services from the Offeror. The term customer 
includes, but is not limited to original equipment manufacturers, value 
added resellers, state and local Governments, distributors, educational 
institutions (an elementary, junior high, or degree granting school 
which maintains a regular faculty and established curriculum and an 
organized body of students), dealers, national accounts, and end users. 
In any instance where the Offeror is asked to disclose information for a 
customer, the Offeror may disclose information by category of customer 
if the Offeror's discount policies or practices are the same for all 
customers in the category. (Use a separate line for each customer or 
category of customer.)

                     Column 2--Identify the Discount

    The term ``discount'' is as defined in solicitation clause 552.212-
70, Preparation of Offer (Multiple Award Schedule). Indicate the best 
discount (based on your written discounting policies or standard 
commercial discounting practices if you do not have written discounting 
policies) at which you sell to the customer or category of customer 
identified

[[Page 325]]

in column 1, without regard to quantity; terms and conditions of the 
agreements under which the discounts are given; and whether the 
agreements are written or oral. Net prices or discounts off of other 
price lists should be expressed as percentage discounts from the price 
list which is the basis of your offer. If the discount disclosed is a 
combination of various discounts (prompt payment, quantity, etc.), the 
percentage should be broken out for each type of discount. If the price 
lists which are the basis of the discounts given to the customers 
identified in the chart are different than the price list submitted upon 
which your offer is based, identify the type or title and date of each 
price list. The contracting officer may require submission of these 
price lists. To expedite evaluation, offerors may provide these price 
lists at the time of submission.

           Column 3--Identify the Quantity or Volume of Sales

    Insert the minimum quantity or sales volume which the identified 
customer or category of customer must either purchase/order, per order 
or within a specified period, to earn a discount indicate the time 
period.

  Column 4--Indicate the FOB Delivery Term for Each Identified Customer

    See FAR 47.3 for an explanation of FOB delivery terms.

  Column 5--Indicate Concessions Regardless of Quantity Granted to the 
               Identified Customer or Category of Customer

    Concessions are defined in solicitation clause 552.12-70, 
Preparation of Offers (Multiple Award Schedule). If the space provided 
is inadequate, the disclosure should be made on a separate sheet by 
reference.
    If you respond ``yes'' to question 4(b) in the Commercial Sales 
Practices Format, provide an explanation of the circumstances under 
which you deviate from your written policies or standard commercial 
sales practices disclosed in the chart on the Commercial Sales Practices 
Format and explain how often they occur. Your explanation should include 
a discussion of situations that lead to deviations from standard 
practice, an explanation of how often they occur, and the controls you 
employ to assure the integrity of your pricing. Examples of typical 
deviations may include, but are not limited to, one time goodwill 
discounts to charity organizations or to compensate an otherwise 
disgruntled customer; a limited sale of obsolete or damaged goods; the 
sale of sample goods to a new customer, or the sales of prototype goods 
for testing purposes.
    If deviations from your written policies or standard commercial 
sales practices disclosed in the chart on the Commercial Sales Practices 
Format are so significant and/or frequent that the Contracting Officer 
cannot establish whether the price(s) offered is fair and reasonable, 
then you may be asked to provide additional information. The Contracting 
Officer may ask for information to demonstrate that you have made 
substantial sales of the item(s) in the commercial market consistent 
with the information reflected on the chart on the Commercial Sales 
Practices Format, a description of the conditions surrounding those 
sales deviations, or other information that may be necessary in order 
for the Contracting Officer to determine whether your offered price(s) 
is fair and reasonable. In cases where additional information is 
requested the Contracting Officer will target the request in order to 
limit the submission of data to that needed to establish the 
reasonableness of the offered price.

                             (End of figure)

    (d) Insert the clause at 452.215-72, Price Adjustment--Failure to 
Provide Accurate Information, in solicitations and contracts under the 
MAS program.
    (e) You should use Alternate IV of FAR 52.215-21, Requirements for 
Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data--
Modifications, to provide for submission of information other than cost 
or pricing data for MAS contracts. To provide for uniformity in requests 
under the MAS program, you should insert the following in paragraph (b) 
of the clause:
    (1) Information required by the clause at 552.243-72, Modifications 
(Multiple Award Schedule).
    (2) Any additional supporting information requested by the 
Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may require additional 
supporting information, but only to the extent necessary to determine 
whether the price(s) offered is fair and reasonable.
    (3) By submitting a request for modification, the Contractor grants 
the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative the right to 
examine, at any time before agreeing to a modification, books, record, 
documents, papers, and other directly pertinent records to verify the 
pricing, sales and other data related to the supplies or services 
proposed in order to determine the reasonableness of price(s). Access 
does not extent to Contractor's cost or profit information or other data 
related solely to the Contractor's determination of the prices to be 
offered in the catalog or marketplace.

    (a) Unsolicited samples. The reference to FAR 14.404-2(d) in FAR 
14.202-4(g) does not apply.
    ``However, qualifications in the proposal that are at variance with 
the Government's requirements, constitute deficiencies. Resolve these as 
provided in FAR 15.306.''

    (1) Use the clause at FR 52.214-20. The second sentence in paragraph 
(c) of the clause does not apply. Substitute a sentence substantially as 
follows:

    Failure of the bid samples to conform to all the required 
characteristics listed in the solicitation constitutes a deficiency in 
the proposal (see FAR 15.306).

    (2) In addition to listing subjective characteristics that you 
cannot adequately describe in the specification, you may list and 
evaluate objective characteristics. To include objective 
characteristics, you must determine that examination of such 
characteristics is essential to the acquisition of any acceptable 
product. Base your determination on past experience or other valid 
considerations.
    (c) FAR 52.215-1(c)(3) applies to samples received after the time 
set for receipt of offers.

<R05>
516.203-4  Contract clauses.

    (a) Multiple award schedules. Do not use FAR 52.216-2, 52.216-3, or 
52.216-4 in negotiated acquisitions based on discounts from established 
commercial catalogs or pricelists. Instead, use:
    (1) 552.216-70, Economic Price Adjustment--FSS Multiple Award 
Schedule Contracts, in a 1-year solicitation or contract.
    (2) 552.216-70 (Alternate I) in multiyear solicitations and 
contracts.
    (b) Stock or Special Order Program Contracts. In multiyear 
solicitations and contracts, after making the determination required by 
FAR 16.203-2, use 552.216-71, Economic Price Adjustment-Stock and 
Special Order Program Contract, or a clause prepared as authorized in 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this subsection.
    (1) If the contract includes one or more options to extend the term 
of the contract, use the clause with its Alternate I or a clause 
substantially the same as 552.216-71 with its Alternate I suitably 
modified.
    (2) In a contract requiring a minimum adjustment before the price 
adjustment mechanism is effectuated, use the basic clause with Alternate 
II or with Alternate I and Alternative II.
    (3) If the Producer Price Index is not an appropriate indicator for 
price adjustment, modify the clause to use an alternate indicator for 
adjusting prices. Similarly, if other aspects of 552.216-71 are not 
appropriate, use an alternate clause following established procedures.
    (c) Adjustments based on cost indexes of labor or material.

[[Page 327]]

    (1) If you decide to provide for adjustments based on cost indexes 
of labor or material, prepare a clause that defines each of the 
following elements:
    (i) The type of labor and/or material subject to adjustment.
    (ii) The labor rates, including any fringe benefits and/or unit 
prices of materials that may be increased or decreased.
    (iii) The index(es) that will be used to measure changes in price 
levels and the base period or reference point from which changes will be 
measured.
    (iv) The period during which the price(s) will be subject to 
adjustment.
    (2) The contracting director must approve use of this clause.

              Subpart 516.5--Indefinite-Delivery Contracts


<R05>
516.506  Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

    (a) In solicitations and contracts for stock or special order 
program items, when the contract authorizes FSS and other activities to 
issue delivery or task orders, insert the clause at 552.216-72, 
Placement of Orders. If only FSS will issue delivery or task orders, 
insert the clause with its Alternate I.
    (b) In solicitations and contracts for single or multiple award 
schedule program items, insert the clause at 552.216-72, Placement of 
Orders, with its Alternate II.
    (c) If the clause at 552.216-72 is prescribed, insert the provision 
at 552.216-73, Ordering Information, in solicitations for stock items 
and in other FSS solicitations. Use 552.216-73 Alternate I when 552.216-
72 Alternate I is prescribed. Use 552.216-73 Alternate II when 552.72 
Alternate II is prescribed.

                    Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services

    (a) Requirement for a price proposal. Before you award a letter 
contract, the proposed A-E must provide a price proposal for the non-
design effort.
    (b) Contents of each letter contract. You must include the following 
information in the letter contract:
    (1) The scope. If you include the design effort, only authorize the 
A-E to perform those services that are independent of the design effort 
(for example, feasibility studies, existing facility surveys or site 
investigation, etc.). Do not authorize the A-E to begin the design 
effort before the letter contract is definitized.
    (2) A definitization schedule. Include dates for each of the 
following:
    (i) Submission of the design fee proposal.
    (ii) Start of negotiations.
    (iii) Definitization. This date must be no later than 90 days after 
the date of the letter contract.
    (3) A limitation on the Government's liability for the non-design 
effort to be performed under the contract. Insert this amount in FAR 
52.216-24, Limitation of Government Liability.
    (c) Unilateral price decision. If you must issue a unilateral price 
decision, the maximum contract amount must not exceed a reasonable price 
for the excludable items plus the 6 percent statutory fee limitation for 
the project.

(including dredging, excavating, and painting) of buildings, bridges, 
roads, or other kinds of real property.
    (2) Architect-engineer services.
    (b) If a requirement in this subpart is inconsistent with FAR 17.2, 
this subpart takes precedence.


<R05>
517.202  Use of options.

    (a) Supplies or services.
    (1) You should use options when they meet one or more of the 
following objectives:
    (i) Reduce procurement lead time and associated costs.
    (ii) Ensure continuity of contract support.
    (iii) Improve overall contractor performance.
    (iv) Facilitate longer term contractual relationships with those 
contractors that continually meet or exceed quality performance 
expectations.
    (2) An option is normally in the Government's interest in the 
following circumstances:
    (i) You anticipate a need for additional supplies or services during 
the contract term.
    (ii) Multiyear contracting authority is not available or its use is 
inappropriate and you anticipate a need for additional supplies or 
services beyond the initial contract term.
    (iii) There is a need for continuity of supply or service support.
    (iv) Funds are not available for the entirety of the Government's 
needs, but are likely to become available during the contract term.
    (v) The initial contract will be used to evaluate the performance of 
an emerging small business.
    (3) Do not use an option if the market price is likely to change 
substantially and an economic price adjustment clause inadequately 
protects the Government's interest.
    (b) Construction. For limitations on the use of options, see 536.213 
and 536.270.


<R05>

    Before exercising an option, you must:
    (a) Synopsize it unless you meet of the following conditions:
    (1) The option was evaluated as part of the original competition.
    (2) The contract action meets an exception in FAR 5.202.
    (b) Conclude that the contractor's performance under the contract 
met or exceeded the Government's expectation for quality performance, 
unless another circumstance justifies an extended contractual 
relationship.
    (c) Determine that the option price is fair and reasonable.


<R05>
517.208  Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

    (a) For solicitations under FSS's Stock or Special Order Program, 
insert a provision substantially the same as the provision at 552.217-
70, Evaluation of Options, if both of the following conditions apply:
    (1) The solicitation contains an option to extend the term of the 
contract.

<R05>
525.105-70  Procurement of hand or measuring tools or stainless steel flatware for DOD.

    (a) Stainless steel flatware means special order and stock items of 
stainless steel flatware purchased for DOD, including, but not limited 
to, the following National Stock Numbers (NSN):

7340-00-060-6057
7340-00-205-3340
7340-00-205-3341
7340-00-241-8169

7340-00-688-1055
7340-00-721-6316
7340-00-721-6971

    (b) Purchases of hand or measuring tools or stainless steel flatware 
exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold by DOD must be domestic 
end products. In the case of stainless steel flatware, the Secretary of 
the Department concerned can make an exception. The individual must 
determine that a satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity produced 
in the United States or its possessions are not available when needed at 
domestic market prices.
    (c) If GSA solicitations of hand or measuring tools or stainless 
steel flatware include DOD requirements, GSA will apply the DOD 
restrictions. The bases for applying the DOD restriction to GSA 
acquisitions are:
    (1) DOD's restrictions apply to requisitions of such items from the 
GSA stock program.
    (2) The impracticality of establishing a dual supply system to 
satisfy the requirements of civilian and military agencies.
    (3) GSA may reject any offer when it is considered necessary for 
reasons of national interest.


<R05>
525.109  Solicitation provisions and contract clause.

    If you include DOD requirements for hand or measuring tools or 
stainless steel flatware in the solicitation for an acquisition to 
exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, insert 552.225-70, Notice 
of Procurement Restriction--Hand or Measuring Tools or Stainless Steel 
Flatware, in the solicitation and resulting contract(s).

    GSA procurements made directly for other agencies of items to be 
used outside the United States are made the Balance of Payments Program. 
The only exception is if GSA contracts as the agent for an agency 
governed by the Foreign Assistance Act (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.). If this 
exception applies, the contract will be governed by the policies and 
procedures of the agency instead of FAR 25.3 and 525.3. For example, GSA 
sometimes acts as agent for the Agency for International Development and 
the Bureau of International Narcotics Matters.

Government. Prepare a written justification for specifying the longer 
period and obtain your contracting director's approval.
    (ii) Use Alternate I if the lease contract does not contain 
provisions for ordering alterations or overtime utility services.
    (2) Insert 552.232-76, Electronic Funds Transfer Payment, in

accept payment by commercial credit card for orders of:

____ $2,500 or less

tailoring is authorized by a deviation approved on January 5, 1999.
    (1) Delete paragraph FAR 52.212-4(g), Invoice.
    (2) Add the following to paragraph FAR 52.212-4(i), Payment:

    The Government shall pay the Contractor, without submission of 
invoices or vouchers, 30 days after the service period, the prices 
stipulated in this contract for services rendered and accepted, less any

                         Subpart 536.1--General


<R05>
536.101  Applicability.

    If a requirement in this part is inconsistent with a requirement in 
another GSAR part, this part takes precedence.


<R04>
     Subpart 536.2--Special Aspects of Contracting for Construction


<R05>
536.213  Special procedures for sealed bidding in construction contracting.


<R05>
536.213-3  Invitations for bids.


<R05>
536.213-370  Bids that include alternates.

    (a) The base bid must include all features essential to a sound and 
adequate building design. If it appears that funds available for a 
project may be insufficient to include all desired features in the base 
bid, you may issue a solicitation for a base bid and include one or more 
alternates in the order of priority. Use alternates only if they are 
clearly justified and involve substantial amounts of work in relation to 
the base bid. Their use must be limited and should involve only ``add'' 
alternates.
    (b) Before opening bids that include alternates, determine, and 
record in the contract file, the amount of funds available for the 
project. The amount recorded must be announced at the beginning of the 
bid opening. The amount is the controlling factor in determining the low 
bidder. This amount may be increased later when determining the 
alternate items to award to the low bidder if the following condition is 
met: the award amount of the base bid plus the combination of alternate 
items does not exceed the amount offered for the base bid and the same 
combination of alternate items by any other responsible bidder whose bid 
conforms to the solicitation. This requirement prevents the displacement 
of the low bidder by manipulating the alternates to be used.


<R05>
536.213-371  Bids that include options.

    (a) Subject to the limitations in paragraph (c) of this section, you 
may include options in contracts if it is in the Government's interest.
    (b) the appropriate use of options may include, but is not limited 
to, any of the following:

[[Page 342]]

    (1) If additional work is anticipated but funds are not expected to 
be available at the time of award, and it would not be practicable to 
award a separate contract or to permit an additional contractor to work 
on the same site.
    (2) If fixed building equipment, e.g. elevators or escalators, will 
be installed under the construction contract and it is advantageous to 
have the installer of the equipment maintain and service the equipment 
during the warranty period.
    (c) You must not use options under any of the following conditions:
    (1) the prospective option represents known firm requirements for 
which funds are available unless competition for the option quantity is 
impracticable once the initial contract is awarded.
    (2) The contractor will incur undue risks; e.g., the price or 
availability of necessary materials or labor is not reasonably 
foreseeable.
    (d) Solicitations containing option provisions must state the period 
within which the options may be exercised.
    (e) Solicitations must state whether the basis of award is inclusive 
or exclusive of the options. Before issuing a solicitation that includes 
evaluated options, you must determine that there is reasonable certainty 
that funds will be made available to permit exercise of the option.


<R05>
536.213-372  Bids that include both alternates and options.

    (a) Solicitations may include both alternates and options if the 
conditions in 536.213-370, Bids that include alternates, and 536.213-
371, Bids that include options, are satisfied. In these solicitations, 
the low bidder for purposes of award is the responsible bidder offering 
the lowest aggregate price for the base bid and the alternates, in the 
order of priority listed in the solicitation, that provide the most work 
features within the funds available at bid opening, plus all options 
designated to be evaluated.
    (b) The basis of award may require the evaluation of options 
associated with alternates if the related alternate is selected.
    (c) Before opening bids that include both alternates and options, 
determine, and record in the contract file, the amount of funds 
available for the project (i.e., for the base bid and alternate work). 
The amount recorded must be announced at the beginning of the bid 
opening. This amount may be increased later when determining the 
alternate items to be awarded to the low bidder if the following 
condition is met: the award amount of the base bid and evaluated options 
plus the alternate items does not exceed the amount offered for the base 
bid, the evaluated options, and the same combination of alternate items 
by any other responsible bidder whose bid conforms to the solicitation.


<R05>
536.270  Exercise of options.

    (a) If exercising an option, notify the contractor, in writing, 
within the time period specified in the contract.
    (b) Exercise options only after determining that all the following 
conditions exist:
    (1) Funds are available.
    (2) The requirement covered by the option fulfills an existing 
Government need.
    (3) Exercising the option is the most advantageous method of 
satisfying the Government's need, price and other factors considered.
    (c) Before exercising an option, you must determine that the action 
complies with the option's terms and this section's requirements. 
Include your written determination in the contract file.
    (d) The contract modification, or other written document which 
notifies the contractor of the exercise of the option, must cite the 
option clause as authority. If exercising an unpriced or unevaluated 
option, cite the statutory authority permitting the use of other than 
full and open competition (see FAR 6.302 and 517.207).


<R05>
536.271  Project labor agreements.

    (a) Authority. This subpart implements the Presidential memorandum 
of June 5, 1997, on using project labor agreements (PLAs) on Federal 
construction projects. The Presidential memorandum authorizes executive 
departments and agencies to require PLAs on large and significant 
construction projects for facilities to be

[[Page 343]]

owned by a Federal department or agency.
    (b) Applicability. These policies and procedures apply to all GSA 
activities authorized to award contracts for construction of facilities 
to be owned by a Federal department or agency. You may use a PLA in 
leasehold arrangement, Federally funded projects, and other appropriate 
circumstances.
    (c) Definitions. Construction means construction, alteration, or 
repair (including dredging, excavating, and painting) of buildings, 
structures, or other real property. The terms buildings, structures, or 
other real property are defined further in Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) 36.102.
    Labor organization means a labor organization engaged in an industry 
affecting commerce, and any agent of such an organization, and includes 
any organization of any kind, and any agency, or employee representation 
committee, group, association, or plan so engaged in which employees 
participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of 
dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, 
rates of pay, hours, or other terms or conditions of employment, and any 
conference, general committee, joint or system board, or joint council 
so engaged which is subordinate to a national or international labor 
organization (42 U.S.C. 2000e(d)).
    Large and significant project means a Federal construction project 
with a total cost to the Federal Government of more than $5 million.
    Project Labor Agreement (PLA) means an agreement between the 
contractor, subcontractors, and the union(s) representing workers. Under 
a PLA, the contractor and subcontractors on a project and the union(s) 
agree on terms and conditions of employment for the project, 
establishing a framework for labor-management cooperation to advance the 
Government's procurement interest in cost, efficiency, and quality.
    (d) Policy. (1) You may, on a project-by-project basis, use a PLA on 
a large and significant project when both of the following conditions 
apply:
    (i) A PLA will advance the Government's procurement interests.
    (ii) No laws that apply to the specific construction project 
preclude the use of the PLA.
    (2) Do not require any contractor to enter into a PLA with any 
particular labor organization.
    (3) The use of a PLA is not intended to create any right or benefit, 
substantive or procedural enforceable by a nonfederal party against the 
United States, its departments, and agencies, its officers or employees, 
or any other person.
    (e) Procedures. (1) As part of procurement planning for construction 
projects with a total estimated cost to the Federal Government of more 
than $5 million, you may consider requiring a PLA.
    (2) To require a PLA, you must determine whether use of a PLA will 
advance the Government's procurement interests in all the following 
areas:
    (i) Cost, efficiency, and quality.
    (ii) Promoting labor-management stability.
    (iii) Promoting compliance with applicable legal requirements 
governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and 
employment standards, and other matters.
    (3) In making the determination required by paragraph (b) of this 
section, consult with the agency project or program manager and obtain 
guidance from the Agency Labor Advisor and assigned legal counsel. You 
should consider the following factors:
    (i) Whether past experience with construction projects in the 
location where the project will be performed indicates that a PLA will 
be effective.
    (ii) Whether delays in performance of the construction contract 
would have significant adverse impact on the mission of the agency or 
operation of the installation or facility.
    (iii) Whether any law applies to the specific construction project 
that would impede use of a PLA.
    (iv) Whether the labor organizations in the area can provide a 
reliable source of skilled, experienced building trades workers in all 
crafts needed on the job site for the project's duration (taking into 
consideration other major construction work in the area).

[[Page 344]]

    (v) Whether the Government can benefit from uniform work rules and 
working conditions and established procedures for resolving labor 
disputes, no strike/no lock-out protections.
    (vi) Whether the Government can benefit from increased stability and 
labor peace that derives from greater labor-management cooperation.
    (vii) Whether the requirements for a PLA will unreasonably restrict 
competition.
    (viii) Other relevant information.
    (4) Document the rationale supporting your decision to require a PLA 
in the contract file.
    (5) Provide the following information to the Agency Labor Advisor 
(GSA Acquisition Policy Division (MVP)):
    (i) A brief description of the project.
    (ii) The estimated cost.
    (iii) A copy of the document supporting your decision to require a 
PLA.
    (iv) A copy of the solicitation.

<R04>
 Subpart 538.2--Establishing and Administering Federal Supply Schedules


<R05>
538.270  Evaluation of multiple award schedule (MAS) offers.

    (a) The Government will seek to obtain the offeror's best price (the 
best price given to the most favored customer). However, the Government 
recognizes that the terms and conditions of commercial sales vary and 
there may be legitimate reasons why the best price is not achieved.
    (b) Establish negotiation objectives based on a review of relevant 
data and determine price reasonableness.
    (c) When establishing negotiation objectives and determining price 
reasonableness, compare the terms and conditions of the MAS solicitation 
with the terms and conditions of agreements with the offeror's 
commercial customers. When determining the Government's price 
negotiation objectives, consider the following factors:
    (1) Aggregate volume of anticipated purchases.
    (2) The purchase of a minimum quantity or a pattern of historic 
purchases.
    (3) Prices taking into consideration any combination of discounts 
and concessions offered to commercial customers.
    (4) Length of the contract period.
    (5) Warranties, training, and/or maintenance included in the 
purchase price or provided at additional cost to the product prices.
    (6) Ordering and delivery practices.
    (7) Any other relevant information, including differences between 
the MAS solicitation and commercial terms and conditions that may 
warrant differentials between the offer and the discounts offered to the 
most favored commercial customer(s). For example, an offeror may incur 
more expense selling to the Government than to the customer who receives 
the offeror's best price, or the customer (e.g., dealer, distributor, 
original equipment manufacturer, other reseller) who receives the best 
price may perform certain value-added functions for the offeror that the 
Government does not perform. In such cases, some reduction in the 
discount given to the Government may be appropriate. If the best price 
is not offered to the Government, you should ask the offeror to identify 
and explain the reason for any differences. Do not require offerors to 
provide detailed cost breakdowns.
    (d) You may award a contract containing pricing which is less 
favorable than the best price the offeror extends to any commercial 
customer for similar purchases if you make a determination that both of 
the following conditions exist:
    (1) The prices offered to the Government are fair and reasonable, 
even though comparable discounts were not negotiated.
    (2) Award is otherwise in the best interest of the Government.


<R05>
538.271  MAS contract awards.

    (a) MAS awards will be for commercial items as defined in FAR 2.101. 
Negotiate contracts as a discount from established catalog prices.
    (b) Before awarding any MAS contract, determine that the offered 
prices are fair and reasonable (see FAR subpart 15.4 and 538.270). 
Document the negotiation and your determination using FAR 15.406-3 as 
guidance.
    (c) State clearly in the award document the price/discount 
relationship between the Government and the identified commercial 
customer (or category of customers) on which the award is predicated.


<R05>
538.272  MAS price reductions.

    (a) Section 552.238-75, Price Reductions, requires the contractor to 
maintain during the contract period the negotiated price/discount 
relationship (and/or term and condition relationship) between the 
Government and the offeror's customer or category of customers on which 
the contract award was predicated (see 538.271(c)). If a change occurs 
in the contractor's commercial pricing or discount arrangement 
applicable to the identified commercial customer (or category of 
customers) that results in a less advantageous relationship between the 
Government and this customer or category of customers, the change 
constitutes a ``price reduction.''
    (b) Make sure that the contractor understands the requirements of 
section 552.238-75 and agrees to report to you

[[Page 347]]

all price reductions as provided for in the clause.


<R05>
538.273  Contract clauses.

    (a) Multiple award schedules. Insert in solicitations and contracts:
    (1) 552.238-70, Identification of Electronic Office Equipment 
Providing Accessibility for the Handicapped, if you include electronic 
office equipment items.
    (2) 552.238-71, Submission and Distribution of Authorized FSS 
Schedule Pricelists. If GSA is not prepared to accept electronic 
submissions for a particular schedule delete:
    (i) Subparagraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(3).
    (ii) The subparagraph identifier ``(i)'' in (c)(1) and the word 
``and'' at the end of subparagraph (i).
    (3) 552.238-72, Identification of Energy-Efficient Office Equipment 
and Supplies Containing Recovered Materials or Other Environmental 
Attributes.
    (4) 552.238-73, Cancellation.
    (b) Multiple and single award schedules. Insert in solicitations and 
contracts:
    (1) 552.238-74, Contractor's Report of Sales.
    (2) 552.238-75, Price Reductions.
    (3) 552.238-76, Industrial Funding Fee.

improper influence.
    ``Bona fide employee,'' as used in this clause, means a person, 
employed by a Contractor and subject to the Contractor's supervision and 
control as to time, place, and manner of performance, who neither exerts 
nor proposes to exert improper influence to solicit or obtain Government 
contracts nor

[[Page 355]]

holds out as being able to obtain any Government contract or contracts 
through improper influence.
    ``Contingent fee,'' as used in this clause, means any commission, 
percentage, brokerage, or other fee that is contingent upon the success 
that a person or concern has in securing a Government contract.

      Price Adjustment for Illegal or Improper Activity (SEP 1999)

    (a) If the head of the contracting activity (HCA) or his or her 
designee determines that there was a violation of subsection 27(a) of 
the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, as amended (41 U.S.C. 
423), as implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the 
Government, at its election, may--
    (1) Reduce the monthly rental under this lease by 5 percent of the 
amount of the rental for each month of the remaining term of the lease, 
including any option periods, and recover 5 percent of the rental 
already paid;
    (2) Reduce payments for alterations not included in monthly rental 
payments by 5 percent of the amount of the alterations agreement; or
    (3) Reduce the payments for violations by a Lessor's subcontractor 
by an amount not to exceed the amount of profit or fee reflected in the 
subcontract at the time the subcontract was placed.
    (b) Prior to making a determination as set forth above, the HCA or 
designee shall provide to the Lessor a written notice of the action 
being considered and the basis therefor. The Lessor shall have a period 
determined by the agency head or designee, but not less than 30 calendar 
days after receipt of such notice, to submit in person, in writing, or 
through a representative, information and argument in opposition to the 
proposed reduction. The agency head or designee may, upon good cause 
shown, determine to deduct less than the above amounts from payments.
    (c) The rights and remedies of the Government specified herein are

    As prescribed in 512.301(a)(4), insert the following provision:

    Evaluation--Commercial Items (Multiple Award Schedule) (AUG 1997)

    (a) The Government may make multiple awards for the supplies or 
services offered in response to this solicitation that meet the 
definition of a ``commercial item'' in FAR 52.202-1. Awards may be made 
to those responsible offerors that offer reasonable pricing, conforming 
to the solicitation, and will be most advantageous to the Government, 
taking into consideration the multiplicity and complexity of items of 
various manufacturers and the differences in performance required to 
accomplish or produce required end results, production and distribution 
facilities, price, compliance with delivery requirements, and other 
pertinent factors. By providing a selection of comparable supplies or 
services, ordering activities are afforded the opportunity to fulfill 
their requirements with the item(s) that constitute the best value and 
that meet their needs at the lowest overall cost.
    (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or 
otherwise furnished to the offeror within the time for acceptance 
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without 
further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration 
time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether 
or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice 
of withdrawal is received before award.

                           (End of provision)

    Alternate I (AUG 1997). When anticipating competition of identical 
items,

[[Page 363]]

add the following paragraph after paragraph (b) of the basic provision.
    (c) The Government reserves the right to award only one contract for 
all or a part of a manufacturer's product line. When two or more 
offerors (e.g., dealers/resellers) offer the identical product, award 
may be made competitively to only one offeror on the basis of the lowest 
price. (Discounts for early payment will not be considered as an 
evaluation factor in determining the low offeror). During initial open 
season for an option period, any offers that are equal to or lower than 
the current contract price received for identical items will be 
considered. Current contractors will also be allowed to submit offers 
for identical items during this initial open season. The current 
contractor which has the identical item on contract will be included in 
the evaluation process. The Government will evaluate all offers and may 
award only one contract for each specified product or aggregate group.


<R05>
552.214-70  ``All or None'' Offers.

    As prescribed in 514.201-6, insert the following provision:

                    ``All or None'' Offers (SEP 1999)

    (a) Unless awards in the aggregate are specifically precluded in 
this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to evaluate offers 
and make awards on all ``all or none'' basis as provided below.
    (b) An offer submitted on an ``all or none'' or similar basis will 
be evaluated as follows: The lowest acceptable offer exclusive of the 
``all or none'' offer will be selected with respect to each item (or 
group of items when the solicitation provides for aggregate awards) and 
the total cost of all items thus determined shall be compared with the 
total of the lowest acceptable ``all or none'' offer. Award will be made 
to result in the lowest total cost to the Government.

                           (End of provision)

    Alternate I (SEP 1999). For a requirements or indefinite quantity 
contract, the following paragraph (b) shall be substituted in the basic 
provision:
    (b) An offer submitted on an ``all or none'' or similar basis will 
not be considered unless the offer is low on each item to which the 
``all or none'' offer is made applicable. The term ``each item'' as used 
in this provision refers either to an item that under the terms of the 
solicitation may be independently awarded, or to a group of items on 
which an award is to be made in the aggregate.

    (a) Monthly quantity allocation.
    (1) Set forth below are the Government's estimated annual and 
monthly requirements for each stock item covered by this solicitation. 
Offerors shall indicate, in the spaces provided, the monthly quantity 
which they are willing to furnish of any item or group of items 
involving the use of the same production facilities. In making monthly 
allocations, offerors are urged to group as many items as possible. Such 
groupings will make it possible for the Government to make fullest use 
of the production capabilities of each offeror.
    (2) Offerors need not limit their monthly allocations to the 
Government's estimated monthly requirements, since additional 
unanticipated needs may occur during the period of the contract. If an 
offeror does not insert monthly allocation quantities, it will be deemed 
to offer to furnish all of the Government's requirements, even though 
they may exceed the stated estimated requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Progressive awards. If the low responsive offeror's monthly 
quantity allocation is less than the Government's estimated 
requirements, the Government may make progressive awards beginning with 
the low responsive offeror and including each next low responsive 
offeror to the extent necessary to meet the estimated requirements.
    (c) Ordering procedures. If progressive awards are made, orders will 
be placed first with the Contractor offering the lowest price on each 
item normally up to that Contractor's maximum quantity allocation and 
then, in the same manner, successively to other Contractors. When 
cumulative orders during any month, placed with a lower priced 
Contractor, equal or exceed 95 percent of its monthly quantity 
allocation, to avoid the placement of unduly small orders or the 
splitting of a subsequent order, the Government reserves the right to 
award the full quantity of the subsequent order to the next

[[Page 364]]

lower priced Contractor. In no case will orders be placed with any 
Contractor in excess of its monthly quantity allocation.

Economic Price Adjustment-Stock and Special Order Program Contracts (SEP 
                                  1999)

    (a) ``Producer Price Index'' (PPI), as used in this clause, means 
the originally released index, not seasonally adjusted, published by the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor (Labor) for product 
code ________ found under Table ________.
    (b) During the term of the contract, the award price may be adjusted 
once upward or downward a maximum of *________ percent. Any price 
adjustment for the product code shall be based upon the percentage 
change in the PPI released in the month prior to the initial month of 
the contract period specified in the solicitation for sealed bidding or 
the month prior to award in negotiation (the base index) and the PPI 
released 12 months later (the updated index). The formula for 
determining the Adjusted Contract Price (ACP) applicable to shipments 
for the balance of the contract period is-

    (c) If the PPI is not available for the month of the base index or 
the updated index, the month with the most recently published PPI prior 
to the month determining the base index or updated index shall be used.
    (d) If a product code is discontinued, the Government and the 
Contractor will mutually agree to substitute a similar product code. If 
Labor designates an index with a new title and/or code number as 
continuous with the product code specified above, the new index shall be 
used.
    (e) Unless the Contractor's written request for a price adjustment 
resulting from the application of the formula in (b) above is received 
by the Contracting Officer within 30 calendar days of the release of the 
updated index, the Contractor shall have waived its right to an upward 
price adjustment for the balance of the contract. Alternatively, the 
Contracting Officer will unilaterally adjust the award price downward 
when appropriate using the updated index defined in (b) above.
    (f) Price adjustments shall be effective upon execution of a 
contract modification by the Government or on the 31st day following

    (b) In any option period, the contract price may be adjusted upward 
or downward a maximum of *________ percent.
    (1) For the first option period, any price adjustment for the 
product code shall be based upon the percentage change in the PPI 
released in the month prior to the initial month of the contract period 
specified in the solicitation for sealed bidding or the month prior to 
award in negotiation (the base index) and the PPI released in the third 
month before completion of the initial contract period stated in the 
solicitation (the updated index). This initial contract period may be 
less than 12 months. The formula for determining the Adjusted Contract 
Price (ACP) applicable to shipments during the first option period is--

    (2) For any subsequent option period, the price adjustment shall be 
the percentage change between the previously updated index (the new base 
index) and the PPI released 12 months later (the most recent updated 
index). This percentage shall be applied to the Current Contract Price 
(CCP). The formula for determining the ACP applicable to shipments for 
the subsequent option period(s) is--
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09JY99.002

    (e) Unless the Contractor's written request for a price adjustment 
resulting from the application of the formulas in (b) (1) or (2) above 
is received by the Contracting Officer within 30 calendar days of the 
date of the Government's preliminary written notice of its intent to 
exercise the option, the Contractors shall have waived its right to an 
upward price adjustment for that option period. Alternatively, the 
Contracting Officer in its written notice shall exercise the option at 
the CCP or at a reduced price when appropriate using the formulas in (b) 
(1) or (2) above.
    (f) Price adjustments shall be effected by execution of a contract

                    Evaluation of Options (AUG 1990)

    (a) The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by 
determining the lowest base period price. When option year pricing is 
based on a formula (e.g., changes in the Producer Price Index or other 
common standard); option year pricing is automatically' considered when 
evaluating the base year price, as any change in price will be uniformly 
related to changes in market conditions. All options are therefore 
considered to be evaluated. Evaluation of options will not obligate the 
Government to exercise the option(s).
    (b) The Government will reject the offer if exceptions are taken to 
the price provisions of the Economic Price Adjustment clause, unless the 
exception results in a lower maximum option year price. Such offers will 
be evaluated without regard to the lower option year(s) maximum. 
However, if the offeror offering a lower maximum is awarded a contract, 
the award will reflect the lower maximum.

[Insert ``purchase additional quantities of supplies or services'' or 
``extend the term of this contract'' or ``purchase additional quantities 
of supplies or services and to extend the term of this contract''] in 
order to demonstrate the value it places on quality performance by 
providing a mechanism for continuing a contractual relationship with a 
successful Offeror that performs at a level which meets or exceeds GSA's 
quality performance expectations as communicated to the Contractor, in 
writing, by the Contracting Officer or designated representative. When 
deciding whether to exercise the option, the Contracting Officer will 
consider the quality of the Contractor's past performance under this 
contract in accordance with 48 CFR 517.207.

    Where the set-aside portion of an item or group of items is awarded 
to a Contractor other than the one receiving the award on the 
corresponding non-set-aside portion, the Government will divide the 
requirements to be ordered between the two Contractors with the 
objective of achieving, as nearly as possible, a 50/50 division of the 
total value of orders placed after the award of the set-aside portion. 
In no case will this division vary by more than a 60/40 division (with 
either the non-set-aside or set-aside Contractor receiving the larger

small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns to 
participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its 
efficient performance. GSA expects any subcontracting plan submitted

this commitment. Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business 
concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 
for construction), must demonstrate that its subcontracting plan 
represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, 
HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business 
concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.

 Preparation, Submission, and Negotiation of Subcontracting Plans (SEP 
                                  1999)

    (a) An offeror, other than a small business concern, submitting an 
offer that exceeds $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) shall submit a 
subcontracting plan with its initial offer. The subcontracting plan will 
be negotiated concurrently with price and any required technical and 
management proposals, unless the offeror submits a previously-approved 
commercial products plan.
    (b) Maximum practicable utilization of small, HUBZone small, small 
disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors 
is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits. 
The General Services Administration (GSA) expects that an offeror's 
subcontracting plan will reflect a commitment to assuring that small, 
HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business 
concerns are provided the maximum practicable opportunity, consistent 
with efficient contract performance, to participate as subcontractors in 
the performance of the resulting contract. An offeror submitting a 
commercial products plan can reflect this commitment through 
subcontracting opportunities it provides that relate to the offeror's 
production generally; i.e., for both its commercial and Government 
business.
    (c) GSA believes that this potential contract provides significant 
opportunities for the use of small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, 
and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors. Consequently, 
in addressing the eleven elements described at FAR 52.219-9(d) of the 
clause in this contract entitled Small Business Subcontracting Plan, the 
offeror shall:
    (1) Demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative 
and innovative program for involving small, HUBZone small, small 
disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns in performing the 
contract.
    (2) Include a description of the offeror's subcontracting strategies 
used in any previous contracts, significant achievements, and how this 
plan will build upon those earlier achievements.
    (3) Demonstrate through its plan that it understands the small 
business subcontracting program's objectives and GSA's expectations, and 
it is committed to taking those actions necessary to meet these goals or 
objectives.
    (d) In determining the acceptability of any subcontracting plan, the 
Contracting Officer will take each of the following actions:
    (1) Review the plan to verify that the offeror demonstrates an 
understanding of the small business subcontracting program's objectives 
and GSA's expectations with respect to the program and has included all 
the information, goals, and assurances required by FAR 52.219-9.
    (2) Consider previous goals and achievements of contractors in the 
small industry.
    (3) Consider information and potential sources obtained from 
agencies administering national and local preference programs and other 
advocacy groups in evaluating whether the goals stated in the plan 
adequately reflect the anticipated potential for subcontracting to 
small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small 
business concerns.
    (4) Review the offeror's description of its strategies, historical 
performance and significant achievements in placing subcontracts for the 
same or similar products or services with small, HUBZone small, small 
disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns. The offeror's 
description can apply to commercial as well as previous Government 
contracts.
    (e) Failure to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan and/or 
correct deficiencies in a plan within the time specified by the 
Contracting Officer shall make the offeror ineligible for award.

    (a) Maximum practicable utilization of small, HUBZone small, small 
disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors 
is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits.
    (1) The General Service Administration's (GSA's) commitment to 
ensuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, 
HUBZone small, small disdvantaged, and women-owned small business 
concerns to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this 
contract, consistent with its efficient performance, must be reflected 
in the offeror's subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to the clause of 
this contract at FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.
    (2) In addressing the eleven elements described at FAR 52.219-9(d), 
the offeror shall demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a 
creative and innovative program for involving small, HUBZone small, 
small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns in 
performing this contract. An offeror submitting a commercial products 
plan can demonstrate its commitment in providing maximum practicable 
opportunities through subcontracting opportunities it provides to small, 
HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-

[[Page 371]]

owned small business concerns that relate to the offeror's production 
generally; i.e., for both its commercial and Government business.
    (3) The subcontracting plan shall include a description of the 
offeror's subcontracting strategies used in previous contracts and 
significant achievements, with an explanation of how this plan will 
build upon those earlier achievements. Additionally, the offeror shall 
demonstrate through its plan that it understands the small business 
subcontracting program's objectives, GSA's expectations, and is 
committed to taking those actions necessary to meet these goals or 
objectives.
    (b) GSA believes that this contract provides significant 
opportunities for the use of small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, 
and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors. Accordingly, 
it is anticipated that an acceptable subcontracting plan will contain at 
least the following goals:


Small Business.......................................      ____ percent.
HUBZone Small Business...............................      ____ percent.
Small Disadvantaged Business.........................      ____ percent.
Women-Owned Small Business...........................      ____ percent.
 

    Note: Target goals are expressed as a percentage of planned 
subcontracting dollars.

    (c) In determining the acceptability of any subcontracting plan, the 
Contracting Officer will--
    (1) Review the plan to verify that the offeror has demonstrated an 
understanding of the small business subcontracting program's objectives 
and GSA's expectations with respect to the programs and has included all 
the information, goals, and assurances required by FAR 52.219-9;
    (2) Consider previous goals and achievements of contractors in the 
same industry;
    (3) Consider information and potential sources obtained from 
agencies administering national and local preference programs and other 
advocacy groups in evaluating whether the goals stated in the plan 
adequately reflect the anticipated potential for subcontracting to 
small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small 
business concerns; and
    (4) Review the offeror's description of its strategies, historical 
performance and significant achievements in placing subcontracts for the 
same or similar products or services with small, HUBZone small, small 
disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns. The offeror's 
description can apply to commercial as well as previous Government 
contracts.
    (d) Failure to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan and/or 
correct deficiencies in a plan within the time specified by the 
Contracting Officer shall make the offeror ineligible for award.

  Buy American Act--Trade Agreements--Balance of Payments Program (SEP

    (a) This clause implements the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (19 
U.S.C. 2501-2582) by providing a preference for U.S. made end products, 
designated country end products, Caribbean Basin country end products, 
Canadian end products or Mexican end products over other products.

from that of the article or articles from which it was so transformed. 
The term includes services (except transportation services) incidental

consists in whole or in part of materials from another country or 
instrumentality, has been substantially transformed into a new and 
different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct 
from that of the article or articles from which it was so transformed. 
The term includes services (except transportation services) incidental 
to its supply, provided that the value of those incidental services does 
not exceed that of the product itself. It does not include service 
contracts as such.
    ``Canadian end product,'' as used in this clause, means an article 
that (1) is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of Canada, or (2) 
in the case of an article which consists in whole or in part of 
materials from another country or instrumentality, has been 
substantially transformed in Canada into a new and different article of 
commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the 
article or articles from which it was transformed. The term includes 
services (except transportation services) incidental to its supply; 
provided, that the value of those incidental services does not exceed 
that of the product itself. It does not include service contracts as 
such.
    ``Mexican end product,'' as used in this clause, means an article 
that (1) is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of Mexico, or (2) 
in the case of an article which consists in whole or in part of 
materials from another country or instrumentality, has been 
substantially transformed in Mexico into a new and different article of 
commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the 
article or articles from which it was so transformed. The term includes 
services (except transportation services) incidental to its supply, 
provided that the value of those incidental services does not exceed 
that of the product itself. It does not include service contracts as 
such.
    ``End products,'' as used in this clause, means those articles, 
materials, and supplies to be acquired under this contract for public 
use.
    ``U.S. made end product,'' as used in this clause, means an article 
which (1) is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of the United 
States, or (2) in the case of an article which consists in whole or in 
part of materials from another country or instrumentality, has been 
substantially transformed in the United States into a new and different 
article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of 
the article or articles from which it was so transformed.
    ``Nondesignated country end products,'' as used in this clause, 
means any end product which is not a U.S. made end product, designated 
country end product, Caribbean Basin Country end product, Canadian end 
product or Mexican end product.
    ``United States,'' as used in this clause, means the United States, 
its possessions, Puerto Rico, and any other place which is

[[Page 374]]

subject to its jurisdiction, but does not include leased bases or trust 
territories.
    (b) The Contractor agrees to deliver under this contract only U.S. 
made end products, designated country end products, Caribbean Basin 
country end products, Canadian end products or Mexican end products or, 
if a national interest waiver is granted under section 302 of the Trade 
Agreements Act of 1979, nondesignated country end products. Only if such 
waiver is granted may a nondesignated country end product be delivered 
under the contract(s).
    (c) Offers will be evaluated in accordance with the policies and 
procedures of Part 25 of the FAR except that offers of U.S. made end 
products, designated country end products, Caribbean Basin end products, 
Canadian end products or Mexican end products shall be evaluated without 
the restrictions of the Buy American Act or the Balance of Payments 
Program.

    (a) Awards under this solicitation will only be made to offerors 
that will furnish hand or measuring tools or stainless steel flatware

interest to reject foreign products.
    As used in this clause, a ``domestic end product'' is--
    (1) Any hand or measuring tool, except for an electric or air-motor 
driven hand tool, or stainless steel flatware, wholly produced or 
manufactured, including all components, in the United States or its 
possessions; or
    (2) Any electric or air-motor driven hand tool if the cost of its 
components produced or manufactured in the United States exceeds 75 
percent of the cost of all its components.
    (b) Tool kits or sets, being procured under this solicitation, will 
not be considered domestic end products if any individual tool 
classified in FSC Group 51 or 52 and included in a tool kit or set is 
not a domestic end product as defined in paragraph (a) of this clause. 
The restrictions of this clause do not apply to individual hand or 
measuring tools that are contained in the tool kit or set but are not 
classified in FSC Group 51 or 52.

Contractor for a period of three years after completion of the project 
agrees to furnish the original or copies of all such works on the 
request of the Contracting Officer.

    All designs, drawings, specifications, notes and other works

construction without additional compensation to the Contractor. The 
Government shall be considered the ``person for whom the work was

Section 201(b) of Title 17, United States Code. With respect thereto, 
the Contractor agrees not to assert or authorize others to assert any 
rights nor establish any claim under the design patent or copyright 
laws. The Contractor for a period of three years after completion of the 
project agrees to furnish all retained works on the request of the 
Contracting Officer. Unless otherwise provided in this contract, the

    (2) The Contractor requests it and the amount due on the deliveries 
is at least $1,000 or 50 percent of the total contract price.
    (c) When processing payment, GSA's Finance Office will automatically

552.232-8  Discounts for Prompt Payment.

    As prescribed in 532.206, insert the following clause:

    Discounts for Prompt Payment (APR 1989) (Deviation FAR 52.232-8)

    (a) Discounts for early payment (hereinafter referred to as 
``discounts'' or ``the discount'') will be considered in evaluating the 
relationship of the offeror's concessions to the Government vis-a-vis 
the offeror's concessions to its commercial customers, but only to the 
extent indicated in this clause.
    (b) Discounts will not be considered to determine the low offeror in 
the situation described in the ``Offers on Identical Products'' 
provision of this solicitation.
    (c) Uneconomical discounts will not be considered as meeting the 
criteria for award established by the Government. In this connection, a 
discount will be considered uneconomical if the annualized rate of 
return for earning the discount is lower than the ``value of funds'' 
rate established by the Department of the Treasury and published 
quarterly in the Federal Register. The ``value of funds'' rate applied 
will be the rate in effect on the date specified for the receipt of 
offers.
    (d) Agencies required to use the resultant schedule will not apply 
the discount in determining the lowest delivered price pursuant to the 
FPMR, 41 CFR 101-26.408, if the agency determines that payment will 
probably not be made within the discount period offered. The same is 
true if the discount is considered uneconomical at the time of placement 
of the order.
    (e) Discounts for early payment may be offered either in the 
original offer or on individual invoices submitted under the resulting 
contract. Discounts offered will be taken by the Government if payment 
is made within the discount period specified.
    (f) Discounts that are included in offers become a part of the 
resulting contracts and are binding on the Contractor for all orders

[[Page 376]]

placed under the contract. Discounts offered only on individual invoices 
will be binding on the Contractor only for the particular invoice on 
which the discount is offered.
    (g) In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time 
shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of 
computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been 
made on the date which appears on the payment check or the date on which 
an electronic funds transfer was made.

552.232-23  Assignment of Claims.

    As prescribed in 532.806, insert the following clause:

                     Assignment of Claims (SEP 1999)

    Because this is a requirements or indefinite quantity contract under 
which more than one agency may place orders, paragraph (a) of the 
Assignment of Claims clause (FAR 52.232-23) is inapplicable and the 
following is substituted therefor:
    In order to prevent confusion and delay in making payment, the 
Contractor shall not assign any claim(s) for amounts due or to become 
due under this contract. However, the Contractor is permitted to assign 
separately to a bank, trust company, or other financial institution, 
including any Federal lending agency, under the provisions of the 
Assignment of Claims Act, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 3727, 41 U.S.C. 15 
(hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''), all amounts due or to become 
due under any order amounting to $1,000 or more issued by any Government 
agency under this contract. Any such assignment takes effect only if and 
when the assignee files written notice of the assignment together with a 
true copy of the instrument of assignment with the contracting officer 
issuing the order and the finance office designated in the order to make 
payment. Unless otherwise stated in the order, payments to an assignee 
of any amounts due or to become due under any order assigned may, to the 
extent specified in the Act, be subject to reduction or set-off.

    As prescribed in 532.908(a)(2), insert the following clause:

           Prompt Payment (JUL 1998) (Deviation FAR 52.232-25)

    Notwithstanding any other payment clause in this contract, the 
Government will make invoice payments and contract financing payments 
under the terms and conditions specified in this clause. Payment shall 
be considered as being made on the day a check is dated or the date of 
an electronic funds transfer. Definitions of pertinent terms are set 
forth in section 32.902 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. All days 
referred to in this clause are calendar days, unless otherwise 
specified. (However, see subparagraph (a)(4) of this clause concerning 
payments due on Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.)
    (a) Invoice payments. (1) The due date for making invoice payments 
by the designated payment office is:
    (i) For orders placed electronically by the General Services 
Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Service (FSS), and to be paid by GSA 
through electronic funds transfer (EFT), the later of the following two 
events:
    (A) The 10th day after the designated billing office receives a 
proper invoice from the Contractor. If the designated billing office 
fails to annotate the invoice with the date of receipt at the time of 
receipt, the invoice payment due date shall be the 10th day after the 
date of the Contractor's invoice; provided the Contractor submitted a 
proper invoice and no disagreement exists over quantity, quality, or 
Contractor compliance with contract requirements.
    (B) The 10th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered 
or services performed by the Contractor.
    (ii) For all other orders, the later of the following two events:
    (A) The 30th day after the designated billing office receives a 
proper invoice from the Contractor. If the designated billing office 
fails to annotate the invoice with the date of receipt at the time of 
receipt, the invoice payment due date shall be the 30th day after the 
date ofthe Contractor's invoice; provided the Contractor submitted a 
proper invoice and no disagreement exists over quantity, quality, or 
Contractor compliance with contract requirements.
    (B) The 30th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered 
or services performed by the Contractor.
    (iii) On a final invoice, if the payment amount is subject to 
contract settlement actions, acceptance occurs on the effective date of 
the contract settlement.
    (2) The General Services Administration will issue payment on the 
due date in (a)(1)(i) above if the Contractor complies with full cycle 
electronic commerce. Full cycle electronic commerce includes all the 
following elements:
    (i) The Contractor must receive and fulfill electronic data 
interchange (EDI) purchase orders (transaction set 850).
    (ii) The Contractor must generate and submit to the Government valid 
EDI invoices (transaction set 810) or submit invoices through the GSA 
Finance Center Internet-based invoice process. Internet-based invoices 
must be submitted using procedures provided by GSA.

[[Page 377]]

    (iii) The Contractor's financial institution must receive and 
process, on behalf of the Contractor, EFT payments through the Automated 
Clearing House (ACH) system.
    (iv) The EDI transaction sets in (i) through (iii) above must adhere 
to implementation conventions provided by GSA.
    (3) If any of the conditions in(a)(2) above do not occur, the 10 day 
payment due dates in (a)(1) become 30 day payment due dates.
    (4) Certain food products and other payments.
    (i) Due dates on Contractor invoices for meat, meat food products, 
or fish; perishable agricultural commodities; and dairy products, edible 
fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils are--
    (A) For meat or meat food products, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of 
the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921 (7 U.S.C. 182 (3)), and as further 
defined in Pub. L. 98-181, including any edible fresh or frozen poultry 
meat, any perishable poultry meat food product, fresh eggs, an any 
perishable egg product, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 
7th day after product delivery.
    (B) For fresh or frozen fish, as defined in section 204(3) of the 
Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 4003(3)), as close as 
possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery.
    (C) For perishable agricultural commodities, as defined in section 
1(4) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1930 (7 U.S.C. 
499a(4)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day 
after product delivery, unless another date is specified in the 
contract.
    (D) For daily products, as defined in section 111(e) of the Dairy 
Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4502(e)), edible fats or 
oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils, as close as 
possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after the date on which a 
proper invoice has been received. Liquid milk, cheese, certain processed 
cheese products, butter, yogurt, ice cream, mayonnaise, salad dressing, 
and other similar products, fall within this classification. Nothing in 
the Act limits this classification to refrigerated products. When 
questions arise regarding the proper classification of a specific 
product, prevailing industry practices will be followed in specifying a 
contract payment due date. The burden of proof that a classification of 
a specific product is, in fact, prevailing industry practice is upon the 
Contractor making the representation.
    (ii) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for 
payment (e.g., periodic lease payments), the due date will be as 
specified in the contract.
    (5) Contractor's invoice. The Contractor shall prepare and submit 
invoices to the designated billing office specified in the contract. 
Notwithstanding paragraph (g) of the clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract

invoice does not comply with these requirements, it shall be returned 
within 7 days after the date the designated billing office received the 
invoice (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for 
perishable agricultural commodities, edible fats or oils, and food 
products prepared from edible fats or oils), with a statement of the 
reasons why it is not a proper invoice. Untimely notification will be 
taken into account in computing any interest penalty owed the Contractor 
in the manner described in subparagraph (a)(5) of this clause.
    (i) Name and address of the Contractor.
    (ii) Invoice date. (The Contractor is encouraged to date invoices as 
close as possible to the date of the mailing or transmission.)

lading.
    (vi) Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to 
be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice 
of assignment).
    (vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing 
address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.
    (viii) Any other information or documentation required by the 
contract (such as evidence of shipment).
    (ix) While not required, the Contractor is strongly encouraged to 
assign an identification number to each invoice.
    (6) Interest penalty. An interest penalty shall be paid 
automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the 
Contractor, if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions 
listed in subdivisions (a)(6)(i) through (a)(6)(iii) of this clause are 
met, if applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and 
Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made 
on the following business day without incurring a late payment interest 
penalty.
    (i) A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office.
    (ii) A receiving report or other Government documentation 
authorizing payment

[[Page 378]]

was processed, and there was no disagreement over quantity, quality, or 
Contractor compliance with any contract term or condition.
    (iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due 
the Contractor for supplies delivered or services performed, the amount 
was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the 
Government and the Contractor.
    (7) Computing penalty amount. The interest penalty shall be at the 
rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of 
the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on 
the day after the due date, except where the interest penalty is 
prescribed by other governmental authority (e.g., tariffs). This rate is 
referred to as the ``Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,'' and it is 
published in the Federal Register semiannually on or about January 1 and 
July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the invoice principal 
payment amount approved by the Government until the payment date of such 
approved principal amount; and will be compounded in 30-day increments 
inclusive from the first day after the due date through the payment 
date. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be 
added to the approved invoice principal payment amount and will be 
subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day 
period. If the designated billing office failed to notify the Contractor 
of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in subparagraph 
(a)(5) of this clause, the due date on the corrected invoice will be 
adjusted by subtracting from such date the number of days taken beyond 
the prescribed notification of defects period. Any interest penalty owed 
the Contractor will be based on this adjusted due date. Adjustments will 
be made by the designated payment office for errors in calculating 
interest penalties.
    (i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might 
be due the Contractor, Government acceptance shall be deemed to have 
occurred constructively on the 7th day (unless otherwise specified in 
this contract) after the Contractor delivered the supplies or performed 
the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality or 
Contractor compliance with a contract provision. In the event that 
actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the 
determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date 
of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does, not 
however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, 
perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to 
fulfilling their responsibilities.
    (ii) The following periods of time will not be included in the 
determination of an interest penalty:
    (A) The period taken to notify the Contractor of defects in invoices 
submitted to the Government, but this may not exceed 7 days (3 days for 
meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for perishable agricultural 
commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products 
prepared from edible fats or oils).
    (B) The period between the defects notice and resubmission of the 
corrected invoice by the Contractor.
    (C) For incorrect electronic funds transfer (EFT) information, in 
accordance with the EFT clause of this contract.
    (iii) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the 
filing of a claim for such penalties under the clause at 52.233-1, 
Disputes, or for more than 1 year. Interest penalties of less than $1 
need not be paid.
    (iv) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to 
disagreement between the Government and the Contractor over the payment 
amount or other issues involving contract compliance or on amounts 
temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the 
contract. Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be 
payable, will be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233-1, 
Disputes.
    (8) Prompt payment discounts. An interest penalty also shall be paid 
automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the 
Contractor, if a discount for prompt payment is taken improperly. The 
interest penalty will be calculated as described in subparagraph (a)(7) 
of this clause on the amount of discount taken for the period beginning 
with the first day after the end of the discount period through the date 
when the Contractor is paid.
    (9) Additional interest penalty.
    (i) If this contract was awarded on or October 1, 1989, a penalty 
amount, calculated in accordance with subdivision (a)(9)(iii) of this 
clause, shall be paid in addition to the interest penalty amount if the 
Contractor--
    (A) Is owed an interest penalty of $1 or more;
    (B) Is not paid the interest penalty within 10 days after the date 
the invoice amount is paid; and
    (C) Makes a written demand to the designated payment office for 
additional penalty payment, in accordance with subdivision (a)(9)(ii) of 
this clause, postmarked not later than 40 days after the invoice amount 
is paid.
    (ii)(A) Contractors shall support written demands for additional 
penalty payments with the following data. No additional data shall be 
required. Contractors shall--
    (1) Specifically assert that late payment interest is due under a 
specific invoice, and request payment of all overdue late payment 
interest penalty and such additional penalty as may be required;

[[Page 379]]

    (2) Attach a copy of the invoice on which the unpaid late payment 
interest was due; and
    (3) State that payment of the principal has been received, including 
the date of receipt.
    (B) Demands must be postmarked on or before the 40th day after 
payment was made, except that--
    (1) If the postmark is illegible or nonexistent, the demand must 
have been received and annotated with the date of receipt by the 
designated payment office on or before the 40th day after payment was 
made; or
    (2) If the postmark is illegible or nonexistent and the designated 
payment office fails to make the required annotation, the demand's 
validity will be determined by the date the Contractor has placed on the 
demand; provided such date is no later than the 40th day after payment 
was made.
    (iii)(A) The additional penalty shall be equal to 100 percent of any 
original late payment interest penalty, except--
    (1) The additional penalty shall not exceed $5,000;
    (2) The additional penalty shall never be less than $25; and
    (3) No additional penalty is owed if the amount of the underlying 
interest penalty is less than $1.
    (B) If the interest penalty ceases to accrue in accordance with the 
limits stated in subdivision (a)(5)(iii) of this clause, the amount of 
the additional penalty shall be calculated on the amount of interest 
penalty that would have accrued in the absence of these limits, subject 
to the overall limits on the additional penalty specified in subdivision 
(a)(7)(iii)(A) of this clause.
    (C) For determining the maximum and minimum additional penalties, 
the test shall be the interest penalty due on each separate payment made 
for each separate contract. The maximum and minimum additional penalty 
shall not be based upon individual invoices unless the invoices are paid 
separately. Where payments are consolidated for disbursing purposes, the 
maximum and minimum additional penalty determination shall be made 
separately for each contract therein.
    (D) The additional penalty does not apply to payments regulated by 
other Government regulations (e.g., payments under utility contracts 
subject to tariffs and regulation).
    (b) Contract financing payments. (1) Due dates for recurring 
financing payments. If this contract provides for contract financing, 
requests for payment shall be submitted to the designated billing office 
as specified in this contract or as directed by the Contracting Officer. 
Contract financing payments shall be made on the [insert day as 
prescribed by Agency head; if not prescribed, insert 30th day] day after 
receipt of a proper contract financing request by the designated billing 
office. In the event that an audit or other review of a specific 
financing request is required to ensure compliance with the terms and 
conditions of the contract, the designated payment office is not 
compelled to make payment by the due date specified.
    (2) Due dates for other contract financing. For advance payments, 
loans, or other arrangements that do not involve recurring submissions 
of contract financing requests, payment shall be in accordance with the 
corresponding contract terms or as directed by the Contracting Officer.
    (3) Interest penalty not applicable. Contract financing payments 
shall not be assessed an interest penalty for payment delays.
    (c) Fast payment procedure due dates. If this contract contains the 
clause at 52.213-1, Fast Payment Procedure, payments will be made within 
15 days after the date of receipt of the invoice.

    (a) Under the Inspection of Services clause of this contract, 
payments may be adjusted if any services do not conform with contract 
requirements. The Contracting Office or a designated representative will 
inform the Contractor, in writing, of the type and dollar amount of 
proposed deductions by the 10th workday of the month following the 
performance period for which the deductions are to be made.

[[Page 380]]

    (b) The Contractor may, within 10 working days of receipt of the 
notification of the proposed deductions, present to the Contracting 
Officer specific reasons why any or all of the proposed deductions are 
not justified. Reasons must be solidly based and must provide specific 
facts that justify reconsideration and/or adjustment of the amount to be 
deducted. Failure to respond within the 10-day period will be 
interpreted to mean that the Contractor accepts the deductions proposed.
    (c) All or a portion of the final payment may be delayed or withheld 
until the Contracting Officer makes a final decision on the proposed 
deduction. If the Contracting Officer determines that any or all of the 
proposed deductions are warranted, the Contracting Officer shall so 
notify the Contractor, and adjust payments under the contract 
accordingly.

    Before final payment is made, the Contractor shall furnish the 
Contracting Officer with a release of all claims against the Government 
relating to this contract, other than claims in stated amounts that are 
specifically excepted by the Contractor from the release. If the 
Contractor's claim to amounts payable under the contract has been

3727, 41 U.S.C. 15), a release may also be required of the assignee.

    The authorization of performance of work under this contract during 
the initial contract period and any option or extension period(s) is 
contingent upon the appropriation of funds to procure this service. If 
the contract is awarded, extended, or option(s) exercised, the 
Government's obligation beyond the end of the fiscal year (September 
30), in which the award or extension is made or option(s) exercised, is 
contingent upon the availability of funds from which payment for the

Government for payment of any money beyond the end of the each fiscal 
year (September 30) shall arise unless or until funds are made available 
to the Contracting Officer for this procurement and written notice of 
such availability is given to the Contractor.

proper invoice from the Contractor.
    (ii) The 30th day after Government acceptance of the work or

determining the payment due date and calculation of interest, acceptance 
will be deemed to occur on the last day of the 7 day inspection period. 
If the work or service is rejected for failure to conform to the 
technical requirements of the contract, the 7 days will be counted 
beginning with receipt of a new invoice or notification. In either case,

penalties under the clause at 52.233-1, Disputes, or for more than 1 
year. Interest rates penalties of less than $1.00 need not be paid.

payable, will be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233-1, 
Disputes.

    (1) Indicate that it is a protest to the agency.
    (2) Be filed with the Contracting Officer.

presentation, a written presentation, or an oral presentation confirmed 
in writing, of arguments in support of the protest to the deciding 
official.

Official for GSA will not consider appeals from the Contracting 
Officer's decision on an agency protest.
    (f) The deciding Official must conduct a scheduling conference with 
the protester within three (3) days after the protest is filed. The 
scheduling conference will establish deadlines for oral or written 
arguments in support of the agency protest and for agency officials to 
present information in response to the protest issues. The deciding 
official may hear oral arguments in support of the agency protest at the 
same time as the scheduling conference, depending on availability of the 
necessary parties.
    (g) Oral conferences may take place either by telephone or in 
person. Other parties (e.g., representatives of the program office) may 
attend at the discretion of the deciding official.
    (h) The following procedures apply to information submitted in

support or explain the substance of the protest (either orally, in 
writing, or orally confirmed in writing).
    (2) GSA procedures do not provide for any discovery.

                 Authorities and Limitations (APR 1984)

    (a) All work shall be performed under the general direction of the 
Contracting Officer, who alone shall have the power to bind the 
Government and to exercise the rights, responsibilities, authorities and 
functions vested in him by the contract documents, except that he shall

private, to perform any act on behalf of or in the interests of the 
Government, that individual or organization shall be deemed to be the

    As prescribed in 536.570-4, insert the following provision or the 
appropriate Alternate:

            Basis of Award--Construction Contract (APR 1985)

    (a) The low bidder for purposes of award is the responsible bidder 
offering the lowest price for the base bid (consisting of the lump sum 
bid and any associated unit price bids extended by the applicable number 
of units shown on the bid form). See Standard Form 1442, Solicitation, 
Offer, and Award and the provision entitled ``Contract Award--Sealed 
Bidding.''
    (b) A bid may be rejected as nonresponsive if the bid is materially 
unbalanced as to bid prices. A bid is unbalanced when the bid is based 
on prices significantly less than cost for some work and significantly 
overstated for other work.


[[Page 385]]



                           (End of provision)

    Alternate I (APR 1985). if the solicitation includes a base bid and 
options, the Contracting Officer shall delete paragraph (a) of the basic 
provision and insert paragraph (a) substantially as follows:
    (a) The low bidder for purposes of award is the responsible bidder 
offering the lowest aggregate price for (1) the base bid (consisting of 
the lump sum bid and any associated unit price bids extended by the 
applicable number of units shown on the bid form) plus (2) all options 
designated to be evaluated. The evaluation of options will not obligate 
the Government to exercise the options. See Standard Form 1442, 
Solicitation, Offer, and Award and the provision entitled ``Contract 
Award--Sealed Bidding.''
    Alternate II (APR 1985). If the solicitation includes a base bid and 
alternates, the Contracting Officer shall delete paragraph (a) of the 
basic provision and insert paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) substantially as 
follows:
    (a) The low bidder for purposes of award is the responsible bidder 
offering the lowest aggregate price for (1) the base bid (consisting of 
the lump sum bid and any associated unit price bids extended by the 
applicable number of units shown on the bid form) plus (2) those 
alternates in the order of priority listed in the solicitation that 
provide the most features of work within the funds available at bid 
opening. See the provision entitled ``Contract Award--Sealed Bidding.''
    (c) Alternates will be added to the base bid in the order listed in 
the solicitation (see Standard Form 1442, Solicitation, Offer, and 
Award). If the addition of an alternate would make all bids exceed the 
funds available at bid opening, that alternate shall be skipped and the 
next subsequent alternate in a lower amount shall be added, provided 
that the aggregate of base bid and the selected alternates do not exceed 
the funds available at bid opening. For example, when the amount 
available is $100,000 and a bidder's base bid is $85,000, with its 
separate bids on four successive alternatives being $10,000, $8,000, 
$6,000, and $4,000, the aggregate amount of the bid for purposes of 
selecting the alternates would be $99,000 (base bid plus the first and 
four alternates). The second and third alternates are skipped because 
each of them would cause the aggregate of the base bid and alternates to 
exceed the $100,000 amount available when considered with the first 
alternate. All bids shall be evaluated on the basis of the same 
alternates.
    (d) After the low bidder has been determined in accordance with 
paragraph (a), an award may be made to that low bidder on the base bid, 
plus any combination of alternates for which funds are available at the 
time of award, but only if the award amount does not exceed the amount 
offered by any other responsible bidder. If the base bid plus the 
proposed combination of alternates exceed the amount offered by any 
other responsible bidder for thesame combination of alternates, the 
award cannot be made on that combination of alternates.
    Alternate III (APR 1985). If the solicitation includes a base bid, 
alternates, and options, the Contracting Officer shall delete paragraph 
(a) of the basic provision and insert paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) 
substantially as follows:
    (a) The low bidder for purposes of award is the responsible bidder 
offering the lowest aggregate price for (1) the base bid (consisting of 
the lump sum bid and any associated unit price bids extended by the 
applicable number of units shown on the bid form) plus (2) those 
alternates in the order of priority listed in the solicitation that 
provide the most features of work within the funds available at bid 
opening plus (3) all options designated to be evaluated except those 
options associated with alternates which are skipped during the 
selection process outlined in paragraph (c) below. The evaluation of 
options will not obligate the Government to exercise the options. See 
the provision entitled ``Contract Award--Sealed Bidding.''
    (c) Alternates will be added to the base bid in the order listed in 
the solicitation (see Standard Form 1442, Solicitation, Offer, or 
Award). If the addition of an alternate would make all bids exceed the 
funds available at bid opening, that alternate shall be skipped and the 
next subsequent alternate in a lower amount shall be added, provided 
that the aggregate of base bid and the selected alternates do not exceed 
the funds available at bid opening. For example, when the amount 
available is $100,000 and a bidder's base bid is $85,000, with its 
separate bids on four successive alternates being $10,000, $8,000, 
$6,000, and $4,000, the aggregate amount of the bid for purposes of 
selecting the alternates would be $99,000 (base bid plus the first and 
fourth alternates). The second and third alternates are skipped because 
each of them would cause the aggregate of the base bid and alternates to 
exceed the $100,000 amount available when considered with the first 
alternate. All bids shall be evaluated on the basis of the same 
alternates.
    (d) After the low bidder has been determined in accordance with 
paragraph (a), award may be made to that low bidder on the base bid and 
evaluated options plus any combination of alternates for which funds are 
available at the time of award, but only if that low bidder is still low 
on the sum thereof plus any previously unevaluated options designated to 
be evaluated which are associated with proposed alternates that were

[[Page 386]]

skipped during the selection under paragraph (c). If that low bidder is 
not still low, award cannot be made on the proposed combination of 
alternates.

a manner as not to unreasonably interrupt or interfere with the conduct 
of Government business.

the Contracting Officer for determination.
    (c) If the premises are occupied, the Contractor, his subcontractors

follows:
    (a) In case of difference between small and large-scale drawings, 
the large-scale drawings shall govern. Schedules on any contract drawing 
shall take precedence over conflicting information on that or any other 
contract drawing. On any of the drawings where a portion of the work is 
detailed or drawn out and the remainder is shown in outline, the parts 
detailed or drawn out shall apply also to all other like portions of the 
work.
    (b) Where the word ``similar'' occurs on the drawings, it shall have 
a general meaning and not be interpreted as being identical, and all 
details shall be worked out in relation to their location and their 
connection with other parts of the work.
    (c) Standard Details or Specification Drawings are applicable when 
listed, bound with the specifications, noted on the drawings or 
referenced elsewhere in the specifications. Where the notes on the 
drawings indicate modifications, such modifications shall govern.
    (d) In case of difference between Standard Details or Specification 
Drawings and the specifications, the specifications will govern. In case 
of difference between the Standard Details or Specification Drawings and 
their drawings prepared specifically for this contract, the later shall 
govern.

 Containing Recovered Materials or Other Environmental Attributes (SEP 
                                  1999)

    (a) Definitions. ``Energy-efficient office equipment,'' as used in 
this clause, means office equipment that, in representative use, 
provides equivalent or better performance and value to users, but uses 
significantly less

[[Page 391]]

energy than most functionally equivalent models.
    ``Recovered materials,'' as used in this clause, means waste 
material and by-products which have been recovered or diverted from 
solid waste, but such term does not include those materials and by-
products generated from, and commonly reused, within an original 
manufacturing process (42 U.S.C. 6903(19)). For paper, it also includes 
postconsumer materials, and manufacturing and certain other wastes. (42 
U.S.C. 6962(h)).
    ``Remanufactured products,'' as used in this clause, means equipment 
or parts that have been factory remanufactured or rebuilt to meet new 
equipment or part performance specifications and have had no use 
subsequent to their remanufacture.
    (b) The offeror shall identify in its offer and include in any 
commercial catalogs and pricelists and any resultant Government catalogs 
or pricelists submitted to the Contracting Officer, energy-efficient 
office equipment and supplies that contain recovered material, 
remanufactured products, or other environmental attributes. Examples of 
energy-efficient office equipment are microcomputers and associated 
equipment that meet the requirements of the Environmental Protection 
Agency's (EPA's) Energy Star Computers Program. Supplies that contain 
recovered materials and other environmental attributes include, but are 
not limited to, products identified in EPA procurement guidelines (40 
CFR Subchapter I) and products that are either degradable, ozone safe, 
recyclable, contain low volatile organic content compounds, contribute 
to source reduction, or otherwise are designed or manufactured to 
achieve environmental improvement. For example, an offeror can identify 
products that are safe or safer alternatives for more toxic or hazardous 
products and products that can be substituted for ones manufactured with 
toxic or hazardous materials. Such supplies shall satisfy the guidance 
contained in 16 CFR Part 260, Guides for the Use of Environmental 
Marketing Claims.
    (c) An offeror, in identifying an item with an environmental 
attribute, shall possess evidence or rely upon a reasonable basis to 
substantiate the claim (see 16 CFR 260.5). The Government will accept an 
offeror's claim of an item's environmental attribute on the basis of--
    (1) Participation in a Federal agency sponsored program, e.g., EPA's 
Energy Star Computer program;
    (2) Verification by an independent organization that specializes in 
certifying such claims; or
    (3) Possession of competent and reliable evidence. For any test, 
analysis, research, study or other evidence to be ``competent and 
reliable,'' it must have been conducted and evaluated in an objective 
manner by persons qualified to do so, using procedures generally 
accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results.

reconciled all errors and credits on the final quarterly report, then 
show zero sales in the close-out report.

price/discount relationship of the Government to the customer (or 
category of customers) that was the basis of award.
    (2) The Contractor shall offer the price reduction to the Government 
with the same effective date, and for the same time period, as extended

charged to ordering activities.
    (b) The Contractor must remit any monies due as a result of the

32.6. The Government may exercise all rights under the Debt Collection 
Act of 1982, including withholding or setting off payments and interest 
on the debt (see FAR 52.232-17, Interest).

report, or fails to pay the IFF In a timely manner, the Government may 
terminate or cancel this contract. Willful failure or refusal to furnish 
the required reports, falsification of sales reports, or failure to pay 
the IFF timely constitutes sufficient cause for terminating the 
Contractor for cause under the termination provisions of this contract.

Contractor may transmit price reductions, item deletions, and 
corrections without prior approval. However, the Contractor shall notify 
the contracting officer as set forth in the Price Reductions clause at 
552.238-75.
    (e) Amendments to Paper Supply Schedule Price Lists.
    (1) The Contractor must provide supplements to its paper price 
lists, reflecting the most current changes. The Contractor may either:
    (i) Distribute a supplemental paper Federal Supply Schedule Price 
List within 15 workdays after the effective date of each modification.
    (ii) Distribute quarterly cumulative supplements. The period covered 
by a cumulative supplement is at the discretion of the Contractor, but 
may not exceed three calendar months from the effective date of the 
earliest modification. For example, if the first modification occurs in 
February, the quarterly supplement must cover February--April, and every 
3 month period after. The Contractor must distribute each quarterly 
cumulative supplement within 15 workdays from the last day of the 
calendar quarter.
    (2) At a minimum, the Contractor shall distribute each supplement to 
those ordering activities that previously received the basic document.

552.246-17  Warranty of Supplies of a Noncomplex Nature

    As prescribed in 546.710(a), insert the following clause:

 Warranty of Supplies of a Noncomplex Nature (DEC 1990) (Deviation FAR 
                               52.246-17)

    (a) Definitions. ``Acceptance,'' as used in this clause, means the 
act of an authorized representative of the Government by which

[[Page 396]]

the Government assumes for itself, or as an agent of another, ownership 
of existing supplies, or approves specific services as partial or 
complete performance of the contract.
    ``Correction,'' as used in this clause, means the elimination of a 
defect.
    ``Supplies,'' as used in this clause, means the end item furnished 
by the Contractor and related services required under the contract. The 
word does not include ``data.''
    (b) Contractor's obligations.
    (1) Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government of 
supplies furnished under this contract, or any condition of this 
contract concerning the conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor warrants 
that for ________*________
    (i) All supplies furnished under this contract will be free from 
defects in material or workmanship and will conform with the 
requirements of this contract; and
    (ii) The preservation, packaging, packing, and marking, and the 
preparation for, and method of, shipment of such applies will conform 
with the requirements of this contract.
    (2) When return, correction, or replacement is required, the 
Contractor shall be responsible for all costs attendant to the return, 
correction or replacement of the nonconforming supplies. Any removal in 
connection with the above shall be done by the Contractor at its 
expense. However, the Contractor's liability for the transportation 
charges shall not exceed an amount equal to the cost of transportation 
by the usual commercial method of shipment between the place of delivery 
specified in the contract and the Contractor's plant, and return.
    (3) Any supplies or parts thereof, corrected or furnished in 
replacement under this clause, shall also be subject to the terms of 
this clause to the same extent as supplies initially delivered. The 
warranty, with respect to supplies or parts thereof, shall be equal in 
duration to that in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause and shall run from 
the date of delivery of the corrected or replaced supplies.
    (4) All implied warranties of merchantability and ``fitness for a 
particular purpose'' are excluded from any obligation contained in this 
contract.
    (c) Remedies available to the Government.
    (1) The Contracting Officer shall give written notice to the 
Contractor of any breach of warranties in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
clause with ________*________. This notice shall contain information 
concerning the deficiencies found, the location of the nonconforming 
supplies, and the quantity involved.
    (2) Within a reasonable time after the notice, the Contracting 
Officer may either--
    (i) Require, by written notice, the prompt correction or replacement 
of any supplies or parts thereof (including preservation, packaging, 
packing, and marking) that do not conform with the requirements of this 
contract within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this clause; or
    (ii) Retain such supplies and reduce the contract price by an amount 
equitable under the circumstances. When the nature of the defect in the 
nonconforming item is such that the defect affects an entire batch or 
lot of material, then the equitable price adjustment shall apply to the 
entire batch or lot of material from which the nonconforming item was 
taken.
    (3)(i) If the contract provides for inspection of supplies by 
sampling procedures, conformance of supplies or components subject to 
warranty action shall be determined by the applicable sampling 
procedures in the contract. The Contracting Officer--
    (A) May, for sampling purposes, group any supplies delivered under 
this contract;
    (B) Shall require the size of the sample to be that required by 
sampling procedures specified in the contract for the quantity of 
supplies on which warranty action is proposed;
    (C) May project warranty sampling results over supplies in the same 
shipment or other supplies contained in other shipments even though all 
of such supplies are not present at the point of reinspection; provided, 
that the supplies remaining are reasonably representative of the 
quantity on which warranty action is proposed; and
    (D) Need not use the same lot size as on original inspection or 
reconstitute the original inspection lots.
    (ii) Within a reasonable time after notice of any breach of the 
warranties specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Contracting 
Officer may exercise one or more of the following options:
    (A) Require an equitable adjustment in the contract price for any 
group of supplies.
    (B) Screen the supplies grouped for warranty action under this 
clause at the Contractor's expense and return all nonconforming supplies 
to the Contractor for correction or replacement.
    (C) Require the Contractor to screen the supplies at locations 
designated by the Government within the continental United States and to 
correct or replace all nonconforming supplies.
    (D) Return the supplies grouped for warranty action under this 
clause to the Contractor (irrespective of the f.o.b. point or the point 
of acceptance) for screening and correction or replacement. All costs 
incurred by the Government in returning the nonconforming supplies, 
including costs to the freight carrier resulting from the Contractor's 
refusal to accept their return, shall be for the Contractor's account.
    (4)(i) The Contracting Officer may, by contract or otherwise, 
correct or replace the nonconforming supplies with similar supplies from 
another source and charge to the

[[Page 397]]

Contractor the cost occasioned to the Government thereby if the 
Contractor--
    (A) Fails to make redelivery of the corrected or replaced supplies 
within the time established for their return; or
    (B) Fails either to accept return of the nonconforming supplies or 
fails to make progress after their return to correct or replace them so 
as to endanger performance of the delivery schedule, and in either of 
these circumstances does not cure such failure within a period of 10 
days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in 
writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying 
such failure.
    (ii) Instead of correction or replacement by the Government, the 
Contracting Officer may require an equitable adjustment of the contract 
price for all nonconforming supplies, including batch or lot materials 
which either have been consumed or other disposition has been made. In 
addition, if the Contractor fails to furnish timely disposition 
instructions, the Contracting Officer may return the supplies for 
screening and correction or replacement under subparagraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) 
above; store the nonconforming supplies for the Contractor's account; 
sell the nonconforming supplies to the highest bidder on the open market 
and apply the proceeds against the accumulated storage and other costs, 
including the cost of the sale; or otherwise dispose of the 
nonconforming supplies for the Contractor's account in a reasonable 
manner. The Government is entitled to reimbursement from the Contractor, 
or from the proceeds of such disposal, for the reasonable expenses of 
the care and disposition of the nonconforming supplies, as well as for 
excess costs incurred or to be incurred.
    (5) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this 
clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the 
Government by any other clause of this contract.
    (6) Unless otherwise provided, this warranty is applicable both 
within and outside the continental limits of the United States.
    (7) In addition to other marking requirements of this contract, the 
Contractor shall stamp or mark the supplies delivered or otherwise 
furnish notice with the supplies of the existence of the warranty. The 
marking should briefly include (i) a statement that the warranty exists, 
(ii) the substance of the warranty, (iii) its duration, and (iv) whom to 
notify if the supplies are found to be defective.

                             (End of clause)

    * State the specific period of time after delivery or the specified 
event whose occurrence will terminate the warranty period; e.g., the 
number of miles or hours of use, or combination of any applicable event 
or periods of time.
    ** Insert specific period of time; e.g., ``45 days from the last 
delivery under this contract,'' or ``45 days after discovery of the 
defect.'' The number of days specified shall be no less than 30.
    Alternate I (DEC 1990). As prescribed in 546.710(a)(1), substitute 
the following for paragraph (b)(1) of the basic clause and delete 
paragraph (b)(4) of the basic clause.
    (1) Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government of 
supplies furnished under this contract, or any condition of this 
contract concerning the conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor warrants 
that for ________*________ all supplies furnished--
    (i) Are of a quality to pass without objection in the trade under 
the contract description;
    (ii) Are fit for the ordinary purposes for which the supplies are 
used;
    (iii) Are within the variations permitted by the contract, and are 
of an even kind, quality, and quantity within each unit and among all 
units;
    (iv) Are adequately contained, packaged, and marked as the contract 
may require; and
    (v) Conform to the promises or affirmations of fact made on the 
container.
    Alternate II (DEC 1990). As prescribed in 546.710(a)(2), substitute 
the following paragraph for paragraph (b)(1) of the basic clause:
    (1) Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government of 
supplies furnished under this contract, or any condition of this 
contract concerning the conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor warrants 
that for ________*________ all supplies furnished--
    (i) Conform to the specifications except that in the case of solvent 
systems, the viscosity may exceed the specified maximum by 10 Kreb 
Units, unless otherwise specified elsewhere in this contract; and
    (ii) Are suitable for their intended purpose as stated in this 
contact.
    Alternate III (DEC 1990). As prescribed in 546.710(a)(3), substitute 
the following for paragraph (b)(1) of the basic clause, redesignate 
paragraph (c) of the basic clause as paragraph (d), and add the 
following as paragraph (c) in the basic clause:
    (1) Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government of 
supplies furnished under this contract, or any condition of this 
contract concerning the conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor warrants 
that for ________*________, beginning with the first day of the first 
full month following the month of manufacture marked on the container, 
all supplies furnished retain their

[[Page 398]]

original characteristics to the extent that the supplies remain suitable 
for the intended use as stated in this contract (i) under actual 
application conditions or (ii) when tested in accordance with 
requirements stated elsewhere in this contract.
    (c) Government surveillance and testing.
    (1) During this period, surveillance will be maintained on supplies 
warehoused in Government facilities; and the supplies will be tested 
periodically to determine their suitability for intended use. Sampling 
for surveillance testing will be in accordance with Military Standard 
No. 105, and such testing will be made after NORMAL MIXING, STIRRING, OR 
SHAKING, in accordance with directions either furnished with the 
supplies or as shown in the applicable specifications.
    (2) Surveillance testing will be based on storage stability 
requirements set forth in the contract specification, or purchase 
description on the basis of salient characteristics (e.g., viscosity or 
sag flow, curing time, strip adhesion or tensile shear, etc.) 
established by GSA as appropriate to determine suitability for intended 
use. In the case of brand name items not covered by detailed purchase 
descriptions, surveillance testing may be based on salient 
characteristics included in the manufacturer's data sheets. If storage 
stability requirements showing allowable variations are not included in 
applicable specifications or elsewhere in the contract, material will be 
considered suitable for intended use if the salient characteristics vary 
not more than 20 percent from the originally specified values (i.e., 
those applicable to acceptance testing of the supplies) for noncritical 
end-use items, and not more then 10 percent for critical end-use items.

552.246-70  Source Inspection by Quality Approved Manufacturer.

    As prescribed in 546.302-70, insert the following clause:

      Source Inspection by Quality Approved Manufacturer (SEP 1999)

    (a) Inspection system and inspection facilities.
    (1) The inspection system maintained by the Contractor under the 
Inspection of Supplies--Fixed Price clause (FAR 52.246-2) of this 
contract shall be maintained throughout the contract period and shall 
comply with all requirements of editions in effect on the date of the 
solicitation of either Federal Standard 368 or the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 9001 (ANSI/ASQC Q 91) 
(Quality Systems--Model for Quality Assurance in Design/Development, 
Production, Installation and Servicing), or ISO Standard 9002 (ANSI/ASQC 
Q 92) (Quality Systems--Model for Quality Assurance in Production and 
Installation). The ISO 9000 family of standards is a set of worldwide 
standards used to document, implement and demonstrate quality assurance 
systems. When using the ISO option the Contractor's quality system must 
be registered by a third party registrar accredited by either the 
Registrar Accreditation Board (RAB) or an organization recognized as 
equivalent. A written description of the inspection system shall be made 
available to the Government before contract award. The Contractor shall 
immediately notify the Contracting Officer and the designated GSA 
quality assurance office of any changes made in the inspection system 
during the contract period. As used herein, the term ``inspection 
system'' means the Contractor's own facility or any other facility 
acceptable to the Government that will be used to perform inspections or 
tests of materials and components before incorporation into end articles 
and for inspection of such end articles before shipment. When the 
manufacturing plant is located outside of the United States, the 
Contractor shall arrange delivery of the items from a plant or warehouse 
located in the United States (including Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands) equipped to perform all inspections and tests required by the 
contract or specifications to evidence conformance therewith, or shall 
arrange with a testing laboratory or other facility in the United 
States, acceptable to the Government, to perform the required 
inspections and tests.
    (2) In addition to the requirements in Federal Standard 368, ISO 
9001 or ISO 9002 records shall include the date when inspection and 
testing were performed. These records shall be available for (i) 3 years 
after final payment; or (ii) 4 years from the end of the Contractor's 
fiscal year in which the record was created, whichever period expires 
first.
    (3) Offerors are required to specify, in the space provided 
elsewhere in this solicitation, the name and address of each 
manufacturing plant or other facility where supplies will be available 
for inspection, indicating the item number(s) to which each applies.
    (4) Within 10 calendar days after receipt of the written notice of 
award, the Contractor shall provide the Administrative Contracting 
Officer with the name of the individual and an alternate that will be 
responsible for inspecting each shipment under this contract.
    (b) Inspection and receiving reports.
    (1) For each shipment released, one of the officials named by the 
Contractor under paragraph (a)(4) above shall sign a Quality Approved 
Manufacturer Certificate certifying that supplies have been inspected 
and found to comply with contract requirements. The certification shall 
read as follows:
    ``I certify that all items in this shipment have been listed herein, 
and have been inspected and found to comply with all requirements of the 
contract.''

[[Page 399]]

                    Signature of Certifying Official

    (2) For shipments made to military facilities, the Contractor shall 
prepare and distribute the DD Form 250, Material Inspection and 
Receiving Report, or computer formatted equivalent of the form not later 
than the close of business the workday following shipment. The 
certification above shall be placed in block 16 on this form. The 
Contractor will be provided a supply of the DD Form 250 with complete 
instructions for preparation and distribution.
    (3) For shipments made to civilian facilities only, the Contractor 
shall prepare and distribute not later than the close of business the 
workday following shipment a certification of inspection and conformance 
for the identified items, in accordance with instructions furnished at 
the time of award. The Contractor may furnish the requisite information 
on the DD Form 250 or computer formatted equivalent, company letterhead, 
or invoice document.
    (c) Inspection by Government personnel.
    (1) Although the Government will normally rely upon the Contractor's 
certification as to the quality of supplies shipped, it reserves the 
right under the Inspection of Supplies--Fixed Price clause to inspect 
and test all supplies called for by this contract, before acceptance, at 
all times and places, including the point of manufacture. When the 
Government notifies the Contractor of its intent to inspect supplies 
before shipment, the Contractor shall notify or arrange for 
subcontractors to notify the designated GSA quality assurance office 7 
workdays before the date when supplies will be ready for inspection. 
Shipment shall not be made until inspection by the Government is 
completed and shipment is authorized by the Government.
    (2) Government inspection responsibility will be assigned the GSA 
quality assurance office which has jurisdiction over the State in which 
the Contractor's or subcontractor's plant or other designated point for 
inspection is located.
    (3) During the contract period, a Government representative may 
periodically select samples of supplies produced under this contract for 
verification inspection and testing. Samples sent to a Government 
testing facility will be disposed of as follows: Samples from an 
accepted lot, not damaged in the testing process, will be returned 
promptly to the Contractor after completion of tests. Samples damages in 
the testing process will be disposed of as requested by the Contractor. 
Samples from a rejected lot will be returned to the Contractor or 
disposed of in a time and manner agreeable to both the Contractor and 
the Government.
    (d) Quality deficiencies.
    (1) Notwithstanding any other clause of this contract concerning the 
conclusiveness of acceptance by the Government, any supplies or 
production lots shipped under this contract found to be defective in 
material or workmanship, or otherwise not in conformity with the 
requirements of this contract within a period of ________*________ 
months after acceptance shall, at the Government's option, be replaced, 
repaired or otherwise corrected by the Contractor at no cost to the 
Government within 30 calendar days (or such longer period as the 
Government may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice to replace 
or correct. The Contractor shall remove, at its expense, supplies 
rejected or required to be replaced, repaired or corrected. When the 
nature of the defect affects an entire batch or lot of supplies, and the 
Contracting Officer determines that correction can best be accomplished 
by retaining the nonconforming supplies and reducing the contract price 
by an amount equitable under the circumstances, then the equitable price 
adjustment shall apply to the entire batch or lot of supplies from which 
the nonconforming item was taken.
    (2) If supplies in process, shipped, or awaiting shipment to fill 
Government orders are found not to comply with contract requirements, or 
if deficiencies in either plant quality or process controls are found, 
the Contractor may be issued a Quality Deficiency Notice (QDN). Upon 
receipt of a QDN, the Contractor shall take immediate corrective action 
and shall suspend shipment of the supplies covered by the QDN until such 
time as corrective action has been completed. The Contractor shall 
notify the GSA quality assurance office, within 5 workdays, of 
corrective action taken or to be taken to permit on site verification by 
a Government representative. Shipments of nonconforming supplies will be 
returned at the Contractor's expense and may constitute cause for 
termination. Delays due to the insurance of a QDN do not constitute 
excusable delay under the Default clause. Failure to complete corrective 
action in a timely manner may result in termination of this contract.
    (3) This contract may be terminated for default if subsequent 
Government inspection discloses that plant quality or process controls 
are not being maintained, supplies which do not meet the requirements of 
the specification are being shipped, or there is failure to comply with 
any other requirement of this clause.
    (e) Additional cost for inspection and testing. The Contractor will 
be charged for any additional cost of inspection/testing or 
reinspecting/retesting supplies for the reasons stated in paragraph (e) 
of FAR 52.246-2, Inspection of Supplies--Fixed Price. When inspection or 
testing is performed by or under the direction of GSA, charges will be 
at the rate of $________*________ per man-hour or fraction thereof if 
the inspection is at a GSA distribution center; $________*________ per

[[Page 400]]

man-hour or fraction thereof, plus travel costs incurred, if the 
inspection is at any other location; and $________*________ per man-hour 
or fraction thereof for laboratory testing, except that when a testing 
facility other than a GSA laboratory performs all or part of the 
required tests, the Contractor shall be assessed the actual cost 
incurred by the Government as a result of testing at such facility. When 
inspection is performed by or under the direction of any agency other 
than GSA, the charges indicated above may be used, or the agency may 
assess the actual cost of performing the inspection and testing.
    (f) Responsibility for rejected supplies. When the Contractor fails 
to remove or provide instructions for the removal of rejected supplies 
under paragraph (d) above, pursuant to the Contracting Officer's 
instructions, the Contractor shall be liable for all costs incurred by 
the Government in taking such measures as are expedient to avoid 
unnecessary loss to the Contractor. In addition to the remedies provided 
in FAR 52.246-2, supplies may be--
    (1) Stored for the Contractor's account;
    (2) Reshipped to the Contractor at its expense (any additional 
expense incurred by the Government or the freight carrier caused by the 
refusal of the Contractor to accept their return also shall be for the 
Contractor's account); or
    (3) Sold to the highest bidder on the open market and the proceeds 
applied against the accumulated storage and other costs, including the 
cost of the sale.
    (g) Subcontracting requirements. The Contractor shall insert in any 
subcontracts the inspection or testing provisions set forth in 
paragraphs (a) through (d) of this clause and the Inspection of 
Supplies--Fixed Price clause of this contract. The Contractor shall be 
responsible for compliance by any subcontractor with the provisions set 
forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this clause and the Inspection of 
Supplies--Fixed Price clause.

                             (End of clause)

    * Normally insert 12 months as the period during which defective or 
otherwise nonconforming supplies must be replaced. However, when the 
supplies being bought have a shelf life of less than 1 year, you should 
use the shelf-life period, or in the instance where you reasonably 
expect a longer period to be available, you should use the longer 
period.
    ** The rates to be inserted are established by the Commissioner of 
the Federal Supply Service or a designee.

or contract carrier. If carrier rates are not publicly filed with a 
regulatory body (e.g., interstate shipments moving by rail piggyback 
service), the Contractor shall provide a copy of the contract, letter 
agreement, or other written communication from the carrier(s) quoting 
the rates/charges that would have applied for shipments to the standard 
contract destination.
    (2) If (i) shipments to the new destination are made by the 
Contractor's owned or leased trucks or (ii) shipments to the original 
destination were or would have been made by the Contractor's owned or 
leased trucks, the Government shall determine the adjustment by 
substituting a rate equal to 70 percent of the lowest applicable rate 
published in common carrier tariffs as of the date of shipment for the 
Contractor's actual rate or contemplated transportation costs.
    (d) If the copies of paid freight bills for a diverted shipment do 
not show, or make readily available, each of the following items,the 
Contractor shall supply a written statement showing the item(s):
    (1) Full name of each carrier in the routing.
    (2) Number of containers.
    (3) Gross shipping weight.

service portion of the contract.

the payment of such charges shall be the only responsibility of the 
Government to compensate the Contractor for such termination; except 
that, there shall be no termination liability for equipment installed 
after termination of this contract.

  Instructions to Offerors--Acquisition of Leasehold Interests in Real 
                           Property (MAR 1998)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this provision--
    ``Discussions'' are negotiations that occur after establishment of 
the competitive range that may, at the contracting Officer's discretion, 
result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal.
    ``In Writing'' or ``Written'' means any worded or numbered 
expression which can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and 
includes electronically transmitted and stored information.
    ``Proposal modification'' is a change made to a proposal before the 
solicitation's closing date and time, or made in response to an 
amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award.
    ``Proposal revision'' is a change to a proposal made after the 
solicitation closing date, at the request of as allowed by a Contracting 
Officer as the result or of negotiations.
    ``Time,'' if stated as a number of days, is calculated using 
calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, 
Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a 
Saturday, Sunday, or legal

[[Page 405]]

holiday, then the period shall include the next working day.
    (b) Amendments to solicitations. If this solicitation is amended, 
all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors 
shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the 
date and time specified in the amendment(s).
    (c) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.
    (1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) 
are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to 
proposals shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or 
packages. Offers must be:
    (i) Submitted on the forms prescribed and furnished by the 
Government as a part of this solicitation or on copies of those forms, 
and
    (ii) Signed. The person signing an offer must initial each erasure 
or change appearing on any offer form. If the offeror is a partnership, 
the names of the partners composing the firm must be included with the 
offer.
    (2) Late proposals and revisions.
    (i) The Government will not consider any proposal received at the 
office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for 
receipt of offers unless it is received before the Government makes 
award and it meets at least one of the following conditions:
    (A) It was sent by registered or certified mail not later than the 
5th calendar day before the date specified for receipt of offers (e.g., 
an offer submitted in response to solicitation requiring receipt of 
offers by the 20th of the month must have been mailed by the 15th).
    (B) It was sent by mail (or telegram or facsimile, if authorized) or 
hand-carried (including delivery by a commercial carrier) if it is 
determined by the Government that the late receipt was due primarily to 
Government mishandling after receipt at the Government installation.
    (C) It was sent by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day 
Service-Post Office to Addressee, not later than 5:00 p.m. at the place 
of mailing two working days prior to the date specified for receipt of 
proposals. The term ``working days'' excludes weekends and U.S. Federal 
holidays.
    (D) It was transmitted through an electronic commerce method 
authorized by the solicitation and was received at the initial point of 
entry of the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one 
working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals.
    (E) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received 
at the activity designated for receipt of offers and was under the 
Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers, and 
the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would 
not unduly delay the procurement.
    (F) It is the only proposal received.
    (ii) Any modification or revision of a proposal or response to 
request for information, including any final proposal revision, is 
subject to the same conditions as in subparagraphs (c)(2)(i)(A) through 
(c)(2)(i)(E) of this provision.
    (iii) The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing 
of a late proposal or modification or revision sent either by registered 
or certified mail is the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service postmark both 
on the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. or 
Canadian Postal Service. Both postmarks must show a legible date or the 
proposal, response to a request for information, or modification or 
revision shall be processed as if mailed late. ``Postmark'' means a 
printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of a postage 
meter machine impression) that is readily identifiable without further 
action as having been supplied and affixed by employees of the U.S. or 
Canadian Postal Service on the date of mailing. Therefore, offerors or 
respondents should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand 
cancellation bull's eye postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or 
wrapper.
    (iv) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the 
Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that 
installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of 
receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements 
of Government personnel.
    (v) The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of 
a late offer, modification or revision, or withdrawal sent by Express 
Mail Next Day Service-Post Office to Addressee is the date entered by 
the post office receiving clerk on the ``Express Mail Next Day Service-
Post Office to Addressee'' label and the postmark on both the envelope 
or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. Postal Service, 
``Postmark'' has the same meaning as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of 
this provision, excluding postmarks of the Canadian Postal Service. 
Therefore, offerors or respondents should request the postal clerk to 
place a legible hand cancellation bull's eye postmark on both the 
receipt and the envelope or wrapper.
    (vi) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this provision, a late 
modification or revision of an otherwise successful proposal that makes 
its terms more favorable to the Government will be considered at any 
time it is received and may be accepted.
    (vii) An offeror may withdraw its proposal by written notice or 
telegram (including mailgram) received at any time before award. If the 
solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, an offeror may withdraw

[[Page 406]]

its proposal via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to 
the conditions specified in the provision entitled ``Facsimile 
Proposals.'' Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an 
authorized representative, if the representative's identity is made 
known and the representative signs a receipt for the proposal before 
award.
    (viii) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal 
Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office 
designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the 
solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of 
the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, 
the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be 
extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the 
first work day on which normal Government processes resume. If no time 
is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., 
local time, for the designated Government office.
    (3) Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning this 
solicitation will be furnished promptly to all other prospective 
offerors, if that information is necessary in submitting offers or if 
the lack of it would be prejudicial to any other prospective offeror.
    (4) Offerors may submit modifications to their proposals at any time 
before the solicitation closing date and time, and may submit 
modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at 
any time before award.
    (5) Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or 
allowed by the Contracting Officer.
    (6) The Government will construe an offer to be in full and complete 
with this solicitation unless the offer describes any deviation in the 
offer.
    (7) Offerors may submit proposals that depart from stated 
requirements. Such a proposal shall clearly identify why the acceptance 
of the proposal would be advantageous to the Government. The proposal 
must clearly identify and explicitly define any deviations from the 
terms and conditions of the solicitation, as well as the comparative 
advantage to the Government. The Government reserves the right to amend 
the solicitation to allow all offerors an opportunity to submit revised 
proposals based on the revised requirements.
    (d) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. An offeror that 
includes in its proposal data that it does not want disclosed to the 
public for any purpose, or use by the Government except for evaluation 
purposes, must meet both of the following conditions:
    (1) Mark the title page with the following legend:
    This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the 
Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed--in whole or 
in part--for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, 
however, a lease is awarded to this offeror as a result of--or in 
connection with--the submission of this data, the Government shall have 
the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided 
in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the 
Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is 
obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to 
this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other 
identification of sheets].
    (2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following 
legend:
    Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the 
restriction on the title page of this proposal.
    (e) Lease award.
    (1) The Government intends to award a lease resulting from this 
solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the 
best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and 
subfactors in the solicitation.
    (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is 
in the Government's interest.
    (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities 
in proposals received.
    (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a lease 
after conducting discussions with offerors whose proposals have been 
determined to be within the competitive range. If the Contracting 
Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be 
in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient 
competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the 
number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that 
will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated 
proposals. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the 
offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.
    (5) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not 
constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
    (6) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if 
the price proposed are materially unbalanced between line terms or 
subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable 
total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is 
significantly overstated or understand as indicated by the application 
of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the 
Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an 
unacceptable risk to the Government.
    (7) The unconditional written acceptance of an offer establishes a 
valid contract.

[[Page 407]]

    (8) The Government may disclose the following information in 
postaward debriefings to other offerors:
    (i) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the 
successful offeror;
    (ii) The overall making of all offerors, when any making was 
developed by the agency during source selection; and
    (iii) A summary of the rationale for award.

                           (End of provision)

    Alternate I (MAR 1998). As prescribed in 570.602, substitute the 
following paragraph for paragraph (c)(2)(i) of the basic provision:
    (i) Any offer received at the office designated in the solicitation 
after the exact time specified for receipt of final proposal revisions 
will not be considered unless it is received before award is made and it 
meets one of the following conditions--
    Alternate II (MAR 1998). As prescribed in 570.602, substitute the 
following paragraph for paragraph (e)(4) of the basic provision:
    (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a lease 
without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in 
FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain 
the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. 
The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the 
Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the 
Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would 
otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an 
efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may 
limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest 
number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly 
rated proposals.

all administrative costs. If the Government elects to perform any such 
requirement, the Government and each of its contractors shall be 
entitled to access to any and all areas of the building, access to which 
is necessary to perform any such requirement, and the Lessor shall 
afford and facilitate such access. Alternatively, the Government may 
deduct from any payment under this lease, then or thereafter due, an 
amount which reflects the reduced value of the contract requirement not 
performed. No deduction from rent pursuant to this clause shall 
constitute a default by the Government

nor charge the Lessor with damages under this clause, if (1) the delay 
in substantially completing the work arises from excusable delays, and 
(2) the Lessor within 10 days from the beginning of any such delay 
(unless extended in writing

by the Contracting Officer) provides notice to the Contracting Officer 
of the causes of delay. The Contracting Officer shall ascertain the 
facts and the extent of delay. If the facts warrant, the Contracting 
Officer shall extend the delivery date, to the extent of such delay at

remedy of the Lessor.

foot (RSF). That is:

    (a) Lessor warrants that it holds such title to or other interest in 
the premises and other property as is necessary to the Government's 
access to the premises and full use and enjoyment thereof in accordance 
with the provisions of this lease. Government agrees, in consideration 
of the warranties and conditions set forth in this clause, that this 
lease is subject and subordinate to any and all recorded mortgages, 
deeds of trust and other liens now or hereafter existing or imposed upon 
the premises, and to any renewal, modification or extension thereof. It 
is the intention of the parties that this provision shall be self-
operative and that no further instrument shall be required to effect the 
present or subsequent subordination of this lease. Government agrees, 
however, within twenty (20) business days next following the Contracting 
Officer's receipt of a written demand, to execute such instruments as 
Lessor may reasonably request to evidence further the subordination of 
this lease to any existing or future mortgage, deed of trust or other 
security interest pertaining to the premises, and to any water, sewer or 
access easement necessary or desirable to serve the premises or 
adjoining property owned in whole or in part by Lessor if such easement 
does not interfere with the full enjoyment of any right granted the 
Government under this lease.

deeds of trust or other lien or security instrument shall operate to 
affect adversely any right of the Government under this lease so long as 
the Government is not in default under this lease. Lessor will include 
in any future mortgage, deed of trust or other security instrument to 
which this lease becomes subordinate, or in a separate nondisturbance 
agreement, a provision to the foregoing effect. Lessor warrants that the 
holders of all notes or other obligations secured by existing mortgages, 
deeds of trust or other security instruments have consented to the 
provisions of this clause, and agrees to provide true copies of all such 
consents to the Contracting Officer promptly upon demand.
    (c) In the event of any sale of the premises or any portion thereof 
by foreclosure of the lien of any such mortgage, deed of trust or other 
security instrument, or the giving of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the 
Government will be deemed to have attorned to any purchaser, purchasers, 
transferee or transferees of the premises or any portion thereof and its 
or their successors and assigns, and any such purchasers and transferees 
will be deemed to have assumed all obligations of the Lessor under this 
lease, so as to establish direct privity of estate and contract between 
Government and such purchasers or transferees, with the same force, 
effect and relative priority in time and right as if the lease had 
initially been entered into between such purchasers or transferees and 
the Government; provided, further, that the Contracting Officer and such 
purchasers or transferees shall, with reasonable promptness following 
any such sale or deed delivery in lieu of foreclosure, execute all such 
revisions to this lease, or other writings, as shall be necessary to 
document the foregoing relationship.
    (d) None of the foregoing provisions may be deemed or construed to 
imply a waiver of the Government's rights as a sovereign.

<R05>
570.102  Definitions.

    Acquisition means the acquiring by lease of an interest in improved 
real property for use by the Federal Government, whether the space 
already exists or must be constructed.
    Contract means lease.
    Contractor means lessor.
    Landlord or lessor means any individual, firm, partnership, trust, 
association, State or local government, or other legal entity that 
leases real property to the Government.
    Lease or leasehold interest in real property means a conveyance to 
the Government of the right of exclusive possession of real property for 
a definite period of time by a landlord. It may include operational 
services provided by the landlord.
    Lessee or tenant means the United States of America.
    Operational services means services that support use of a leased 
property, such as heating, ventilation, air condition, utilities, and 
custodial services.
    Rent and related services means that consideration paid for the use 
of leased property plus the costs of operational services whether 
furnished by the lessor, the Government, or both.
    Simplified lease acquisition procedures mean the procedures for 
awarding leases at or below the simplified lease acquisition threshold.
    Simplified lease acquisition threshold Means $100,000 average annual 
rent for the term of the lease, including option periods and excluding 
the cost of operational services.
    Small business means a concern including affiliates, which is 
organized for profit, is independently-owned and operated, is not 
dominant in the field of leasing commercial real estate, and has annual 
average gross receipts of $15 million or less for the preceding three 
fiscal years.
    Solicitation for Offers (SFO) means invitation for bids in sealed 
bidding or request for proposals in negotiations.
    Space in buildings means the premises leased, or to be leased, 
including improvements. Its quantity is normally expressed in square 
feet. It does not include space acquired by the power of eminent domain, 
donation, or condemnation, nor acquisitions of bare or unimproved land.
    Substantially as follows or substantially the same as, when used in 
prescribing a provision or clause, means that you may prepare and use a 
variation of that provision or clause to accommodate requirements 
peculiar to an individual acquisition. The variation must include the 
salient features of the FAR or GSAR provision or clause. It must also be 
consistent with the intent, principle, and substance of the FAR or GSAR 
provision or clause and related coverage on the subject matter.


<R05>
570.103  Authority to lease.

    (a) The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 
U.S.C. 490(h)(1)), as amended, and Section 1 of the Reorganization Plan 
No. 18 of 1950 (40 U.S.C. 490 Note) authorize the Administrator of 
General Services to acquire leasehold interests in real property for use 
by Federal agencies. The authority is limited to leases for buildings 
and improvement that bind the Government for periods not exceeding 20 
years.
    (b) You have exclusive authority to enter into and administer leases 
on the Government's behalf to the extent provided in your certificate of 
appointment as a contracting officer.


<R05>
570.104  Competition.

    Unless you use the simplified procedures in subpart 570.2, the 
competition requirements of FAR part 6 apply to acquisition of leasehold 
interests in real property.


<R05>
570.105  Methods of contracting.


<R05>
570.105-1  Contracting by negotiation.

    Contracting by negotiation is usually appropriate for acquiring 
space in a building through a lease contract. You will usually need to 
conduct discussions with offerors about their proposals and consider 
factors other than price in making the award.

[[Page 417]]


<R05>
570.105-2  Two-phase design-build selection procedures.

    Unless you use another acquisition procedure authorized by law, you 
must use the two-phase design-build selection procedures in section 303M 
of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as 
amended, for lease construction projects. This includes lease 
construction projects with options to purchase the real property leased. 
Use the procedures in section 303M when you meet the conditions in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:
    (a) You anticipate the lease will involve the design and 
construction of a public building, facility, or work for lease to the 
Government.
    (b) You determine the procedures are appropriate for entering into a 
lease construction contract based on the following:
    (1) You expect to receive three or more offers.
    (2) Offerors will need to perform design work before developing a 
price.
    (3) Offerors will incur a substantial amount of expense in preparing 
offers.
    (4) You consider criteria such as the following:
    (i) The extent to which the project requirements have been 
adequately defined.
    (ii) The time constraints for delivery of the project.
    (iii) The capability and experience of potential contractors.
    (iv) The suitability of the project for use of the two-phase 
selection procedures.
    (v) The capability of the agency to manage the two-phase selection 
process.
    (vi) Other criteria established by the HCA.


<R05>
570.105-3  Sealed bidding.

    For sealed bidding, use the procedures in FAR part 14. In most cases 
you should not use sealed bidding to acquire space in buildings unless 
you meet all the following conditions:
    (a) You have a preselected site.
    (b) A building will be constructed on the site using Government 
furnished plans and specifications.
    (c) The Government will lease the building.


<R05>
570.106  Publicizing/Advertising.

    (a) Subparts 505.101, 505.202, and 505.203 define requirements for 
publicizing lease actions.
    (b) Instead of issuing separate advertisements for multiple, known 
leasing actions, you may include the actions in one consolidated 
advertisement.


<R05>
570.107  Oral presentations.

    You may use oral presentations for acquisitions of leasehold 
interests in real property. Follow the procedures in FAR 15.102.


<R05>
570.108  Responsibility determination.

    (a) Determine that the prospective awardee is responsible with 
respect to the lease under consideration. The standards in FAR 9.104 
apply. As part of the determination that a prospective contractor is 
otherwise qualified and eligible for award, review the List of Parties 
Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.
    (b) Your signature on the contract is deemed an affirmative 
determination.
    (c) If you find an offeror nonresponsible, sign and place in the 
contract file a determination of nonresponsibility. State the basis for 
the determination.
    (d) If you find a small business concern nonresponsible, the 
procedures at FAR 19.6 apply. Place all documents and reports supporting 
a determination of responsibility or nonresponsibility in the lease 
file.


<R05>
570.109  Certifications.

    Before awarding a lease, review applicable certifications for 
compliance with statute and regulations.


<R05>
570.110  Cost or pricing data and information other than cost or pricing data.

    (a) The policies and procedures of FAR 15.403 apply to lease 
contract actions.
    (b) FAR 15.403-1 defines exceptions to and waivers for submitting 
cost or pricing data. Most leasing actions will have adequate price 
competition. For price analysis, you may use a market survey or an 
appraisal conducted using accepted real property appraisal procedures to 
establish a market price for comparison.

[[Page 418]]

    (c) In exceptional cases, the requirement for submission of 
certified cost or pricing data may be waived under FAR 15.403-1(c)(4).
    (d) If cost or pricing data are required, follow the procedures in 
FAR 15.403-4 and 15.406-2.


<R05>
570.111  Inspection and acceptance.

    Before you accept space, obtain an inspection to ensure that the 
space complies with the Government's requirements and specifications. 
Document the inspection and acceptance in the contract file.


<R05>
570.112  Awards to Federal employees.

    If you receive an offer from an officer or employee of the 
Government, follow the procedures in FAR 3.6.


<R05>
570.113  Disclosure of mistakes after award.

    If you discover a mistake in a lessor's offer after award, follow 
the procedures in FAR 14.407-4 and subpart 514.407-4.


<R05>
570.114  Protests.

    FAR 33.1 and 533.1 apply to protests of lease acquisitions.


<R04>
         Subpart 570.2--Simplified Lease Acquisition Procedures


<R05>
570.201  Purpose.

    This subpart prescribes simplified procedures for small leases. 
These procedures reduce administrative costs, while improving efficiency 
and economy, when acquiring small leasehold interests in real property.


<R05>
570.202  Policy.

    Use simplified lease acquisition procedures to the maximum extent 
practicable for actions at or below the simplified lease acquisition 
threshold.


<R05>
570.203  Procedures.


<R05>
570.203-1  Market survey.

    Conduct a market survey to identify potential sources. Use 
information available in GSA or from other sources to identify locations 
that will meet the Government's requirements.


<R05>
570.203-2  Competition.

    (a) Solicit at least three sources to promote competition to the 
maximum extent practicable. If you have repeated requirements for space 
in the same market, and if practicable, invite two sources not included 
in the most recent solicitation to submit offers.
    (b) If you solicit only one source, document the file to explain the 
lack of competition.


<R05>
570.203-3  Soliciting offers.

    (a) Solicit offers by providing each prospective offeror a proposed 
short form lease or SFO. The short form lease or SFO must provide all 
the following information:
    (1) A description of the Government's requirements.
    (2) All award factors, including price or cost, and any significant 
subfactors you will consider in awarding the lease.
    (3) A statement of the relative importance of the evaluation factors 
and subfactors.
    (4) A statement of whether all evaluation factors other than cost or 
price, when combined, are either:
    (i) Significantly more important than cost or price.
    (ii) Approximately equal in importance to cost or price.
    (iii) Significantly less important than cost or price.
    (5) Either in full text or by reference, applicable FAR provisions 
and contract clauses required by 570.6.
    (b) As necessary, review with prospective offerors the Government's 
requirements, pricing matters, evaluation procedures and submissions of 
offers.


<R05>
570.203-4  Negotiations, evaluation, and award.

    (a) If you need to conduct negotiations, use the procedures in 
570.307.
    (b) Evaluate offers in accordance with the solicitation. Evaluate 
prices and document the lease file to demonstrate whether the proposed 
contract prices are fair and reasonable.
    (c) If the total price, including options, exceeds $500,000, 
consider whether you need cost and pricing data to determine that the 
price is fair and reasonable. In most cases the exceptions at FAR 
15.403-1 will apply.

[[Page 419]]

    (d) If the total contract value of the lease, including options, 
will exceed $500,000, the proposed awardee must provide an acceptable 
small business subcontracting plan. This requirement does not apply if 
the proposed awardee is a small business concern.
    (e) Make award to the responsible offeror whose proposal is most 
advantageous to the Government considering price and other factors 
included in the solicitation.

    (a) The description of requirements depends on the nature of the 
space the agency needs and the market available to satisfy that need.
    (b) The description of requirements must include all the following:
    (1) A statement of the purpose of the lease.
    (2) Functional, performance, or physical requirements.
    (3) Any special requirements.
    (4) The delivery schedule.
    (c) The description must promote full and open competition. Include

<R05>
570.303-1  Preparing the SFO.

    The SFO forms the basis for the lease negotiation process and

570.309  Debriefings.

    The procedures of FAR 15.505 and 15.506 apply to leasing actions.


<R04>
   Subpart 570.4--Special Aspects of Contracting for Continued Space 
                              Requirements


<R05>
570.401  Renewal options.

    (a) Exercise of options. Before exercising an option to renew, 
follow the procedures in 517.202 and 517.207. The contract must first 
provide the right to renew the lease.
    (b) Market survey. Before exercising an option to renew a lease, 
review current market information to ensure the rental rate in the 
option is fair and reasonable.


<R05>
570.402  Succeeding leases.


<R05>
570.402-1  General.

    (a) If a succeeding lease for the continued occupancy of space in a 
building does not exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, you 
may use the simplified procedures in 570.2. Explain the absence of 
competition in the contract file.
    (b) If a succeeding lease will exceed the simplified lease 
acquisition threshold, you may enter into the lease under either of the 
following conditions:
    (1) You do not identify any potential acceptable locations.
    (2) You identify potential acceptable locations, but a cost-benefit 
analysis indicates that award to an offeror other than the present 
lessor will result in substantial relocation costs or duplication of 
costs to the Government, and the Government cannot expect to recover 
such costs through competition.


<R05>
570.402-2  Publicizing/Advertising.

    Publish a notice if required by 505.101(c). The notice should:
    (a) Indicate the Government's lease is expiring.
    (b) Describe the requirement in terms of type and quantity of space.
    (c) Indicate the Government is interested in considering alternative 
space if economically advantageous.
    (d) Advise prospective offerors that the Government will consider 
the cost of moving, alterations, etc., when deciding whether it should 
relocate.
    (e) Provide a contact person for those interested in providing space 
to the Government.


<R05>
570.402-3  Market survey.

    Conduct a market survey following 570.301.


<R05>
570.402-4  No potential acceptable locations.

    If you do not identify any potential acceptable locations through 
the advertisement or the market survey, you may prepare a justification 
to negotiate directly with the present lessor. Fully document the 
efforts to locate alternative sources. Prepare the justification and 
obtain approval following FAR 6.3 and 506.3.


<R05>
570.402-5  Potential acceptable locations.

    If you identify potential acceptable locations through the 
advertisement or market survey, conduct a cost-benefit analysis 
following the procedures in 570.402-6. Based on the results of the cost-
benefit analysis, take appropriate action as follows:
    (a) If the cost-benefit analysis indicates that the Government will 
recover relocation costs and duplication of costs through competition, 
develop an SFO and negotiate with all interested parties following 
570.3.
    (b) If the cost-benefit analysis indicates that the Government 
cannot expect to recover relocation costs and duplication of costs 
through competition, prepare a justification for approval in accordance 
with FAR 6.3 and 506.3. Explain both:
    (1) How you performed the cost-benefit analysis.
    (2) That the cost-benefit analysis indicates that award to any other 
offeror will likely result in substantial costs to the Government that 
the Government cannot expect to recover through competition.

[[Page 422]]


<R05>
570.402-6  Cost-benefit analysis.

    (a) The cost-benefit analysis must consider all the following:
    (1) The prices of other potentially available properties.
    (2) Relocation costs, including estimated costs for moving, 
telecommunications, and alterations, amortized over the firm term of the 
lease.
    (3) Duplication of costs to the Government.
    (4) Other appropriate considerations.
    (b) Establish the prices for other potentially available properties 
by requesting each prospective offeror to provide an informational 
quotation for standard space for comparison purposes.
    (1) Adjust the prices quoted for standard space for any special 
requirements.
    (2) You do not need a formal SFO to obtain the informational 
quotation. However, you must provide a general description of the 
Government's needs.
    (3) If you obtain oral quotations, document the following 
information, as a minimum:
    (i) Name and address of the firm solicited.
    (ii) Name of the firm's representative providing the quote.
    (iii) Price(s) quoted.
    (iv) Description of the space and services for which the quote is 
provided.
    (v) Name of the Government employee soliciting the quotation.
    (vi) Date of the conversation.
    (4) Compare the informational quotations to the present lessor's 
price, adjusted to reflect the anticipated price for a succeeding lease.


<R05>
570.403  Expansion requests.

    (a) If the expansion space is in the general scope of the lease, you 
may acquire the space through a modification without further 
justification under FAR 6.3.
    (b) If the expansion space needed is outside the general scope of 
the lease, determine whether it is more prudent to provide the expansion 
space by supplemental agreement to the existing lease or to satisfy the 
requirement by competitive means.
    (1) Conduct a market survey to determine the availability of 
suitable alternative locations.
    (2) If you identify alternate locations that can satisfy the total 
requirement, perform a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether it is 
in the Government's best interest to relocate. Consider, as appropriate.
    (i) The cost of the alternate space compared to the cost of 
expanding at the existing location.
    (ii) The cost of moving.
    (iii) The cost of duplicating existing improvements.
    (iv) The cost of the unexpired portion of the firm lease term. If a 
termination is possible, use the actual cost of such an action.
    (v) the cost of disruption to the agency's operation.
    (c) If you determine not to use competitive procedures and the 
expansion space is outside the general scope of the lease:
    (1) If the estimated value of the acquisition does not exceed the 
simplified lease acquisition threshold, document the file as required by 
570.203-2(b).
    (2) If the estimated value of the acquisition exceeds the simplified 
lease acquisition threshold, prepare a justification for approval under 
FAR 6.3 and 506.3.


<R05>
570.404  Superseding leases.

    (a) Consider executing a superseding lease to replace an existing 
lease when the Government need numerous or detailed modifications to the 
space that would cause complications or substantially change the present 
lease.
    (b) If the value of the superseding lease exceeds the simplified 
lease acquisition threshold, the justification and approval requirements 
in FAR 6.3 and 506.3 apply. If the cost does not exceed the simplified 
lease acquisition threshold, you may use the simplified procedures in 
570.2 and explain the absence of competition in the file.


<R05>
570.405  Lease extensions.

    (a) This section applies to extension of the term of a lease to 
provide for continued occupancy on a short-term basis.
    (b) If the value of a lease extension will exceed the simplified 
lease acquisition threshold, the justification and approval requirements 
in FAR 6.3 and 506.3 apply. For extensions that will

[[Page 423]]

not exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, you may use the 
simplified procedures in 570.2 and explain the absence of competition in 
the file.
    (c) FAR 6.302-1 permits contracting without providing for full and 
open competition when the property or services needed by the agency are 
available from only one responsible source and no other type of property 
or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. This authority may 
apply to lease extensions in situations such as the following:
    (1) The agency occupying the leased space is scheduled to move into 
other Federally controlled space, but encounters unexpected delays in 
preparing the new space for occupancy.
    (2) The Government encounters unexpected delays outside of its 
control in acquiring replacement space.
    (3) The Government is consolidating various agencies occupying the 
leased space and you need to extend the terms of some leases to 
establish a common expiration date.


<R04>
   Subpart 570.5--Special Aspects of Contracting for Lease Alterations


<R05>
570.501  General.

    (a) Acquire alterations through a modification to an existing lease 
if you meet all the following conditions:
    (1) The alterations fall in the general scope of the lease. Consider 
whether the work can be regarded as fairly and reasonably an inseparable 
part of the lease requirement originally contracted for.
    (2) The lessor is willing to perform the proposed alterations at a 
fair and reasonable price.
    (3) It is in the Government's interest to acquire the alterations 
from the lessor.
    (b) If proposed alterations are outside the general scope of the 
existing lease, decide whether to acquire the alterations through 
either:
    (1) A supplemental lease agreement, justified and approved under 
570.502-1.
    (2) Government performance or a separate contract. The lease must 
first provide the Government the right to perform alterations to the 
leased space.


<R05>
570.502  Alterations by the lessor.

    These procedures apply to alterations you acquire directly from a 
lessor by modification or supplement lease agreement.


<R05>
570.502-1  Justification and approval requirements.

    If the proposed alterations are outside the general scope of the 
lease and you plan to acquire them from the lessor without competition, 
the following justification and approval requirements apply:
    (a) If the alteration project will exceed the simplified lease 
acquisition threshold, the justification and approval requirements in 
FAR 6.3 and 506.3 apply.
    (b) If the alteration project will exceed $2,500, but not the 
simplified lease acquisition threshold, you may use simplified 
acquisition procedures and explain the absence of competition in the 
file.
    (c) If the alternation project will not exceed $2,500, no 
justification and approval is required.


<R05>
570.502-2  Procedures.

    (a) Scope of work. Prepare a scope of work for each alteration 
project.
    (b) Independent Government estimate. Obtain an independent 
Government estimate for each alteration project, including changes to 
existing alteration agreements with the lessor.
    (c) Request for proposal. (1) Provide the scope of work to the 
lessor, including any plans and specifications, and request a proposal. 
Indicate in the request for proposal if the Government will make 
progress payments and provide for retainage, when appropriate.
    (2) Request sufficient cost or price information to permit a price 
analysis.
    (d) Audits. If you require cost or pricing data and the alteration 
project will exceed $500,000, request an audit.
    (e) Proposal evaluation. (1) Determine if the proposal meets the 
Government's requirements.
    (2) Analyze price or cost. At a minimum, compare the proposed cost 
to the independent estimate and, if applicable, any audit received.
    (3) Analyze profit following FAR 15.404-4.

[[Page 424]]

    (4) Document your analysis under this paragraph and the resulting 
negotiation objectives.
    (f) Price negotiations. (1) Exercise sound judgment. You may make 
reasonable compromises as necessary.
    (2) The negotiated price should provide the lessor with the greatest 
incentive for efficient and economical performance.
    (3) Document negotiations in the contract file.
    (g) Award. Use GSA Form 276, Supplemental Lease Agreement. If the 
modification does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, you 
may use GSA Form 300, Order for Supplies or Services. Reference the 
lease on the form.
    (h) Inspection and payment. Do not make final payment for 
alterations until the work is:
    (1) Inspected by a qualified Government employee or independent 
Government contractor.
    (2) Confirmed as completed in a satisfactory manner.

[64 FR 37265, July 9, 1999; 64 FR 49844, Sept. 14, 1999]


<R05>
570.503  Alterations by the Government or through a separate contract.

    (a) If the Government chooses to exercise its right to make the 
alterations rather than contracting directly with the lessor, the 
Government may either:
    (1) Have Federal employees perform the work.
    (2) Contract out the work using standard contracting procedures that 
apply to a construction contract performed on Federal property.
    (b) If the Government decides to contract for the work, invite the 
lessor, as well as all other prospective contractors, to submit an offer 
for the project.

          in Real Property. Use Alternate I if you decide that it is 
          advantageous to the Government to allow offers to be submitted 
          up to the exact time specified for award. Use Alternate II if 
          the Government intends to award without discussions. These two 
          alternates are not exclusive.

552.270-3  Parties to Execute Lease.


<R05>
570.603  GSAR contract clauses.

    Insert clauses substantially the same as the following in 
solicitations and contracts for leasehold interests in real property 
that exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, unless you 
determine that a clause is not appropriate. You do not require a 
deviation under 570.604 to determine that a clause in this section is

<R05>
601.201  Maintenance of the FAR.


<R05>
601.201-1  The two councils.

    The Office of the Procurement Executive (A/OPE) represents the 
Department of State (DOS) on the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council. 
The Procurement Executive shall appoint a representative for this 
purpose. A/OPE is responsible for coordinating with all interested DOS 
elements proposed FAR revisions and for advocating FAR revisions sought 
by the Department.

[53 FR 26159, July 11, 1988, as amended at 59 FR 66750, Dec. 28, 1994]


<R04>
              Subpart 601.3--Agency Acquisition Regulations


<R05>
601.301  Policy.

    (a) The Assistant Secretary of State for Administration is the 
agency head for the purposes of FAR 1.301 (see Delegation of Authority 
No. 120 (34 FR 18095, October 30, 1969), as amended by Delegation of 
Authority No. 120-4 (59 FR 38022, July 26, 1994)). Under Delegation of 
Authority No. 120-5 (59 FR 62771, December 6, 1994), the Assistant 
Secretary of State for Administration redelegated to the Procurement 
Executive the authority to prescribe, promulgate, and amend DOS 
acquisition policies, rules, and regulations.
    (b) The Department of State Acquisition Regulation (DOSAR) is 
prescribed under the authority of 22 U.S.C. 2658 and 40 U.S.C. 486(c).
    (c) The DOSAR implements and supplements the FAR.

[59 FR 66751, Dec. 28, 1994, as amended at 64 FR 43620, Aug. 11, 1999]


<R05>
601.302  Limitations.

    (a) The FAR and the DOSAR apply to all DOS acquisitions of personal 
property and services, including construction, both within and outside 
the United States, unless expressly excluded by this subpart, or exempt 
from the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as 
amended (40 U.S.C. 474(7)), or undertaken pursuant to section 208 of the 
State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended (22 U.S.C. 
4308), or the Foreign Service Buildings Act of 1926, as amended (22 
U.S.C. 292 et seq.).
    (b) At posts where Joint Administrative Offices have been formed, 
the FAR and the DOSAR apply to all Agency for International Development 
(AID) administrative and technical support acquisitions, except in those 
areas which have been exempted by the cognizant administrative office.

[53 FR 26159, July 11, 1988, as amended at 59 FR 66751, Dec. 28, 1994; 
64 FR 43620, Aug. 11, 1999]


<R05>
601.303  Publication and codification.

    (a) The DOSAR is issued as Chapter 6 of Title 48, Code of Federal 
Regulations. The DOSAR is established as Chapter 6 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulations System. The DOSAR is divided into the same 
parts, subparts, sections, subsections, and paragraphs as is the FAR. 
However, when the FAR coverage is adequate by itself there will be no 
corresponding DOSAR coverage. Where the DOSAR implements a specific 
part, subpart, section, or subsection of the FAR, the DOSAR coverage is 
numbered and titled to correspond to the appropriate FAR number and 
title, except that the DOSAR number will include a 6 or 60 such that 
there will always be three numbers to the left of the decimal. For 
example, the DOSAR implementation of FAR 14.1 is shown as 614.1 and the 
DOSAR implementation of FAR 1.301 is shown as 601.301. Materials that 
supplement the FAR are assigned the numbers 70 and up. For example, 
DOSAR requires additional definitions than those used in FAR; this 
supplementary material is provided in 602.101-70.
    (b) The DOSAR and its revisions are published in the Federal 
Register and in the Code of Federal Regulations, both of which may be 
purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing 
Office, Washington, DC 20402.
    (c) The DOSAR shall be referenced in the same manner as described at 
FAR 1.105-2(c).

pertaining to treaties and executive agreements is authorized under FAR 
1.405 or that a request for deviation is required under FAR 1.405(e).

[53 FR 26159, July 11, 1988, as amended at 59 FR 66751, Dec. 28, 1994]

601.602-1  Authority.

    (a) DOS contracts are awarded pursuant to the foreign affairs

U.S.C. 2656), and the various laws, regulations, and Executive Orders 
relating thereto.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided by law, DOS regulations, and this 
DOSAR, the Procurement Executive has the authority to execute, award, 
and administer contracts, purchase orders, other contractual 
arrangements, and other agreements, including FAR-covered interagency 
acquisition agreements, for the expenditure of funds involved in the 
acquisition of real and personal property, services, and for the sale of 
personal property. The Procurement Executive may further delegate this 
authority to those DOS employees appointed or designated to the 
contracting activities enumerated in 601.603-70.
    (c) The contracting officer shall not award, modify, or terminate a 
contract unless all reviews, clearances, and approvals prescribed in the 
FAR or the DOSAR have been obtained, and all applicable requirements of 
law, the FAR, the DOSAR, and other regulations have been met.

[53 FR 26159, July 11, 1988, as amended at 55 FR 5774, Feb. 16, 1990; 59 
FR 66751, Dec. 28, 1994]


<R05>
601.603  Selection, appointment, and termination of appointment.


<R05>
601.603-3  Appointment.

    (a) General. There is no contracting officer authority conferred 
upon any DOS employee by virtue of position. The Procurement Executive 
appoints all DOS contracting officers, in conformance with FAR 1.603-3, 
with the one exception as noted in paragraph (b) of this section. The 
contracting officer shall retain the original copy of the Standard Form 
1402, Certificate of Appointment, signed by the Procurement Executive. 
Only qualified employees shall be appointed as contracting officers. A/
OPE is responsible for providing guidance and oversight in managing such 
appointments.

[[Page 432]]

    (b) Temporary warrants. The Chief of Mission is delegated the 
authority by the Procurement Executive to issue temporary contracting 
officer warrants for periods up to 90 calendar days in order to cover 
emergency, post-specific operational requirements (e.g., staffing gaps, 
medical evacuations, extended leave, etc.). These temporary appointments 
shall be executed on the Standard Form 1402, and a copy shall be 
furnished to A/OPE. The warrant shall contain both a dollar limitation 
of no more than $100,000 and a specific time period (not to exceed 90 
days) during which the warrant is effective.
    (c) Non-Federal employees. Only United States Government direct-hire 
employees who are U.S. citizens shall be appointed as contracting 
officers. Personal services contractors, Foreign Service Nationals, and 
Third Country Nationals are not eligible for appointment as DOS 
contracting officers.
    (d) Personal services agreements. Individuals who may sign personal 
services agreements (PSAs) are limited to the following:
    (1) An individual, or class of individuals, granted authority by the 
Director, PER/OE; or
    (2) Individuals with contracting officer certificates of 
appointment.

[59 FR 66752, Dec. 28, 1994, as amended at 64 FR 43620, Aug. 11, 1999]


<R05>
601.603-70  Delegations of authority.

    (a) Delegations. As stated in 601.603-3(a), there is no contracting 
officer authority conferred by virtue of position. Pursuant to 601.602-
1(b), the Procurement Executive has designated the following as 
contracting activities as defined in FAR 2.101. These authorities are 
not redelegable. In addition, specific individuals are designated as 
heads of contracting activities (HCAs) (see FAR 2.101):
    (1) Overseas posts. Each overseas post shall be regarded as a 
contracting activity to enter into and administer contracts for the 
expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of supplies, equipment, 
publications, and services. The Principal Officer, the Administrative 
Officer, or the Supervisory General Services Officer are designated as 
HCAs; provided, that he/she has a contracting officer's warrant issued 
by the Procurement Executive. The Procurement Executive (or authorized 
A/OPE staff) may delegate to a contracting officer, on a case-by-case 
basis, the authority to award a contract or modification which exceeds 
the contracting officer's warrant level.
    (i) No authority is delegated to enter into cost-reimbursement, 
fixed-price incentive, or fixed-price redeterminable contracts.
    (ii) When expressly authorized by a U.S. Government agency which 
does not have a contracting officer at the post, the officers named in 
paragraph (a)(1) introductory text of this section may enter into 
contracts for that agency. Use of this authority is subject to the 
statutory authority of that agency and any special contract terms or 
other requirements necessary for compliance with any conditions or 
limitations applicable to the funds of that agency. The agency's 
authorization shall cite the statute(s) and state any special contract 
terms or other requirements with which the acquisition so authorized 
must comply. In view of the contracting officer's responsibility for the 
legal, technical, and administrative sufficiency of contracts, questions 
regarding the propriety of contracting actions that the post is required 
to take pursuant to this authority may be referred to the Department for 
resolution with the headquarters of the agency concerned.
    (2) Office of Foreign Buildings. The authority to enter into and

    (a) Policy. In accordance with a Determination and Findings issued 
by the Assistant Secretary of State for Administration, the requirement 
for advance CBD notices for the Department's foreign acquisitions 
awarded by overseas contracting activities is waived. CBD notices may be 
published for any acquisition where the contracting officer decides that 
publication would be in the Department's best interests. This waiver 
shall remain in effect until May 19, 2001.
    (b) Procedures. Contracting officers at overseas contracting 
activities are not required to prepare an individual determination and 
findings to document their decision to waive the CBD notice 
requirements.
    (c) Competition requirements. Nothing in this section waives the 
requirement to obtain competition as required by FAR part 6 and DOSAR 
(48 CFR) part 606. Competition, including the use of written 
solicitation, shall be obtained in all cases to the extent feasible. If 
there are known U.S. firms or firms with U.S. affiliations in local 
residence capable of supplying the required supplies or services, the 
contracting activity shall ensure that those firms are included in the 
source list for the acquisition.
    (d) Policy exclusion. CBD waiver authority does not apply to local 
guard service contracts that exceed $250,000. Local guard service 
contracts that exceed $250,000 shall be synopsized in the CBD. Option 
year prices shall be included when computing the applicability of this 
threshold.

606.302-6  National security.

    (b) This subsection applies to all acquisitions involving national 
security information, regardless of dollar amount. In no case shall 
information be classified in order to restrict competition. Information 
may be classified only when its authorized disclosure could be expected 
to cause damage to national security.
    (c) (1) The Chief, Controls Division, Office of Intelligence 
Liaison, Directorate for Coordination, Bureau of Intelligence and 
Research, is responsible for reviewing and certifying on any proposed 
acquisitions derived from or funded or administered by intelligence 
community agencies that involve sensitive compartmented information and 
ensuring that the provisions of Executive Order 12958 and FAR 6.302-6 
have been met. The Chief, Information Security Programs Division, Office 
of Information Security Technology, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, is 
responsible for reviewing and certifying on all other proposed 
acquisitions funded by the Department of State that involve national 
security information and ensuring that the provisions of Executive Order 
12958 and FAR 6.302-6 have been met. When disclosure of the Department's 
needs through full and open competition would compromise national 
security, the Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition 
shall include the following specific information:
    (i) How national security would be compromised if the Department of 
State's (or other agencies') needs were disclosed in the Commerce 
Business Daily;
    (ii) Why the CBD synopsis cannot be worded in such a manner that 
national security would not be compromised;
    (iii) Necessity for access to classified information to prepare 
technical and/or cost proposal and level of security clearance required;
    (iv) Necessity for access to classified information to perform the 
proposed contract and level of security clearance required;
    (v) Number and value of contracts that the justification covers; and
    (vi) A statement as follows: ``I hereby certify that the national 
security concerns of the referenced acquisition(s) meet the criteria set 
forth in Executive Order 12958 and FAR 6.302-6''.
    (2) Any acquisition involving national security information shall be 
publicized in the Commerce Business Daily unless disclosure of the 
agency's needs would compromise national security.
    (3) The contracting officer is responsible for soliciting offers 
from as many potential sources as is practicable under the 
circumstances. However, given the sensitivity required for acquisitions 
involving national security information, it is expected that 
requirements offices will work closely with the contracting officer in 
maximizing competition.

606.370  Department of State standardization program.

    (a) It is the Department's policy to promote full and open 
competition in all procurement actions. The authority at 41 U.S.C. 
253(c)(1) shall be used with respect to standardization when only 
specified makes and models of equipment will satisfy the Department's 
needs and only one source is available. This policy applies to all 
acquisitions involving standardization, regardless of dollar amount.
    (b) Contracts awarded under the authority at 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) 
shall be supported by the written justification described in FAR 6.303. 
The contracting officer, requirements office, procuring activity 
competition advocate, and the Procurement Executive shall approve all 
Justifications for Other than Full and Open Competition that cite 
standardization of technical equipment as justification to restrict 
competition. The Administrative Officer at each post is the procuring 
activity competition advocate for that post and the requirements office 
at post is the embassy functional office responsible for identifying the 
need to contract.
    (c) Procurement of specified makes and models of technical equipment 
and systems, for which there is only one source of supply, is considered 
other than full and open competition. Such procurements shall be 
supported by an approved Justification for Other than Full and Open 
Competition. The justification shall include the content requirements of 
FAR 6.303-2. The justification shall also address potential cost savings 
in areas such as inventory, operations, training, maintenance, repairs, 
and administrative and management support. Areas of consideration for 
potential cost savings shall be supported by detailed estimates as 
attachments to the justification. Justifications shall specify an 
effective period, which shall bear a reasonable relationship to the life 
of the technical equipment. The effective period shall not exceed six 
years with a review at the end of the first three years. Periodic 
reviews shall be made during the standardization period to determine 
whether the standardization should be continued, revised or canceled.

609.405  Effect of listing.

    (a) The Procurement Executive is the agency head's designee for the 
purposes of FAR 9.405(a).
    (d) In accordance with a FAR class deviation granted by the 
Procurement Executive, the following actions apply to actions awarded by 
DOS contracting activities:
    (1)(i) Contracting officers at overseas contracting activities may 
rely on the debarment certification submitted by bidders/offerors (FAR 
52.209-5) as proof of eligibility for award when access to the current 
``Lists of Parties Excluded from Procurement Programs'' is not 
reasonably available. For contracts which require A/OPE review and 
approval, the contracting officer should request that A/OPE perform the 
required review if the list is not available.

[[Page 442]]

    (4)(i) For procurement actions (both domestic and overseas) that do 
not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers 
need not consult the ``List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement 
and Nonprocurement Programs'' prior to award. The list should be 
consulted whenever the contracting officer has reason to believe that a 
proposed contractor may appear on the list.
    (ii) Contracting officers at domestic contracting activities shall 
review the ``List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and 
Nonprocurement Programs'', either in hard copy or electronic form, prior 
to awarding a procurement action exceeding the simplified acquisition 
threshold.

609.405-70  Termination action decision.

    (a) Prior to making a decision to terminate, based on the 
consideration listed below, the contracting officer shall have the 
proposed action reviewed and approved by:
    (1) The Office of the Legal Adviser;
    (2) An individual one level above the contracting officer; and
    (3) For overseas posts, A/OPE.
    (b) Termination for default. Termination for default under a 
contract's default clause is appropriate when the circumstances giving 
rise to the debarment or suspension also constitute a default in the 
contractor's performance of that contract. Debarment or suspension of 
the contractor for reasons unrelated to the performance of that contract 
may not support a termination for default.
    (c) Termination for convenience or cancellation. Termination for 
convenience or cancellation under appropriate contract clauses should be 
considered when the contractor presents a significant risk to the 
Government in completing a current contract and when such termination 
for convenience or cancellation is determined to be in the Government's 
best interests. In making this determination, the contracting officer 
should consider such factors as the--
    (1) Seriousness of the cause for debarment or suspension;
    (2) Extent of contract performance;
    (3) Potential costs to the Government;
    (4) Urgency of the requirement and the impact of the delay; and/or
    (5) Availability of other safeguards to protect the Government's 
interests.

    (2) In response to the debarment notice, if the contractor or its 
representative notifies the debarring official within 30 days after 
receipt of the notice that it wants to present information and arguments 
in person to the debarring official, that official shall chair such a 
meeting within 20 calendar days of receipt of the request, unless the 
contractor requests a longer period of time. The oral presentation shall

whether a cause for debarment exists, based on the facts as found.
    (6) The fact-finding panel shall conduct its hearing in accordance 
with rules promulgated by the fact-finding official. The rules shall be 
as informal as is practicable, consistent with FAR 9.406-3(b) The fact-
finding official is responsible for making the transcribed record of the 
hearing, unless the contractor and the fact-finding panel agree to waive 
the requirement for a transcript.
    (7) The fact-finding official shall deliver written findings and the 
transcribed record, if made, to the debarring official within 30 
calendar days after the hearing. The findings shall resolve any facts in 
dispute based on a preponderance of the evidence presented and recommend 
whether a cause for debarment exists.
    (c) Notice of proposal to debar. (1) Upon receipt of a complete 
referral and after consulting with the Office of the Legal Adviser, the 
debarring official shall decide whether to initiate debarment action.
    (2) When a determination is made to initiate action, the debarring 
official shall provide to the contractor and any specifically named 
affiliates written notice in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c). A copy of

<R05>
611.002  Policy.


<R05>
611.002-70  Metric system implementation.

    (a) Policy. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975, as amended by the 
Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 205a, et seq.), 
requires Federal agencies to establish implementing guidelines pursuant 
to metric policy to adopt the metric system as the preferred system of 
weights and measurements for United States trade and commerce. This 
section establishes the Department of State's metric conversion 
guidelines.
    (b) Applicability. This section applies to all DOS acquisitions, 
except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause 
significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to U.S. firms.
    (c) Definitions.
    Dual system means the use of both traditional and metric systems. 
For example, an item is designated, produced and described in inch-pound 
values

[[Page 445]]

with soft metric values also shown for information or comparison.
    Hard metric means the use of only standard metric (SI) measurements 
in specifications, standards, supplies and services.
    Hybrid system means the use of both traditional and hard metric 
values in specifications, standards, supplies and services.
    Measurement sensitive means any item having an application or 
meaning depending substantially on some measured quantity. For example, 
measurement sensitive items include product or performance criteria and 
standards binding on others, such as emission levels, size and weight 
limitations, etc.
    Metric system means the International System of Units (Le System 
International d'Unites (SI)) of the International Bureau of Weights and 
Measures.
    Metrication means any act that increases metric system use, 
including metric training and initiation or conversion of measurement 
sensitive processes and systems to the metric system.
    Soft metric means the result of mathematical conversion of inch-
pound measurements to metric equivalents. The physical dimensions, 
however, are not changed.
    Traditional system of weights and measurements means the predominant 
weight and measurement system currently used in the United States, also 
referred to as the ``inch-pound system.'' The traditional system 
includes such commonly used units as inch, foot, yard, mile, pint, 
quart, gallon, bushel, ounce (fluid and avoirdupois), pound, degree 
Fahrenheit, ampere, candela, and second.
    (d) Procedures. (1) DOS contracting activities shall implement the 
metric system in a manner consistent with 15 U.S.C. 205a, et seq.
    (2) All DOS contracting activities shall use the metric system in 
acquisition consistent with security, operations, economic, technical, 
logistical, training and safety requirements.
    (3) The Department shall encourage industry to adopt the metric 
system by acquiring commercially available metric products and services 
that meet the Department's needs whenever practical. Toward this end, 
solicitations for DOS acquisitions shall:
    (i) State all measurement sensitive requirements in metric terms 
whenever possible. Alternatives to hard metric are soft, dual and hybrid 
metric terms. The Metric Handbook for Federal Officials regarding the 
selection of proper metric units and symbols is available from the 
National Technical Information Service; and
    (ii) For contracts expected to exceed $500,000 contracting officers 
shall return to the requirements office all specifications and 
statements of work that are not expressed in some form of metric terms 
unless the requirements office has prepared a justification, for the 
approval of the contracting officer, for the use of non-metric 
specifications or statements of work. The justification shall be in a 
format as prescribed by the head of the contracting activity. Option 
year prices shall be considered when computing the $500,000 threshold.
    (4) Waivers are not required when ordering from Federal Supply 
Schedules.
    (5) Valid justifications for non-metric specifications or statements 
of work include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Existing specifications or standards are in inch-pound units, 
unless conversion of the existing specifications or standards is 
necessary or advantageous to the Government. Unnecessary retrofit of 
existing systems with new metric components should be avoided if the 
total cost of the retrofit, including redesign costs, exceeds $50,000;
    (ii) Metric is not the accepted industry system with respect to a 
business-related activity; however, soft, hybrid, or dual systems may be 
used during the transition to hard metric;
    (iii) The use of metric is impractical or is likely to cause 
significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to U.S. firms.
    (6) The contracting officer shall review and, if acceptable, approve 
the waiver prior to the release of the solicitation. The waiver shall be 
placed in the contract file. If the waiver is not approved, the 
contracting officer shall return it to the requirements office with an 
explanation for the disapproval.

[[Page 446]]

    (7) The in-house operating metric costs shall be identified. 
Identification includes, but is not limited to, the cost of metric aids, 
tools, equipment, training and increased cost to develop metric 
specifications. All contracting activities and requirements offices 
shall maintain a record of any costs and/or savings brought about by 
metric conversion.
    (8) Bulk (loose, unpacked) materials shall be specified and 
purchased in metric or dual units.
    (9) Measuring devices, shop and laboratory equipment shall be 
purchased in metric or dual units.
    (10) Shipping allowances, bills of lading and other shipping 
documents shall be expressed in metric or dual units.

619.705-1  General support of the program.

    It is the Department's policy to incorporate its current fiscal year 
goals as negotiated with the SBA into all pertinent Department 
solicitations, in addition to the standard subcontract clauses. 
Incorporation of the goals does not require that large business prime 
contractors must subcontract, but does require that to the extent they 
plan to subcontract, specific goals be established for doing business 
with small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned firms. Where funds are 
available, an incentive clause such as that found in FAR 52.219-10, 
Incentive Subcontracting Program for Small and Small Disadvantaged 
Business Concerns, is encouraged.

[59 FR 66760, Dec. 28, 1994]


<R05>
619.705-3   Preparing the solicitation.

    To further promote the use of small, disadvantaged, and women-owned 
firms by large prime contractors, contracting officers are encouraged to 
consider the adequacy of the subcontracting plans, and/or past 
performance in achieving negotiated subcontract goals, as part of the 
overall evaluation of the technical proposals.

[64 FR 43624, Aug. 11, 1999]


<R05>
619.705-4  Reviewing the subcontracting plan.

    A/SDBU shall review subcontracting plans to determine if small and 
small disadvantaged businesses are afforded the maximum practicable 
opportunity to participate as subcontractors. A/SDBU shall recommend to 
the contracting officer changes needed to subcontracting plans found to 
be deficient.

    (d) Utilizing Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), the SBA has 
delegated its authority to contract directly with program participants 
under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act to the Senior Procurement 
Executives of various Federal contracting activities. The Department of 
State has signed an MOU with SBA, effective May 6, 1998. Under the MOU, 
a contract may be awarded directly to an 8(a) firm on either a sole 
source or competitive basis. The SBA reserves the right to withdraw any 
delegation issued as a result of an MOU; however, any such withdrawal 
shall have no effect on contracts currently awarded under the MOU.

contracting officer shall establish the price with the selected 8(a) 
contractor.

[[Page 455]]

<R05>
623.400  Scope of subpart.

    The affirmative procurement program is applicable to all domestic 
acquisitions of items currently designated by an EPA guideline or by 
future guidelines promulgated by EPA. The requirements of this section 
are not applicable to acquisitions made and/or performed outside the 
United States or its possessions.


<R05>
623.404  Procedures.

    (b)(2) The requirements office initiating an acquisition is 
responsible for determining whether recovered materials should be 
included in the specifications. Requirements offices may purchase EPA 
designated items containing other than recovered materials only if one 
of the exemptions listed in FAR 23.404(b)(3) applies. If the 
requirements office determines to acquire EPA designated items that do 
not contain recovered materials, a written justification must be 
submitted to the head of the contracting activity.
    (i) Contracts for the purchase of, or requiring the supply of, any 
EPA designated item shall require that the item conform to the EPA 
guidelines, unless an exception has been approved by the head of the 
contracting activity in accordance with FAR 23.404(b)(3) and DOSAR 
623.404(b)(3).
    (ii) Contracting officers shall promote the fact that the Department 
is seeking to buy items containing recovered materials at pre-bid and 
pre-proposal conferences, when appropriate. Other means of promotion may 
include a specific notice on a solicitation's cover letter, calling 
attention to the requirement for recovered materials.
    (iii) Contracting officers shall include FAR clause 52.223-9 to 
ensure that contractors estimate, certify, and verify the amount of 
recovered material used in the performance of the contract.
    (iv) The effectiveness of the program shall be reviewed annually by 
A/OPE. An assessment will be made to determine if greater use of 
recovered materials is possible for the existing requirements or if 
recovered materials are causing undue delay, lack of competition, 
unreasonable prices, or an unacceptable level of performance.
    (3) The head of the contracting activity is the agency head for the 
purpose of FAR 23.404(b)(3).

<R05>
628.305  Overseas workers' compensation and war-hazard insurance.

    (a) It is the Department's policy that acquisitions for services, 
including construction but excluding personal services contracts, which 
require contractor personnel to perform work outside of the United 
States, shall include the contractual obligation for coverage under the 
Defense Base Act (42 U.S.C. Sections 1651-1654, as amended). For the 
purpose of this section only, ``contractor personnel'' includes 
individuals who are either:
    (1) United States citizens or residents, or
    (2) Hired in the United States or its possessions.
    (b) The Department of State has entered into a contract with an 
insurance broker and carrier to provide Defense Base Act insurance, at a 
fixed rate for services and construction, to cover DOS contracts which 
will require performance overseas by United States citizens, residents, 
or those employed in the United States. In countries where local 
nationals and/or third country nationals will be employed to perform the 
contract, such countries have been waived by the Secretary of Labor. 
Whenever such insurance is required under the contract, the contracting 
officer shall insert the clause at 652.228-71, Worker's Compensation 
Insurance (Defense Base Act)--Services. If the contract is for 
construction, the contracting officer shall insert the clause with its 
Alternate I.
    (c) Upon award of a contract which requires Defense Base Act 
insurance, the contracting officer shall notify the successful offeror 
of the name of the insurance broker from which the contractor should 
acquire insurance.
    (d) The authority to request a waiver from the Secretary of Labor of 
a particular country, as set forth in FAR 28.305(d), is reserved to the 
Secretary of State. The Department has obtained blanket waivers from the 
Secretary of Labor for all contracts for services, including 
construction, awarded and/or performed overseas. The waivers apply to 
all individuals who are not employees hired in the United States, or who 
are not United States citizens or residents.

solicitations for fixed-price or construction contracts to be performed 
outside the United States by United States citizens, residents, and/or

which a

private buyer would guard against through insurance. There may be 
occasions, however, when a contractor's assumption of such risks is in 
the best interest of the Government. The clause in paragraph (b) below 
is authorized for use on those occasions. In the determination of its 
use, the contracting officer should weigh the advantages it provides 
against the likelihood of a resultant increase in the contract price.
    (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 652.228-70, 
Indemnification, in solicitations and contracts when it is determined 
that the contractor's assumption of risk is in the best interest of the 
Government.

<R04>
                   Subpart 633.2--Disputes and Appeals


<R05>
633.203  Applicability.

    The Procurement Executive is the agency head for the purposes of FAR 
33.203(b).


<R05>
633.214-70  Alternative dispute resolution.

    (a) Policy. The Department's goal is to resolve contract disputes 
before the issuance of a contracting officer's final decision under the 
Contract Disputes Act. Contracting officers shall consider all possible 
means of reaching a negotiated settlement, consistent with the 
Government's best interests, before issuing a final decision on a 
contractor claim under the process outlined in FAR 33.206 through 
33.211.
    (b) When to use ADR. (1) Factors favoring ADR. Contracting officers 
should consider using ADR in those cases where:
    (i) Only facts are in dispute;
    (ii) The facts are clearly not favorable to the Government;
    (iii) The anticipated costs (in time and money) are less than the 
anticipated costs of litigation;
    (iv) Settlement attempts have reached an impasse;

[[Page 468]]

    (v) ADR techniques have been used successfully in similar 
situations;
    (vi) There is a need for independent expert analysis; or,
    (vii) The claim has merit but its value is overstated.
    (2) Factors disfavoring ADR. The following circumstances do not 
favor use of ADR:
    (i) Cases involving disputes controlled by clear legal precedent, 
making compromise difficult;
    (ii) The resolution will have a significant impact on other pending 
cases or on the future conduct of Department business;
    (iii) The dispute is primarily over issues of law;
    (iv) A decision of precedential value is needed;
    (v) A significant policy question is involved;
    (vi) A full public record of the proceeding is important;
    (vii) The outcome could significantly involve persons who are not 
parties to the contract;
    (viii) The costs of pursuing an ADR procedure (in time and money) 
exceed the cost of litigation;
    (ix) The nature of the case may cause ADR to be used merely for 
delay or discovery; or,
    (x) The case involves criminal violations.
    (3) Initial action. Immediately upon receipt of a claim, the 
contracting officer shall send a letter acknowledging receipt of the 
claim and soliciting the contractor's views on submitting this claim for 
ADR. In every dispute, the first step toward resolution shall be 
unassisted negotiations, in which the parties try to work out the 
disagreement among themselves. If this fails, before issuing a final 
decision, the contracting officer shall consult first with the head of 
the contracting activity, and contact the Office of the Legal Adviser 
and A/OPE to determine whether the disagreement appears susceptible to 
resolution by ADR. Consideration shall be given to pursuing additional 
fact-finding or designating a neutral expert in the disputed issue to 
provide an advisory opinion.
    (c) Methods of ADR. If the initial action to resolve the dispute 
fails, and the contracting officer issues a final decision which is 
appealed, ADR may still be feasible. The GSBCA issues a notice regarding 
ADR to all contractors who file appeals under the Contract Disputes Act. 
This notice describes the following ADR techniques, which contracting 
officers are urged to discuss with contractors at any time:
    (1) Settlement judge. A settlement judge is either an administrative 
judge or hearing examiner who is appointed by the parties in dispute for 
the purpose of facilitating settlement. The agenda is flexible and based 
on the specifics of the individual dispute. By holding a frank, in-depth 
discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each party's position, the 
settlement judge may be able to foster a settlement of the dispute. The 
settlement judge may meet with the parties jointly or individually, and 
the settlement judge's recommendations are not binding. Typically, the 
settlement judge's opinions, based on his or her experience in handling 
prior disputes, will help the parties realize whether their arguments 
have merit or not.
    (2) Minitrial. A minitrial is not an actual trial but rather a 
flexible, expedited, but structured procedure in which each party 
presents an abbreviated version of its position both to a neutral 
advisor (who may be appointed by the GSBCA) and to principals of the 
parties who have full contractual authority to conclude a settlement. 
The parties mutually decide on the form of presentation without regard 
to traditional judicial proceedings or rules of evidence. An advance 
agreement by the parties specifies the procedure to be followed in 
making presentations, as well as the role of the neutral advisor. Upon 
conclusion of the presentations, settlement negotiations are conducted. 
The neutral advisor may assist the parties in negotiating settlement, 
including making non-binding recommendations.
    (3) Summary trial with binding decision. A summary trial with 
binding decision is a procedure in which the scheduling of an appeal is 
expedited and the parties try their appeal informally before an 
administrative judge or panel of judges. The length of the trial and the 
time for presentation and decision are tailored to the needs of the 
particular

[[Page 469]]

case. Trial procedures and rules applicable to appeals are modified or 
eliminated to expedite resolution of the appeal. The parties must agree, 
however, that all decisions, rulings, and orders by the judge(s) are 
final, conclusive, and not appealable, and may not be set aside, except 
for fraud. A summary ``bench'' decision is issued at the conclusion of 
the trial or a summary written decision will be issued within ten (10) 
days of either the trial's conclusion or receipt of a trial transcript.
    (4) Mediation. Mediation is a process in which a neutral and 
impartial third party assists the Government and the contractor in 
conflict to negotiate an acceptable settlement of contested issues. The 
mediator is jointly selected and is asked by the disputing parties to 
assist them to reach a voluntary agreement. The mediator has no 
decisionmaking authority and cannot impose a decision. Mediation 
assistance involves working with the parties to improve their 
communications, clarify or interpret data, identify key issues to be 
discussed, design an effective negotiation process, generate settlement 
options, or help to identify or formulate areas of agreement. Additional 
information on alternative dispute resolution and mediation resources is 
available at the following address on the Internet: http://www.adrr.com
    (5) Arbitration. Non-binding arbitration is a process in which a 
dispute is jointly submitted by the Government and a contractor to an 
impartial and neutral person or panel who provides a written, non-
binding opinion used as a guide for negotiations toward a settlement. 
Although the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-
552) allows agencies to use binding arbitration, the law provides that 
the agency head may vacate any arbitration award within 30 days after it 
is served on all parties. For this reason, non-binding arbitration is 
preferable. Additional information on alternative dispute resolution and 
mediation resources is available at the following address on the 
Internet: http://www.adrr.com
    (6) Partnering. Partnering involves an agreement in principle to 
share the risks involved in completing a project, and to establish and 
promote a partnership environment. Partnering itself is not a 
contractual agreement and it does not create any legally enforceable 
rights, but instead partnering seeks to create a new cooperative 
attitude in completing Government contracts. The three basic steps in 
partnering are:
    (i) Establish the new relationship through personal contact among 
the principals for the Government and the contractor before the work 
begins;
    (ii) Prepare a joint statement of goals establishing common 
objectives in specific detail for reaching the goals; and,
    (iii) Identify specific dispute prevention processes designed to 
head off problems, evaluate performance, and promote cooperation. 
Additional information on alternative dispute resolution and mediation 
resources is available at the following address on the Internet: http://
www.adrr.com
    (d) ADR procedures. The ADR method shall be selected voluntarily by 
both the Government and the contractor. Both parties shall agree on the 
procedures to be followed, including the agenda and amount of time 
allowed for each party to present its case. The parties may choose not 
to have a written transcript or hearing on the record, as this might 
inhibit settlement. Also, the decision rendered, if any, should not be 
considered to establish any precedent for future litigation unless the 
parties agree otherwise. In cases where the parties agree to pay jointly 
for a third-party neutral advisor, it is recommended that the parties 
and the advisor agree on a fair and reasonable price. The Government 
would then issue a simplified acquisition (if the dollar amount does not 
exceed the simplified acquisition limitation) for 50% of the agreed 
price, and the advisor would submit separate invoices (each for 50% of 
the price) to the Government and the contractor.

    (a) The Department of State's Competition Advocate is responsible 
for assisting industry in removing restrictive requirements from 
Department of State solicitations and removing barriers to full and open 
competition and use of commercial items. If such a solicitation is 
considered competitively restrictive or does not appear properly 
conducive to competition and commercial practices, potential offerors 
are encouraged to first contact the contracting officer for the 
respective solicitation. If concerns remain unresolved, contact the 
Department of State Competition Advocate on (703) 516-1680, by fax at 
(703) 875-6155, or write to: Department of State, Competition Advocate, 
Office of the Procurement Executive (A/OPE), Suite 603, SA-6, 
Washington, DC 20522-0602.
    (b) The Department of State's Acquisition Ombudsman has been 
appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors and contractors 
during the preaward and postaward phases of this acquisition. The role 
of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting 
officer, the Technical Evaluation Panel or Source Evaluation Board, or 
the selection official. The purpose of the ombudsman is to facilitate 
the communication of concerns, issues, disagreements, and 
recommendations of interested parties to the appropriate Government 
personnel, and work to resolve them. When requested and appropriate, the 
ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the 
concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of 
proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of formal 
contract disputes. Interested parties are invited to contact the 
contracting activity ombudsman, [insert name], at [insert telephone and 
fax numbers]. For an American Embassy or overseas post, refer to the 
numbers below for the Department Acquisition Ombudsman. Concerns, 
issues, disagreements, and recommendations which cannot be resolved at a

652.216-71  Price Adjustment.

    As prescribed in 616.203-4, insert a clause substantially the same 
as follows:

                       Price Adjustment (AUG 1999)

    (a) The contract price may be increased or decreased in actual costs 
of direct service labor which result directly from laws enacted and 
effective during the term of this contract by the [insert name of 
country] Government. Direct service labor costs include only the costs 
of wages and direct benefits (such as social security, health insurance, 
unemployment compensation insurance) paid to or incurred for the direct 
benefit of personnel performing services under one of the categories 
listed in Section [identify section number] of this contract. Price 
adjustments will include only changes in direct service labor costs 
incurred in order to comply with the requirements of the law. No 
adjustment will be made under this clause with respect to labor costs of 
personnel not performing direct service labor under the categories of 
Section [identify section], nor for overhead, profit, general and 
administrative (G&A) costs, taxes or any other costs whatsoever.
    (b) For the contracting officer to consider any request for 
adjustment, the contractor shall demonstrate in writing:
    (1) That the change in the law occurred during the term of this 
contract and subsequent to the award date of this contract; and,
    (2) That the change in the law could not have been reasonably 
anticipated prior to contract award; and,
    (3) How the change in the law directly affects the contractor's 
costs under this contract.
    (c) The contractor shall present data that clearly supports any 
request for adjustment. This data shall be submitted no later than 30 
calendar days after the changes in the law

[[Page 480]]

have been made public. This data shall include, but not be limited to, 
the following:
    (1) The calculation of the amount of adjustment requested; and,
    (2) Documentation which identifies and provides the appropriate 
portions of the text of the particular law from which the request is 
derived.
    (d) In order to establish the change between the requested adjusted 
rate and the original rate, the contractor shall support the appropriate 
data and composition of the original rate and the requested adjusted 
rate. This shall include details regarding specific hourly rates paid to 
individual employees. For contracts paid in U.S. dollars, the 
contractor's request for price adjustment shall present data reflecting:
    (1) The exchange rate in effect on the date of the contractor's 
proposal that was accepted for the basic contract; and
    (2) The current exchange rate and its effect on payment of workers 
in local currency. The allowable adjustment shall be limited to the 
extent to which increases in direct service labor costs due to host 
country law changes are not offset by exchange rate gains.
    (e) Only direct cost changes mandated by enacted laws shall be 
considered for adjustment under this contract. Changes for purposes of 
maintaining parity of pay between employees at the minimum mandated 
levels and employees already paid at levels above the newly mandated 
minimums shall not be considered. Therefore, if the contractor elects to 
increase payments to employees who are already being paid at or above 
the mandated amounts, such increased costs shall be borne solely by the 
contractor and shall not be justification for an increase in the hourly 
and monthly rates under this contract.
    (f) Any request for adjustment shall be presented by signature of an 
officer or general partner of the contractor having overall 
responsibility for the conduct of the contractor's affairs.
    (g) No adjustment shall be made to the contract price that relates 
to any indirect, overhead, or fixed costs, profit or fee. Only the 
changes in direct service labor wages (and any benefits based directly 
on wages) shall be considered by the U.S. Government as basis for 
contract price changes.
    (h) No request by the contractor for an adjustment under this clause 
shall be allowed if asserted after final payment has been made under 
this contract.
    (i) This clause shall only apply to laws enacted by the [insert name 
of country] Government meeting the criterion set forth above in 
paragraph (b). No adjustments shall be made due to currency fluctuations 
in exchange rates.

[[Page 481]]

shall also coordinate with SBA prior to processing any novation 
agreement. The DOS contracting officer may assign contract 
administration functions to a contract administration office.
    (c) The contractor agrees:

 Section 8(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as Amended (AUG

    (a) Section 8(a) of the U.S. Export Administration Act of 1979, as 
amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)), prohibits compliance by U.S. persons with 
any boycott fostered by a foreign country against a country which is 
friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any 
form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation. The Boycott 
of Israel by Arab League countries is such a boycott, and therefore, the 
following actions, if taken with intent to comply with, further, or 
support the Arab League Boycott of Israel, are prohibited activities 
under the Export Administration Act:
    (1) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to do business 
with or in Israel, with any Israeli business concern, or with any 
national or resident of Israel, or with any other person, pursuant to an 
agreement of, or a request from or on behalf of a boycotting country;
    (2) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to employ or 
otherwise discriminating against any person on the basis of race, 
religion, sex, or national origin of that person or of any owner, 
officer, director, or employee of such person;

national origin of any U.S. person or of any owner, officer, director, 
or employee of such U.S. person;
    (4) Furnishing information about whether any person has, has had, or 
proposes to have any business relationship (including a relationship by 
way of sale, purchase, legal or commercial representation, shipping or 
other transport, insurance, investment, or supply) with or in the State 
of Israel, with any business concern organized under the laws of the 
State of Israel, with any Israeli national or resident, or with any 
person which is known or believed to be restricted from having any 
business relationship with or in Israel;
    (5) Furnishing information about whether any person is a member of, 
has made contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved 
in the activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which 
supports the State of Israel; and,
    (6) Paying, honoring, confirming, or otherwise implementing a letter 
of credit which contains any condition or requirement against doing 
business with the State of Israel.
    (b) Under Section 8(a), the following types of activities are not 
forbidden ``compliance

[[Page 482]]

with the boycott,'' and are therefore exempted from Section 8(a)'s 
prohibitions listed in paragraphs (a)(1)-(6) above:
    (1) Complying or agreeing to comply with requirements:
    (i) Prohibiting the import of goods or services from Israel or goods 
produced or services provided by any business concern organized under 
the laws of Israel or by nationals or residents of Israel; or,
    (ii) Prohibiting the shipment of goods to Israel on a carrier of

    (2) Complying or agreeing to comply with import and shipping 
document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the name of 
the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the supplier of the 
shipment or the name of the provider of other services, except that no 
information knowingly furnished or conveyed in response to such 
requirements may be stated in negative, blacklisting, or similar 
exclusionary terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of 
shipments as may be permitted by such regulations in order to comply 
with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks and 
confiscation;
    (3) Complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business 
with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or 
national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurance, suppliers of 
services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods 
which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when 
imported into the boycotting country;
    (4) Complying or agreeing to comply with the export requirements of 
the boycotting country relating to shipments or transshipments of 
exports to Israel, to any business concern of or organized under the 
laws of Israel, or to any national or resident of Israel;
    (5) Compliance by an individual or agreement by an individual to 
comply with the immigration or passport requirements of any country with 
respect to such individual or any member of such individual's family or 
with requests for information regarding requirements of employment of 
such individual within the boycotting country; and,
    (6) Compliance by a U.S. person resident in a foreign country or 
agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country with 
respect to his or her activities exclusively therein, and such 
regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the 
laws or regulations of that foreign country governing imports into such 
country of trademarked, trade named, or similarly specifically 
identifiable products, or components of products for his or her own use,

only the amount stated on the contract award document or subsequent 
modifications is now available for payment and obligated under this 
contract. It is anticipated that from time to time, additional funds 
will be obligated under the contract until the total price of the 
contract is obligated.
    (b) The Government is not obligated to pay or reimburse the 
contractor more than the amount obligated pursuant to this clause. The 
contractor agrees to perform the contract up to the point at which the 
total amount paid and payable by the Government (including amounts 
payable for subcontracts and settlement costs if this contract is 
terminated for convenience) approximates but does not exceed the total 
amount obligated.
    (c)(1) It is contemplated that funds now obligated under this 
contract will cover the work to be performed until [contracting officer 
insert date].
    (2) If the contractor considers the funds obligated under this 
contract to be insufficient to cover the work to be performed until that 
date, or another date agreed to by the parties, the contractor shall 
notify the contracting officer in writing and indicate the date on which 
it expects expended funds to approximate 75 percent of the total amount 
obligated. The notice shall state the estimated amount of additional 
funds required to continue performance through the date specified in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this clause or another date agreed to by the 
parties.
    (3) If, after notification is provided pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) 
of this clause, additional funds are not obligated, or an earlier date 
than the date in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause is not agreed to, the 
contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance under this 
contract (including actions under the termination clause of this 
contract) beyond the funds obligated for contract performance.
    (d) When additional funds are obligated from time to time for 
continued performance of this contract, the contract shall be modified 
to increase the funds obligated and to indicate the period of 
performance for which funds are applicable. The contractor may notify 
the contracting officer as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this clause 
regarding any additional funds obligated.

    (e) If the contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the 
performance of work under this contract, solely by reason of the 
Government's failure to obligate additional funds in amounts sufficient 
for the timely performance of this contract, an equitable adjustment may 
be made to the price, or time of delivery, or both.
    (f) This clause shall become inoperative upon obligation of funds 
sufficient to cover the full price stated in the contract, except for 
rights and obligations then existing under this clause.

terminate the contract for convenience or default.

Martin Luther King's Birthday
Washington's Birthday
Memorial Day
Independence Day
Labor Day
Columbus Day
Veterans Day
Thanksgiving Day
Christmas Day

Any other day designated by Federal law, Executive Order, or 
Presidential Proclamation.

    (b) When any such day falls on a Saturday, the preceding Friday is 
observed; when any such day falls on a Sunday, the following Monday is 
observed. Observance of such days by Government personnel shall not be 
cause for additional period of performance or entitlement to 
compensation except as set forth in the contract. If the contractor's 
personnel work on a holiday, no form of holiday or other premium 
compensation will be reimbursed either as a direct or indirect cost, 
unless authorized pursuant to an overtime clause elsewhere in this 
contract.
    (c) When the Department of State grants administrative leave to its 
Government employees, assigned contractor personnel in Government 
facilities shall also be dismissed. However, the contractor agrees to 
continue to provide sufficient personnel to perform round-the-clock 
requirements of critical tasks already in operation or scheduled, and 
shall be guided by the instructions issued by the contracting officer or 
his/her duly authorized representative.
    (d) For fixed-price contracts, if services are not required or 
provided because the building is closed due to inclement weather, 
unanticipated holidays declared by the President, failure of Congress to 
appropriate funds, or similar reasons, deductions will be computed as 
follows:
    (1) The deduction rate in dollars per day will be equal to the per 
month contract price divided by 21 days per month.
    (2) The deduction rate in dollars per day will be multiplied by the 
number of days services are not required or provided. If services are 
provided for portions of days, appropriate adjustment will be made by 
the contracting officer to ensure that the contractor is compensated for 
services provided.

[[Page 488]]

    (e) If administrative leave is granted to contractor personnel as a 
result of conditions stipulated in any ``Excusable Delays'' clause of 
this contract, it will be without loss to the contractor. The cost of 
salaries and wages to the contractor for the period of any such excused 
absence shall be a reimbursable item of direct cost hereunder for 
employees whose regular time is normally charged, and a reimbursable 
item of indirect cost for employees whose time is normally charged 
indirectly in accordance with the contractor's accounting policy.

                    Shipping Instructions (DEC 1994)

    (a) Each packing box shall be of solid construction in accordance 
with best commercial practices and sufficiently strong in direct ratio 
to the weight of the contents to withstand excessively rough handling 
while in transit overseas. It shall be constructed of lumber that is 
well seasoned, reasonably sound, free from bad cross grain and from 
knots or knotholes that interfere with nailing or that occupy more than 
\1/3\ of the width of the piece of lumber. Box shall be constructed with 
three-way corners and diagonal bracing. All nails shall be cement-
coated, of correct size and properly spaced to avoid splitting or 
warping, and shall be driven into the grain of the wood. Dimension of 
lumber shall be in accordance with the following table, dependent upon 
the weight of the contents:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                        Minimum dimensions of lumber for
      Weight of box and contents           struts, frame members, and
                                             single diagonal braces
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Up to 45 kg...........................  19.05  x  57.15mm
46 to 113 kg..........................  22.23  x  73.03mm
114 to 181 kg.........................  22.23  x  98.43mm

                                         98.43 mm
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Each box shall be lined with waterproof paper and shall be bound 
with 19.05mm" steel straps firmly stapled in position to prevent the 
straps from slipping off the box. Articles must be secured and braced 
inside the shipping container to prevent the articles from shifting.
    (c) Packing cases weighing 453.5kg and more must be equipped with 
skids. Each skid shall consist of two end sections of 50.8  x  152.4mm 
lumber placed flat and a center section of 50.8  x  101.6mm lumber 
placed flat and then arranged in line to provide 254mm forklift spaces 
between center and end sections. When goods are ready for shipment, the 
Contractor shall prepare four (4) copies of a packing list, indicating 
the contract and, if applicable, order numbers; case number; itemized 
list of contents; net and gross weights in kilograms; and outside 
dimensions, including all clears, of each shipping container. The 
Contractor shall provide three (3) copies of the packing list to the 
U.S. Despatch Agent as specified in the contract or order. The 
Contractor shall place the fourth copy of the packing list in packing 
case number one, which shall be marked

[[Page 489]]

as such so that it is easily identified by the consignee. Upon receipt 
of the packing list, the Despatch Agent will furnish export marks and 
instructions regarding shipment to the port specified, depending upon 
steamer services available at the time.
    (d) The export marks shall be stenciled on one side of each box 
reserved for that purpose, and the appropriate case number stenciled in 
the lower left-hand corner of the same side. The contract and, as 
necessary, order numbers, net and gross weights in kilograms shall be 
stenciled on the same side. However, if the size of the box is too small 
to accommodate all stenciling on one side, the contract and order 
numbers and weights may be stenciled on the side opposite that used for 
the export marks and case number.
    (e) The contract and, as necessary, order numbers must appear on all 
containers and papers relating to this clause.
