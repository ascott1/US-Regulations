                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2003), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    Title 48--Federal Acquisition Regulations System is composed of 
seven volumes. The chapters in these volumes are arranged as follows: 
Chapter 1 (parts 1 to 51), chapter 1 (parts 52 to 99), chapter 2 (parts 
201 to 299), chapters 3 to 6, chapters 7 to 14, chapters 15 to 28 and 
chapter 29 to end. The contents of these volumes represent all current

acquisition regulations issued by individual government agencies. Parts 
1 to 69 in each of chapters 2 through 99 are reserved for agency 
regulations implementing the Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 
1 and are numerically keyed to them. Parts 70 to 99 in chapters 2 
through 99 contain agency regulations supplementing the Federal 
acquisition regulations.

    The OMB control numbers for the Federal Acquisition Regulations 
System appear in section 1.106 of chapter 1. For the convenience of the

205(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, 
as amended (40 U.S.C. 486(c)), as delegated by the Secretary.
    (c) The HHSAR is issued in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as 
Chapter 3 of Title 48, Department of Health and Human Services 
Acquisition Regulation. It may be referenced as ``48 CFR Chapter 3.''

                      Subpart 301.2--Administration


<R05>
301.270  Executive Committee for Acquisition.

    (a) The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Grants and Acquisition 
Management has established the Executive Committee for Acquisition (ECA) 
to assist and facilitate the planning and development of departmental 
acquisition policies and procedures and to assist in responding to other 
agencies and organizations concerning policies and procedures impacting

Acquisition Management, Administration for Children and Families, Agency 
for Healthcare Research and Quality, Health Care Financing 
Administration, Program Support Center, Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, Health Resources and Services 
Administration, Indian Health Service, National Institutes of Health,

is chaired by the Director, Office of Acquisition Management. All 
meetings will be held at the call of the Chair, and all activities will 
be carried out under the direction of the Chair.
    (c) The ECA, to facilitate the planning, development, and 
coordination of governmentwide and departmentwide acquisition policies 
and procedures, is to:

matters;
    (2) Review and appraise, at appropriate intervals, the overall 
effectiveness of existing policies and procedures; and
    (3) Review and appraise the impact of new major acquisition 
policies, procedures, regulations, and development on current 
acquisition policies and procedures.
    (d) The Chair will periodically issue a list of current members and 
alternates specifying the name, title, organization, address, and 
telephone number of each. The member organizations are responsible for 
apprising the Chair whenever a new member or alternate is to be 
appointed to the ECA, or an organizational change retitles the 
individual or organization.

<R04>
     Subpart 301.6--Career Development, Contracting Authority, and 
                            Responsibilities


<R05>
301.602  Contracting officers.


<R05>
301.602-3  Ratification of unauthorized commitments.

    (b) Policy. (1) The Government is not bound by agreements or 
contractual commitments made to prospective contractors by persons to 
whom contracting authority has not been delegated. However, execution of 
otherwise proper contracts made by individuals without contracting 
authority, or by contracting officers in excess of the limits of their 
delegated authority, may be later ratified. The ratification must be in 
the form of a written document clearly stating that ratification of a 
previously unauthorized act is intended and must be signed by the head 
of the contracting activity (HCA).
    (2) The HCA is the official authorized to ratify an unauthorized 
commitment (but see paragraph (b)(3) of this section).
    (3) Ratification authority for actions up to $25,000 may be 
redelegated by the HCA to the chief of the contracting office (CCO). No 
other redelegations are authorized.
    (c) Limitations. (5) The concurrence of legal counsel concerning the 
payment issue is optional.
    (e) Procedures. (1) The individual who made the unauthorized 
contractual commitment shall furnish the reviewing contracting officer 
all records and documents concerning the commitment and a complete 
written statement of facts, including, but not limited to: a statement

the request for ratification. If legal review is desirable, the HCA or 
CCO will coordinate the request for ratification with the Office of 
General Counsel, Business and Administrative Law Division.

301.603  Selection, appointment, and termination of appointment.


<R05>
301.603-1  General.

    (a) The appointment and termination of appointment of contracting 
officers shall be made by the head of the contracting activity (HCA). 
This authority is not delegable.
    (b) The contracting officer appointment document for personnel in 
the GS-1101, 1102, and 1105 series, as well as personnel in any other 
series who will obligate the Government to the expenditure of funds in 
excess of the micro-purchase threshold, shall be the Standard Form (SF)-
-1402, Certificate of Appointment. The HCA may determine an alternative 
appointment document for appointments at or below that threshold. 
Changes to appointments shall be made by issuing a new appointment 
document. Each appointment document shall be prepared and maintained in 
accordance with FAR 1.603-1 and shall state the limits of the 
individual's authority.
    (c) An individual must be certified at the appropriate level under 
the HHS Acquisition Certification Program as a prerequisite to being 
appointed as a contracting officer with authority to obligate funds in 
excess of the micro-purchase threshold (see 301.603-3(a)). The HCA will 
determine and require appropriate training for individuals appointed as 
contracting officers at lower dollar levels. An individual shall be 
appointed as a contracting officer only in instances where a valid 
organizational need can be demonstrated. Factors to be considered in 
assessing the need for

[[Page 8]]

an appointment of a contracting officer include volume of actions, 
complexity of work, and structure of the organization.


<R05>
301.603-2  Selection.

    Nominations for appointment of contracting officers shall be 
submitted to the HCA through appropriate organizational channels for 
review. The nomination package, which is usually initiated by the 
prospective contracting officer's immediate supervisor, shall normally 
include the nominee's current personal qualifications statement or job 
history, including the information required by FAR 1.603-2, a copy of 
his/her most recent performance appraisal, and a copy of the certificate 
issued under the HHS Acquisition Certification Program indicating the 
nominee's current certification level, if applicable. The HCA will 
determine the documentation required, consistent with FAR 1.603-2, when 
the resulting appointment and authority will not exceed the micro-
purchase threshold.


<R05>
301.603-3  Appointment.

    (a) Contracting officer appointments shall be made at levels 
commensurate with nominees' certification levels as follows:
    (1) Level I--Purchasing Agent--Required for all personnel in the GS-
1102 and 1105 series having signature authority for simplified 
acquisitions, including orders from GSA sources over the micro-purchase 
threshold.
    (2) Level II--Acquisition Official--Required for all personnel in 
the GS-1102 series. Sufficient for delegation of contracting officer 
authority up to $500,000.
    (3) Level III--Senior Acquisition Official--Required for all 
personnel in the GS-1102 series for delegation of contracting officer 
authority above $500,000.
    (4) Level IV--Acquisition Manager--Required for delegation of pre-
award review and approval authority as specified in subpart 304.71.
    (b) If it is essential to appoint an individual who does not fully 
meet the certification requirements of this section for the contracting 
officer authority sought, an interim appointment may be granted by the 
HCA. Interim appointments may not exceed one (1) year in total, and 
shall not be granted unless the individual can meet the certification 
requirements within one year from the date of appointment. If the 
certification requirements are not met by that date, the appointment 
will automatically terminate and cannot be renewed.


<R05>
301.603-4  Termination.

    Termination of contracting officer appointments shall be 
accomplished in accordance with FAR 1.603-4.


<R05>
301.603-70  Delegation of contracting officer responsibilities.

    (a) Contracting officer responsibilities which do not involve the 
obligation (or deobligation) of funds or result in establishing or 
modifying contractual provisions may be delegated by the contracting 
officer by means of a written memorandum which clearly delineates the 
delegation and its limits.
    (b) Contracting officers may designate individuals as ordering 
officials to make purchases or place orders under blanket purchase 
agreements, indefinite delivery contracts, or other pre-established 
mechanisms. Ordering officials, including those under NIH's DELPRO, are 
not contracting officers.
    (c) Project officers are required to complete the training specified 
in 307.170, while ordering officials and others should receive 
sufficient instruction from the contracting officer to ensure the 
appropriate exercise of the responsibilities and knowledge of their 
limitations.

<R05>
302.101  Definitions.

    Chief of the contracting office (CCO) is a mid-level management 
official in charge of a contracting office who controls and oversees the 
daily contracting operation of an Operating Division (OPDIV) or major 
component of an OPDIV. The CCO is subordinate to the head of the 
contracting activity, and is located at a management level above other 
contracting personnel, usually as a branch chief or division director.
    Head of the agency or agency head, unless otherwise specified, means 
the head of the Operating Division (OPDIV) for ACF, AHRQ, HCFA, PSC, 
CDCP, FDA, HRSA, IHS, NIH, and SAMHSA, or the Assistant Secretary for 
Management and Budget (ASMB) for the Office of the Secretary (OS).
    Head of the contracting activity (HCA) is defined in terms of 
certain organizational positions within the Office of Grants and 
Acquisition Management (OGAM), Administration for Children and Families 
(ACF), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Health Care 
Financing Administration (HCFA), Program Support Center (PSC), Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Indian 
Health Service (IHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Substance 
Abuse and Metal Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), as follows:

OGAM-OS--Director, Office of Acquisition Management
ACF--Director, Division of Acquisition Management
AHRQ--Director, Division of Contracts Management
HCFA--Director, Acquisition and Grants Group
PSC--Director, Division of Acquisition Management
CDCP--Director, Procurement and Grants Office
FDA--Director, Policy, Evaluation and Support Staff, Office of 
Facilities, Acquisition, and Central Services
HRSA--Director, Division of Grants and Procurement Management
IHS--Director, Division of Acquisitions and Grants Management
NIH--Director, Office of Acquisition Management and Policy
SAMHSA--Director, Division of Contracts Management

    In addition, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Grants and 
Acquisition Management (DASGAM) is designated as an HCA. Each HCA is 
responsible for conducting an effective and efficient acquisition 
program. Adequate controls shall be established to assure compliance 
with applicable laws, regulations, procedures, and the dictates of good 
management practices. Periodic reviews shall be conducted and evaluated 
by qualified personnel, preferably assigned to positions other than in 
the contracting office being reviewed, to determine the extent of 
adherence to prescribed policies and regulations, and to detect a need 
for guidance and/or training. The HCA shall be certified, or be 
certifiable, at Level IV of the HHS Acquisition Certification Program. 
Individuals appointed as HCA's who do not meet the Level IV requirements 
shall have one year from the date of appointment to obtain Level IV 
certification. The heads of contracting activities may redelegate their 
HCA authorities to the extent that redelegation is not prohibited by the 
terms of their respective delegations of authority, by law, by the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation, by the HHS Acquisition Regulation, or by 
other regulations. However, HCA and other contracting approvals and 
authorities shall not be redelegated below the levels specified in the 
HHS Acquisition Regulation or, in the absence of coverage in the HHS 
Acquisition Regulation, the Federal Acquisition Regulation. To ensure 
proper control of redelegated acquisition authorities, HCA's shall 
maintain a file containing successive delegations of HCA authority 
through and including the contracting officer level. Personnel delegated 
responsibility for acquisition functions must possess a level of 
experience, training, and ability commensurate with the complexity and 
magnitude of the acquisition actions involved.

<R05>
304.804-70  Contract closeout audits.

    (a) Contracting officers shall rely, to the maximum extent possible, 
on non-Federal single audits to close physically completed cost-
reimbursement contracts with colleges and universities, hospitals, non-
profit firms, and State and local governments. In addition, where 
appropriate, a sample of these contractors may be selected for audit, in 
accordance with the decision-making process set forth in the following 
paragraph (b).
    (b) Contracting officers shall request contract closeout audits on 
physically completed, cost-reimbursement, for-profit contracts in 
accordance with the following:
    (1) Decisions on: The need for and allocation of contract audit 
resources and services; the selection of contracts or contractors to be 
audited; the identification of the audit agency to perform the audit; 
and the type or scope of closeout audit to be conducted, shall be made 
by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and Office of Grants and 
Acquisition Management, in consultation with the Department's Contract 
Audit Users Work Group. These decisions shall be based upon the needs of 
the customer, risk analysis, return on investment, and the availability 
of audit resources. When an audit is warranted prior to closing a 
contract, the contracting officer shall submit the audit request to the 
OIG's Office of Audit via the appropriate OPDIV representative on the 
Contract Audit Users Work Group.
    (2) Except where a contracting officer suspects misrepresentation or 
fraud, contract closeout field audits shall not be requested if the cost 
of performance is likely to exceed the potential cost recovery. 
Contracts that are not selected for a field audit may be closed

[[Page 12]]

on the basis of a desk review, subject to any later on-site audit 
findings. The release executed by the contractor shall contain the 
following statement:

    The Contractor agrees, pursuant to the clause in this contract 
entitled ``Allowable Cost'' or ``Allowable Cost and Fixed Fee'' (as 
appropriate), that the amount of any sustained audit exceptions 
resulting from any audit made after final payment shall be refunded to 
the Government.''


<R04>
 Subpart 304.70--Acquisition Instrument Identification Numbering System


<R05>
304.7000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes policy and procedures for assigning 
identifying numbers to contracts and related instruments, including 
solicitation documents, purchase orders, and delivery orders. The HCA 
(not delegable) is responsible for establishing the numbering system 
within the OPDIV.


<R05>
304.7001  Numbering acquisitions.

    (a) Acquisitions which require numbering. The following acquisitions 
shall be numbered in accordance with the system prescribed in paragraphs 
(b) and (c) of this section:
    (1) Contracts, including letter contracts and task orders under 
basic ordering agreements, which involve the payment of $2,500 or more 
for the acquisition of personal property or nonpersonal services. (The 
number assigned to a letter contract shall be assigned to the 
superseding definitized contract).
    (2) Contracts which involve the payment of $2,000 or more for 
construction (including renovation or alteration).
    (3) Contracts which involve more than one payment regardless of 
amount.
    (4) Requests for proposals and invitations for bids.
    (5) Requests for quotations.
    (6) Basic ordering agreements.
    (b) Numbering system for contracts. All contracts which require 
numbering (paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section) shall be 
assigned a number consisting of the following:
    (1) The three digit identification code assigned to the contracting 
office by the Office of Grants and Acquisition Management (OGAM).
    (2) A two digit fiscal year designation; and
    (3) A four digit serial number. For example, the initial contract 
executed by the Office of Acquisition Management, OS, for fiscal year 
1996 would be numbered 100-96-0001. While it is required that a 
different series of four digit serial numbers be used for each fiscal 
year, serial numbers assigned need not be sequential.
    (c) Numbering system for other acquisitions. The HCA is responsible 
for developing a numbering system for the acquisitions other than 
contracts listed in paragraphs, (a)(4) through (a)(6) of this section, 
and any other types of acquisitions that may be used.
    (d) Assignment of identification codes. Each contracting office of 
the Department shall be assigned a three digit identification code by 
the OGAM. Requests for the assignment of codes for newly established 
contracting offices shall be submitted by the headquarters acquisition 
staff office of the contracting activity to the OGAM. A listing of the 
contracting office identification codes currently in use is contained in 
the Enhanced Departmental Contracts Information System Manual.


<R04>
     Subpart 304.71--Review and Approval of Proposed Contract Awards


<R05>
304.7100  Policy.

    This subpart requires each HCA (not delegable) to establish review 
and approval procedures for proposed contracts actions to ensure that:
    (a) Contract awards are in conformance with law, established 
policies and procedures, and sound business practices;
    (b) Contractual documents properly reflect the mutual understanding 
of the parties; and
    (c) The contracting officer is informed of deficiencies and items of 
questionable acceptability, and corrective action is taken.

[[Page 13]]


<R05>
304.7101  Procedures.

    (a) All contractual documents, regardless of dollar value, are to be 
reviewed by the contracting officer prior to award.
    (b) The HCA is responsible for establishing review and approval 
procedures and designating acquisition officials to serve as reviewers. 
Each HCA is responsible for determining the criterion (criteria) to be 
used in determining which contracts are to be reviewed, and that a 
sampling of proposed contracts not included in the ``to be reviewed'' 
group are reviewed and approved.
    (c) Officials assigned responsibility for review and approval of 
contract actions must possess qualifications in the field of acquisition 
commensurate with the level of review performed, and, at a minimum, 
possess those acquisition skills expected of a contracting officer. 
However, if any official is to serve as the contracting officer and sign 
the contractual document, the review and approval function shall be 
performed by an appropriate official at least one level above.

    (c) Limitations. An ``approval package'' must be prepared by the 
contracting officer and staffed through departmental acquisition 
channels to the Secretary. The package shall include a determination and 
findings for the Secretary to sign that contains all pertinent 
information to support justification for exercising the exemption to 
competition, and a letter for the Secretary to sign notifying Congress 
of the determination to award a contract under the authority of 41 
U.S.C. 253(c)(7).


<R05>
306.303  Justifications.


<R05>
306.303-1  Requirements.

    (b) Preliminary arrangements or agreements with the proposed 
contractor shall have no effect on the rationale used to support an 
acquisition for other than full and open competition.
    (f) When a program office desires to obtain certain goods or 
services by contract without full and open competition, it shall, at the 
time of forwarding the requisition or request for contract, furnish the 
contracting office a justification explaining why full and open 
competition is not feasible. All justifications shall be initially 
reviewed by the contracting officer.
    (1) Justifications in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold 
shall be in the form of a separate, self-contained document, prepared in 
accordance with FAR 6.303 and 306.303, and called a ``JOFOC'' 
(Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition). Justifications 
at or below the simplified acquisition threshold may be in the form of a 
paragraph or paragraphs contained in the requisition or request for 
contract.
    (2) Justifications, whether over or under the simplified acquisition 
threshold, shall fully describe what is to be acquired, offer reasons 
which go beyond inconvenience, and explain why it is not feasible to 
obtain competition. The justifications shall be supported by verifiable 
facts rather than mere opinions. Documentation in the justification 
should be sufficient to permit an individual with technical competence 
in the area to follow the rationale.

                   Subpart 307.1--Acquisition Planning


<R05>
307.104  General procedures.

    (d) Each contracting activity shall prepare an Annual Acquisition 
Plan

[[Page 17]]

(AAP). The AAP is a macro plan, containing a list of anticipated 
contract actions over the simplified acquisition threshold and their 
associated funding, as well as the aggregate planned dollars for 
simplified acquisitions by quarter, developed for each fiscal year. The 
AAP shall conform to reasonable budget expectations and shall be 
reviewed at least quarterly and modified as appropriate. The chief of 
the contracting office (CCO) shall obtain this information from the 
program planning/budget office of the contracting activity and use the 
AAP to provide necessary reports and monitor the workload of the 
contracting office. For contract actions, the plan shall contain, at a 
minimum:
    (1) A brief description (descriptive title, perhaps one or two 
sentences if necessary);
    (2) Estimated award amount;
    (3) Requested award date;
    (4) Name and phone number of contact person (usually the project 
officer);
    (5) Other information required for OPDIV needs.
    (e) Once the AAP is obtained, the contracting officer/contract 
specialist shall initiate discussions with the assigned project officer 
for each planned negotiated acquisition over $100,000 except for:
    (1) Acquisitions made under interagency agreements, and
    (2) Contract modifications which exercise options, make changes 
authorized by the Changes clause, or add funds to an incrementally 
funded contract. (The HCA may prescribe procedures for contract actions 
not covered by this subpart.)
    (f) The purpose of the discussions between the contracting and 
project officers is to develop an individual acquisition planning 
schedule and to address the things that will need to be covered in the 
request for contract (RFC), including clearances, acquisition strategy, 
sources, etc. The project officer must either have a statement of work 
(SOW) ready at this time or must discuss in more detail the nature of 
the services/supplies that will be required.
    (g) Standard lead-times for processing various types of acquisitions 
and deadlines for submission of acceptable RFCs (that is, RFCs which 
include all required elements such as clearances, funding documents, and 
an acceptable SOW) for award in a given fiscal year shall be established 
by the HCA or designee not lower than the CCO.
    (h) The outcome of the discussions referenced in paragraph (f) of 
this section between the project officer and the contracting officer/
contracting specialist will be an agreement concerning the dates of 
significant transaction-specific acquisition milestones, including the 
date of submission of the RFC to the contracting officer. This milestone 
schedule document will be prepared with those dates and will be signed 
by the project officer and the contracting officer. The milestones 
cannot be revised except by mutual agreement of these same individuals. 
If the planning schedule indicates the need to obtain approval of a 
Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition, the CCO must 
sign the milestone agreement. This document shall be retained in the 
contract file. All other considerations that will affect the acquisition 
(technical, business, management) shall be addressed in the RFC (see 
307.71).


<R05>
307.105  Contents of written acquisition plans.

    The written acquisition plan required by FAR 7.105 must be contained 
in the request for contract, as specified in subpart 307.71, and is the 
final product of the planning process.


<R05>
307.170  Program training requirements.

    (i) All program personnel selected to serve as project officers for 
HHS contracts shall have successfully completed either the Department's 
appropriate ``Basic Project Officer'' course, or an equivalent course 
(see paragraph (c) of this section).
    (b) At least fifty percent of the HHS program personnel performing 
the function of technical proposal evaluator on a technical evaluation 
team or panel for any competitively solicited HHS contract shall have 
successfully completed the appropriate ``Basic Project Officer'' course, 
or an equivalent course (see paragraph (c) of this section). This 
requirement applies to

[[Page 18]]

the initial technical proposal evaluation and any subsequent technical 
evaluations that may be required.
    (c) Determination of course equivalency shall be made by the HCA 
(not delegable) of the cognizant contracting activity. The contracting 
officer is responsible for ensuring that the project officer and 
technical proposal evaluators have successfully completed the required 
training discussed in 307.170-2.


<R05>
307.170-1  Policy exceptions.

    In the event there is an urgent requirement for a specific 
individual to serve as a project officer and that individual has not 
successfully completed the prerequisite training course, the HCA (not 
delegable) may waive the training requirement and authorize the 
individual to perform the project duties, provided that:
    (a) The individual first meets with the cognizant contracting 
officer to review the DHHS Project Officers' Contracting Handbook,'' and 
to discuss the important aspects of the contracting--program office 
relationship as appropriate to the circumstances; and
    (b) The individual attends the next scheduled and appropriate 
``Basic Project Officer'' course.


<R05>
307.170-2  Training course prerequisites.

    (a) Project officers. (1) Newly appointed project officers, and 
project officers with less than three years experience and no previous 
related training, are required to take the appropriate ``Basic Project 
Officer'' course. (The grade level for project officers attending the 
course should be GS-7 and above.) All project officers are encouraged to 
take the appropriate ``Writing Statements of Work'' course.
    (2) Project officers with more than three years experience, and 
project officers with less than three years experience who have 
successfully completed the appropriate basic course, are qualified (and 
encouraged) to take the ``Advanced Project Officer'' course.
    (3) Additional information on prerequisites for attendance of these 
courses may be found in the ``DHHS Acquisition Training and 
Certification Program Handbook.''
    (b) Technical proposal evaluators. Technical proposal evaluators, 
regardless of experience, are required to take the appropriate ``Basic 
Project Officer'' course or its equivalent. Upon successful completion 
of the basic course, it is recommended that they take the appropriate 
``Advanced Project Officer'' course. Peer and objective reviewers are 
excluded from these requirements.


<R04>
         Subpart 307.3--Contractor Versus Government Performance


<R05>
307.302  General.

    (a) General Administration Manual (GAM) Chapter 18-10, Commercial-
Industrial Activities of the Department of Health and Human Services 
Providing Products or Services for Government Use, assigns 
responsibilities for making method-of-performance decisions (contract 
vs. in-house performance) to various management levels within the 
Department depending on the dollar amount of capital investment or 
annual operating costs. It also requires that each operating division 
(OPDIV) and staff division (STAFFDIV) designate a ``Commercial-
Industrial Control Officer'' (CICO) to be responsible for ensuring 
compliance with the requirements of the Chapter.


<R05>
307.303  Determining availability of private commercial sources.

    In accordance with the provisions of GAM Chapter 18-10, OPDIVs and 
STAFFDIVs must prepare and maintain a complete inventory of all 
individual commercial or industrial activities. They must also conduct 
periodic reviews of each activity and contract in the inventory to 
determine if the existing performance, in-house or by contract, 
continues to be in accordance with the policy guidelines of GAM Chapter 
18-10.


<R05>
307.304  Procedures.

    Contracting officers shall ensure that no acquisition action 
involving a commercial-industrial activity is initiated unless it is in 
compliance with the requirements of GAM Chapter 18-10. The contracting 
officer must check each request for contract expected to result in a 
contract in excess of $100,000 to ensure that it contains a statement as 
to

[[Page 19]]

whether the proposed contract is or is not subject to review under GAM 
Chapter 18-10 requirements. If the contracting officer has any questions 
regarding the determination of applicability or nonapplicability, or if 
the required statement is missing, the program office submitting the 
request for contract should be contacted and the situation rectified. If 
the issue cannot be resolved with the program office, the contracting 
office shall refer the matter to the CICO for a final determination. The 
HCA is responsible for ensuring that contracting activities are in full 
compliance with FAR Subpart 7.3.


<R05>
307.307  Appeals.

    The review and appeals procedure discussed in FAR 7.307 are 
addressed in GAM Chapter 18-10.


<R04>
     Subpart 307.70--Considerations in Selecting an Award Instrument


<R05>
307.7000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart provides guidance on the appropriate selection of award 
instruments consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6301-6308. This subpart explains 
the use of the contract as the award instrument for acquisition 
relationships, and the grant or cooperative agreement as the instrument 
for assistance relationships. This subpart provides guidance for 
determining whether to use the acquisition or assistance process to 
fulfill program needs.


<R05>
307.7001  Distinction between acquisition and assistance.

    (a) 31 U.S.C. 6301-6308 requires the use of contracts to acquire 
property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Government and 
grants or cooperative agreements to transfer money, property, services, 
or anything of value to recipients to accomplish a public purpose of 
support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute.
    (b) A contract is to be used as the legal instrument to reflect a 
relationship between the Federal Government and a recipient whenever:
    (1) The principal purpose of the instrument is the acquisition, by 
purchase, lease, or barter, of property or services for the direct 
benefit or use of the Federal Government; or
    (2) The Department determines in a specific instance that the use of 
a type of contract is appropriate. That is, it is determined in a 
certain situation that specific needs can be satisfied best by using the 
acquisition process. However, this authority does not permit 
circumventing the criteria for use of acquisition or assistance 
instruments. Use of this authority is restricted to extraordinary 
circumstances and only with the prior approval of the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Grants and Acquisition Management (DASGAM).
    (c) A grant or cooperative agreement is to be used as the legal 
instrument to reflect a relationship between the Federal Government and 
a recipient whenever the principal purpose of the relationship is the 
transfer of money, property, services, or anything of value to the 
recipient to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation 
authorized by Federal statute.
    (1) A grant is the legal instrument to be used when no substantial 
involvement is anticipated between the Department and the recipient 
during performance of the contemplated activity.
    (2) A cooperative agreement is the legal instrument to be used when 
substantial involvement is anticipated between the Department and the 
recipient during performance of the contemplated activity.
    (d) As a general rule, contracts are to be used for the following 
purposes:
    (1) Evaluation (including research of an evaluative nature) of the 
performance of Government programs or projects or grantee activity 
initiated by the funding agency for its direct benefit or use.
    (2) Technical assistance rendered to the Government, or on behalf of 
the Government, to any third party, including those receiving grants or 
cooperative agreements.
    (3) Surveys, studies, and research which provide specific 
information desired by the Government for its direct activities, or for 
dissemination to the public.
    (4) Consulting services or professional services of all kinds if 
provided to the Government or, on behalf of the Government, to any third 
party.

[[Page 20]]

    (5) Training projects where the Government selects the individuals 
or specific groups whose members are to be trained or specifies the 
content of the curriculum (not applicable to fellowship awards.)
    (6) Planning for Government use.
    (7) Production of publications or audiovisual materials required 
primarily for the conduct of the direct operations of the Government.
    (8) Design or development of items for Government use or pursuant to 
agency definition or specifications.
    (9) Conferences conducted on behalf of the Government.
    (10) Generation of management information or other data for 
Government use.


<R05>
307.7002  Procedures.

    (a) OPDIV program officials should use existing budget and program 
planning procedures to propose new activities and major changes in 
ongoing programs. It is the responsibility of these program officials to 
meet with the HCA and the principal grants management official, or their 
designees, to distinguish the relationships and determine whether award 
is to be made through the acquisition process or assistance process. 
This determination should be made prior to the time when the annual 
acquisition plan is reviewed and approved so that the plan will reflect 
all known proposed contract actions. The cognizant contracting officer 
will confirm the appropriateness of the use of the contract instrument 
when reviewing the request for contract.
    (b) Shifts from one award instrument to another must be fully 
documented in the appropriate files to show a fundamental change in 
program purpose that unequivocally justifies the rationale for the 
shift.
    (c) OPDIVs must ensure that the choice of instrument is determined 
in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 6301-6308 and applicable departmental 
policies. If, however, there are major individual transactions or 
programs which contain elements of both acquisition and assistance in 
such a way that they cannot be characterized as having a principal 
purpose of one or the other, guidance should be obtained from the 
DASGAM, through normal channels, before proceeding with a determination.
    (d) Any public notice, program announcement, solicitation, or 
request for applications or proposals must indicate whether the intended 
relationship will be one of acquisition or assistance and specify the 
award instrument to be used.


<R04>
                  Subpart 307.71--Requests for Contract


<R05>
307.7100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes the format and contents of the request for 
contract (RFC) and provides procedures for its preparation and 
submission.


<R05>
307.7101  General.

    The program office's preparation of the RFC and submission to the 
contracting office completes the presolicitation phase of the 
acquisition planning process and commences the solicitation phase. The 
RFC is the formal document which initiates the preparation of the 
solicitation by the contracting office and sets the acquisition process 
in motion. It is the result of the planning by the project officer and 
contracting officer and contains much of the pertinent information 
necessary for the development of a sound, comprehensive solicitation.


<R05>
307.7102  Procedures.

    The program office should submit the RFC to the contracting office 
no later than the date agreed to by the contracting officer and the 
project officer in the milestone schedule (see 307.104(h)), unless a 
revised due date has been established by mutual agreement.


<R05>
307.7103  Responsibilities.

    (a) It is the responsibility of the project officer to prepare the 
RFC so that it complies with the requirements of this subpart and any 
OPDIV guidance issued in accordance with this subpart.
    (b) Prior to the submission of the RFC to the contracting office, 
the head of the program office sponsoring the project shall review the 
RFC to ensure

[[Page 21]]

that all required information is provided in the prescribed format, and 
a technical review of the statement of work has been made. The level and 
extent of the technical review is to be commensurate with the estimated 
cost, importance, and complexity of the proposed acquisition, and must 
be thorough enough to ensure that vague and ambiguous language is 
eliminated, the statement of work is structured by phases or tasks, if 
appropriate, and methods are available for assessing the contractor's 
technical, cost, and delivery performance.


<R05>
307.7104  Transmittal.

    The RFC must be conveyed to the contracting office by use of a 
covering memorandum or other form of transmittal. The transmittal 
document must be signed by the head of the sponsoring program office and 
include both a statement attesting to the conclusiveness of the review 
described in 307.7103(b) and a list identifying all attachments to the 
RFC.


<R05>
307.7105  Format and content.

    The Department does not prescribe a standard format for the RFC. A 
format similar to what is in this section is recommended. However, any 
document or group of documents will be acceptable as an RFC as long as 
all of the required information (paragraph (a) of this section), and as 
much of the optional information (paragraph (b) of this section) as is 
relevant, is included.
    (a) The RFC must include:
    (1) Purpose of the contract. A brief, general description of the 
requirement, including the citation of the legislation which authorizes 
the program or project, and a statement as to the intended purpose/use 
of the proposed contract.
    (2) Period of performance. The number of months (or other time 
period) required for total performance and, if applicable, for each 
phase of work indicated in the statement of work, as well as the 
proposed starting date.
    (3) Estimated cost and funds citation. An estimate of the total cost 
of the proposed contract and, if applicable, the estimate for each phase 
indicated in the statement of work. The project officer must provide a 
cost breakdown of all contributing cost factors, an estimate of the 
technical staff hours, direct material, subcontracting, travel, etc., 
and may consult with contracting and cost advisory personnel in 
developing this information. This section must include the certification 
of funds availability for the proposed acquisition, along with the 
appropriation and accounting information citations. When funds for the 
proposed acquisition are not currently available for obligation but are 
anticipated, a statement of intent to commit funds from the financial 
management officer shall be included in lieu of the certification of 
funds availability. (Contracts cannot be awarded unless funds are 
available, but see FAR 32.703-2).
    (4) Specification, purchase description, or statement or work. A 
description of the work to be performed that may be in the form of a 
specification, purchase description, or statement of work. Guidance 
concerning the statement of work and its contents is contained in 
307.7106. Use of the specification is primarily limited to supply or 
service contracts where the material end item or service to be delivered 
is well defined by the Government. To the maximum extent possible, 
requirements should be defined as performance-based statements of work 
that focus on outcomes or results. If the RFC for a service contract is 
not utilizing a performance-based statement of work, with associated 
measures and a quality surveillance plan, the rationale for this 
determination must be documented. If a performance-based service 
contract is utilized, the RFC must detail the performance standards that 
must be met, the quality surveillance plan that will be implemented and 
the performance incentives to be used, if applicable.
    (5) Schedule of deliverables/reporting requirements. A description 
of what is to be delivered, including, if applicable, technical and 
financial progress reports and any final report, and the required date 
of delivery for each deliverable. Reporting requirements should be 
tailored to the instant acquisition and should not be unnecessarily 
extensive or detailed. All delivery and reporting requirements shall 
include the quantities, the place of delivery, and time of delivery.

[[Page 22]]

    (6) Sources for solicitation. A list of known potential sources by 
name, size, type of ownership, and mailing address. The project officer 
is encouraged to use trade and professional journals and publications 
and conduct a thorough market research to identify new prospective 
sources to supplement the list of known sources. Efforts to identify 
set-aside possibilities, e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, and small business, and 
efforts to identify sources such as small disadvantaged and women-owned 
small businesses must be documented.
    (7) Project officer and alternate. The project officer's name, 
title, organization, mailing address, and telephone number, along with 
the same data for the project officer's alternate, and a statement that 
these individuals have completed the Department's project officer 
training course (see 307.l70)
    (b) The RFC must include, if applicable to the acquisition:
    (1) Background and need. The background, history, and necessity for 
the proposed contract. This section is to include prior, present, and 
planned efforts by the program office in the same or related areas, and 
a description of efforts by other departmental activities and Federal 
agencies in the same or related program areas, if known. In addition, 
specific project information, such as the relevance or contribution to 
overall program objectives, reasons for the need, priority, and project 
overlap are to be provided.
    (2) Reference materials. A list, by title and description, of study 
reports, plans, drawings, and other data to be made available to 
prospective offerors for use in preparation of proposals and/or the 
contractor for use in performance of the contract. The project officer 
must indicate whether this material is currently available or when it 
will be available, and how it may be accessed by potential offerors.
    (3) Technical evaluation criteria and instructions. Technical 
evaluation criteria, which have been developed based on the requirements 
of the specific project, and any instructions and information which will 
assist in the preparation of prospective offerors' technical proposals. 
Evaluation factors may include understanding of the problem, technical 
approach, experience, personnel, facilities, etc. Criteria areas 
discussed in the statement of work and the relative order of importance 
or weights assigned to each of these areas for technical evaluation 
purposes must be identified.
    (4) Special program clearances or approvals. Any required clearance 
or approval. The following special program clearances or approvals 
should be reviewed for applicability to each acquisition. The ones which 
are applicable should be addressed during the planning discussions 
between the project officer and contracting officer/contract specialist 
(see 307.104(f)) and immediate action should be initiated by the project 
officer to obtain the necessary clearances or approvals. Comprehensive 
checklists of these and any OPDIV special approvals, clearances, and 
requirements shall be provided for reference purposes to program offices 
by the servicing contracting activity. If the approval or clearance has 
been requested and is being processed at the time of RFC submission, a 
footnote to this effect, including all pertinent details, must be 
included in this section.
    (i) Commercial activities. (OMB Circular No. A-76). A request for 
contract (RFC) must contain a statement as to whether the proposed 
solicitation is or is not to be used as part of an OMB Circular No. A-76 
cost comparison. (See General Administration Manual (GAM) Chapter 18-10; 
FAR subpart 7.3, subpart 307.3; OMB Circular No. A-76.)
    (ii) Printing. The acquisition of printing and high volume 
duplicating by contract is prohibited unless it is authorized by the 
Joint Committee on Printing of the U.S. Congress. Procedures to be 
followed are contained in the ``Government Printing and Binding 
Regulations'' and the HHS Printing Management Manual and FAR subpart 
8.8.
    (iii) Paperwork Reduction Act. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995, a Federal agency shall not collect information or sponsor the 
collection of information from ten or more persons (other than Federal 
employees acting within the scope of their employment) unless, in 
advance, the agency has submitted a request for Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) review, to the OMB, and the OMB has approved the

[[Page 23]]

proposed collection of information. Procedures for the approval may be 
obtained by contacting the OPDIV reports clearance officer. (See 5 CFR 
part 1320).
    (iv) Publications. All projects that will result in contracts which 
include publications development (print products, electronic bulletin 
boards, posting on the internet) require review and approval by the 
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (OASPA). Form HHS-
615, Publication Planning and Clearance Request, must be forwarded to 
OASPA through the OPDIV public affairs officer. Publications are defined 
in Chapter 5-00-15 of the Public Affairs Management Manual.
    (v) Public affairs services. Projects for the acquisition of public 
affairs services in excess of $5,000 must be submitted to the Office of 
the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (OASPA) for review and 
approval on Form HHS-524, Request for Public Affairs Services Contract.
    (vi) Audiovisual. All projects which will result in contracts which 
include audiovisuals, regardless of the audio, video, or audiovisual 
medium employed, require review and approval by the Office of the 
Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (OASPA). Form HHS-524A, 
Publication Planning and Clearance Request, must be forwarded to OASPA 
through the OPDIV public affairs officer. Audiovisuals are defined in 
chapter 6-00-15 of the Public Affairs Management Manual.
    (vii) Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a). Whenever the Department contracts 
for the design, development, operation, or maintenance of a system of 
records on individuals on behalf of the Department to accomplish a 
departmental function, the Privacy Act is applicable. The program 
official, after consultation with the activity's Privacy Act Coordinator 
and the Office of General Counsel, as necessary, shall include a 
statement in the request for contract as to the applicability of the 
Act. Whenever an acquisition is subject to the Act, the program official 
prepares a ``system notice'' and has it published in the Federal 
Register. (See HHS Privacy Act regulation, 45 CFR part 5b; FAR subpart 
24.1 and subpart 324.1.)
    (viii) Foreign research. All foreign research contract projects to 
be conducted in a foreign country and financed by HHS funds (U.S. 
dollars) must have clearance by the Department of State with respect to 
consistency with foreign policy objectives. This clearance should be 
obtained prior to negotiation. Procedures for obtaining this clearance 
are set forth in the HHS General Administration Manual, Chapter 20-60.
    (5) Identification and disposition of data. Identification of the 
data expected to be generated by the acquisition and an indication of 
whether the data are to be delivered to the Department or to be retained 
by the contractor is required. The project officer must also include 
information relative to the use, maintenance, disclosure, and 
disposition of data. The project officer must include a statement as to 
whether or not another acquisition, based upon the data generated by the 
proposed acquisition, is anticipated.
    (6) Government property. If known, the type of Government property, 
individual items, and quantities of Government property to be furnished 
to, or allowed to be acquired by, the resultant contractor should be 
indicated. The project officer must specify when the Government property 
is to be made available.
    (7) Special terms and conditions. Any suggested special terms and 
conditions not already covered in the statement of work or the 
applicable contract general provisions is required.
    (8) Justification for other than full and open competition. If the 
proposed acquisition is to be awarded using other than full and open 
competition, a justification prepared in accordance with FAR subpart 6.3 
and subpart 306.3 is required.


<R05>
307.7106  Statement of work.

    (a) General. A statement of work (SOW) differs from a specification 
and purchase description primarily in that it describes work or services 
to be performed in reaching an end result rather than a detailed, well 
defined description or specification of the end product. The SOW may 
enumerate or describe the methods (statistical, clinical, laboratory, 
etc.) that will be used.

[[Page 24]]

However, it is preferable for the offeror to propose the method of 
performing the work. The SOW should specify the desired results, 
functions, or end items without telling the offeror what has to be done 
to accomplish those results unless the method of performance is critical 
or required for the successful performance of the contract. The SOW 
should be clear and concise and must completely define the 
responsibilities of the Government and the contractor. The SOW should be 
worded so as to make more than one interpretation virtually impossible 
because it has to be read and interpreted by persons of varied 
backgrounds, such as attorneys, contracting personnel, cost estimators, 
accountants, scientists, educators, functional specialists, etc. The SOW 
must clearly define the obligations of both the contractor and the 
Government so as to protect the interests of both. Ambiguous statements 
of work can create unsatisfactory performance, delays, and disputes, and 
can result in higher costs.
    (b) Term (level of effort) vs. completion work statement. Careful 
distinctions must be drawn between term (level of effort) SOWs, which 
essentially require the furnishing of technical effort and which may 
include a report thereof, and completion type work statements, which 
require development of tangible items designed to meet specific 
performance and/or design characteristics. (See FAR 16.306(d) for 
distinction).
    (1) Term (or level of effort). A term or level of effort type SOW is 
appropriate for research where one seeks to discover the feasibility of 
later development, or to gather general information. A term or level of 
effort type SOW may only specify that some number of labor-hours be 
expended on a particular course of research, or that a certain number of 
tests be run, without reference to any intended conclusion.
    (2) Completion. A completion type SOW is appropriate to development 
work where the feasibility of producing an end item is already known. A 
completion type SOW may describe what is to be achieved through the 
contracted effort, such as development of new methods, new end items, or 
other tangible results.
    (c) Phasing. Individual research, development, or demonstration 
projects frequently lie well beyond the present state of the art and 
entail procedures and techniques of great complexity and difficulty. 
Under these circumstances, a contractor, no matter how carefully 
selected, may be unable to deliver the desired result. Moreover, the job 
of evaluating the contractor's progress is often difficult. Such a 
contract is frequently phased and often divided into stages of 
accomplishment, each of which must be completed and approved before the 
contractor may proceed to the next. Phasing makes it necessary to 
develop methods and controls, including reporting requirements for each 
phase of the contract and criteria for evaluation of the report 
submitted, that will provide, at the earliest possible time, appropriate 
data for making decisions relative to future phases. A phased contract 
may include stages of accomplishment such as research, development, and 
demonstration. Within each phase, there may be a number of tasks which 
should be included in the SOW. When phases of work can be identified, 
the SOW will provide for phasing and the request for proposals will 
require the submission of proposed costs by phases. The resultant 
contract will reflect costs by phases, require the contractor to 
identify incurred costs by phases, establish delivery schedules by 
phase, and require the written acceptance of each phase. The provisions 
of the Limitation of Cost clause shall apply to the estimated cost of 
each phase. Contractors shall not be allowed to incur costs for phases 
which are dependent upon successful completion of earlier phases until 
written acceptance of the prior work is obtained from the contracting 
officer.
    (d) Elements of the SOW. The elements of the SOW will vary with the 
objective, complexity, size, and nature of the acquisition. In general, 
it should cover the following matters as appropriate.
    (1) A general description of the required objectives and desired 
results. Initially, a broad, nontechnical statement of the nature of the 
work to be performed. This should summarize the actions to be performed 
by the contractor and the results that the Government expects.

[[Page 25]]

    (2) Background information helpful to a clear understanding of the 
requirements and how they evolved. Include a brief historical summary as 
appropriate and the relationship to overall program objectives.
    (3) A detailed description of the technical requirements. A 
comprehensive description of the work to be performed to provide 
whatever details are necessary for prospective offerors to submit 
meaningful proposals.
    (4) Subordinate tasks or types of work. A listing of the various 
tasks or types of work (it may be desirable in some cases to indicate 
that this is not all-inclusive). The degree of task breakout is directly 
dependent on the size and complexity of the work to be performed and the 
logical groupings. A single cohesive task should not be broken out 
merely to conform to a format. Indicate whether the tasks are sequential 
or concurrent for offeror planning purposes.
    (5) Reference material. All reference material to be used in the 
conduct of the project that tells how the work is to be carried out must 
be identified. Applicability should be explained, and a statement made 
as to where the material can be obtained.
    (6) Level of effort. When a level of effort is required, the number 
and type of personnel required should be stated. If known, the type and 
degree of expertise should be specified.
    (7) Special requirements. (as applicable). An unusual or special 
contractual requirement, which would impact on contract performance, 
should be included as a separate section.
    (8) Deliverables reporting requirements. All deliverables and/or 
reports must be clearly and completely described.


<R05>
307.7107  Review.

    Upon receipt of the RFC, the contracting officer shall review its 
contents to ensure that all pertinent information has been provided by 
the program office and that it includes an acceptable SOW. If pertinent 
information is missing or the SOW is inadequate, the contracting officer 
shall obtain or clarify the information as soon as possible so that the 
acquisition schedule can be met. If the program office delays furnishing 
the information or clarification, the contracting officer should notify 
the head of the sponsoring program office, in writing, of the possible 
slippage in the acquisition schedule and the need for an expeditious 
remedy. The contracting officer should also notify the chief of the 
contracting office. A program office's or project officer's continued 
failure to adhere to agreed on milestones should also be reported to the 
head of the contracting activity.

<R05>
309.403  Definitions.

    Acquiring agency's head or designee, as used in the FAR, shall mean, 
unless otherwise stated in this subpart, the head of the contracting 
activity. Acting in the capacity of the acquiring agency's head, the 
head of the contracting activity may make the required justifications or 
determinations, and take the necessary actions, specified in FAR 9.405, 
9.406 and 9.407 for his or her respective activity, but only after 
obtaining the written approval of the debarring or suspending official, 
as the case may be.
    Debarring official means the Assistant Secretary for Management and 
Budget, or his/her designee.

[[Page 26]]

    Initiating official means either the contracting officer, the head 
of the contracting activity, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Grants 
and Acquisition Management, or the Inspector General.
    Suspending official means the Assistant Secretary for Management and 
Budget, or his/her designee.


<R05>
309.404  List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement 
Programs.

    (c) The Office of Grants and Acquisition Management (OGAM) shall 
perform the actions required by FAR 9.404(c).
    (4) OGAM shall maintain all documentation submitted by the 
initiating official recommending the debarment or suspension action and 
all correspondence and other pertinent documentation generated during 
the OGAM review.


<R05>
309.405  Effect of listing.

    (a) The head of the contracting activity (HCA) (not delegable) may, 
with the written concurrence of the debarring or suspending official, 
make the determinations referenced in FAR 9.405(a), regarding contracts 
for their respective activities.
    (1) If a contracting officer considers it necessary to award a 
contract, or consent to a subcontract with a debarred or suspended 
contractor, the contracting officer shall prepare a determination, 
including all pertinent documentation, and submit it through acquisition 
channels to the head of the contracting activity. The documentation must 
include the date by which approval is required and a compelling reason 
for the proposed action. Some examples of circumstances that may 
constitute a compelling reason for the award to, or consent to a 
subcontract with, a debarred or suspended contractor include:
    (i) The property or services to be acquired are available only from 
the listed contractor;
    (ii) The urgency of the requirement dictates that the Department 
deal with the listed contractor; or
    (iii) There are other compelling reasons which require business 
dealings with the listed contractor.
    (2) If the HCA decides to approve the requested action, he/she shall 
request the concurrence of the debarring or suspending official and, if 
given, shall inform the contracting officer in writing of the decision 
within the required time period.


<R05>
309.406  Debarment.


<R05>
309.406-3  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. Whenever an apparent cause for 
debarment becomes known to an initiating official, that person shall 
prepare a report incorporating the information required by 309.470-2, if 
known, and forward it through appropriate channels with a written 
recommendation, to the debarring official. Contracting officers shall 
forward their reports in accordance with 309.470-1. The debarring 
official shall initiate an investigation through such means as he/she 
deems appropriate.
    (b) Decisionmaking process. The debarring official shall review the 
results of the investigation, if any, and make a written determination 
whether or not debarment procedures are to be commenced. A copy of the 
determination shall be promptly sent through appropriate channels to the 
initiating official, and the contracting officer, if necessary. If the 
debarring official determines to commence debarment procedures, he/she 
shall, after consultation with the Office of the General Counsel, notify 
the contractor in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c). If the proposed action 
is not based on a conviction or judgement and the contractor's 
submission in response to the notice raises a genuine dispute over facts 
material to the proposed debarment, the debarring official shall arrange 
for fact-finding hearings and take the necessary action specified in FAR 
9.406-3(b)(2). The debarring official shall also ensure that written 
findings of facts are prepared, and shall base the debarment decisions 
on the facts as found, after considering information and argument 
submitted by the contractor and any other information in the 
administrative record. The Office of the General Counsel shall represent 
the Department at any fact-

[[Page 27]]

finding hearing and may present witnesses for HHS and question any 
witnesses presented by the contractor.


<R05>
309.407  Suspension.


<R05>
309.407-3  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. Whenever an apparent cause for 
suspension becomes known to an initiating official, that person shall 
prepare a report incorporating the information required by 309.470-2, if 
known, and forward it through appropriate channels, with a written 
recommendation, to the suspending official. Contracting officers shall 
forward their reports in accordance with 309.470-1. The suspending 
official shall initiate an investigation through such means as he/she 
deems appropriate.
    (b) Decisionmaking process. The suspending official shall review the 
results of the investigation, if any, and make a written determination 
whether or not suspension should be imposed. A copy of this 
determination shall be promptly sent through appropriate channels to the 
initiating official and the contracting officer, if necessary. If the 
suspending official determines to impose suspension, he/she shall, after 
consultation with the Office of the General Counsel, notify the 
contractor in accordance with FAR 9.407-3(c). If the action is not based 
on an indictment, and, subject to the provisions of FAR 9.407-3(b)(2), 
the contractor's submission in response to the notice raises a genuine 
dispute over facts material to the suspension, the suspending official 
shall, after suspension has been imposed, arrange for fact-finding 
hearings and take the necessary actions specified in FAR 9.407-3(b)(2).


<R05>
309.470  Reporting of suspected causes for debarment or suspension, or the 
taking of evasive actions.

the applicable representations and certifications:

    To Be Completed by the Offeror: (The Representations and 
Certifications must be executed by an individual authorized to bind the 
offeror.) The offeror makes the following Representations and

evaluation factors must be developed by the project officer and 
submitted to the contracting officer in the request for contract (RFC) 
for inclusion in the request for proposal (RFP). Development of these 
factors and the assignment of the relative importance or weight to each 
require the exercise of judgment on a case-by-case basis because they 
must be tailored to the requirements of the individual acquisition. 
Since the factors will serve as a standard against which all proposals 
will be evaluated, it is imperative that they be chosen carefully to 
emphasize those considered to be critical in the selection of a 
contractor.
    (ii) The finalized evaluation factors cannot be changed except by a 
formal amendment to the RFP issued by the contracting officer. No 
factors other than those set forth in the RFP shall be used in the 
evaluation of proposals.
    (2) Review of evaluation factors. (i) The evaluation factors should 
be reviewed by the contracting officer in terms of the work statement. 
This review is not intended to dictate technical requirements to the 
program office or project officer, but rather to ensure that the 
evaluation factors are clear, concise, and fair so that all potential 
offerors are fully aware of the bases for proposal evaluation and are 
given an equal opportunity to compete.
    (ii) The project officer and the contracting officer should then 
review the evaluation factors together to ascertain the following:
    (A) The factors are described in sufficient detail to provide the 
offerors (and evaluators) with a total understanding of the factors to 
be involved in the evaluation process;
    (B) The factors address the key programmatic concerns which the 
offerors must be aware of in preparing proposals;
    (C) The factors are specifically applicable to the instant 
acquisition and are not merely restatements of factors from previous 
acquisitions which are not relevant to this acquisition; and
    (D) The factors are selected to represent only the significant areas 
of importance which must be emphasized rather than a multitude of 
factors. (All factors tend to lose importance if too many are included. 
Using too many factors will prove as detrimental as using too few.)
    (3) Examples of topics that form a basis for evaluation factors. 
Typical examples of topics that form a basis for the development of 
evaluation factors are listed in the following paragraphs. These 
examples are intended to assist in the development of actual evaluation 
factors for a specific acquisition and should only be used if they are 
applicable to that acquisition. They are not to be construed as actual 
examples of evaluation factors to be included in the RFP.
    (i) Understanding of the problem and statement of work:
    (ii) Method of accomplishing the objectives and intent of the 
statement of work;
    (iii) Soundness of the scientific or technical approach for 
executing the requirements of the statement of work

[[Page 32]]

(to include, when applicable, preliminary layouts, sketches, diagrams, 
other graphic representations, calculations, curves, and other data 
necessary for presentation, substantiation, justification, or 
understanding of the approach);
    (iv) Special technical factors, such as experience or pertinent 
novel ideas in the specific branch of science or technology involved;
    (v) Feasibility and/or practicality of successfully accomplishing 
the requirements (to include a statement and discussion of anticipated 
major difficulties and problem areas and recommended approaches for 
their resolution);
    (vi) Availability of required special research, test, and other 
equipment or facilities;
    (vii) Managerial capability (ability to achieve delivery or 
performance requirements as demonstrated by the proposed use of 
management and other personnel resources, and to successfully manage the 
project, including subcontractor and/or consultant efforts, if 
applicable, as evidenced by the management plan and demonstrated by 
previous experience);
    (viii) Availability, qualifications, experience, education, and 
competence of professional, technical, and other personnel, to include 
proposed subcontractors and consultants (as evidenced by resumes, 
endorsements, and explanations of previous efforts);
    (ix) Soundness of the proposed staff time or labor hours, propriety 
of personnel classifications (professional, technical, others), 
necessity for type and quantity of material and facilities proposed, 
validity of proposed subcontracting, and necessity of proposed travel;
    (x) Quality of offeror's past performance on recent projects of 
similar size and scope; and
    (xi) Extent of proposed participation of small disadvantaged 
business concerns in performance of the contract.

315.208  Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.

    (b) When the head of the contracting activity (HCA) for a health 
agency determines that certain classes of biomedical or behavioral 
research and development acquisitions should be subject to conditions 
other than those specified in FAR 52.215-1(c)(3), the HCA may authorize 
the use of the provision at 352.215-70 in addition to the provision at 
FAR 52.215-1. This is an authorized deviation.
    (2) When the provision at 352.215-70 is included in the solicitation 
and a proposal is received after the exact time specified for receipt, 
the contracting officer, with the assistance of cost and technical 
personnel, shall make a written determination as to whether the proposal 
meets the requirements of the provision at 352.215-70 and, therefore, 
can be considered.


<R05>
315.209  Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

    (a) Paragraph (e) of the provision at 352.215-1 shall be used in 
place of that specified at FAR 52.215-1(e). This is an authorized 
deviation.
    (g) If the head of the contracting activity (HCA)(not delegable) has 
determined that the contracting activity will allow the use of the 
annual submission of representations and certifications by offerors, the 
provisions of FAR 14.213 shall be followed.


<R04>
                     Subpart 315.3--Source Selection


<R05>
315.305  Proposal evaluation.

    (a)(1) Cost or price evaluation. The contracting officer shall 
evaluate business proposals adhering to the requirements for cost or 
price analysis included in FAR 15.404. The contracting officer must 
determine the extent of analysis in each case depending on the amount of 
the proposal, the technical complexity, and related cost or price. The 
contracting officer should request the project officer to analyze items 
such as the number of labor hours proposed for various labor categories; 
the mix of labor hours and categories of labor in relation to the 
technical requirements of the project; the kinds and quantities of 
material, equipment, and supplies; types, numbers and hours/days of 
proposed consultants; logic of proposed subcontracting; analysis of the 
travel proposed including number of trips, locations, purpose, and 
travelers; and kinds and quantities of information technology. The 
project officer

[[Page 33]]

shall provide his/her opinion as to whether these elements are necessary 
and reasonable for efficient contract performance. Exceptions to 
proposed elements shall be supported by adequate rationale to allow for 
effective negotiations or award if discussions are not conducted. The 
contracting officer should also request the assistance of a cost/price 
analyst when considered necessary. In all cases, the negotiation 
memorandum must include the rationale used in determining that the price 
or cost is fair and reasonable.
    (2) Past performance evaluation. When evaluating past performance, 
the contracting officer is responsible for conducting reference checks 
to obtain information concerning the performance history of offerors. 
The contracting officer may require the assistance of the project 
officer as well as other Government technical personnel in performing 
this function.
    (3) Technical evaluation.
    (i) Technical evaluation plan.
    (A) A technical evaluation plan may be required by the contracting 
officer, at his/her discretion, when an acquisition is sufficiently 
complex as to warrant a formal plan.
    (B) The technical evaluation plan should include at least the 
following:
    (1) A list of recommended technical evaluation panel members, their 
organizations, a list of their major consulting clients (if applicable), 
their qualifications, and curricula vitae (if applicable);
    (2) A justification for using non-Government technical evaluation 
panel members. (Justification is not required if non-Government 
evaluators will be used in accordance with standard contracting activity 
procedures or policies);
    (3) A statement that there is no apparent or actual conflict of 
interest regarding any recommended panel member;
    (4) A copy of each rating sheet, approved by the contracting 
officer, to be used to assure consistency with the evaluation criteria; 
and
    (5) A brief description of the general evaluation approach.
    (C) The technical evaluation plan must be signed by an official 
within the program office in a position at least one level above the 
project officer, or in accordance with contracting activity procedures.
    (D) The technical evaluation plan should be submitted to the 
contracting officer for review and approval before the solicitation is 
issued. The contracting officer shall make sure that the significant 
factors and subfactors relating to the evaluation are reflected in the 
evaluation criteria when conducting the review of the plan.
    (ii) Technical evaluation panel.
    (A) General. (1) A technical evaluation panel is required for all 
acquisitions subject to this subpart which are expected to exceed 
$500,000 and in which technical evaluation is considered a key element 
in the award decision. The contracting officer has the discretion to 
require a technical evaluation panel for acquisitions not exceeding 
$500,000 based on the complexity of the acquisition.
    (2) The technical evaluation process requires careful consideration 
regarding the size, composition, expertise, and function of the 
technical evaluation panel. The efforts of the panel can result in the 
success or failure of the acquisition.
    (B) Role of the project officer. (1) The project officer is the 
contracting officer's technical representative for the acquisition 
action. The project officer may be a voting member of the technical 
evaluation panel, and may also serve as the chairperson of the panel, 
unless he/she is prohibited by law or contracting activity procedures to 
do so.
    (2) The project officer is responsible for recommending panel 
members who are knowledgeable in the technical aspects of the 
acquisition and who are competent to identify strengths and weaknesses 
of the various proposals. The program training requirements specified in 
307.170 must be adhered to when selecting prospective panel members 
(government employees).
    (3) The project officer shall ensure that persons possessing 
expertise and experience in addressing issues relative to sex, race, 
national origin, and handicapped discrimination are included as panel 
members in acquisitions which address those issues. The intent is to 
balance the composition of the panel so

[[Page 34]]

that qualified and concerned individuals may provide insight to other 
panel members regarding ideas for, and approaches to be taken in, the 
evaluation of proposals.
    (4) The project officer is to submit the recommended list of panel 
members to an official within the program office in a position at least 
one level above the project officer, or in accordance with contracting 
activity procedures. This official will review the recommendations and 
select the chairperson.
    (5) The project officer shall arrange for adequate and secure 
working space for the panel.
    (C) Role of the contracting officer. (1) The term ``contracting 
officer,'' as used in this subpart, may be the contracting officer or 
his/her designated representative within the contracting office.
    (2) The contracting officer shall not serve as a member of the 
technical evaluation panel but should be available to:
    (i) Address the initial meeting of the technical evaluation panel;
    (ii) Provide assistance to the evaluators as required; and
    (iii) Ensure that the scores adequately reflect the written 
technical report comments.
    (D) Conflict of interest. (1) If a panel member has an actual or 
apparent conflict of interest related to a proposal under evaluation, 
he/she shall be removed from the panel and replaced with another 
evaluator. If a suitable replacement is not available, the panel shall 
perform the review without a replacement.
    (2) For the purposes of this subpart, conflicts of interest are 
defined in the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the 
Executive Branch (5 CFR part 2635), Supplemental Standards of Ethical 
Conduct for Employees of the Department of Health and Human Services (5 
CFR part 5501), and the Procurement Integrity Act. For outside 
evaluators serving on the technical evaluation panel, see paragraph 
(a)(3)(ii)(F) of this section.
    (E) Continuity of evaluation process. (1) The technical evaluation 
panel is responsible for evaluating the original proposals, making 
recommendations to the chairperson regarding weaknesses and deficiencies 
of proposals, and, if required by the contracting officer, assisting the 
contracting officer during communications and discussions, and reviewing 
supplemental, revised and/or final proposal revisions. To the extent 
possible, the same evaluators should be available throughout the entire 
evaluation and selection process to ensure continuity and consistency in 
the treatment of proposals. The following are examples of circumstances 
when it would not be necessary for the technical evaluation panel to 
evaluate revised proposals submitted during the acquisition:
    (i) The answers to questions do not have a substantial impact on the 
proposal;
    (ii) Final proposal revisions are not materially different from the 
original proposals; or
    (iii) The rankings of the offerors are not affected because the 
revisions to the proposals are relatively minor.
    (2) The chairperson, with the concurrence of the contracting 
officer, may decide not to have the panel evaluate the revised 
proposals. Whenever this decision is made, it must be fully documented 
by the chairperson and approved by the contracting officer.
    (3) When technical evaluation panel meetings are considered 
necessary by the contracting officer, the attendance of evaluators is 
mandatory. When the chairperson determines that an evaluator's failure 
to attend the meetings is prejudicial to the evaluation, the chairperson 
shall remove and/or replace the individual after discussing the 
situation with the contracting officer and obtaining his/her concurrence 
and the approval of the official responsible for appointing the panel 
members.
    (4) Whenever continuity of the evaluation process is not possible, 
and either new evaluators are selected or a reduced panel is decided 
upon, each proposal which is being reviewed at any stage of the 
acquisition shall be reviewed at that stage by all members of the 
revised panel unless it is impractical to do so because of the receipt 
of an unusually large number of proposals.
    (F) Use of outside evaluators. (1) The National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) and

[[Page 35]]

the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) 
are required to have a peer review of research and development contracts 
in accordance with Public Law 93-352 as amended by Public Law 94-63; 42 
U.S.C. 289 a and 42 U.S.C. 290aa-3 respectively. This legislation 
requires peer review of projects and proposals, and not more than one-
fourth of the members of a peer review group may be officers or 
employees of the United States. NIH and SAMHSA are therefore exempt from 
the provisions of 315.305(a)(3)(ii) to the extent that 42 U.S.C. 289a 
and 290aa-3 apply. Conflicts of interest are addressed at 42 CFR part 
52h. Other agencies subject to statutory scientific peer review 
requirements are also exempt from the requirements of paragraph 
(a)(3)(ii) of this section to the extent that these requirements are 
inconsistent with their legislative requirements.
    (2) In general, decisions to disclose proposals outside the 
Government for evaluation purposes shall be made by the official 
responsible for appointing panel members for the acquisition, after 
consultation with the contracting officer and in accordance with 
operating division procedures. The decision to disclose either a 
solicited or unsolicited proposal outside the Government for the purpose 
of obtaining an evaluation shall take into consideration the avoidance 
of organizational conflicts of interest and any competitive relationship 
between the submitter of the proposal and the prospective evaluator(s).
    (3) When it is determined to disclose a solicited proposal outside 
the Government for evaluation purposes, the following or similar 
conditions shall be included in the written agreement with evaluator(s) 
prior to disclosure:

                   Conditions for Evaluating Proposals

    The evaluator agrees to use the data (trade secrets, business data, 
and technical data) contained in the proposal only for evaluation 
purposes.
    The foregoing requirement does not apply to data obtained from 
another source without restriction.
    Any notice or legend placed on the proposal by either the Department 
or the submitter of the proposal shall be applied to any reproduction or 
abstract provided to the evaluator or made by the evaluator. Upon 
completion of the evaluation, the evaluator shall return the Government 
furnished copy of the proposal or abstract, and all copies thereof, to 
the Departmental office which initially furnished the proposal for 
evaluation.
    Unless authorized by the Department's initiating office, the 
evaluator shall not contact the submitter of the proposal concerning any 
aspects of its contents.
    The evaluator is obligated to obtain commitments from its employees 
and subcontractors, as necessary, to effect the purposes of these 
conditions.

    (iii) Receipt of proposals.
    (A) After the closing date set by the solicitation for the receipt 
of proposals, the contracting officer will use a transmittal memorandum 
to forward the technical proposals to the project officer or chairperson 
for evaluation. The business proposals will be retained by the 
contracting officer for evaluation.
    (B) The transmittal memorandum shall include at least the following:
    (1) A list of the names of the organizations submitting proposals;
    (2) A reference to the need to preserve the integrity of the source 
selection process;
    (3) A statement that only the contracting officer is to conduct 
discussions.
    (4) A requirement for a technical evaluation report in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(3)(vi) of this section; and
    (5) The establishment of a date for receipt of the technical 
evaluation report.
    (iv) Convening the technical evaluation panel.
    (A) Normally, the technical evaluation panel will convene to 
evaluate the proposals. However, there may be situations when the 
contracting officer determines that it is not feasible for the panel to 
convene. Whenever this decision is made, care must be taken to assure 
that the technical review is closely monitored to produce acceptable 
results.
    (B) When a panel is convened, the chairperson is responsible for the 
control of the technical proposals provided to him/her by the 
contracting officer for use during the evaluation process. The 
chairperson will generally distribute the technical proposals prior to

[[Page 36]]

the initial panel meeting and will establish procedures for securing the 
proposals whenever they are not being evaluated to insure their 
confidentiality. After the evaluation is complete, all proposals must be 
returned to the contracting officer by the chairperson.
    (C) The contracting officer shall address the initial meeting of the 
panel and state the basic rules for conducting the evaluation. The 
contracting officer shall provide written guidance to the panel if he/
she is unable to attend the initial panel meeting. The guidance should 
include:
    (1) Explanation of conflicts of interest;
    (2) The necessity to read and understand the solicitation, 
especially the statement of work and evaluation criteria, prior to 
reading the proposals;
    (3) The need for evaluators to restrict the review to only the 
solicitation and the contents of the technical proposals;
    (4) The need for each evaluator to review all the proposals;
    (5) The need to watch for ambiguities, inconsistencies, errors, and 
deficiencies which should be surfaced during the evaluation process;
    (6) An explanation of the evaluation process and what will be 
expected of the evaluators throughout the process;
    (7) The need for the evaluators to be aware of the requirement to 
have complete written documentation of the individual strengths and 
weaknesses which affect the scoring of the proposals; and
    (8) An instruction directing the evaluators that, until the award is 
made, information concerning the acquisition must not be disclosed to 
any person not directly involved in the evaluation process.
    (v) Rating and ranking of proposals. The evaluators will 
individually read each proposal, describe tentative strengths and 
weaknesses, and independently develop preliminary scores in relation to 
each evaluation factor set forth in the solicitation. After this has 
been accomplished, the evaluators shall discuss in detail the individual 
strengths and weakness described by each evaluator and, if possible, 
arrive at a common understanding of the major strengths and weaknesses 
and the potential for correcting each offeror's weakness(es). Each 
evaluator will score each proposal, and then the technical evaluation 
panel will collectively rank the proposals. Generally, ranking will be 
determined by adding the numerical scores assigned to the evaluation 
factors and finding the average for each offeror. The evaluators should 
then identify whether each proposal is acceptable or unacceptable. 
Predetermined cutoff scores shall not be employed.
    (vi) Technical evaluation report. A technical evaluation report 
shall be prepared and furnished to the contracting officer by the 
chairperson and maintained as a permanent record in the contract file. 
The report must reflect the ranking of the proposals and identify each 
proposal as acceptable or unacceptable. The report must also include a 
narrative evaluation specifying the strengths and weaknesses of each 
proposal, a copy of each signed rating sheet, and any reservations, 
qualifications, or areas to be addressed that might bear upon the 
selection of sources for negotiation and award. Concrete technical 
reasons supporting a determination of unacceptability with regard to any 
proposal must be included. The report should also include specific 
points and questions which are to be raised in discussions or 
negotiations.


<R05>
315.306  Exchanges with offerors after receipt of proposals.

    (d) Exchanges with offerors after establishment of the competitive 
range. The contracting officer and project officer should discuss the 
uncertainties and/or deficiencies that are included in the technical 
evaluation report for each proposal in the competitive range. Technical 
questions should be developed by the project officer and/or the 
technical evaluation panel and should be included in the technical 
evaluation report. The management, past performance and cost or price 
questions should be prepared by the contracting officer with assistance 
from the project officer and/or panel as required. The method of 
requesting offerors in the competitive range to submit the additional 
information will vary depending on the complexity of the questions, the 
extent

[[Page 37]]

of additional information requested, the time needed to analyze the 
responses, and the time frame for making the award. However, to the 
extent practicable, all questions and answers should be in writing. Each 
offeror in the competitive range shall be given an equitable period of 
time for preparation of responses to questions to the extent 
practicable. The questions should be developed so as to disclose the 
ambiguities, uncertainties, and deficiencies of the offeror.


<R05>
315.307  Proposal revisions.

    (b) Final proposal revisions are subject to a final evaluation of 
price or cost and other salient factors by the contracting officer and 
project officer with assistance from a cost/price analyst, and an 
evaluation of technical factors by the technical evaluation panel, as 
necessary. Proposals may be technically rescored and reranked by the 
technical evaluation panel and a technical evaluation report prepared. 
To the extent practicable, the evaluation shall be performed by the same 
evaluators who reviewed the original proposals. A final evaluation of 
past performance will be made by the contracting officer and project 
officer. The technical evaluation panel may be involved in the final 
evaluation of past performance if the panel is comprised solely of 
Government personnel.


<R05>
315.370  Finalization of details with the selected source.

    (a) After selection of the successful proposal, finalization of 
details with the selected offeror may be conducted if deemed necessary. 
However, no factor which could have any effect on the selection process 
may be introduced after the common cutoff date for receipt of final 
proposal revisions. The finalization process shall not in any way 
prejudice the competitive interest or rights of the unsuccessful 
offerors. Finalization of details with the selected offeror shall be 
restricted to definitizing the final agreement on terms and conditions, 
assuming none of these factors were involved in the selection process.
    (b) Caution must be exercised by the contracting officer to insure 
that the finalization process is not used to change the requirements 
contained in the solicitation, nor to make any other changes which would 
impact on the source selection decision. Whenever a material change 
occurs in the requirements, the competition must be reopened and all 
offerors submitting final proposal revisions must be given an 
opportunity to resubmit proposals based on the revised requirements. 
Whenever there is a question as to whether a change is material, the 
contracting officer should obtain the advice of technical personnel and 
legal counsel before reopening the competition. Significant changes in 
the offeror's cost proposal may also necessitate a reopening of 
competition if the changes alter the factors involved in the original 
selection process.
    (c) Should finalization details beyond those specified in paragraph 
(a) of this section be required for any reason, discussions must be 
reopened with all offerors submitting final proposal revisions.
    (d) Upon finalization of details, the contracting officer should 
obtain a confirmation letter from the successful offeror which includes 
any revisions to the technical proposal, the agreed to price or cost, 
and, as applicable, a certificate of current cost or pricing data.


<R05>
315.371  Contract preparation and award.

    (a) The contracting officer must perform the following actions after 
finalization details have been completed:
    (1) Prepare the negotiation memorandum in accordance with 315.372;
    (2) Prepare the contract containing all agreed to terms and 
conditions and clauses required by law or regulation;
    (3) Include in the contract file the pertinent documents referenced 
in FAR 4.803; and
    (4) Obtain the appropriate approval of the proposed contract 
award(s) in accordance with subpart 304.71 and contracting activity 
procedures.
    (b) After receiving the required approvals, the contract should be 
transmitted to the prospective contractor for signature. The prospective 
contractor must be informed that the contract is not effective until 
accepted by the contracting officer.

[[Page 38]]

    (c) The contract shall not be issued until the finance office 
certifies that the funds are available for obligation.


<R05>
315.372  Preparation of negotiation memorandum.

    The negotiation memorandum or summary of negotiations is a complete 
record of all actions leading to award of a contract and is prepared by 
the contract negotiator to support the source selection decision 
discussed in FAR 15.308. It should be in sufficient detail to explain 
and support the rationale, judgments, and authorities upon which all 
actions were predicated. The memorandum will document the negotiation 
process and reflect the negotiator's actions, skills, and judgments in 
concluding a satisfactory agreement for the Government. Negotiation 
memorandums shall contain discussion of the following or a statement of 
nonapplicability; however, information already contained in the contract 
file need not be reiterated. A reference to the document which contains 
the required information is acceptable.
    (a) Description of articles and services and period of performance. 
A description of articles and services, quantity, unit price, total 
contract amount, and period of contract performance should be set forth 
( if Supplemental Agreement--show previous contract amount as revised, 
as well as information with respect to the period of performance).
    (b) Acquisition planning. Summarize or reference any acquisition 
planning activities that have taken place.
    (c) Synopsis of acquisition. A statement as to whether the 
acquisition has or has not been publicized in accordance with FAR 
Subpart 5.2. A brief statement of explanation should be included with 
reference to the specific basis for exemption under the FAR, if 
applicable.
    (d) Contract type. Provide sufficient detail to support the type of 
contractual instrument recommended for the acquisition. If the contract 
is a cost-sharing type, explain the essential cost-sharing features.
    (e) Extent of competition. The extent to which full and open 
competition was solicited and obtained must be discussed. The discussion 
shall include the date of solicitation, sources solicited, and 
solicitation results. If a late proposal was received, discuss whether 
or not the late proposal was evaluated and the rationale for the 
decision.
    (f) Technical evaluation. Summarize or reference the results 
presented in the technical evaluation report.
    (g) Business evaluation. Summarize or reference results presented in 
the business report.
    (h) Past performance. Summarize or reference results of past 
performance evaluation and reference checks.
    (i) Competitive range (if applicable). Describe how the competitive 
range was determined and state the offerors who were included in the 
competitive range and the ones who were not.
    (j) Cost breakdown and analysis. Include a complete cost breakdown 
together with the negotiator's analysis of the estimated cost by 
individual cost elements. The negotiator's analysis should contain 
information such as:
    (1) A comparison of cost factors proposed in the instant case with 
actual factors used in earlier contracts, using the same cost centers of 
the same supplier or cost centers of other sources having recent 
contracts for the same or similar item.
    (2) Any pertinent Government-conducted audit of the proposed 
contractor's record of any pertinent cost advisory report.
    (3) Any pertinent technical evaluation inputs as to necessity, 
allocability and reasonableness of labor, material and other direct 
expenses.
    (4) Any other pertinent information to fully support the basis for 
and rationale of the cost analysis.
    (5) If the contract is an incentive type, discuss all elements of 
profit and fee structure.
    (6) A justification of the reasonableness of the proposed 
contractor's estimated profit or fixed fee, considering the requirements 
of FAR 15.404-4 and HHSAR 315.404-4.
    (k) Cost realism. Describe the cost realism analysis performed on 
proposals.
    (l) Government-furnished property and Government-provided 
facilities. With respect to Government-furnished or Government-provided 
facilities, equipment, tooling, or other property, include the 
following:

[[Page 39]]

    (1) Where no property is to be provided, a statement to that effect.
    (2) Where property is to be provided, a full description, the 
estimated dollar value, the basis of price comparison with competitors, 
and the basis of rental charge, if rental is involved.
    (3) Where the furnishing of any property or the extent has not been 
determined and is left open for future resolution, a detailed 
explanation.
    (m) Negotiations. Include a statement as to the date and place 
negotiations were conducted, and identify members of both the Government 
and contractor negotiating teams by area of responsibility. Include 
negotiation details relative to the statement of work, terms and 
conditions, and special provisions. The results of cost or price 
negotiations must include the information required by FAR 31.109 and 
15.406-3. In addition, if cost or pricing data was required to be 
submitted, the negotiation record must also contain the extent to which 
the contracting officer relied upon the factual cost or pricing data 
submitted and used in negotiating the cost or price.
    (n) Other considerations. Include coverage of areas such as:
    (1) Financial data with respect to a contractor's capacity and 
stability.
    (2) Determination of contractor responsibility.
    (3) Details as to why the method of payment, such as progress 
payment, advance payment, etc., is necessary. Also cite any required D & 
F's.
    (4) Information with respect to obtaining of a certificate of 
current cost or pricing data.
    (5) Other required special approvals.
    (6) If the contract represents an extension of previous work, the 
status of funds and performance under the prior contract(s) should be 
reflected. Also, a determination should be made that the Government has 
obtained enough actual or potential value from the work previously 
performed to warrant continuation with the same contractor. (Project 
officer should furnish the necessary information.)
    (7) If the contract was awarded by full and open competition, state 
where the unsuccessful offerors' proposals are filed.
    (8) State that equal opportunity provisions of the proposed contract 
have been explained to the contractor, and it is aware of its 
responsibilities. Also state whether or not a clearance is required.
    (9) If the contract is for services, a statement must be made, in 
accordance with FAR 37.103, that the services to be acquired are 
nonpersonal in nature.
    (o) Terms and conditions. Identify the general and special clauses 
and conditions that are contained in the contract, such as option 
arrangements, incremental funding, anticipatory costs, deviations from 
standard clauses, etc. The basis and rationale for inclusion of any 
special terms and conditions must be stated and, where applicable, the 
document which granted approval for its use identified.
    (p) Recommendation. A brief statement setting forth the 
recommendations for award.
    (q) Signature. The memorandum must be signed by the contract 
negotiator who prepared the memorandum.

<R05>
315.404-2  Information to support proposal analysis.

    (a)(2) When some or all information sufficient to determine the 
reasonableness of the proposed cost or price is already available or can 
be obtained by phone from the cognizant audit agency, contracting 
officers may request less-than-complete field pricing support 
(specifying in the request the information needed) or may waive in 
writing the requirement for audit and field pricing support by 
documenting the file to indicate what information is to be used instead 
of the audit report and the field pricing report.
    (3) When initiating audit and field pricing support, the contracting 
officer shall do so by sending a request to the cognizant administrative 
contracting officer (ACO), with an information copy to the cognizant 
audit office. When field pricing support is not available, the 
contracting officer shall initiate an audit by sending, in accordance 
with agency procedures, two (2) copies of the request to the OIG Office

[[Page 40]]

of Audits' Regional Audit Director. In both cases, the contracting 
officer shall, in the request:
    (i) Prescribe the extent of the support needed;
    (ii) State the specific areas for which input is required;
    (iii) Include the information necessary to perform the review (such 
as the offeror's proposal and the applicable portions of the 
solicitation, particularly those describing requirements and delivery 
schedules);
    (iv) Provide the complete address of the location of the offeror's 
financial records that support the proposal;
    (v) Identify the office having audit responsibility if other than 
the HHS Regional Audit Office; and
    (vi) Specify a due date for receipt of a verbal report to be 
followed by a written audit report. (If the time available is not 
adequate to permit satisfactory coverage of the proposal, the auditor 
shall so advise the contracting officer and indicate the additional time 
needed.) One copy of the audit request letter that was submitted to the 
Regional Audit Director and a complete copy of the contract price 
proposal shall be submitted to OIG/OA/DAC. Whenever, an audit review has 
been conducted by the Office of Audits, two (2) copies of the memorandum 
of negotiation shall be forwarded to OIG/OA/DAC by the contracting 
officer.


<R05>
315.404-4  Profit.

    (b) Policy. (1) The structured approach for determining profit or 
fee (hereafter referred to as profit) provides contracting officers with 
a technique that will ensure consideration of the relative value of the 
appropriate profit factors described in paragraph (d) of this section in 
the establishment of a profit objective for the conduct of negotiations. 
The contracting officer's analysis of these profit factors is based on 
information available to him/her prior to negotiations. The information 
is furnished in proposals, audit data, assessment reports, preaward 
surveys and the like. The structured approach also provides a basis for 
documentation of this objective, including an explanation of any 
significant departure from this objective in reaching an agreement. The 
extent of documentation should be directly related to the dollar value 
and complexity of the proposed acquisition. Additionally, the 
negotiation process does not require agreement on either estimated cost 
elements or profit elements. The profit objective is a part of an 
overall negotiation objective which, as a going-in objective, bears a 
distinct relationship to the cost objective and any proposed sharing 
arrangement. Since profit is merely one of several interrelated 
variables, the Government negotiator generally should not complete the 
profit negotiation without simultaneously agreeing on the other 
variables. Specific agreement on the exact weights or values of the 
individual profit factors is not required and should not be attempted.
    (ii) The profit-analysis factors set forth at FAR 15.404-4(d) shall 
be used for establishing profit objectives under the following listed 
circumstances. Generally, it is expected that this method will be 
supported in a manner similar to that used in the structured approach 
(profit factor breakdown and documentation of the profit objective); 
however, factors within FAR 15.404-4(d) considered inapplicable to the 
acquisition will be excluded from the profit objective.
    (A) Contracts not expected to exceed $100,000;
    (B) Architect-engineer contracts;
    (C) Management contracts for operations and/or maintenance of 
Government facilities;
    (D) Construction contracts;
    (E) Contracts primarily requiring delivery of material supplies by 
subcontractors;
    (F) Termination settlements; and
    (G) Cost-plus-award-fee contracts (However, contracting officers may 
find it advantageous to perform a structured profit analysis as an aid 
in arriving at an appropriate fee arrangement). Other exceptions may be 
made in the negotiation of contracts having unusual pricing situations, 
but shall be justified in writing by the contracting officer in 
situations where the structured approach is determined to be unsuitable.
    (c) Contracting officer responsibilities. A profit objective is that 
part of the estimated contract price objective or

[[Page 41]]

value which, in the judgment of the contracting officer, constitutes an 
appropriate amount of profit for the acquisition being considered. This 
objective should realistically reflect the total overall task to be 
performed and the requirements placed on the contractor. Development of 
a profit objective should not begin until a thorough review of proposed 
contract work has been made; a review of all available knowledge 
regarding the contractor pursuant to FAR subpart 9.1, including audit 
data, preaward survey reports and financial statements, as appropriate, 
has been conducted; and an analysis of the contractor's cost estimate 
and comparison with the Government's estimate or projection of cost has 
been made.
    (d) Profit--analysis factors (1) Common factors. The following 
factors shall be considered in all cases in which profit is to be 
negotiated. The weight ranges listed after each factor shall be used in 
all instances where the structured approach is used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Profit factors                 Weight ranges (in percent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contractor effort:
  Material acquisition.................  1 to 5.
  Direct labor.........................  4 to 15.
  Overhead.............................  4 to 9.
  General management (G&A).............  4 to 8.
  Other costs..........................  1 to 5.
Other factors:
  Cost risk............................  0 to 7.
  Investment...........................  -2 to +2.
  Performance..........................  -1 to +1.
  Socioeconomic programs...............  -.5 to +.5.
  Special situations...................
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Under the structured approach, the contracting officer shall 
first measure ``Contractor Effort'' by the assignment of a profit 
percentage within the designated weight ranges to each element of 
contract cost recognized by the contracting officer. The amount 
calculated for the cost of money for facilities capital is not to be 
included for the computation of profit as part of the cost base. The 
suggested categories under ``Contractor Effort'' are for reference 
purposes only. Often individual proposals will be in a different format, 
but since these categories are broad and basic, they provide sufficient 
guidance to evaluate all other items of cost.
    (ii) After computing a total dollar profit for ``Contractor 
Effort,'' the contracting officer shall then calculate the specific 
profit dollars assigned for cost risk, investment, performance, 
socioeconomic programs, and special situations. This is accomplished by 
multiplying the total Government Cost Objective, exclusive of any cost 
of money for facilities capital, by the specific weight assigned to the 
elements within the ``Other Factors'' category. Form HHS-674, Structured 
Approach Profit/Fee Objective, should be used, as appropriate, to 
facilitate the calculation of this profit objective. Form HHS-674 is 
illustrated in 353.370-674.
    (iii) In making a judgment of the value of each factor, the 
contracting officer should be governed by the definition, description, 
and purpose of the factors together with considerations for evaluating 
them.
    (iv) The structured approach was designed for arriving at profit 
objectives for other than nonprofit organizations. However, if 
appropriate adjustments are made to reflect differences between profit 
and nonprofit organizations, the structured approach can be used as a 
basis for arriving at profit objectives for nonprofit organizations. 
Therefore, the structured approach, as modified in paragraph 
(d)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, shall be used to establish profit 
objectives for nonprofit organizations.
    (A) For purposes of this section, nonprofit organizations are 
defined as those business entities organized and operated exclusively 
for charitable, scientific, or educational purposes, no part of the net 
earnings of which inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or 
individual, and which are exempt from Federal income taxation under 
Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (B) For contracts with nonprofit organizations where profit is 
involved, an adjustment of up to 3 percentage points will be subtracted 
from the total profit objective percentage. In developing this 
adjustment, it will be necessary to consider the following factors;
    (1) Tax position benefits;
    (2) Granting of financing through advance payments; and
    (3) Other pertinent factors which may work to either the advantage 
or

[[Page 42]]

disadvantage of the contractor in its position as a nonprofit 
organization.
    (2) Contractor effort. Contractor effort is a measure of how much 
the contractor is expected to contribute to the overall effort necessary 
to meet the contract performance requirement in an efficient manner. 
This factor, which is apart from the contractor's responsibility for 
contract performance, takes into account what resources are necessary 
and what the contractor must do to accomplish a conversion of ideas and 
material into the final service or product called for in the contract. 
This is a recognition that within a given performance output, or within 
a given sales dollar figure, necessary efforts on the part of individual 
contractors can vary widely in both value and quantity, and that the 
profit objective should reflect the extent and nature of the 
contractor's contribution to total performance. A major consideration, 
particularly in connection with experimental, developmental, or research 
work, is the difficulty or complexity of the work to be performed, and 
the unusual demands of the contract, such as whether the project 
involves a new approach unrelated to existing technology and/or 
equipment or only refinements to these items. The evaluation of this 
factor requires an analysis of the cost content of the proposed contract 
as follows:
    (i) Material acquisition. (Subcontracted items, purchased parts, and 
other material.) Analysis of these cost items shall include an 
evaluation of the managerial and technical effort necessary to obtain 
the required subcontracted items, purchased parts, material or services. 
The contracting officer shall determine whether the contractor will 
obtain the items or services by routine order from readily available 
sources or by detailed subcontracts for which the prime contractor will 
be required to develop complex specifications. Consideration shall also 
be given to the managerial and technical efforts necessary for the prime 
contractor to select subcontractors and to perform subcontract 
administration functions. In application of this criterion, it should be 
recognized that the contribution of the prime contractor to its 
purchasing program may be substantial. Normally, the lowest unadjusted 
weight for direct material is 2 percent. A weighting of less than 2 
percent would be appropriate only in unusual circumstances when there is 
a minimal contribution by the contractor.
    (ii) Direct labor. (Professional, service, manufacturing and other 
labor). Analysis of the various labor categories of the cost content of 
the contract should include evaluation of the comparative quality and 
quantity of professional and semiprofessional talents, manufacturing and 
service skills, and experience to be employed. In evaluating 
professional and semiprofessional labor for the purpose of assigning 
profit dollars, consideration should be given to the amount of notable 
scientific talent or unusual or scarce talent needed in contrast to 
nonprofessional effort. The assessment should consider the contribution 
this talent will provide toward the achievement of contract objectives. 
Since nonprofessional labor is relatively plentiful and rather easily 
obtained by the contractor and is less critical to the successful 
performance of contract objectives, it cannot be weighted nearly as high 
as professional or semiprofessional labor. Service contract labor should 
be evaluated in a like manner by assigning higher weights to engineering 
or professional type skills required for contract performance. 
Similarly, the variety of manufacturing and other categories of labor 
skills required and the contractor's manpower resources for meeting 
these requirements should be considered. For purposes of evaluation, 
categories of labor (i.e., quality control, receiving and inspection, 
etc.) which do not fall within the definition for professional, service 
or manufacturing labor may be categorized as appropriate. However, the 
same evaluation considerations as outlined in this paragraph will be 
applied.
    (iii) Overhead and general management (G&A). (A) Analysis of these 
overhead items of cost should include the evaluation of the makeup of 
these expenses and how much they contribute to contract performance. To 
the extent practicable, analysis should include a determination of the 
amount of labor

[[Page 43]]

within these overhead pools and how this labor should be treated if it 
were considered as direct labor under the contract. The allocable labor 
elements should be given the same profit considerations that they would 
receive if they were treated as direct labor. The other elements of 
these overhead pools should be evaluated to determine whether they are 
routine expenses, such as utilities and maintenance, and hence given 
lesser profit consideration, or whether they are significant 
contributing elements. The composite of the individual determinations in 
relation to the elements of the overhead pools will be the profit 
consideration given the pools as a whole. The procedure for assigning 
relative values to these overhead expenses differs from the method used 
in assigning values of the direct labor. The upper and lower limits 
assignable to the direct labor are absolute. In the case of overhead 
expenses, individual expenses may be assigned values outside the range 
as long as the composite ratio is within the range.
    (B) It is not necessary that the contractor's accounting system 
break down overhead expenses within the classifications of research 
overhead, other overhead pools, and general administrative expenses, 
unless dictated otherwise by Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). The 
contractor whose accounting system reflects only one overhead rate on 
all direct labor need not change its system (if CAS exempt) to 
correspond with these classifications. The contracting officer, in an 
evaluation of such a contractor's overhead rate, could break out the 
applicable sections of the composite rate which could be classified as 
research overhead, other overhead pools, and general and administrative 
expenses, and follow the appropriate evaluation technique.
    (C) Management problems surface in various degrees and the 
management expertise exercised to solve them should be considered as an 
element of profit. For example, a contract for a new program for 
research or an item which is on the cutting edge of the state of the art 
will cause more problems and require more managerial time and abilities 
of a higher order than a follow-on contract. If new contracts create 
more problems and require a higher profit weight, follow-ons should be 
adjusted downward because many of the problems should have been solved. 
In any event, an evaluation should be made of the underlying managerial 
effort involved on a case-by-case basis.
    (D) It may not be necessary for the contracting officer to make a 
separate profit evaluation of overhead expenses in connection with each 
acquisition action for substantially the same project with the same 
contractor. Where an analysis of the profit weight to be assigned to the 
overhead pool has been made, that weight assigned may be used for future 
acquisitions with the same contractor until there is a change in the 
cost composition of the overhead pool or the contract circumstances, or 
the factors discussed in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(C) of this section are 
involved.
    (iv) Other costs. Analysis of this factor should include all other 
direct costs associated with contractor performance (e.g., travel and 
relocation, direct support, and consultants). Analysis of these items of 
cost should include, the significance of the cost of contract 
performance, nature of the cost, and how much they contribute to 
contract performance. Normally, travel costs require minimal 
administrative effort by the contractor and, therefore, usually receive 
a weight no greater than 1%. Also, the contractor may designate 
individuals as ``consultants'' but in reality these individuals may be 
obtained by the contractor to supplement its workforce in the 
performance of routine duties required by contract. These costs would 
normally receive a minimum weight. However, there will be instances when 
the contractor may be required to locate and obtain the services of 
consultants having expertise in fields such as medicine or human 
services. In these instances, the contractor will be required to expend 
greater managerial and technical effort to obtain these services and, 
consequently, the costs should receive a much greater weight.
    (3) Other factors (i) Contract cost risk. The contract type employed 
basically determines the degree of cost risk assumed by the contractor. 
For example,

[[Page 44]]

where a portion of the risk has been shifted to the Government through 
cost-reimbursement provisions, unusual contingency provisions, or other 
risk-reducing measures, the amount of profit should be less than where 
the contractor assumes all the risk.
    (A) In developing the prenegotiation profit objective, the 
contracting officer will need to consider the type of contract 
anticipated to be negotiated and the contractor risk associated 
therewith when selecting the position in the weight range for profit 
that is appropriate for the risk to be borne by the contractor. This 
factor should be one of the most important in arriving at prenegotiation 
profit objective. Evaluation of this risk requires a determination of 
the degree of cost responsibility the contractor assumes; the 
reliability of the cost estimates in relation to the task assumed; and 
the complexity of the task assumed by the contractor. This factor is 
specifically limited to the risk of contract costs. Thus, risks on the 
part of the contractor such as reputation, losing a commercial market, 
risk of losing potential profits in other fields, or any risk which 
falls on the contracting office, such as the risk of not acquiring a 
satisfactory report, are not within the scope of this factor.
    (B) The first and basic determination of the degree of cost 
responsibility assumed by the contractor is related to the sharing of 
total risk of contract cost by the Government and the contractor through 
the selection of contract type. The extremes are a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee 
contract requiring the contractor to use its best efforts to perform a 
task and a firm fixed-price contract for a service or a complex item. A 
cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract would reflect a minimum assumption of 
cost responsibility, whereas a firm-fixed-price contract would reflect a 
complete assumption of cost responsibility. Where proper contract 
selection has been made, the regard for risk by contract type would 
usually fall into the following percentage ranges:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 Percent
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cost-reimbursement type contracts.............................       0-3
Fixed-price type contracts....................................       2-7
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (C) The second determination is that of the reliability of the cost 
estimates. Sound price negotiation requires well-defined contract 
objectives and reliable cost estimates. Prior experience assists the 
contractor in preparing reliable cost estimates on new acquisitions for 
similar related efforts. An excessive cost estimate reduces the 
possibility that the cost of performance will exceed the contract price, 
thereby reducing the contractor's assumption of contract cost risk.
    (D) The third determination is that of the difficulty of the 
contractor's task. The contractor's task can be difficult or easy, 
regardless of the type of contract.
    (E) Contractors are likely to assume greater cost risk only if 
contracting officers objectively analyze the risk incident to proposed 
contracts and are willing to compensate contractors for it. Generally, a 
cost-plus-fixed fee contract will not justify a reward for risk in 
excess of 0.5 percent, nor will a firm fixed-price contract justify a 
reward of less than the minimum in the structured approach. Where proper 
contract-type selection has been made, the reward for risk, by contract 
type, will usually fall into the following percentage ranges:
    (1) Type of contract and percentage ranges for profit objectives 
developed by using the structured approach for research and development 
and manufacturing contracts:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       Percent
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cost-Plus-fixed fee.......................  0 to 0.5
Cost-plus-incentive fee:
  With cost incentive only................  1 to 2
  With multiple incentives................  1.5 to 3
Fixed-price-incentive:
  With cost incentive only................  2 to 4
  With multiple incentives................  3 to 5
  Prospective price redetermination.......  3 to 5
  Firm fixed-price........................  5 to 7
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Type of contract and percentage ranges for profit objectives 
developed by using the structured approach for service contracts:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       Percent
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cost-plus-fixed-fee.......................  0 to 0.5
Cost-plus-incentive fee...................  1 to 2
Fixed-price incentive.....................  2 to 3
Firm fixed-price..........................  3 to 4
------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[Page 45]]

    (F) These ranges may not be appropriate for all acquisitions. For 
instance, a fixed-price-incentive contract that is closely priced with a 
low ceiling price and high incentive share may be tantamount to a firm 
fixed-price contract. In this situation, the contracting officer may 
determine that a basis exists for high confidence in the reasonableness 
of the estimate and that little opportunity exists for cost reduction 
without extraordinary efforts. On the other hand, a contract with a high 
ceiling and low incentive formula can be considered to contain cost-plus 
incentive-fee contract features. In this situation, the contracting 
officer may determine that the Government is retaining much of the 
contract cost responsibility and that the risk assumed by the contractor 
is minimal. Similarly, if a cost-plus-incentive-fee contract includes an 
unlimited downward (negative) fee adjustment on cost control, it could 
be comparable to a fixed-price-incentive contract. In such a pricing 
environment, the contracting officer may determine that the Government 
has transferred a greater amount of cost responsibility to the 
contractor than is typical under a normal cost-plus-incentive-fee 
contract.
    (G) The contractor's subcontracting program may have a significant 
impact on the contractor's acceptance or risk under a contract form. It 
could cause risk to increase or decrease in terms of both cost and 
performance. This consideration should be a part of the contracting 
officer's overall evaluation in selecting a factor to apply for cost 
risk. It may be determined, for instance, that the prime contractor has 
effectively transferred real cost risk to a subcontractor and the 
contract cost risk evaluation may, as a result, be below the range which 
would otherwise apply for the contract type being proposed. The contract 
cost risk evaluation should not be lowered, however, merely on the basis 
that a substantial portion of the contract costs represents subcontracts 
without any substantial transfer of contractor's risk.
    (H) In making a contract cost risk evaluation in an acquisition 
action that involves definitization of a letter contract, unpriced 
change orders, and unpriced orders under basic ordering agreements, 
consideration should be given to the effect on total contract cost risk 
as a result of having partial performance before definitization. Under 
some circumstances it may be reasoned that the total amount of cost risk 
has been effectively reduced. Under other circumstances it may be 
apparent that the contractor's cost risk remained substantially 
unchanged. To be equitable, the determination of profit weight for 
application to the total of all recognized costs, both those incurred 
and those yet to be expended, must be made with consideration to all 
attendant circumstances--not just the portion of costs incurred or 
percentage of work completed prior to definitization.
    (I) Time and material and labor hour contracts will be considered to 
be cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contracts for the purpose of establishing 
profit weights unless otherwise exempt under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of 
this section in the evaluation of the contractor's assumption of 
contract cost risk.
    (ii) Investment. HHS encourages its contractors to perform their 
contracts with the minimum of financial, facilities, or other assistance 
from the Government. As such, it is the purpose of this factor to 
encourage the contractor to acquire and use its own resources to the 
maximum extent possible. The evaluation of this factor should include an 
analysis of the following:
    (A) Facilities. (Including equipment). To evaluate how this factor 
contributes to the profit objective requires knowledge of the level of 
facilities utilization needed for contract performance, the source and 
financing of the required facilities, and the overall cost effectiveness 
of the facilities offered. Contractors who furnish their own facilities 
which significantly contribute to lower total contract costs should be 
provided with additional profit. On the other hand, contractors who rely 
on the Government to provide or finance needed facilities should receive 
a corresponding reduction in profit. Cases between these examples should 
be evaluated on their merits with either positive or negative 
adjustments, as appropriate, in profit being made. However, where a 
highly facilitized contractor is to perform a contract which does not

[[Page 46]]

benefit from this facilitization or where a contractor's use of its 
facilities has a minimum cost impact on the contract, profit need not be 
adjusted. When applicable, the prospective contractor's computation of 
facilities capital cost of money for pricing purposed under CAS 414 can 
help the contracting officer identify the level of facilities investment 
to be employed in contract performance.
    (B) Payments. In analyzing this factor, consideration should be 
given to the frequency of payments by the Government to the contractor. 
The key to this weighting is to give proper consideration to the impact 
the contract will have on the contractor's cash flow. Generally, 
negative consideration should be given for advance payments and payments 
more frequent than monthly with maximum reduction being given as the 
contractor's working capital approaches zero. Positive consideration 
should be given for payments less frequent than monthly with additional 
consideration given for a capital turn-over rate on the contract which 
is less than the contractor's or the industry's normal capital turn-over 
rate.
    (iii) Performance. (Cost-control and other past accomplishments.) 
The contractor's past performance should be evaluated in such areas as 
quality of service or product, meeting performance schedules, efficiency 
in cost control (including need for and reasonableness of cost 
incurred), accuracy and reliability of previous cost estimates, degree 
of cooperation by the contractor (both business and technical), timely 
processing of changes and compliance with other contractual provisions, 
and management of subcontract programs. Where a contractor has 
consistently achieved excellent results in these areas in comparison 
with other contractors in similar circumstances, this performance merits 
a proportionately greater opportunity for profit. Conversely, a poor 
record in this regard should be reflected in determining what 
constitutes a fair and reasonable profit.
    (iv) Federal socioeconomic programs. This factor, which may apply to 
special circumstances or particular acquisitions, relates to the extent 
of a contractor's successful participation in Government sponsored 
programs such as small business, small disadvantaged business, women-
owned small business, and energy conservation efforts. The contractor's 
policies and procedures which energetically support Government 
socioeconomic programs and achieve successful results should be given 
positive considerations. Conversely, failure or unwillingness on the 
part of the contractor to support Government socioeconomic programs 
should be viewed as evidence of poor performance for the purpose of 
establishing a profit objective.
    (v) Special situations (A) Inventive and developmental 
contributions. The extent and nature of contractor-initiated and 
financed independent development should be considered in developing the 
profit objective, provided that the contracting officer has made a 
determination that the effort will benefit the contract. The importance 
of the development in furthering health and human services purposes, the 
demonstrable initiative in determining the need and application of the 
development, the extent of the contractor's cost risk, and whether the 
development cost was recovered directly or indirectly from Government 
sources should be weighed.
    (B) Unusual pricing agreements. Occasionally, unusual contract 
pricing arrangements are made with the contractor wherein it agrees to 
cost ceilings, e.g., a ceiling on overhead rates for conditions other 
than those discussed at FAR 42.707. In these circumstances, the 
contractor should receive favorable consideration in developing the 
profit objective.
    (C) Negative factors. Special situations need not be limited to 
those which only increase profit levels. A negative consideration may be 
appropriate when the contractor is expected to obtain spin-off-benefits 
as a direct result of the contract (e.g., products or services with 
commercial application).
    (4) Facilities capital cost of money. When facilities capital cost 
of money (cost of capital committed to facilities) is included as an 
item of cost in the contractor's proposal, a reduction in the profit 
objective shall be made in an

[[Page 47]]

amount equal to the amount of facilities capital cost of money allowed 
in accordance with the Facilities Capital Cost-of Money Cost Principal. 
If the contractor does not propose this cost, a provision must be 
inserted in the contract that facilities capital cost of money is not an 
allowable cost.

limits of advance guidance set forth in FAR 15.604 resulting in an 
unfair advantage to an offeror, the contracting officer shall ensure 
that the following certification is furnished to the prospective offeror 
and the executed certification is included as part of the resultant 
unsolicited proposal:

                          Unsolicited Proposal

                        Certification by Offeror

    This is to certify, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that:
    (a) This proposal has not been prepared under Government 
supervision.
    (b) The methods and approaches stated in the proposal were developed 
by this offeror.
    (c) Any contact with employees of the Department of Health and Human 
Services has been within the limits of appropriate advance guidance set 
forth in FAR 15.604.
    (d) No prior commitments were received from departmental employees 
regarding acceptance of this proposal.

Date:___________________________________________________________________

Organization:___________________________________________________________

Name:___________________________________________________________________

Title:__________________________________________________________________

(This certification shall be signed by a responsible official of the 
proposing organization or a person authorized to contractually obligate 
the organization.)


<R05>
315.606  Agency procedures.

    (a) The HCA is responsible for establishing procedures to comply 
with FAR 15.606(a).
    (b) The HCA or his/her designee shall be the point of contract for 
coordinating the receipt and handling of unsolicited proposals.


<R05>
315.606-1  Receipt and initial review.

    (d) An unsolicited proposal shall not be refused consideration 
merely because it was initially submitted as a grant application. 
However, contracts shall not be awarded on the basis of unsolicited 
proposals which have been rejected for grant support on the grounds that 
they lack scientific merit.


<R05>
315.609  Limited use of data.

    The legend, Use and Disclosure of Data, prescribed in FAR 15.609(a) 
is to be used by the offeror to restrict the use of data for evaluation 
purposes only. However, data contained within the unsolicited proposal 
may have to be disclosed as a result of a request submitted pursuant to 
the Freedom of Information Act. Because of this possibility, the 
following notice shall be furnished to all prospective offerors of 
unsolicited proposals whenever the legend is provided in accordance with 
FAR 15.604(a)(7):

    The Government will attempt to comply with the ``Use and Disclosure 
of Data'' legend.
    However, the Government may not be able to withhold a record (data, 
document, etc.) nor deny access to a record requested by an individual 
(the public) when an obligation is imposed on the Government under the 
Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended. The Government 
determination to withhold or disclose a record will be based upon the 
particular circumstances involving the record in question and whether 
the record may be exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of 
Information Act. Records which the offeror considers to be trade secrets 
and commercial or financial information and privileged or confidential 
must be identified by the offeror as indicated in the referenced legend.

    (a) If the contract is with a hospital (profit or nonprofit) for 
research and development, modify the ``Allowable Cost and Payment'' 
clause at FAR 52.216-7 by deleting from paragraph (a) the words 
``Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)'' and 
substituting ``45 CFR Part 74 Appendix E.''
    (j) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.216-72, 
Additional Cost Principles, in all solicitations and resultant cost-
reimbursement contracts.


<R04>
   Subpart 316.6--Time-and-Materials, Labor-Hour, and Letter Contracts

    An official one level above the contracting officer shall execute 
the prescribed written statement.


<R05>
316.603-70  Information to be furnished when requesting authority to issue 
a letter contract.

    The following information should be included by the contracting 
officer in any memorandum requesting approval to issue a letter 
contract:

    (b) Location where contract is to be performed.
    (c) Contract number, including modification number, if possible.

the use of the proposed letter contract.
    (j) Statement of percentage of the estimated cost that the 
obligation of funds represents. In rare instances where the obligation 
represents 50 percent or more of the proposed estimated cost of the 
acquisition, a justification for that obligation must be included which 
would indicate the basis and necessity for the obligation (e.g., the 
contractor requires a large initial outlay of funds for major 
subcontract awards or an extensive purchase of materials to meet an 
urgent delivery requirement). In every case, documentation must assure 
that the amount to be obligated is not in excess of an amount reasonably 
required to perform the work.
    (k) Period of effectiveness of a proposed letter contract. If more 
than 180 days, complete justification must be given.
    (l) Statement of any substantive matters that need to be resolved.


<R05>
316.603-71  Approval for modifications to letter contracts.

    All letter contract modifications (amendments) must be approved one 
level above the contracting officer. Request for authority to issue 
letter contract modifications shall be processed in the same manner as 
requests for authority to issue letter contracts and shall include the 
following:
    (a) Name and address of the contractor.
    (b) Description of work and services.
    (c) Date original request was approved and indicate approving 
official.
    (d) Letter contract number and date issued.
    (e) Complete justification as to why the letter contract cannot be 
definitized at this time.
    (f) Complete justification as to why the level of funding must be 
increased.
    (g) Complete justification as to why the period of effectiveness is 
increased beyond 180 days, if applicable.

[[Page 49]]

    (h) If the funding of the letter contract is to be increased to more 
than 50 percent of the estimated cost of the acquisition, the 
information required by 316.603-70(j) must be included.

<R05>
316.770  Unauthorized types of agreements.


<R05>
316.770-1  Letters of intent.

    A letter of intent is an informal unauthorized agreement between the 
Government and a prospective contractor which indicates that products or 
services will be produced after completion of funding and/or other 
contractual formalities. Letters of intent are often solicited by 
prospective contractors or may be originated by Government personnel. 
Letters of intent are not authorized by the FAR and are prohibited for 
use by Department personnel.


<R05>
316.770-2  Memorandums of understanding.

    A ``memorandum of understanding'' is an unauthorized agreement, 
usually drafted during the course of negotiations, to modify mandatory 
FAR and HHSAR provisions in such a manner as to make them more 
acceptable to a prospective contractor. It may be used to bind the 
contracting officer in attempting to exercise rights given the 
Government under the contract, or may contain other matters directly 
contrary to the language of the solicitation or prospective contractual 
document. Use of memorandums of understanding is not authorized. Any 
change in a solicitation or contract shall be made by amendment or 
modification to that document. When a change to a prescribed contract 
clause is considered necessary, a deviation shall be requested.

    (d) The functional management responsibilities for the Department's 
Small Business Program, (small, HUBZone, small disadvantaged, and women-
owned small business programs) are delegated to the Director of the 
Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU).
    (e) (1) The Department's Small Business Program shall be carried out 
by appointed small business specialists (SBS) at the OPDIV Level. 
Appointments, and termination of appointments, shall be made in writing 
by the head of the OPDIV after consultation and concurrence by the 
Director, OSDBU. The small business specialist shall be responsible 
directly to the appointing authority and shall be at an organizational 
level outside the direct acquisition chain of command, i.e., should 
report directly to the head of the OPDIV or designee. The Director, 
OSDBU will exercise functional management authority over small business 
specialists regarding the small business programs.
    (2) The head of each OPDIV shall appoint a qualified full-time small 
business specialist (SBS) in the following activities: Administration 
for Children and Families (ACF), Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality (AHRQ), Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), Health Resources and Services Administration 
(HRSA), Indian Health Service (IHS), National Institutes of Health 
(NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), and Program 
Support Center (PSC). A SBS shall also be appointed for the Office of 
the Secretary (OS). As deemed necessary, additional small business 
specialists may be appointed in larger contracting activities. When the 
volume of contracting does not warrant assignment of a full-time SBS, an 
individual shall be appointed as the specialist on a part-time basis. 
The responsibilities of this assignment shall take precedence over other 
responsibilities.

contracting officer's recommendation. If the contracting officer 
disapproves the SBS's set-aside recommendation, the reasons must be 
documented on the Form HHS-653, and the form placed in the contract 
file. The contracting officer will make the final determination as to 
whether the proposed acquisition will be set-aside or not.

    This subpart prescribes the use of a safety and health clause in 
contracts involving hazardous materials or operations, and provides 
procedures for administering safety and health provisions.


<R05>
323.7001  Policy.

    Various statutes and regulations (e.g. Walsh-Healy Act; Service 
Contract Act) require adherence to minimum safety and health standards 
by contractors engaged in potentially hazardous work. The guidance 
contained in FAR subpart 23.3 shall be used for hazardous materials as 
the primary reference. When the guidance is judged insufficient or does 
not meet the safety and health situation in the instant acquisition, 
this subpart shall be followed.


<R05>
323.7002  Actions required.

    (a) Contracting activities. Contracting activities shall use the 
clause set forth in 352.223-70, or a clause reading substantially the 
same, in prospective contracts and subcontracts involving hazardous 
materials or operations for the following:
    (1) Services or products;
    (2) Research, development, or test projects;
    (3) Transportation of hazardous materials; and
    (4) Construction, including construction of facilities on the 
contractor's premises.
    (b) Safety officers. OPDIV safety officers shall advise and assist 
initiators of acquisition requests and contracting officers in:
    (1) Determining whether safety and health provisions should be 
included in a prospective contract;
    (2) Evaluating a prospective contractor's safety and health 
programs; and
    (3) Conducting post-award reviews and surveillance to the extent 
deemed necessary.
    (c) Initiators. Initiators of acquisition requests for items 
described in paragraph (a) of this section shall:
    (1) During the preparation of a request for contract, and in the 
solicitation, ensure that hazardous materials and operations to be used 
in the performance of the contract are clearly identified; and
    (2) During the period of performance:
    (i) Apprise the contracting office of any noncompliance with safety 
and health provisions identified in the contract; and
    (ii) Cooperate with the safety officer in conducting review and 
surveillance activities.

<R04>
             Subpart 324.1--Protection of Individual Privacy


<R05>
324.100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart implements 45 CFR Part 5b, Privacy Act Regulations, and 
FAR Subpart 24.1, Protection of Individual Privacy, which implements the 
Privacy Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-579, December 31, 1974; 5 U.S.C. 
552a) and OMB Circular No. A-108, July 9, 1975.


<R05>
324.102  General.

    (a) It is the Department's policy to protect the privacy of 
individuals to the maximum possible extent while permitting the exchange 
of records required to fulfill the Department's administrative and 
program responsibilities and its responsibilities for disclosing records 
to which the general public is entitled under the Freedom of Information 
Act (5 U.S.C. 552). The Privacy Act of 1974 and the Department's 
implementation under 45 CFR part 5b apply ``when an agency provides by a 
contract for the operation by or on behalf of the agency of a system of 
records to accomplish any agency function* * *'' The key factor is 
whether a departmental function is involved. Therefore, the Privacy Act 
requirements apply to a departmental contract when, under the contract, 
the contractor must maintain or operate a system of records to 
accomplish a departmental function.
    (e) The program official, and, as necessary, the official designated 
as the activity's Privacy Act Coordinator and the Office of General 
Counsel, shall determine the applicability of the Act to each proposed 
acquisition. The program official is required to include a statement in 
the request for contract indicating whether the Privacy Act is or is not 
applicable to the proposed acquisition.
    (f) Whenever the contracting officer is informed that the Privacy 
Act is not applicable, but the resultant contract will involve the 
collection of individually identifiable personal data by the contractor, 
the contracting officer shall include provisions to protect the 
confidentiality of the records and the privacy of individuals identified 
in the records (see subpart 324.70).


<R05>
324.103  Procedures.

    (a) All requests for contract shall be reviewed by the contracting 
officer to determine whether the Privacy Act requirements are 
applicable. If applicable, the contracting officer shall include the 
solicitation notification and contract clause required by FAR 24.104 in 
the solicitation, and the contract clause in the resultant contract. In 
addition, the contracting officer shall ensure that the solicitation 
notification, contract clause, and other pertinent information specified 
in this subpart are included in any contract modification which results 
in the Privacy Act requirements becoming applicable to a contract.
    (b)(1) The contracting officer shall identify the system(s) of 
records on individuals in solicitations, contracts, and contract 
modifications to which the Privacy Act and the implementing regulations 
are applicable.
    (2) The contracting officer shall include a statement in the 
contract notifying the contractor that the contractor and its employees 
are subject to criminal penalties for violations of the Act (5 U.S.C. 
552a(i)) to the same extent as employees of the Department. The 
statement shall require that

[[Page 54]]

the contractor assure that each contractor employee knows the prescribed 
rules of conduct, and each contractor employee is aware that he/she can 
be subjected to criminal penalties for violations of the Act. The 
contracting officer shall provide the contractor with a copy of the 
rules of conduct and other requirements set forth in 45 CFR part 5b.
    (c) The contracting officer shall include in the contract the 
disposition to be made of the system(s) of records on individuals upon 
completion of performance of the contract. For example, the contract may 
require the contractor to completely destroy the records, to remove 
personal identifiers, to turn the records over to the Department, or to 
keep the records but take certain measures to keep the records 
confidential and protect the individuals' privacy.
    (d) Whenever an acquisition is determined to be subject to the 
Privacy Act requirements, a ``system notice,'' prepared by the program 
official and describing the Department's intent to establish a new 
system of records on individuals, to make modifications to an existing 
system, or to disclose information in regard to an existing system, is 
required to be published in the Federal Register. A copy of the ``system 
notice'' shall be attached to the request for contract or purchase 
request. If a ``system notice'' is not attached, the contracting officer 
shall inquire about its status and shall obtain a copy from the program 
official for inclusion in the contract file. If a ``system notice'' has 
not been published in the Federal Register, the contracting officer may 
proceed with the acquisition but shall not award the contract until the 
``system notice'' is published, and publication is verified by the 
contracting officer.


<R04>
                Subpart 324.2--Freedom of Information Act


<R05>
324.202  Policy.

    (a) The Department's regulation implementing the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, is set forth in 45 CFR 
part 5.
    (b) The contracting officer, upon receiving a FOIA request, shall 
follow Department and operating division procedures. As necessary, 
actions should be coordinated with the cognizant Freedom of Information 
(FOI) Officer and the Business and Administrative Law Division of the 
Office of General Counsel. The contracting officer must remember that 
only the FOI Officer has the authority to release or deny release of 
records. While the contracting officer should be familiar with the 
entire FOIA regulation in 45 CFR part 5, particular attention should be 
focused on Sec.Sec. 5.65 and 5.66; also of interest are Sec.Sec. 5.32, 
5.33, and 5.35.


<R04>
             Subpart 324.70--Confidentiality of Information


<R05>
324.7001  General.

    In performance of certain HHS contracts, it is necessary for the 
contractor to generate data, or be furnished data by the Government, 
which is about individuals, organizations, or Federal programs. This 
subpart and the accompanying contract clause require contractors to 
prudently handle disclosure of certain types of information not subject 
to the Privacy Act or the HHS human subject regulations set forth in 45 
CFR part 46. This subpart and contract clause address the kinds of data 
to be generated by the contractor and/or data to be furnished by the 
Government that are considered confidential and how it should be 
treated.


<R05>
324.7002  Policy.

    It is the policy of HHS to protect personal interests of 
individuals, corporate interests of non-governmental organizations, and 
the capacity of the Government to provide public services when 
information from or about individuals, organizations, or Federal 
agencies is provided to or obtained by contractors in performance of HHS 
contracts. This protection depends on the contractor's recognition and 
proper handling of the information. As a result, the ``Confidentiality 
of Information'' contract clause was developed.


<R05>
324.7003  Applicability.

    (a) The ``Confidentiality of Information'' clause, set forth in 
352.224-70,

[[Page 55]]

should be used in solicitations and resultant contracts whenever the 
need exists to keep information confidential. Examples of situations 
where the clause may be appropriate include:
    (1) Studies performed by the contractor which generate information 
or involve Government-furnished information that is personally 
identifiable, such as medical records, vital statistics, surveys, and 
questionnaires;
    (2) Contracts which involve the use of salary structures, wage 
schedules, proprietary plans or processes, or confidential financial 
information of organizations other than the contractor's; and
    (3) Studies or research which may result in preliminary or 
invalidated findings which, upon disclosure to the public, might create 
erroneous conclusions which, if acted upon, could threaten public health 
or safety.
    (b) With regard to protecting individuals, this subpart and contract 
clause are not meant to regulate or control the method of selecting 
subjects and performing studies or experiments involving them. These 
matters are dealt with in the HHS regulation entitled ``Protection of 
Human Subjects,'' 45 CFR Part 46. If a system of records under contract, 
or portions thereof, is determined to be subject to the requirements of 
the Privacy Act, in accordance with FAR 24.1 and 324.1 and Title 45 CFR 
part 5b, the procedures cited in those references are applicable and the

<R04>
                     Subpart 332.7--Contract Funding


<R05>
332.702  Policy.

    An incrementally funded contract is a contract in which the total 
work effort is to be performed over multiple time periods and funds are 
allotted to cover discernible phases or increments of performance.
    (a) Incremental funding may be applied to cost-reimbursement type 
contracts for the acquisition of research and development and other 
types of nonpersonal, nonseverable services. It shall not be applied to 
contracts for construction services, architect-engineer services, or 
severable services.Incremental funding allows nonseverable cost-
reimbursement contracts, awarded for more than one year, to be funded 
from succeeding fiscal years.
    (b) It is departmental policy that contracts for projects of 
multiple year duration be fully funded, whenever possible, to cover the 
entire project. However, incrementally funded contracts may be used 
when:
    (1) A project, which is part of an approved program, is anticipated 
to be of multiple year duration, but funds are not currently available 
to cover the entire project;
    (2) The project represents a valid need for the fiscal year in which 
the contract is awarded and of the succeeding fiscal years of the 
project's duration, during which additional funds

[[Page 59]]

may be obligated by increasing the allotment to the contract;
    (3) The project is so significant to the approved program that there 
is reasonable assurance that it will command a high priority for 
proposed appropriations to cover the entire multiple year duration; and
    (4) The statement of work is specific and is defined by separate 
phases or increments so that, at the completion of each, progress can be 
effectively measured.


<R05>
332.703  Contract funding requirements.


<R05>
332.703-1  General.

    (b) The following general guidelines are applicable to incrementally 
funded contracts:
    (1) The estimated total cost of the project (all planned phases or 
increments) is to be taken into consideration when determining the 
requirements which must be met before entering into the contract; i.e., 
justification for noncompetitive acquisition, approval or award, etc.
    (2) The RFP and resultant contract are to include a statement of 
work which describes the total project covering the proposed multiple 
year period of performance and indicating timetables consistent with 
planned phases or increments and corresponding allotments of funds.
    (3) Offerors will be expected to respond to RFPs with technical and 
cost proposals for the entire project indicating distinct break-outs of 
the planned phases or increments, and the multiple year period of 
performance.
    (4) Negotiations will be conducted based upon the total project, 
including all planned phases or increments, and the multiple year period 
of performance.
    (5) Sufficient funds must be obligated under the basic contract to 
cover no less than the first year of performance, unless the contracting 
officer determines it is advantageous to the Government to fund the 
contract for a lesser period. In that event, the contracting officer 
shall ensure that the obligated funds are sufficient to cover a complete 
phase or increment of performance representing a material and measurable 
part of the total project, and the contract period shall be reduced 
accordingly.
    (6) Because of the magnitude of the scope of work and multiple year 
period of performance under an incrementally funded contract, there is a 
critical need for careful program planning. Program planning must 
provide for appropriate surveillance of the contractor's performance and 
adequate controls to ensure that projected funding will not impinge on 
the program office's ability to support, within anticipated 
appropriations, other equally important contract or grant programs.
    (7) An incrementally funded contract must contain precise 
requirements for progress reports to enable the project officer to 
effectively monitor the contract. The project officer should be required 
to prepare periodic performance evaluation reports to facilitate the 
program office's ultimate decision to allot additional funds under the 
contract.

332.704  Limitation of cost or funds.

connection with anticipated cost overruns, see subpart 342.71


<R05>

<R05>
332.705-2  Clauses for limitation of costs or funds.

    (c)(1) When using the Limitation of Funds clause (FAR 52.232-22) in 
the solicitation and resultant incrementally funded contract, the 
contracting officer shall insert the following legend between the clause 
title and the clause text:

(This clause supersedes the Limitation of Cost clause found in the 
General Provisions of this contract.)

    (2) The contracting officer shall also include a clause reading 
substantially as that shown in 352.232-74 in the Special Provisions of 
the resultant incrementally funded contract.
    (3) The request for proposals must inform prospective offerors of 
the Department's intention to enter into an incrementally funded 
contract. Therefore, the contracting officer shall include the provision 
at 352.232-75 in the request for proposals whenever the use

[[Page 60]]

of incremental funding is contemplated.

<R04>
                         Subpart 333.1--Protests


<R05>
333.102  General.

    (a) Contracting officers shall consider all protests or objections 
regarding the award of a contract, whether submitted before or after 
award, provided the protests are filed in a timely manner and are 
submitted by interested parties. To be considered timely, protests based 
on alleged improprieties in any type of solicitation which are apparent 
before bid opening or the closing date for receipt of proposals shall be 
filed prior to bid opening or the closing date for receipt of proposals. 
In the case of negotiated acquisitions, alleged improprieties which do 
not exist in initial solicitations, but which are subsequently 
incorporated by amendment, must be protested not later than the next 
closing date for receipt of proposals following the incorporation of the 
amendment. In other cases, protests shall be filed not later than ten 
(10) calendar days after the basis for protest is known or should have 
been known, whichever is earlier. Provided a protest has been filed 
initially with the contracting officer, any subsequent protest to the 
Secretary or GAO filed within ten (10) calendar days of notification of 
adverse action will be considered. Written confirmation of all oral 
protests shall be requested from protestants and must be timely filed.
    (g)(1) The Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) has been 
designated as the headquarters office to serve as the liaison for 
protests lodged with GAO. Within the OAM, the Departmental Protest 
Control Officer (DPCO) has been designated as the individual to be 
contacted by GAO.
    (2) Each contracting activity shall designate a protest control 
officer to serve as an advisor to the contracting officer and to monitor 
protests from the time of initial notification until the protest has 
been resolved. The protest control officer should be a senior 
acquisition specialist in the headquarters acquisition staff office. In 
addition, contracting activities should designate similar officials 
within their principal components to the extent practicable and 
feasible. A copy of each appointment and termination of appointment of 
protest control officers shall be forwarded to the Director, OAM.


<R05>
333.103  Protests to the agency.

    (f)(1) The contracting officer is authorized to make the 
determination, using the criteria in FAR 33.104(b), to award a contract 
notwithstanding the protest after obtaining the concurrence of the 
contracting activity's protest control officer and the Office of General 
Counsel--Business and Administrative Law Division (OGC-BAL). If the 
protest has been lodged with the Secretary, is addressed to the 
Secretary,

[[Page 61]]

or requests referral to the Secretary, approval shall also be obtained 
from the Director, OAM before making the award.
    (2) The contracting officer shall require written confirmation of 
any oral protest. To be considered timely, the written confirmation must 
be filed in accordance with the applicable provisions in 333.102(a). In 
the following cases, written protests received by the contracting 
officer before award shall be forwarded, through acquisition channels, 
to the DPCO for processing. Files concerning these protests shall be 
submitted in duplicate, or as otherwise specified by the DPCO and sent 
in the most expeditious manner, marked ``IMMEDIATE ACTION--PROTEST 
BEFORE AWARD'', and contain the documentation referenced in 
333.104(a)(3).
    (i) The protestant requests referral to the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services;
    (ii) The protest is known to have been lodged with the Comptroller 
General or the Secretary, or is addressed to either; or
    (iii) The contracting officer entertains some doubt as to the proper 
action regarding the protest or believes it to be in the best interest 
of the Government that the protest be considered by the Secretary or the 
Comptroller General. Otherwise, protests addressed to the contracting 
officer may be answered by the contracting officer, with the concurrence 
of the contracting activity's protest control officer and OGC-BAL.
    (3) Protests received after award shall be treated as indicated in 
FAR 33.103(b)(3).


<R05>
333.104  Protests to GAO.

    (a) General procedures. (3) Protests lodged with GAO, whether before 
or after award, shall be processed by the DPCO. Protest files shall be 
prepared by the contracting office and distributed as follows: two 
copies to the DPCO, one copy to the contracting activity's protest 
control officer, and one copy to OGC-BAL. Files shall include the 
following documentation:
    (i) The contracting officer's statement of facts and circumstances, 
including a discussion of the merits of the protest, and conclusions and 
recommendations, including documentary evidence on which they are based.
    (ii) A copy of the IFB or RFP.
    (iii) A copy of the abstract of bids or proposals.
    (iv) A copy of the bid or proposal of the successful offeror to whom 
award has been made or is proposed to be made.
    (v) A copy of the bid or proposal of the protestant, if any.
    (vi) The current status of award. When award has been made, this 
shall include whether performance has commenced, shipment or delivery 
has been made, or a stop work order has been issued.
    (vii) A copy of any mutual agreement to suspend work on a no-cost 
basis, when appropriate (see FAR 33.104(c)(4)).
    (viii) Copies of the notice of protest given offerors and other 
parties when the notice is appropriate (see FAR 33.104(a)(2)).

a copy of each evaluator's rating for relevant proposals.
    (x) A copy of the negotiation memorandum, when applicable.
    (xi) The name and telephone number of the person in the contracting 
office who may be contacted for information relevant to the protest.
    (xii) A copy of the competitive range memorandum. and
    (xiii) Any document which is referred to in the contracting 
officer's statement of facts. The files shall be assembled in an orderly 
manner and shall include an index of enclosures.
    (4) The DPCO is responsible for making the necessary distributions 
referenced in FAR 33.104 (a)(4).
    (5) The contracting officer shall furnish the protest file 
containing the documentation specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, except the item in paragraph (a)(3)(i), to the DPCO within 
fourteen (14) calendar days from receipt of the protest. The contracting 
officer shall provide the documentation required by item (a)(3)(i) of 
this section to the DPCO within twenty-one (21) calendar days from 
receipt of the protest. Since the statute allows only a short time 
period in which to respond

[[Page 62]]

to protests lodged with GAO, the contracting officer shall handle each 
protest on a priority basis. The DPCO shall prepare the report and 
submit it and the protest file to GAO in accordance with FAR 
33.104(a)(4)(i).
    (6) Since the DPCO will furnish the report to GAO, the protestor, 
and other interested parties, comments on the report from the protestor 
and other interested parties will be requested to be sent to the DPCO.
    (7) The Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) has been designated 
as the headquarters office, and the DPCO as the individual, that GAO 
should contact concerning all protests lodged with GAO.
    (b) Protests before award. (1) To make an award notwithstanding a 
protest, the contracting officer shall prepare a finding using the 
criteria in FAR 33.104(b)(1), have it executed by the head of the 
contracting activity (HCA)(not delegable), and forward it, along with a 
written request for approval to make the award, to the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Grants and Acquisition Management (DASGAM).
    (2) If the request to make an award notwithstanding the protest is 
approved by the DASGAM, the DPCO shall notify GAO. Whether the request 
is approved or not, the DPCO shall telephonically notify the contracting 
activity's protest control officer of the decision of the DASGAM, and 
the contracting activity's protest control officer shall immediately 
notify the contracting officer. The DPCO shall confirm the decision by 
memorandum to the contracting activity's protest control officer.
    (4) The contracting officer shall prepare the protest file in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and forward the 
required number of copies to the DPCO (see paragraph (a)(5) of this 
section).
    (c) Protests after award. (2) If the contracting officer believes 
performance should be allowed to continue notwithstanding the protest, a 
finding shall be prepared by the contracting officer using the criteria 
in FAR 33.104(c)(2), executed by the HCA (not delegable), and forwarded, 
along with a written request for approval, to the Director, OAM. The 
same procedures for notification stated in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section shall be followed.
    (6) The contracting officer shall prepare the protest file in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and forward the 
required number of copies to the DPCO (see paragraph (a)(5) of this 
section).
    (d) Findings and notice. The contracting officer shall perform the 
actions required by FAR 33.104 (d); however, notification to GAO and 
other interested parties shall be made by the DPCO.
    (g) Notice to GAO. The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Grants and 
Acquisition Management shall be the official to comply with the 
requirements of FAR 33.104 (g).
    (i) Express option. When GAO invokes the express option, the 
contracting officer shall prepare the complete protest file as described 
in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, to include the item in paragraph 
(a)(3)(i), and deliver it (hand-carry, if necessary) to the DPCO in time 
to meet the submittal date established by GAO. The DPCO will notify the 
contracting officer of the submittal date after GAO has finalized its 
requirements.

proceedings, and affidavits or statements of any witness on the matter 
in dispute made prior to the filing of the notice of appeal with the 
Board; and
    (5) Any additional information considered pertinent. The contracting 
officer shall furnish the appeal file to the Government Trial Attorney 
for review and approval. After approval, the contracting officer shall 
prepare four copies of the file, one for the ASBCA, one for the 
appellant, one for the Government Trial Attorney, and one for the 
contracting office.
    (d) At all times after the filing of an appeal, the contracting 
officer shall render whatever assistance is requested by the Government 
Trial Attorney. When an appeal is set for hearing, the concerned 
contracting officer, acting under the guidance of the Government Trial 
Attorney, shall be responsible for arranging for the presence of 
Government witnesses and specified physical and documentary evidence at 
both the pre-hearing conference and hearing.
    (e) If a contractor which has filed an appeal with the ASBCA elects 
to accept fully the decision from which the appeal was taken, or any 
modification to it, and gives written notification of acceptance to the 
Government Trial Attorney or the concerned contracting officer, the 
Government Trial Attorney will notify the ASBCA of the disposition of 
the dispute in accordance with Rule 27 of the ASBCA.
    (f) If the contractor has elected to appeal to the U.S. Court of 
Federal Claims, the U.S. Department of Justice will represent the 
Department. However, the contracting officer shall still coordinate all 
actions through OGC-BAL.

<R05>
335.070  Cost-sharing.


<R05>
335.070-1  Policy.

    (a) The use of cost-sharing type contracts should be encouraged to 
contribute to the cost of performing research where there is a 
probability that the contractor will receive present or future benefits 
from participation, such as, increased technical know-how, training to 
employees, acquisition of equipment, use of background knowledge in 
future contracts, etc. Cost-sharing is intended to serve the mutual 
interests of the Government and the performing organization by helping 
to assure efficient utilization of the resources available for the 
conduct of research projects and by promoting sound planning and prudent 
fiscal policies by the performing organization. Encouragement should be 
given to organizations to contribute to the cost of performing research 
under contracts unless the contracting officer determines that a request 
for cost-sharing would not be appropriate because of the following 
circumstances:
    (1) The particular research objective or scope of effort for the 
project is specified by the Government rather than proposed by the 
performing organization. This would usually include any formal 
Government request for proposals for a specific project.
    (2) The research effort has only minor relevance to the non-Federal 
activities of the performing organization, and the organization is 
proposing to undertake the research primarily as a service to the 
Government.
    (3) The organization has little or no non-Federal sources or funds 
from which to make a cost contribution. Cost-sharing should generally 
not be requested if cost-sharing would require the Government to provide 
funds through some other means (such as fees) to enable the organization 
to cost-share. It should be recognized that those organizations which 
are predominantly engaged in research and development and have little or 
no production or other service activities may not be in a favorable 
position to make a cost contribution.
    (b) The responsibility for negotiating cost-sharing is that of the 
contracting office. Each research contract file should show whether the 
contracting officer considered cost-sharing appropriate for that 
particular contract and in what amount. If cost-sharing was not 
considered appropriate, the file must indicate the factual basis for 
that decision, e.g., ``Because the contractor will derive no benefits 
from this award that can be applied to its commercial activities, cost-
sharing is not considered appropriate.'' The contracting officer may 
wish to coordinate with the project officer before documenting this 
decision.
    (c) If the contracting officer considers cost-sharing to be 
appropriate for a research contract and the contractor refuses to accept 
this type of contract, the award may be made without cost-sharing, if 
the contracting officer concludes that payment of the

[[Page 66]]

full cost of the research effort is necessary in order to obtain the 
services of that particular contractor.


<R05>
335.070-2  Amount of cost-sharing.

    When cost-sharing is determined to be appropriate, the following 
guidelines shall be utilized in determining the amount of cost 
participation by the contractor.
    (a) The amount of cost participation should depend to a large extent 
on whether the research effort or results are likely to enhance the 
performing organization's capability, expertise, or competitive 
position, and the value of this enhancement to the performing 
organization. It should be recognized that those organizations which are 
predominantly engaged in research and development have little or no 
production or other service activities and may not be in a favorable 
position to derive a monetary benefit from their research under Federal 
agreements. Therefore, contractor cost participation could reasonably 
range from as little as 1 percent or less of the total project cost, to 
more than 50 percent of the total project cost. Ultimately, the 
contracting officer should bear in mind that cost-sharing is a 
negotiable item. As such, the amount of cost-sharing should be 
proportional to the anticipated value of the contractor's gain.
    (b) If the performing organization will not acquire title or the 
right to use inventions, patents, or technical information resulting 
from the research project, it would generally be appropriate to obtain 
less cost-sharing than in cases in which the performer acquires these 
rights.
    (c) A fee or profit will usually not be paid to the performing 
organization if the organization is to contribute to the cost of the 
research effort, but the amount of cost-sharing may be reduced to 
reflect the fact that the organization is foregoing its normal fee or 
profit in the research. However, if the research is expected to be of 
only minor value to the performing organization and if cost-sharing is 
not required by statute, it may be appropriate for the performer to make 
a contribution in the form of a reduced fee or profit rather than 
sharing costs of the project.
    (d) The organization's participation may be considered over the 
total term of the project so that a relatively high contribution in one 
year may be offset by a relatively low contribution in another.
    (e) A relatively low degree of cost-sharing may be appropriate if, 
in the view of the operating divisions or their subordinate elements, an 
area of research requires special stimulus in the national interest.


<R05>
335.070-3  Method of cost-sharing.

    Cost-sharing on individual contracts may be accomplished either by a 
contribution of part or all of one or more elements of allowable cost of 
the work being performed, or by a fixed amount or stated percentage of 
the total allowable costs of the project. Costs so contributed may not 
be charged to the Government under any other grant or contract 
(including allocations to other grants or contracts as part of any 
independent research and development program).


<R05>
335.070-4  Contract award.

    In consonance with the Department's objectives of competition and 
support of the small business program, award of contracts should not be 
made solely on the basis of ability or willingness to cost-share. Awards 
should be made primarily on the contractor's competence and only after 
adequate competition has been obtained among large and small business 
organizations whenever possible. The offeror's willingness to share 
costs should not be considered in the technical evaluation process but 
as a business consideration, which is secondary to selecting the best 
qualified source.


<R05>
335.071  Special determinations and findings affecting research and 
development contracting.

    OPDIV heads for health agencies shall sign individual and class 
determinations and findings for:
    (a) Acquisition or construction of equipment or facilities on 
property not owned by the United States pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 241(a)(7); 
and
    (b) Use of an indemnification provision in a research contract 
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 241(a)(7).

<R05>
342.705  Final indirect cost rates.

    The Director, Division of Cost Allocation of the Program Support 
Center within the servicing HHS regional office has been delegated the 
authority to establish indirect cost rates, research patient care rates, 
and, as necessary, fringe benefit, computer, and other special costing 
rates for use in contracts and grants awarded to State and local 
governments, colleges and universities, hospitals, and other nonprofit 
organizations.


<R04>
                   Subpart 342.70--Contract Monitoring


<R05>
342.7001   Purpose.

    Contract monitoring is an essential element of contract 
administration and the acquisition process. This subpart describes the 
Department's operating concepts regarding contract monitoring, performed 
jointly by the project officer and the contracting officer, to ensure 
that the required monitoring is performed, timely remedial action is 
taken when necessary, and a determination is made that contract 
objectives have been met.


<R05>
342.7002  Contract monitoring responsibilities.

    (a) Upon execution of the contract, the mutual obligations of the 
Government and the contractor are established by, and limited to, the 
written stipulations in the contract. Unless authorized by the 
contracting officer, HHS personnel shall not direct or request the 
contractor to assume any obligation or take any actions not specifically 
required by the contract. Only the contracting officer may impose a 
requirement which will result in a change to the contract. All contract 
changes must be directed in writing or confirmed in writing by the 
contracting officer.
    (b) The contracting officer is responsible for assuring compliance 
with all terms of the contract, especially the statutory, legal, 
business, and regulatory provisions. Whether or not a postaward 
conference is held, the contracting officer shall inform the contractor 
by letter (if not already stipulated by contract provisions) of the 
authorities and responsibilities of the Government personnel with whom 
the contractor will be dealing throughout the life of the contract.
    (c) The contracting officer must depend on program, technical, and 
other personnel for assistance and advice in monitoring the contractor's 
performance, and in other areas of postaward administration. The 
contracting officer must assure that responsibilities assigned to these 
personnel are understood and carried out. The individual roles and 
corresponding responsibilities typically involve, but are not limited 
to, the following:
    (1) The role of program and technical personnel in monitoring the 
contract to assist or advise the contracting officer (or act as his/her 
representative when so designated by the contracting officer) in 
activities such as:

[[Page 68]]

    (i) Providing technical monitoring during contract performance, and 
issuing letters to the contractor and contracting officer relating to 
delivery, acceptance, or rejection in accordance with the terms of the 
contract;
    (ii) Assessing contractor performance, including inspection and 
testing of products and evaluation of reports and data;
    (iii) Recommending necessary changes to the schedule of work and 
period of performance in order to accomplish the objectives of the 
contract. This shall be accomplished by a written request to the 
contracting officer, together with an appropriate justification and 
funds availability citation;
    (iv) Reviewing invoices/vouchers and recommending approval/
disapproval action by the contracting officer, to include comments 
regarding anything unusual discovered in the review;
    (v) Reviewing and recommending approval or disapproval of 
subcontractors, overtime, travel, and key personnel changes; and
    (vi) Participating, as necessary, in various phases of the contract 
closeout process.
    (2) The role of the project officer in performing required aspects 
of the contract monitoring process. In addition to those applicable 
activities set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the project 
officer shall:
    (i) Submit periodic reports to the contracting officer that 
concisely explain the status of the contract, and include recommended 
actions for any problems reported. Provide the contracting officer with 
written notification of evaluation and approval/disapproval of contract 
deliverables and of completion of tasks or phases. The contracting 
officer will, in turn, provide the contractor with written notification 
of approval or disapproval unless the responsibility has been delegated 
by the contracting officer, in which case the person responsible for 
such action will notify the contractor and provide a copy to the 
contracting officer for inclusion in the contract file;
    (ii) Monitor the technical aspects of the contractor's business and 
technical progress, identify existing and potential problems that 
threaten performance, and immediately inform the contracting officer of 
deviations from contract objectives, or from any technical or delivery 
requirements, so that remedial measures may be instituted accordingly;
    (iii) Provide immediate notification to the head of the program 
office responsible for the program whenever it is determined that 
program objectives are not being met, together with specific 
recommendations of action to be taken. A copy of the project officer's 
report and recommendation shall be transmitted to the contracting 
officer for appropriate action;
    (iv) Submit, within 120 days after contract completion, a final 
assessment report to the contracting officer. The report should include 
analysis of the contractor's performance, including the contract and 
program objectives achieved and missed. A copy of the final assessment 
report shall be forwarded to the head of the program office responsible 
for the program for management review and follow-up, as necessary; and
    (v) Accompany and/or provide, when requested, technical support to 
the HHS auditor in the conduct of floor checks.
    (3) The role of the contract administrator, auditor, cost analyst, 
and property administrator in assisting or advising the contracting 
officer in postaward administration activities such as:
    (i) Evaluation of contractor systems and procedures, to include 
accounting policies and procedures, purchasing policies and practices, 
property accounting and control, wage and salary plans and rate 
structures, personnel policies and practices, etc.;
    (ii) Processing of disputes under the Disputes clause and any 
resultant appeals;
    (iii) Modification or termination of the contract; and
    (iv) Determination of the allowability of cost charges to incentive 
or cost-reimbursement type contracts and progress payments under fixed-
price contracts. This is especially important when award is made to new 
organizations or those with financial weaknesses.

[[Page 69]]

    (d) The contracting officer is responsible for assuring that 
contractor performance and contract monitoring are carried out in 
conformance with contract provisions. If performance is not satisfactory 
or if problems are anticipated, it is essential that the contracting 
officer take immediate action to protect the Government's rights under 
the contract. The contracting officer shall notify his/her immediate 
supervisor of problems that cannot be resolved within contract 
limitations and whenever contract or program objectives are not met. The 
notification shall include a statement of action being take by the 
contracting officer.


<R05>
342.7003  Withholding of contract payments.


<R05>
342.7003-1  Policy.

    (a) All solicitations and resultant contracts shall contain the 
withholding of contract payments clause at 352.232-9, and an excusable 
delays clause, or a clause which incorporates the definition of 
excusable delays. The excusable delays clause at 352.249-14 shall be 
used when the solicitation and resultant contract (other than purchase 
orders) does not contain a default or other excusable delays clause.
    (b) The transmittal letter used to convey the contract to each 
contractor shall contain a notice which highlights the contractor's 
agreement with the withholding of contract payments clause.
    (c) No contract payment shall be made when any report required to be 
submitted by the contractor is overdue, or the contractor fails to 
perform or deliver work or services as required by the contract.
    (d) The contracting officer shall issue a ten-day cure notice or 
initiate appropriate termination action for any failure in the 
contractor's performance as stated in paragraph (c) of this section.


<R05>
342.7003-2  Procedures.

    (a) The contracting officer is responsible for initiating immediate 
action to protect the Government's rights whenever the contractor fails 
to comply with either the delivery or reporting provisions of the 
contract. Compliance with the reporting provisions includes those 
reports to be submitted directly to the payment office. If such a report 
is not submitted on time, the contracting officer is to be notified 
promptly by the payment officer.
    (b) When the contract contains a termination for default clause, the 
contractor's failure to either submit any required report when due or 
perform or deliver services or work when required by the contract is to 
be considered a default in performance. In either circumstance, the 
contracting officer is to immediately issue a formal ten-day cure notice 
pursuant to the default clause. The cure notice is to follow the format 
prescribed in FAR 49.607 and is to include a statement to the effect 
that contract payments will be withheld if the default is not cured or 
is not determined to be excusable.
    (1) If the default is cured or is determined to be excusable, the 
contracting officer is not to initiate the withholding action.
    (2) If the default is not determined to be excusable or a response 
is not received within the allotted time, the contracting officer is to 
initiate withholding action on all contract payments and is to determine 
whether termination for default or other action would be in the best 
interest of the Government.
    (c) When the contract does not contain a termination for default 
clause, the contractor's failure to either submit any required report 
when due or perform or deliver services or work when required by the 
contract is to be considered a failure to perform. In either 
circumstance, the contracting officer is to immediately issue a written 
notice to the contractor specifying the failure and providing a period 
of ten days, or longer period as determined necessary by the contracting 
officer, in which the contractor is to cure the failure or establish an 
excusable delay. The contracting officer is to include a statement in 
the written notice to the effect that contract payments will be withheld 
if the failure is not cured or is not determined to be excusable.
    (1) If the failure is cured or is determined to be excusable, the 
contracting officer is not to initiate the withholding action.

[[Page 70]]

    (2) If the failure is not determined to be excusable or a response 
is not received within the allotted time, the contracting officer is to 
initiate withholding action on all contract payments and is to determine 
whether termination for convenience or other action would be in the best 
interest of the Government.
    (d) The contracting officer should consult FAR subpart 49.4 for 
further guidance before taking any of the actions described in this 
section.


<R05>
342.7003-3  Withholding payments.

    (a) When making the determination that contract payments should be 
withheld in accordance with the Withholding of Contract Payments clause, 
the contracting officer is to immediately notify the servicing finance 
office in writing of the determination to suspend payments. The notice 
of suspension is to contain all elements of information required by the 
payment office to properly identify the contract and the applicable 
accounts involved.
    (b) The contracting officer is to immediately notify the contractor 
in writing that payments have been suspended until the default or 
failure is cured.
    (c) When the contractor cures the default or failure, the 
contracting officer is to immediately notify, in writing, all recipients 
of the notice of suspension that the suspension is to be lifted and 
contract payments are to be resumed.
    (d) When exercising actions regarding the withholding of payment 
procedures, the contracting officer must be careful not to waive any of 
the Government's rights when corresponding with the contractor or when 
taking any other actions.


<R04>
        Subpart 342.71--Administrative Actions for Cost Overruns


<R05>
342.7100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth the procedures to be followed when a cost 
overrun is anticipated; i.e., the allowable actual cost of performing a 
cost-reimbursement type contract is expected to exceed the total 
estimated cost specified in the contract.


<R05>
342.7101  Contract administration.


<R05>
342.7101-1  General.

    Upon receipt of information that a contractor's accumulated cost and 
projected expenditures will exceed the limit of funds obligated by the 
contract, the contracting officer shall coordinate immediately with the 
appropriate program office to determine whether the contract should be 
modified or terminated. If the contracting officer receives information 
from a source other than the contractor that a cost overrun is 
anticipated, the contracting officer shall verify the information with 
the contractor, and remind the contractor of the notification 
requirements of the Limitation of Cost clause.


<R05>
342.7101-2  Procedures.

    (a) Upon notification that a cost overrun is anticipated, the 
contracting officer shall inform the contractor to submit a request for 
additional funds which is to include:
    (1) Name and address of contractor.
    (2) Contract number and expiration date.
    (3) Contract item(s) and amount(s) creating overrun.
    (4) The elements of cost which changed from the original estimate 
(i.e., labor, material, travel, overhead, etc.) to be furnished in the 
following format:
    (i) Original estimate,
    (ii) Costs incurred to date,
    (iii) Estimated cost to completion,
    (iv) Revised estimate, and
    (v) Amount of adjustment.
    (5) The factors responsible for the increase, i.e., error in 
estimate, changed conditions, etc.
    (6) The latest date by which funds must be available for commitment 
to avoid contract slippage, work stoppage, or other program impairment.
    (b) When the contractor submits a notice of an impending overrun, 
the contracting officer shall:
    (1) Immediately advise the appropriate program office and furnish a 
copy of the notice and any other data received;

[[Page 71]]

    (2) Request audit or cost advisory services, and technical support, 
as necessary, for evaluation of information and data received; and
    (3) Maintain continuous follow-up with the program office to obtain 
a timely decision as to whether the work under the contract should be 
continued and additional funds provided, or the contract terminated. The 
decision of the program office must be supported by an appropriate 
written statement and funding authority, or a formal request for 
termination, when applicable. After a programming and funding decision 
is received from the program office, the contracting officer shall 
promptly notify the contractor in writing that:
    (i) A specified amount of additional funds has been allotted to the 
contract by a contractual instrument; or
    (ii) Work will be discontinued when the funds allotted to the 
contract have been exhausted, and that any work performed after that 
date is at the contractor's risk; or
    (iii) The Government is considering whether additional funds should 
be allotted to the contract and will notify the contractor as soon as 
possible, but that any work performed after the funds then allocated to 
the contract have been exhausted is at the contractor's risk. Timely, 
formal notification of the Government's intention is essential in order 
to preclude loss of contractual rights in the event of dispute, 
termination, or litigation.
    (c) If program requirements permit, contracting officers should 
refrain from issuing any contractual documents which will require new 
work or an extension of time, pending resolution of an overrun or 
additional fund request.


<R05>
342.7102  Contract modifications.

    (a) Modifications to contracts containing the Limitation of Cost 
clause shall include either:
    (1) A provision increasing the estimated or ceiling amount referred 
to in the Limitation of Cost clause of the contract and stating that the 
clause will thereafter apply in respect to the increased amount; or
    (2) A provision stating that the estimated or ceiling amount 
referred to in the contract is not changed by the modification and that 
the Limitation of Cost clause will continue to apply with respect to the 
amount in effect prior to the modification.
    (b) A fixed-fee provided in a contract shall not be changed when 
funding a cost overrun. Changes in fixed-fee will be made only to 
reflect changes in the scope of work which justify an increase or 
decrease in fee.

352.215-1  Instructions to offerors--Competitive acquisition.

    Insert the following paragraph (e) in place of paragraph (e) of the 
provision at FAR 52.215-1:

    (e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. (1) The proposal 
submitted in response to this request may contain data (trade secrets; 
business data, e.g., commercial information, financial information, and 
cost and pricing data; and technical data) which the offeror, including 
its prospective subcontractor(s), does not want used or disclosed for 
any purpose other than for evaluation of the proposal. The use and 
disclosure of any data may be so restricted; provided, that the 
Government determines that the data is not required to be disclosed 
under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and the 
offeror marks the cover sheet of the proposal with the following legend, 
specifying the particular portions of the proposal which are to be 
restricted in accordance with the conditions of the legend. The 
Government's determination to withhold or disclose a record will be 
based upon the particular circumstances involving the record in question 
and whether the record may be exempted from disclosure under the Freedom 
of Information Act. The legend reads:
    Unless disclosure is required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 
U.S.C. 552, as

[[Page 73]]

amended, (the Act) as determined by Freedom of Information (FOI) 
officials of the Department of Health and Human Services, data contained 
in the portions of this proposal which have been specifically identified 
by page number, paragraph, etc. by the offeror as containing restricted 
information shall not be used or disclosed except for evaluation 
purposes.
    The offeror acknowledges that the Department may not be able to 
withhold a record (data, document, etc.) nor deny access to a record 
requested pursuant to the Act and that the Department's FOI officials 
must make that determination. The offeror hereby agrees that the 
Government is not liable for disclosure if the Department has determined 
that disclosure is required by the Act.
    If a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of, or in 
connection with, the submission of this proposal, the Government shall 
have right to use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the 
contract. Proposals not resulting in a contract remain subject to the 
Act.
    The offeror also agrees that the Government is not liable for 
disclosure or use of unmarked data and may use or disclose the data for 
any purpose, including the release of the information pursuant to 
requests under the Act. The data subject to this restriction are 
contained in pages (insert page numbers, paragraph designations, etc. or 
other identification).
    (2) In addition, the offeror should mark each page of data it wishes 
to restrict with the following statement:
    ``Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the 
restriction on the cover sheet of this proposal or quotation.''
    (3) Offerors are cautioned that proposals submitted with restrictive 
legends or statements differing in substance from the above legend may 
not be considered for award. The Government reserves the right to reject 
any proposal submitted with a nonconforming legend.

organization which is not sponsored by Federal or non-Federal contracts, 
grants, or other agreements.
    (2) Independent research and development shall be allocated its 
proportionate share of indirect costs on the same basis as the 
allocation of indirect costs to sponsored research and development.

    The following clause, or one reading substantially the same, shall 
be used as prescribed in 323.7002:

                      Safety and Health (JAN 2001)

    (a) To help ensure the protection of the life and health of all 
persons, and to help prevent damage to property, the Contractor shall 
comply with all Federal, State and local laws and regulations applicable 
to the work being performed under this contract. These laws are 
implemented and/or enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency, 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other agencies at the

[[Page 74]]

local levels (Federal, State and local regulatory/enforcement agencies).
    (b) Further, the Contractor shall take or cause to be taken 
additional safety measures as the Contracting Officer, in conjunction 
with the project or other appropriate officers, determines to be 
reasonably necessary. If compliance with these additional safety 
measures results in an increase or decrease in the cost or time required 
for performance of any part of work under this contract, an equitable 
adjustment will be made in accordance with the applicable ``Changes'' 
clause set forth in this contract.
    (c) The Contractor shall maintain an accurate record of, and 
promptly report to the Contracting Officer, all accidents or incidents 
resulting in the exposure of persons to toxic substances, hazardous 
materials or hazardous operations; the injury or death of any person; 
and/or damage to property incidental to work performed under the 
contract and all violations for which the Contractor has been cited by 
any Federal, State or local regulatory/enforcement agency. The report 
shall include a copy of the notice of violation and the findings of any 
inquiry or inspection, and an analysis addressing the impact these 
violations may have on the work remaining to be performed. The report 
shall also state the required action(s), if any, to be taken to correct 
any violation(s) noted by the Federal, State or local regulatory/
enforcement agency and the time frame allowed by the agency to 
accomplish the necessary corrective action.
    (d) If the Contractor fails or refuses to comply with the Federal, 
State or local regulatory/enforcement agency's directive(s) regarding 
any violation(s) and prescribed corrective action(s), the Contracting 
Officer may issue an order stopping all or part of the work until 
satisfactory corrective action (as approved by the Federal, State or 
local regulatory/enforcement agencies) has been taken and documented to 
the Contracting Officer. No part of the time lost due to any stop work 
order shall be subject to a claim for extension of time or costs or 
damages by the Contractor.
    (e) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each 
subcontract involving toxic substances, hazardous materials, or 
hazardous operations. Compliance with the provisions of this clause by 
subcontractors will be the responsibility of the Contractor.

    The following clause is covered by the policy set forth in subpart 
324.70 and is to be used in accordance with the instructions set forth

information or data of a personal nature about an individual, or 
proprietary information or data submitted by or pertaining to an 
institution or organization.
    (b) In addition to the types of confidential information described 
in paragraph (a) of this clause, information which might require special 
consideration with regard to the timing of its disclosure may derive 
from studies or research, during which public disclosure of preliminary 
unvalidated findings could create erroneous conclusions which might 
threaten public health or safety if acted upon.
    (c) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor may, by mutual 
consent, identify elsewhere in this contract specific information and/or 
categories of information which the Government will furnish to the 
Contractor or that the Contractor is expected to generate which is 
confidential. Similarly, the Contracting Officer and the Contractor may, 
by mutual consent, identify such confidential information from time to 
time during the performance of the contract. Failure to agree will be 
settled pursuant to the ``Disputes'' clause.
    (d) If it is established elsewhere in this contract that information 
to be utilized under this contract, or a portion thereof, is subject to 
the Privacy Act, the Contractor will follow the rules and procedures of 
disclosure set forth in the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and 
implementing regulations and policies, with respect to systems of 
records determined to be subject to the Privacy Act.
    (e) Confidential information, as defined in paragraph (a) of this 
clause, that is information or data of a personal nature about an 
individual, or proprietary information or data submitted by or 
pertaining to an institution or organization, shall not be disclosed 
without the prior written consent of the individual, institution, or 
organization.
    (f) Written advance notice of at least 45 days will be provided to 
the Contracting Officer of the Contractor's intent to release findings 
of studies or research, which have the possibility of adverse effects on 
the public or the Federal agency, as described in paragraph (b) of this 
clause. If the Contracting Officer does not pose any objections in 
writing within the 45-day period, the Contractor may proceed with 
disclosure. Disagreements not resolved by the Contractor and the 
Contracting Officer will be settled pursuant to the ``Disputes'' clause.
    (g) Whenever the Contractor is uncertain with regard to the proper 
handling of material under the contract, or if the material in question 
is subject to the Privacy Act or is confidential information subject to 
the provisions of this clause, the Contractor should

[[Page 75]]

obtain a written determination from the Contracting Officer prior to any 
release, disclosure, dissemination, or publication.
    (h) Contracting Officer determinations will reflect the result of 
internal coordination with appropriate program and legal officials.
    (i) The provisions of paragraph (e) of this clause shall not apply 
when the information is subject to conflicting or overlapping provisions 
in other Federal, State or local laws.

352.228-7  Insurance--Liability to third persons.

    As prescribed in 328.311-2, contracting officers shall include the

            Insurance--Liability to Third Persons (DEC 1991)

    (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) immediately following, 
or in paragraph (h) of this clause (if the clause has a paragraph (h)), 
the Contractor shall provide and maintain workers' compensation, 
employer's liability, comprehensive general liability (bodily injury), 
comprehensive automobile liability (bodily injury and property damage) 
insurance, and such other insurance as the Contracting Officer may 
require under this contract.
    (2) The Contractor may, with the approval of the Contracting

to workers' compensation, the Contractor is qualified pursuant to 
statutory authority.
    (3) All insurance required by this paragraph shall be in form and 
amount and for those periods as the Contracting Officer may require or 
approve and with insurers approved by the Contracting Officer.
    (b) The Contractor agrees to submit for the Contracting Officer's 
approval, to the extent and in the manner required by the Contracting 
Officer, any other insurance that is maintained by the Contractor in 
connection with performance of this contract and for which the 
Contractor seeks reimbursement.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this clause (if the 
clause has a paragraph (h)), the Contractor shall be reimbursed:
    (1) For that portion of the reasonable cost of insurance allocable 
to this contract, and required or approved under this clause; and
    (2) For certain liabilities (and expenses incidental to such 
liabilities) to third persons not compensated by insurance or otherwise 
within the funds available under the Limitation of Cost or the 
Limitation of Funds clause of this contract. These liabilities must 
arise out of the performance of this contract, whether or not caused by

or employees, and must be represented by final judgments or settlements 
approved in writing by the Government. These liabilities are for:
    (i) Loss of or damage to property (other than property owned, 
occupied, or used by the Contractor, rented to the Contractor, or in the 
care, custody, or control of the Contractor); or
    (ii) Death or bodily injury.
    (d) The Government's liability under paragraph (c) of this clause is 
limited to the amounts reflected in final judgements, or settlements 
approved in writing by the Government, but in no event to exceed the 
funds available under the Limitation of Cost or Limitation of Funds 
clause of this contract. Nothing in this contract shall be construed as 
implying that, at a later date, the Government will request, or the 
Congress will appropriate, funds sufficient to meet any deficiencies.
    (e) The Contractor shall not be reimbursed for liabilities (and 
expenses incidental to such liabilities):
    (1) For which the Contractor is otherwise responsible under the 
express terms of any clause specified in the Schedule or elsewhere in 
the contract:
    (2) For which the Contractor has failed to insure or to maintain 
insurance as required by the Contracting Officer; or
    (3) That result from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the 
part of the Contractor's directors, officers, managers, superintendents, 
or other representatives who have supervision or direction of:
    (i) All or substantially all of the Contractor's business;
    (ii) All or substantially all of the Contractor's operations at any 
one plant or separate location in which this contract is being 
performed; or
    (iii) A separate and complete major industrial operation in 
connection with the performance of this contract.
    (f) The provisions of paragraph (e) of this clause shall not 
restrict the right of the Contractor to be reimbursed for the cost of 
insurance maintained by the Contractor in connection with the 
performance of this contract, other than insurance required in 
accordance with this clause; provided, that such cost is allowable under 
the Allowable Cost and Payment clause of this contract.
    (g) If any suit or action is filed or any claim is made against the 
Contractor, the cost and expense of which may be reimbursable to the 
Contractor under this contract, and the risk of which is then uninsured 
or is insured for less than the amount claimed, the Contractor shall:
    (1) Immediately notify the Contracting Officer and promptly furnish 
copies of all pertinent papers received;

[[Page 76]]

    (2) Authorize Government representatives to collaborate with counsel 
for the insurance carrier in settling or defending the claim when the 
amount of the liability claimed exceeds the amount of coverage; and
    (3) Authorize Government representatives to settle or defend the 
claim and to represent the Contractor in or to take charge of any 
litigation, if required by the Government, when the liability is not 
insured or covered by the bond. The Contractor may, at its own expense, 
be associated with the Government representatives in any such claim or 
litigation.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (APR 1984). If the successful offeror represents in the 
offer that the offeror is partially immune from tort liability as a 
State agency, add the following paragraph (h) to the basic clause:

    (h) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (c) of this clause--
    (1) The Government does not assume any liability to third persons, 
nor will the Government reimburse the Contractor for its liability to 
third persons, with respect to loss due to death, bodily injury, or 
damage to property resulting in any way from the performance of this 
contract or any subcontract under this contract; and
    (2) The Contractor need not provide or maintain insurance coverage 
as required by paragraph (a) of this clause; provided, that the 
Contractor may obtain any insurance coverage deemed necessary, subject 
to approval by the Contracting Officer as to form, amount, and duration. 
The Contractor shall be reimbursed for the cost of such insurance and, 
to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, to liabilities 
to third persons for which the Contractor has obtained insurance 
coverage as provided in this paragraph, but for which such coverage is 
insufficient in amount.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate II (APR 1984). If the successful offeror represents in the 
offer that the offeror is totally immune from tort liability as a State 
agency, substitute the following paragraphs (a) and (b) for paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of the basic clause:
    (a) The Government does not assume any liability to third persons, 
nor will the Government reimburse the Contractor for its liability to 
third persons, with respect to loss due to death, bodily injury, or 
damage to property resulting in any way from the performance of this 
contract or any subcontract under this contract.
    (b) If any suit or action is filed, or if any claim is made against 
the Contractor, the cost and expense of which may be reimbursable to the 
Contractor under this contract, the Contractor shall immediately notify 
the Contracting Officer and promptly furnish copies of all pertinent 
papers received by the Contractor. The Contractor shall, if required by 
the Government, authorize Government representatives to settle or defend 
the claim and to represent the Contractor in or take charge of any 
litigation. The Contractor may, at its own expense, be associated with 
the Government representatives in any such claims or litigation.

    Notwithstanding any other payment provisions of this contract, 
failure of the Contractor to submit required reports when due or failure 
to perform or deliver required work, supplies, or services, will result 
in the withholding of payments under this contract unless such failure 
arises out of causes beyond the control, and without the fault or 
negligence of the Contractor as defined by the clause entitled 
``Excusable Delays'' or ``Default'', as applicable. The Government shall 
promptly notify the Contractor of its intention to withhold payment of 
any invoice or voucher submitted.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>

[[Page 77]]

    (c) It is estimated that the amount currently allotted will cover

contract using the incremental funding concepts described in the clause 
entitled Limitation of Funds. Under the clause, which will be included 
in the resultant contract, initial funds will be obligated under the 
contract to cover the first year of performance. Additional funds are 
intended to be allotted to the contract by contract modification, up to 
and including the full estimated cost of the contract, to accomplish the 
entire project. While it is the Government's intention to progressively 
fund this contract over the entire period of performance up to and 
including the full estimated cost, the Government will not be obligated 
to reimburse the Contractor for costs incurred in excess of the periodic 
allotments, nor will the Contractor be obligated to perform in excess of 
the amount allotted.
    (b) The Limitation of Funds clause to be included in the resultant 
contract shall supersede the Limitation of Cost clause found in the 
General Provisions.

    The Contractor shall give the Contracting Officer immediate notice 
in writing of any action, including any proceeding before an 
administrative agency, filed against the Contractor arising out of the 
performance of this contract, including, but not limited to the 
performance of any subcontract hereunder; and any claim against the 
Contractor the cost and expense of which is allowable under the clause 
entitled ``Allowable Cost and Payment.'' Except as otherwise directed by 
the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish immediately to the 
Contracting Officer copies of all pertinent papers received by the 
Contractor with respect to such action or claim. To the extent not in 
conflict with any applicable policy of insurance, the Contractor may, 
with the Contracting Officer's approval, settle any such action or 
claim. If required by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall 
effect an assignment and subrogation in favor of the Government of all 
the Contractor's rights and claims (except those against the Government) 
arising out of any such action or claim against the Contractor; and 
authorize representatives of the Government to settle or defend any such 
action or claim and to represent the Contractor in, or to take charge 
of, any action. If the settlement or defense of an action or claim is 
undertaken by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all 
reasonable assistance in effecting a settlement or asserting a defense. 
Where an action against the Contractor is not covered by a policy of 
insurance, the Contractor shall, with the approval of the Contracting 
Officer, proceed with the defense of the action in good faith. The 
Government shall not be liable for the expense of defending any action 
or for any costs resulting from the loss thereof to the extent that the 
Contractor would have been compensated by insurance which was required 
by law or regulation or by written direction of the Contracting Officer, 
but which the Contractor failed to secure through its own fault or 
negligence. In any event, unless otherwise expressly provided in this 
contract, the Contractor shall not be reimbursed or indemnified by the 
Government for any liability loss, cost or expense, which the Contractor 
may incur or be subject to by reason of any loss, injury or damage, to 
the person or to real or personal property of any third parties as may 
accrue during, or arise from, the performance of this contract.

or of the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign 
or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine 
restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, and unusually severe weather, 
but in every case the failure to perform must be beyond the control and 
without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. If the failure to 
perform is caused by the failure of a subcontractor to perform, and if 
such failure arises out of causes beyond the control of both the 
Contractor and subcontractor, and without the fault or negligence of 
either of them, the Contractor shall not be deemed to have failed in 
performance of the contract, unless: the supplies or services to be 
furnished by the subcontractor were obtainable from other sources, the 
Contracting Officer shall have ordered the Contractor in writing to 
procure such supplies or services from such other sources, and the 
Contractor shall have failed to comply reasonably with such order. Upon 
request of the Contractor, the Contracting officer shall ascertain the 
facts and extent of such failure and, if he/she shall determine that any 
failure to perform was occasioned by any one or more of the said causes, 
the delivery schedule shall be revised accordingly, subject to the 
rights of the Government under the termination clause hereof. (As used 
in this clause, the terms ``subcontractor'' and ``subcontractors'' mean 
subcontractor(s) at any tier.)

work, regardless of age (subject to existing laws and regulations), sex, 
religion, or tribal affiliation. To the extent feasible and consistent 
with the efficient performance of this contract, the Contractor further 
agrees to give preference in employment and training opportunities under

disadvantaged business concerns, and women-owned small business 
concerns.
    (e) As used in this clause:
    (1) ``Indian'' means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe. If

    (2) ``Indian Tribe'' means an Indian Tribe, pueblo, band, nation, or 
other organized group or community, including Alaska Native village or 
regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to 
the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601)

    (a) In addition to the requirements of the clause of this contract 
entitled ``Indian Preference,'' the Contractor agrees to establish and 
conduct an Indian preference program which will expand opportunities for 
Indians to receive preference for employment and training in connection 
with the work to be performed under this contract, and which will expand 
the opportunities for Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic 
enterprises to receive a preference in the awarding of subcontracts. In 
this connection, the Contractor shall:
    (1) Designate a liaison officer who will maintain liaison with the 
Government and the Tribe(s) on Indian preference matters; supervise 
compliance with the provisions of this clause; and administer the 
Contractor's Indian preference program.
    (2) Advise its recruitment sources in writing and include a 
statement in all advertisements for employment that Indian applicants 
will be given preference in employment and training incident to such 
employment.
    (3) Not more than twenty (20) calendar days after award of the 
contract, post a written notice in the Tribal office of any reservations 
on which or near where the work under this contract is to be performed 
that sets forth the Contractor's employment needs and related training 
opportunities. The notice shall include the approximate numbers and 
types of employees needed; the approximate dates of employment; the 
experience or special skills required for employment, if any; training 
opportunities available; and other pertinent information necessary to 
advise prospective employees of any other employment requirements. The 
Contractor shall also request the Tribe(s) on or near whose

Contractor in filling its employment needs and training opportunities. 
The Contracting Officer will advise the Contractor of the name,

to the posting of notices and requests for Tribal assistance.
    (4) Establish and conduct a subcontracting program which gives 
preference to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises 
as subcontractors and suppliers under this contract. The Contractor 
shall give public notice of existing subcontracting opportunities and, 
to the extent feasible and consistent with the efficient performance of 
this contract, shall solicit bids or proposals only from Indian 
organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises. The Contractor shall 
request assistance and information on Indian firms qualified as 
suppliers or subcontractors from the Tribe(s) on or near whose 
reservation(s) the work under the contract is to be performed. The 
Contracting Officer will advise the Contractor of the name, location, 
and phone number of the Tribal officials to be contacted in regard to 
the request for assistance and information. Public notices and 
solicitations for existing subcontracting opportunities shall provide an 
equitable opportunity for Indian firms to submit bids or proposals by 
including: A clear description of the supplies or services required, 
including quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules which 
facilitate the participation of Indian firms; A statement indicating 
that preference will be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned 
economic enterprises in accordance with section 7(b) of Public Law 93-
638 (88 Stat. 2205; 25 U.S.C. 450e(b)); Definitions for the terms 
``Indian organization'' and ``Indian-owned economic enterprise'' as 
prescribed under the ``Indian Preference'' clause of this contract; A 
statement to be completed by the bidder or offeror that it is an Indian 
organization or Indian-owned economic enterprise; and A closing date for 
receipt of bids or proposals which provides sufficient time for 
preparation and submission of a bid or proposal. If after soliciting 
bids or proposals from Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic 
enterprises, no responsive bid or acceptable proposal is received, the 
Contractor shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of the 
``Indian Preference'' clause of this contract. If one or more 
responsible bids or acceptable proposals are received, award shall be 
made to the low responsible bidder or acceptable offeror if the price is 
determined to be reasonable. If the low responsive bid or acceptable 
proposal is determined to be unreasonable as to price, the Contractor 
shall attempt to negotiate a reasonable price and award a subcontract. 
If a reasonable price cannot be agreed upon, the Contractor shall comply 
with the requirements of paragraph (d) of the ``Indian Preference'' 
clause of this contract.

[[Page 81]]

    (5) Maintain written records under this contract which indicate: The 
numbers of Indians seeking employment for each employment position 
available under this contract; The number and types of positions filled 
by Indians and non-Indians, and the total number of Indians employed 
under this contract; For those positions where there are both Indian and 
non-Indian applicants, and a non-Indian is selected for employment, the 
reason(s) why the Indian applicant was not selected; Actions taken to 
give preference to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic 
enterprises for subcontracting opportunities which exist under this 
contract; Reasons why preference was not given to Indian firms as 
subcontractors or suppliers for each requirement where it was determined 
by the Contractor that such preference would not be consistent with the 
efficient performance of the contract; and The number of Indian 
organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises contacted, and the 
number receiving subcontract awards under this contract.
    (6) Submit to the Contracting Officer for approval a quarterly 
report which summarizes the Contractor's Indian preference program and 
indicates the number and types of available positions filled by Indians 
and non-Indians, and the dollar amounts of all subcontracts awarded to 
Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises, and to all 
other firms.
    (7) Maintain records pursuant to this clause and keep them available 
for review by the Government until expiration of one (1) year after 
final payment under this contract, or for such longer period as may be 
required by any other clause of this contract or by applicable law or 
regulation.
    (b) For purposes of this clause, the following definitions of terms 
shall apply:
    (1) The terms ``Indian,'' ``Indian Tribe,'' ``Indian Organization,'' 
and ``Indian-owned economic enterprise'' are defined in the clause of 
this contract entitled ``Indian Preference.''
    (2) ``Indian reservation'' includes Indian reservations, public 
domain Indian Allotments, former Indian reservations in Oklahoma, and 
land held by incorporated Native groups, regional corporations, and 
village corporations under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)
    (3) ``On or near an Indian Reservation'' means on a reservation or 
reservations or within that area surrounding an Indian reservation(s) 
where a person seeking employment could reasonably be expected to 
commute to and from in the course of a work day.
    (c) Nothing in the requirements of this clause shall be interpreted 
to preclude Indian Tribes from independently developing and enforcing 
their own Indian preference requirements. Such requirements must not 
conflict with any Federal statutory or regulatory requirement dealing 
with the award and administration of contracts.
    (d) The Contractor agrees to include the provisions of this clause, 
including this paragraph (d), in each subcontract awarded at any tier 
under this contract and to notify the Contracting Officer of such 
subcontracts.
    (e) In the event of noncompliance with this clause, the Contracting 
Officer may terminate the contract in whole or in part or may impose any 
other sanctions authorized by law or by other provisions of the 
contract.

(Department) regulations for the protection of human subjects, 45 CFR 
Part 46, are available from the Office for Protection from Research 
Risks (OPRR), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. 
The regulations provide a systematic means, based on established ethical 
principles, to safeguard the rights and welfare of individuals who 
participate as subjects in research activities supported or conducted by 
the Department.
    (b) The regulations define a human subject as a living individual 
about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting 
research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the 
individual, or identifiable private information. The regulations extend 
to the use of human organs, tissue, and body fluids from individually 
identifiable human subjects as well as to graphic, written, or recorded

covered by the regulations or are in an exempt category, based on the 
information provided in the proposal. In

[[Page 83]]

Assurance of Compliance with the regulations, specifying review 
procedures and assigning responsibilities for the protection of human 
subjects. The initial and continuing review of a research project by an 
institutional review board shall assure that the rights and welfare of 
the human subjects involved are adequately protected, that the risks to 
the subjects are reasonable in relation to the potential benefits, if 
any, to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained, 
and that informed consent will be obtained by methods that are adequate 
and appropriate. Prospective Contractors proposing research that 
involves human subjects shall be contacted by OPRR and given detailed 
instructions for establishing an institutional review board and filing 
an Assurance of Compliance.
    (f) It is recommended that OPRR be consulted for advice or guidance

46 and the Assurance of Compliance.
    (b) The Contractor shall bear full responsibility for the 
performance of all work and services involving the use of human subjects 
under this contract in a proper manner and as safely as is feasible. The 
parties hereto agree that the Contractor retains the right to control 
and direct the performance of all work under this contract. Nothing in 
this contract shall be deemed to constitute the Contractor or any 
subcontractor, agent or employee of the Contractor, or any other person, 
organization, institution, or group of any kind whatsoever, as the agent 
or employee of the Government. The Contractor agrees that it has entered 
into this contract and will discharge its obligations, duties, and 
undertakings and the work pursuant thereto, whether requiring 
professional judgement or otherwise, as an independent contractor 
without imputing liability on the part of the Government for the acts of 
the Contractor or its employees.
    (c) If at any time during the performance of this contract, the 
Contracting officer determines, in consultation with the OPRR, NIH, that 
the Contractor is not in compliance with any of the requirements and/or 
standards stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the Contracting 
Officer may immediately suspend, in whole or in part, work and further

involve live vertebrate animals that an Animal Welfare Assurance is 
required. The Contracting Officer will request that OPRR negotiate an 
acceptable Animal Welfare Assurance with those Contractor(s). For 
further information, OPRR may be contacted at NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 
20892 (301-496-7041).

                           (End of provision)

    (b) The following clause shall be included in all solicitations and 
resultant contracts involving research on vertebrate animals:

               Care of Live Vertebrate Animals (JAN 2001)

    (a) Before undertaking performance of any contract involving animal 
related activities, the Contractor shall register with the Secretary of 
Agriculture of the United States in accordance with 7 U.S.C. 2136 and 9 
CFR sections 2.25 through 2.28. The Contractor shall furnish evidence of 
the registration to the Contracting Officer.
    (b) The Contractor shall acquire vertebrate animals used in research 
from a dealer licensed by the Secretary of Agriculture under 7 U.S.C. 
2133 and 9 CFR Sections 2.1-2.11, or from a source that is exempt from 
licensing under those sections.
    (c) The Contractor agrees that the care and use of any live 
vertebrate animals used or intended for use in the performance of this 
contract will conform with the PHS Policy on Humane Care of Use of 
Laboratory Animals, the current Animal Welfare Assurance, the Guide for 
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the Institute of 
Laboratory Animal Resources and the pertinent laws and regulations of 
the United States Department of Agriculture (see 7 U.S.C. 2131 et seq. 
and 9 CFR Subchapter A, Parts 1-4). In case of conflict between 
standards, the more stringent standard shall be used.
    (d) If at any time during performance of this contract, the 
Contracting Officer determines, in consultation with the Office for 
Protection from Research Risks (OPRR), National Institutes of Health 
(NIH), that the Contractor is not in compliance with any of the 
requirements and/or standards stated in paragraphs (a) through (c) 
above, the Contracting Officer may immediately suspend, in whole or in 
part, work and further payments under this contract until the Contractor 
corrects the noncompliance. Notice of the suspension may be communicated 
by telephone and confirmed in writing. If the Contractor fails to 
complete corrective action within the period of time designated in the 
Contracting Officer's written notice of suspension, the Contracting 
Officer may, in consultation with OPRR, NIH, terminate this contract in 
whole or in part, and the Contractor's name may be removed from the list 
of those contractors with approved PHS Animal Welfare Assurances.
    Note: Note: The Contractor may request registration of its facility 
and a current listing of licensed dealers from the Regional Office of 
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), USDA, for the 
region in which its research facility is located. The location of the 
appropriate APHIS Regional Office, as well as information concerning 
this program may be obtained by contacting the Animal Care Staff, USDA/
APHIS, 4700 River Road, Riverdale, Maryland 20737.

 Subpart 370.1--Accessibility of Meetings, Conferences, and Seminars to 
                        Persons With Disabilities


<R05>
370.101  Policy.

    (a) It is the policy of HHS that all meetings, conferences, and 
seminars be accessible to persons with disabilities. For the purpose of 
this policy, accessibility is defined as both physical access to 
meeting, conference, and seminar sites, and aids and services to enable 
individuals with sensory disabilities to fully participate in meetings, 
conferences, and seminars.
    (b) In regard to acquisition, the policy is applicable to all 
contracts where the statement of work requires the contractor to conduct 
meetings, conferences, or seminars that are open to the public or 
involve HHS personnel, but not to ad hoc meetings that may be necessary 
or incidental to contract performance.


<R05>
370.102  Responsibilities.

    (a) The contracting officer shall include the clause in 352.270-1 in 
every solicitation and resulting contract when the statement of work 
requires the contractor to conduct meetings, conferences, or seminars in 
accordance with 370.101(b).
    (b) The project officer shall be responsible for obtaining, 
reviewing, and approving the contractor's plan, which is to be submitted 
in response to paragraph (a) of the contract clause in 352.270-1. A 
consolidated or master plan for contracts requiring numerous meetings, 
conferences, or seminars will be acceptable. The project officer, prior 
to approving the plan, should consult with the Office of Engineering 
Services serving the region where the meeting, conference, or seminar is 
to be held, to assure that the contractor's plan meets the accessibility 
requirements of the contract clause. The Office of Engineering Services 
should determine the adequacy of the contractor's plan, and

[[Page 86]]

notify the project officer, in writing, within ten (10) working days of 
receiving the request from the project officer.


<R04>
     Subpart 370.2--Indian Preference in Employment, Training, and 
                      Subcontracting Opportunities


<R05>
370.201  Statutory requirements.

    Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education 
Assistance Act, Public Law 93-638, 88 Stat. 2205, 25 U.S.C. 450e(b), 
requires:

    ``Any contract, subcontract, grant, or subgrant pursuant to this 
Act, the Act of April 16, 1934 (48 Stat. 596), as amended, or any other 
Act authorizing Federal contracts with or grants to Indian organizations 
or for the benefit of Indians, shall require that to the greatest extent 
feasible:
    (1) Preferences and opportunities for training and employment in 
connection with the administration of such contracts or grants shall be 
given to Indians; and
    (b) Preference in the award of subcontracts and subgrants in 
connection with the administration of such contracts or grants shall be 
given to Indian organizations and to Indian-owned economic enterprises 
as defined in section 3 of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 
77).''


<R05>
370.202  Applicability.

    The Indian Preference clause set forth in 352.270-2 and the Indian 
Preference Program clause set forth in 352.270-3 have been developed to 
implement section 7 (b) of Public Law 93-638 for all activities of the 
Department. The clauses shall be used by any affected departmental 
contracting activity as follows, except solicitations issued and 
contracts awarded pursuant to Title I of Public Law 93-638 (25 U.S.C. 
450 et seq.) are exempted:
    (a) The Indian Preference clause (352.270-2) shall be included in 
each solicitation and resultant contract, regardless of dollar amount:
    (1) When the contract is to be awarded pursuant to an act 
specifically authorizing contracts with Indian organizations; or
    (2) Where the work to be performed under the contract is 
specifically for the benefit of Indians and is in addition to any 
incidental benefits which might otherwise accrue to the general public.
    (b) The Indian Preference Program clause (352.270-3) shall be 
included in each solicitation and resultant contract when:
    (1) The dollar amount of the acquisition is expected to equal or 
exceed $50,000 for nonconstruction work or $100,000 for construction 
work;
    (2) The Indian Preference clause is to be included in the 
solicitation and resultant contract; and
    (3) The determination is made, prior to solicitation, that the work 
to be performed under the resultant contract will take place in whole or 
in substantial part on or near an Indian reservation(s). In addition, 
the Indian Preference Program clause may be included in any solicitation 
and resultant contract below the $50,000 or $100,000 level for 
nonconstruction or construction contracts, respectively, but which meet 
the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section 370.202, 
and, in the opinion of the contracting activity, offer substantial 
opportunities for Indian employment, training, and subcontracting.


<R05>
370.203  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart 370.2, the following definitions shall 
apply:
    (a) Indian means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe. If the 
contractor has reason to doubt that a person seeking employment 
preference is an Indian, the contractor shall grant the preference but 
shall require the individual to provide evidence within thirty (30) days 
from the Tribe concerned that the person is a member of the Tribe.
    (b) Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, pueblo, band, nation, or 
other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native Village 
or regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant 
to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688, 43 U.S.C. 
1601) which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and 
services provided by the United States to Indians because of their 
status as Indians.
    (c) Indian organization means the governing body of any Indian Tribe 
or entity established or recognized by such governing body in accordance 
with the

[[Page 87]]

Indian Financing Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 77, 25 U.S.C. 1451).
    (d) Indian-owned economic enterprise means any Indian-owned 
commercial, industrial, or business activity established or organized 
for the purpose of profit, provided that such Indian ownership shall 
constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise, and the ownership 
shall encompass active operation and control of the enterprise.
    (e) Indian reservation includes Indian reservations, public domain 
Indian allotments, former Indian reservations in Oklahoma, and land held 
by incorporated Native groups, regional corporations, and village 
corporations under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement 
Act (85 Stat. 688, 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)
    (f) On or near an Indian Reservation means on a reservation or 
reservations or within that area surrounding an Indian reservation(s) 
where a person seeking employment could reasonably be expected to 
commute to and from in the course of a work day.


<R05>
370.204  Compliance enforcement.

    (a) The concerned contracting activity shall be responsible for 
conducting periodic reviews to insure contractor compliance with the 
requirements of the clauses set forth in 352.270-2 and 352.270-3. These 
reviews may be conducted with the assistance of the Indian Tribe(s) 
concerned.
    (b) Complaints of noncomplaince with the requirements of the clauses 
set forth in 352.270-2 and 352.270-3 which are filed in writing with the 
contracting activity shall be promptly investigated and resolved by the 
contracting officer.


<R05>
370.205  Tribal preference requirements.

    (a) Where the work under a contract is to be performed on an Indian 
reservation, the contracting activity may supplement the clause set 
forth in 352.270-3 by adding specific Indian preference requirements of 
the Tribe on whose reservation the work is to be performed. The 
supplemental requirements shall be jointly developed for the contract by 
the contracting activity and the Tribe. Supplemental preference 
requirements must represent a further implementation of the requirements 
of section 7(b) of Public Law 93-638 and must be approved by the 
affected program director and approved for legal sufficiency by the 
Business and Administrative Law Division, OGC, or a regional attorney 
before being added to a solicitation and resultant contract. Any 
supplemental preference requirements to be added to the clause in 
352.270-3 shall be included in the solicitation and clearly identified 
in order to insure uniform understanding of the additional requirements 
by all prospective bidders or offerors.
    (b) Nothing in this part shall be interpreted to preclude Tribes 
from independently developing and enforcing their own tribal preference 
requirements. Such independently developed tribal preference 
requirements shall not, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this 
section, become a requirement in contracts covered under this subpart 
370.2, and must not conflict with any Federal statutory or regulatory 
requirement concerning the award and administration of contracts.


<R04>
          Subpart 370.3--Acquisitions Involving Human Subjects


<R05>
370.300  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart applies to all research and development activities 
involving human subjects conducted under contract (see 45 CFR 46.102(d) 
and (f)).


<R05>
370.301  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Department of Health and Human Services 
(DHHS) that no contract involving human subjects shall be awarded until 
acceptable assurance has been given that the activity will be subject to 
initial and continuing review by an appropriate Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) as described in DHHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.103. An 
applicable Multiple Project Assurance (MPA) or Single Project Assurance 
(SPA), approved by the Office for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR), 
National Institutes of Health (NIH), shall be required of each 
contractor, subcontractor, or cooperating institution having 
responsibility for human subjects involved in performance of the 
contract. The OPRR, NIH,

[[Page 88]]

is responsible for negotiating assurances covering all DHHS-supported or 
DHHS-conducted activities involving human subjects. Contracting officers 
shall be guided by OPRR regarding nonaward or termination of a contract 
due to inadequate assurance or breach of assurance for protection of 
human subjects.


<R05>
370.302  Types of assurances.

    Assurances may be one of two types:
    (a) Multiple Project Assurance (MPA). An MPA describes the oversight 
procedures applicable to all DHHS-supported human subjects activities 
within an institution having a significant number of concurrent 
projects. An MPA listed in OPRR's current ``List of Institutions Which 
Have an Approved MPA'' will be considered acceptable for purposes of 
this policy.
    (b) Single Project Assurance (SPA). An SPA describes the oversight 
procedures applicable to a single DHHS-supported human subjects 
activity. SPAs may be approved in modified form to meet unusual 
requirements. SPAs are not solicited from institutions with OPRR 
approved MPAs. Copies of proposals selected for negotiation and 
requiring one or more SPAs shall be forwarded to the Human Subjects 
Assurance Branch, OPRR, NIH MSC 7507, 6100 Executive Blvd., Room 3B01, 
Rockville, Maryland 20892, as early as possible so that timely action 
may be taken to secure the SPA(s).


<R05>
370.303  Notice to offerors.

    (a) Solicitations shall contain the notice to offerors in 352.270-
8(a) whenever contract performance is expected to involve human 
subjects.
    (b) IRB approval of proposals submitted by institutions having an 
OPRR-approved MPA should be certified in the manner required by 
instructions for completion of the contract proposal; or by completion 
of a DHHS Form 310, Protection of Human Subjects Assurance 
Identification/Certification/Declaration; or by letter indicating the 
institution's OPRR-assigned MPA number, the date of IRB review and 
approval, and the type of review (convened or expedited). The date of 
IRB approval must not be more than 12 months prior to the deadline for 
proposal submission.
    (c) SPAs for contractors, subcontractors, or cooperating 
institutions generally will not be requested prior to determination that 
a contract proposal has been selected for negotiation. When an SPA is 
submitted, it provides certification for the initial contract period. No 
additional documentation is required. If the contract provides for 
additional years to complete the project, the noncompetitive renewal 
proposal shall be certified in the manner described in the preceding 
paragraph.


<R05>
370.304  Contract clause.

    The clause set forth in 352.270-8(b) shall be inserted in all 
solicitations and resultant contracts involving human subjects.


<R04>
   Subpart 370.4--Acquisitions Involving the Use of Laboratory Animals


<R05>
370.400   Scope of subpart.

    This subpart applies to all research, research training and 
biological testing activities involving live vertebrate animals 
conducted under contract (see Public Health Service Policy on Humane 
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (PHS Policy), Rev. 1986, Repr. 1996).


<R05>
370.401  Policy.

    (a) It is the policy of the Department of Health and Human Services 
(DHHS) and the Public Health Service agencies that no contract involving 
live vertebrate animals shall be awarded until acceptable assurance has 
been given that the activity will be subject to initial and continuing 
review by an appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
(IACUC) as described in the PHS Policy at IV. B. 6. and 7. An applicable 
Full Animal Welfare Assurance or Interinstitutional Agreement/Assurance, 
approved by the Office for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR), 
National Institutes of Health (NIH), shall be required of each 
contractor, subcontractor, or cooperating institution having 
responsibility

[[Page 89]]

for animal care and use involved in performance of the contract (see PHS 
Policy II., IV. A., and V. B.).
    (b) The OPRR, NIH, is responsible for negotiating assurances 
covering all DHHS/PHS-supported or DHHS/PHS-conducted activities 
involving the care and use of live vertebrate animals. Contracting 
officers shall be guided by OPRR regarding adequate animal care, and 
use, approval, disapproval, restriction, or withdrawal of approval of 
assurances (see PHS Policy V. A.).


<R05>
370.402  Assurances.

    (a) Assurances may be one of two types:
    (1) Full Animal Welfare Assurance (AWA). An AWA describes the 
institution's complete program for the care and use of animals, 
including but not limited to the facilities, occupational health, 
training, veterinary care, IACUC procedures and lines of authority and 
responsibility. An AWA listed in OPRR's list of institutions which have 
an approved full AWA will be considered acceptable for purposes of this 
policy.
    (2) Interinstitutional Agreement/Assurance (IAA). An IAA describes 
the arrangements between an offeror and usually a subcontractor where 
animal activities will occur. An IAA is limited to the specific award or 
single project.
    (b) Copies of proposals selected for negotiation and requiring an 
assurance shall be forwarded to the Assurance Branch, Division of Animal 
Welfare, OPRR, NIH MSC 7507, 6100 Executive Blvd., Room 3B01, Rockville, 
Maryland 20892, as early as possible in order that timely action may be 
taken to secure the necessary assurances.
    (c) A contractor providing animal care services at an assured 
entity, such as a Government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) site, 
does not need a separate assurance because the GOCO site normally covers 
the contractor services in the GOCO site assurance.


<R05>
370.403  Notice to offerors.

    Solicitations shall contain the notice to offerors in 352.270-9(a) 
whenever contract performance is expected to involve the use of live 
vertebrate animals.
    (a) For offerors having a full AWA on file with OPRR, IACUC approval 
of the use of animals shall be submitted in the manner required by 
instructions for completion of the contract proposal, but prior to the 
technical review of the proposal. The date of IACUC review and approval 
must not be more than 36 months prior to the deadline for proposal 
submission.]
    (b) Non-assured offerors are not required to submit assurances or 
IACUC approval with proposals. OPRR will contact contractors, 
subcontractors and cooperating institutions to negotiate necessary 
assurances and verify IACUC approvals when requested by appropriate 
DHHS/PHS staff.


<R05>
370.404  Contract clause.

    The clause set forth in 352.270-9(b) shall be included in all 
solicitations and resultant contracts involving the care and use of live 
vertebrate animals.


<R04>
          Subpart 370.5--Acquisitions Under the Buy Indian Act


<R05>
370.500  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth the policy on preferential acquisition from 
Indians under the negotiation authority of the Buy Indian Act. 
Applicability of this subpart is limited to acquisitions made by or on 
behalf of the Indian Health Service of the Public Health Service.


<R05>
370.501  Policy.

    (a) The Indian Health Service will utilize the negotiation authority 
of the Buy Indian Act to give preference to Indians whenever the use of 
that authority is authorized and is practicable. The Buy Indian Act, 25 
U.S.C. 47, prescribes the application of the advertising requirements of 
section 3709 of the Revised Statutes to the acquisition of Indian 
supplies. As set out in 25 U.S.C. 47, the Buy Indian Act provides as 
follows:

    So far as may be practicable Indian labor shall be employed, and 
purchases of the products (including, but not limited to printing, 
notwithstanding any other law) of Indian industry may be made in open 
market in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior.

    (b) The functions, responsibilities, authorities, and duties of the 
Secretary

[[Page 90]]

of the Interior for maintenance and operation of hospital and health 
facilities for Indians and for the conservation of the health of Indians 
are transferred to the Surgeon General of the United States under the 
supervision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, 42 U.S.C. 
2001 (a). Accordingly, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is 
authorized to use the Buy Indian Act in the acquisition of products of 
Indian industry in connection with the maintenance and operation of 
hospital and health facilities for Indians and for the conservation of 
the health of Indians. This authority has been delegated exclusively to 
the Indian Health Service and is not available for use by any other HHS 
component (unless that component is making an acquisition on behalf of 
the Indian Health Service).
    (c) Use of the Buy Indian Act negotiation authority has been 
emphasized in subsequent legislation, particularly Public Law 94-437 and 
Public Law 96-537.


<R05>
370.502  Definitions.

    Buy Indian contract means any contract involving activities covered 
by the Buy Indian Act that is negotiated under the provisions of 41 
U.S.C. 252(c) and 25 U.S.C. 47 between an Indian firm and a contracting 
officer representing the Indian Health Service.
    Indian means a member of any tribe, pueblo, band, group, village or 
community that is recognized by the Secretary of the Interior as being 
Indian or any individual or group of individuals that is recognized by 
the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services in making 
determinations may take into account the determination of the tribe with 
which affiliation is claimed.
    Indian firm means a sole enterprise, partnership, corporation, or 
other type of business organization owned, controlled, and operated by 
one or more Indians (including, for the purpose of sections 301 and 302 
of Public Law 94-437, former or currently federally recognized Indian 
tribes in the State of New York) or by an Indian firm; or a nonprofit 
firm organized for the benefit of Indians and controlled by Indians (see 
370.503(a)).
    Product of Indian industry means anything produced by Indians 
through physical labor or by intellectual effort involving the use and 
application of skills by them.


<R05>
370.503  Requirements.

    (a) Indian ownership. The degree of Indian ownership of an Indian 
firm shall be at least 51 percent during the period covered by a Buy 
Indian contract.
    (b) Joint ventures. An Indian firm may enter into a joint venture 
with other entities for specific projects as long as the Indian firm is 
the managing partner. However, the joint venture must be approved by the 
contracting officer prior to the award of a contract under the Buy 
Indian Act.
    (c) Bonds. In the case of contracts for the construction, 
alteration, or repair of public buildings or public works, performance 
and payment bonds are required by the Miller Act (40 U.S.C. 270a-270f) 
and FAR part 28. In the case of contracts with Indian tribes or public 
nonprofit organizations serving as governmental instrumentalities of an 
Indian tribe, bonds are not required. However, bonds are required when 
dealing with private business entities which are owned by an Indian 
tribe or members of an Indian tribe. Bonds may be required of private 
business entities which are joint ventures with, or subcontractors of, 
an Indian tribe or a public nonprofit organization serving as a 
governmental instrumentality of an Indian tribe. A bid guarantee or bid 
bond is required only when a performance or payment bond is required.
    (d) Indian preference in employment, training and subcontracting. 
Contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act are subject to the 
requirements of section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and 
Education Assistance Act 25 U.S.C. 450e, which requires that preference 
be given to Indians in employment, training, and subcontracting. The 
Indian Preference clause set forth in 352.270-2 shall be included in all 
Buy Indian solicitations and resultant contracts. The Indian Preference 
Program clause set forth in 352.270-3 shall be used as specified in 
370.202(b). All requirements

[[Page 91]]

set forth in subpart 370.2 which are applicable to the instant Buy 
Indian acquisition shall be followed by the contracting officer, e.g., 
sections 370.204 and 370.205.
    (e) Subcontracting. Not more than 50 percent of the work to be 
performed under a prime contract awarded pursuant to the Buy Indian Act 
shall be subcontracted to other than Indian firms. For this purpose, 
work to be performed does not include the provision of materials, 
supplies, or equipment.
    (f) Wage rates. A determination of the minimum wage rates by the 
Secretary of Labor as required by the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a) 
shall be included in all contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act for 
over $2,000 for construction, alteration, or repair, including painting 
and decorating, of public buildings and public works, except contracts 
with Indian tribes or public nonprofit organizations serving as 
governmental instrumentalities of an Indian tribe. The wage rate 
determination is to be included in contracts with private business 
entities even if they are owned by an Indian tribe or a member of an 
Indian tribe and in connection with joint ventures with, or 
subcontractors of, an Indian tribe or a public nonprofit organization 
serving as a governmental instrumentality of an Indian tribe.


<R05>
370.504  Competition.

    (a) Contracts to be awarded under the Buy Indian Act shall be 
subject to competition among Indians or Indian concerns to the maximum 
extent that competition is determined by the contracting officer to be 
practicable. When competition is determined not to be practicable, a 
Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition shall be prepared 
in accordance with 306.303 and subsequently retained in the contract 
file.
    (b) Solicitations must be synopsized and publicized in the Commerce 
Business Daily and copies of the synopses sent to the tribal office of 
the Indian tribal government directly concerned with the proposed 
acquisition as well as to Indian concerns and others having a legitimate 
interest. The synopsis should state that the acquisition is restricted 
to Indian firms under the Buy Indian Act.


<R05>
370.505  Responsibility determinations.

    (a) A contract may be awarded under the Buy Indian Act only if it is 
first determined that the project or function to be contracted for is 
likely to be satisfactorily performed under that contract and the 
project or function is likely to be properly completed or maintained 
under that contract.
    (b) The determination called for by paragraph (a) of this section, 
to be made prior to the award of a contract, will be made in writing by 
the contracting officer reflecting an analysis of the standards set 
forth in FAR 9.104-1.

<R05>
401.000  Scope of part.

    This part presents basic policies and general information about the 
Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Acquisition Regulation, subsequently 
referred to as the AGAR. The AGAR is an integral part of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulations System.


<R04>
               Subpart 401.1--Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
401.101  Purpose.

    (a) The AGAR provides for the codification and publication of 
uniform policies and procedures for acquisitions by contracting 
activities within USDA.
    (b) The purpose of the AGAR is to implement the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR), where further implementation is needed, and to 
supplement the FAR when coverage is needed for subject matter not 
covered in the FAR. The AGAR is not by itself a complete document, as it 
must be used in conjunction with the FAR.


<R05>
401.103  Authority.

    The AGAR and amendments thereto are issued under 5 U.S.C. 301 and 40 
U.S.C. 486(c). The Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) has the delegated 
authority to promulgate Departmental acquisition regulations.


<R05>
401.104  Applicability.

    The FAR and AGAR apply to all USDA acquisitions of supplies and 
services (including construction) which obligate appropriated funds, 
unless otherwise specified in this chapter or excepted by law.


<R05>
401.105  Issuance.


<R05>
401.105-1  Publication and code arrangement.

    (a) The AGAR is codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as 
Chapter 4 of Title 48, Federal Acquisition Regulations System, to 
implement and supplement Chapter 1 which constitutes the FAR. Parts 400 
through 499 have been assigned to USDA by the Office of the Federal 
Register.
    (b) The AGAR and its subsequent changes are published in:

[[Page 96]]

    (1) Daily issues of the Federal Register,
    (2) Cumulative form in the CFR, and
    (3) Loose-leaf form for distribution within USDA.
    (c) Section 553(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 
553, provides an exception from the standard public rulemaking 
procedures to the extent that the rule involves a matter relating to 
agency management or personnel or to public property, loans, grants, 
benefits, or contracts. OFPP Policy Letter 83-2 requires rulemaking for 
substantive acquisition rules but allows discretion in the matter for 
other than significant issues meeting the stated criteria. The AGAR has 
been promulgated and may be revised from time to time in accordance with 
the rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act and OFPP 
Policy Letter 83-2.


<R05>
401.105-2  Arrangement of regulations.

    AGAR coverage parallels the FAR in format, arrangement, and 
numbering system. However, subdivisions below the section and subsection 
levels may not always correlate directly to FAR designated paragraphs 
and subparagraphs.


<R05>
401.105-3  Copies.

    Copies of the AGAR published in CFR form may be purchased from the 
Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
D.C. 20402. Requests should reference Chapter 4 of Title 48 CFR.


<R05>
401.106  OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

    The following OMB control numbers apply to USDA solicitations and 
specified information collections within the AGAR:

otherwise controlling the relationship between USDA (including any of 
its contracting activities) and contractors or prospective contractors.
    (b) Each designated head of a contracting activity (HCA) is 
authorized to issue or authorize the issuance of, at any organizational 
level, internal guidance which does not have a significant effect beyond 
the internal operating procedures of the activity, or a significant cost 
or administrative impact on offerors or contractors. Internal guidance 
issued by contracting activities will not be published in the Federal 
Register. HCA's shall ensure that the guidance, procedures, or 
instructions issued--

    (a) The AGAR System is under the direct oversight and control of the 
SPE, who is responsible for review and issuance of all Department-wide 
acquisition regulations published in the Federal Register to assure 
compliance with FAR part 1.
    (b) The SPE is also responsible for review and issuance of 
unpublished, Department-wide internal guidance under the AGAR System.
    (c) HCA's are responsible for establishment and implementation of 
formal procedures for oversight and control of unpublished internal 
guidance issued within the contracting activity to implement FAR or AGAR 
requirements. These procedures shall be subject to the review and 
approval by the SPE.
    (d) The SPE is responsible for evaluating coverage under the AGAR 
System to determine applicability to other agencies and for recommending 
coverage to the FAR Secretariat for inclusion in the FAR.
    (e) Recommendations for revision of existing FAR coverage or new FAR 
coverage shall be submitted by the HCA to the SPE for further action.


<R05>
401.370  Exclusions.

    Subject to the policies of FAR subpart 1.3, certain USDA acquisition 
policies and procedures may be excluded from the AGAR under 
appropriately justified circumstances, such as:
    (a) Subject matter which is effective for a period less than 12 
months.
    (b) Subject matter which is instituted on an experimental basis for 
a reasonable period.
    (c) Acquisition procedures instituted on an interim basis to comply 
with the requirements of statute, regulation, Executive Order, OMB 
Circular, or OFPP Policy Letter.


<R05>
401.371  AGAR Advisories.

    The SPE may issue AGAR Advisories, consistent with the policies of 
the FAR and the AGAR, for the following purposes:
    (a) To communicate Department-wide policy and/or procedural guidance 
to contracting activities;
    (b) To delegate to procurement officials authority to make 
determinations or to take action to implement the policies of the FAR or 
the AGAR; and,
    (c) To establish internal policy and procedures on an interim basis, 
prior to incorporation in the AGAR or in a Departmental Directive.


<R05>
401.372  Departmental directives.

    Subject to the policies of FAR 1.3, USDA from time to time may issue 
internal directives to establish procedures, standards, guidance, or 
methods of performing duties, functions, or operations. Such directives 
include Departmental Regulations (DR's), Departmental Notices, and 
Secretary's Memoranda.


<R04>
             Subpart 401.4--Deviations From the FAR and AGAR


<R05>
401.402  Policy.

    Requests for authority to deviate from the provisions of the FAR or 
the AGAR shall be submitted in writing as

[[Page 98]]

far in advance as the exigencies of the situation will permit. Each 
request for deviation shall contain the following:
    (a) A statement of the deviation desired, including identification 
of the specific paragraph number(s) of the FAR and AGAR;
    (b) The reason why the deviation is considered necessary or would be 
in the best interest of the Government;
    (c) If applicable, the name of the contractor and identification of 
the contract affected;
    (d) A statement as to whether the deviation has been requested 
previously and, if so, circumstances of the previous request;
    (e) A description of the intended effect of the deviation;
    (f) A statement of the period of time for which the deviation is 
needed; and
    (g) Any pertinent background information which will contribute to a 
full understanding of the desired deviation.


<R05>
401.403  Individual deviations.

    In individual cases, deviations from either the FAR or the AGAR will 
be authorized only when essential to effect a necessary acquisition or 
where special circumstances make such deviations clearly in the best 
interest of the Government. Except for cost principles, HCA's may 
approve individual deviations from the AGAR, after coordinating with the 
General Counsel and the SPE. No deviations from the FAR or AGAR may be 
authorized at the contracting office level. A copy of each deviation and 
its supporting documentation shall be provided to the SPE. Deviations 
from the FAR shall not be made unless such action is authorized by the 
SPE after consultation with the Office of the General Counsel and any 
other appropriate office, on the basis of a written justification 
stating clearly the special circumstances involved.


<R05>
401.404  Class deviations.

    Where deviations from the FAR or AGAR are considered necessary for 
classes of contracts, requests for authority to deviate shall be 
submitted in writing to the SPE for approval. The SPE may authorize 
class deviations from the FAR without consulting the Chairperson of the 
Civilian Agency Acquisition Council where urgency precludes 
consultation. The SPE shall subsequently inform the Chairperson of the 
Civilian Agency Acquisition Council of the deviation including the 
circumstances under which it was required.


<R04>
        Subpart 401.6--Contracting Authority and Responsibilities


<R05>
401.601  General.

    (a) The authority and responsibility vested in the Secretary to 
manage USDA's acquisition function is delegated through the Assistant 
Secretary for Administration to the SPE. This broad authority includes, 
but is not limited to, the following responsibilities:
    (1) Prescribing and publishing Departmental acquisition policies, 
regulations, and procedures.
    (2) Taking any necessary actions consistent with policies, 
regulations, and procedures with respect to purchases, contracts, 
leases, and other transactions.
    (3) Designating contracting officers.
    (4) Establishing clear lines of contracting authority.
    (5) Evaluating and monitoring the performance of USDA's acquisition 
system.
    (6) Managing and enhancing career development of the contracting 
work force.
    (7) Participating in the development of Government-wide acquisition 
policies, regulations, and standards; and determining specific areas 
where government-wide performance standards should be established and 
applied.
    (8) Determining areas of Department-unique standards and developing 
unique Department-wide standards.
    (9) Certifying to the Secretary that the acquisition system meets 
approved standards.
    (b) The SPE may delegate contracting authority to the Heads of 
Contracting Activities (HCA's) and the responsibility to manage their 
acquisition function.
    (c) Unless prohibited by the FAR, the AGAR, or by other applicable 
statutes and regulations, the SPE may redelegate to HCA's the authority 
to make determinations as the agency head in

[[Page 99]]

order to implement the policies and procedures of the FAR. Such 
delegations shall be in writing, but need not be published.
    (d) Unless prohibited by the FAR, the AGAR, or by other applicable 
statutes or regulations, each HCA may designate one individual from the 
contracting activity to carry out the functions of the HCA (HCAD). The 
HCAD may exercise all authority delegated to the HCA.


<R05>
401.602  Contracting officers.


<R05>
401.602-3  Ratification of unauthorized commitments.

    (a) Definitions. Ratification, as used in this section, means the 
signed, documented action taken by an authorized official to approve and 
sanction a previously unauthorized commitment.
    Unauthorized commitment, as used in this section, means an agreement 
made by a Government representative who lacked the authority to enter 
into a contract on behalf of the Government.
    (b) Policy. The HCA may delegate ratification authority to the chief 
of the contracting office.
    (c) Procedure. Whenever an official of the cognizant contracting 
activity who is authorized to ratify unauthorized commitments learns 
that a person or firm has assumed work as a result of an unauthorized 
commitment, that official shall take the following actions:
    (1) Immediately inform any person who is performing work as a result 
of an unauthorized commitment that the work is being performed at that 
person's risk;
    (2) Inform the individual who made the unauthorized commitment of 
the seriousness of the act and the possible consequences;
    (3) Ensure that the individual who made the unauthorized commitment 
furnishes all records and documents concerning the commitment and a 
complete, written statement of facts, including, but not limited to: a 
statement as to why a contracting officer was not used; why the vendor 
was selected and a list of sources considered; a description of work to 
be performed or products to be furnished; the estimated or agreed price; 
whether an appropriation is available for the work; and whether 
performance has begun. Under exceptional circumstances, such as when the 
individual who made the unauthorized commitment is no longer available 
to attest to the circumstances of the unauthorized commitment, the 
ratifying official may waive these requirements; and
    (4) Decide whether ratification is proper and proceed as follows:
    (i) If ratification is not justifiable, provide the cognizant 
program office, contracting office, and the unauthorized contractor with 
an explanation of the decision not to ratify.
    (ii) If ratification appears adequately justified, ratify the action 
and retain or assign the contract to a successor contracting officer if 
necessary.
    (iii) Maintain related approval, decisional, and background 
documents in the contract file for audit purposes.
    (iv) Notify the cognizant program supervisor or line officer about 
the final disposition of the case; the notification may include a 
recommendation that the unauthorized commitment should be further 
considered a violation of USDA's employee conduct regulations.


<R05>
401.603  Selection, appointment, and termination of appointment.


<R05>
401.603-1  General.

    An HCA may delegate contracting authority to the extent authorized 
by the SPE in a general delegation of acquisition authority, by 
appointing qualified individuals as contracting officers, in accordance 
with the USDA Contracting Officer Warrant System, Departmental 
Regulation 5001-1.

    Debarring official. Pursuant to the Secretary's delegations of 
authority in 7 CFR 2.24, the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) is 
designated as the debarring official (Department Debarring Officer) with 
the following exceptions:
    (a) For commodity contracts awarded on behalf of the Commodity 
Credit Corporation (CCC), the Executive Vice President, CCC, or his 
designee is designated as the debarring official pursuant to 7 CFR part 
1407.
    (b) For contracts awarded under the School Lunch and Surplus Removal 
Programs (42 U.S.C. 1755 and 7 U.S.C. 612c), the Department Debarring 
Officer has delegated debarring authority to the Agricultural Marketing 
Service (AMS).

[63 FR 26995, May 15, 1998]


<R05>
409.404  List of parties excluded from Federal procurement and nonprocurement 
programs.

    The Department Debarring Officer is USDA's single point of contact 
with GSA for debarment and suspension actions taken under this subpart. 
The debarring official for AMS shall notify the Department Debarring 
Officer of each debarment and suspension action by promptly submitting a 
copy of the debarment or suspension notice and any later changes to the 
debarment or suspension status. The Department Debarring Officer will 
forward a copy of each notice to GSA for inclusion in the Government-
wide list.


<R05>
409.405  Effect of listing.

    Compelling reasons are considered to be present where failure to 
contract with the debarred or suspended contractor would seriously harm 
the agency's programs and prevent accomplishment of mission 
requirements. The SPE is authorized to make the determinations under FAR 
9.405. Requests for such determinations shall be submitted through the 
head of the contracting activity (HCA) to the SPE.


<R05>
409.405-1  Continuation of current contracts.

    The HCA is authorized to make the determinations under FAR 9.405-1.


<R05>
409.405-2  Restrictions on subcontracting.

    The HCA is authorized to approve subcontracts with debarred or 
suspended subcontractors under FAR 9.405-2.


<R05>
409.406  Debarment.


<R05>
409.406-3  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. When a contracting officer becomes 
aware of possible irregularities or any information which may be 
sufficient cause for debarment, the case shall be immediately referred 
through the HCA to the debarring official. The case must be accompanied 
by a complete statement of the facts (including a copy of

[[Page 109]]

any criminal indictments, if applicable) along with a recommendation for 
action. Where the statement of facts indicates the irregularities to be 
possible criminal offenses, or for any other reason further 
investigation is considered necessary, the matter shall be referred to 
the HCA who should consult with the Office of Inspector General to 
determine if further investigation is required prior to referring to the 
debarring official.
    (b) Decision-making process. If, after reviewing the recommendations 
and consulting with the Office of Inspector General and Office of the 
General Counsel, as appropriate, the debarring official determines 
debarment is justified, the debarring official shall initiate the 
proposed debarment in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and notify the HCA 
of the action taken.
    (c) Fact-finding proceeding. For actions listed under FAR 9.406-
3(b)(2), the contractor shall be given the opportunity to appear at an 
informal hearing. The hearing should be held at a location and time that 
is convenient to the parties concerned, if at all possible. The 
contractor and any specifically named affiliates may be represented by 
counsel or any duly authorized representative. Witnesses may be called 
by either party. The proceedings shall be conducted expeditiously and in 
such a manner that each party will have an opportunity to present all 
information considered pertinent to the proposed debarment. The 
contractor shall be provided a copy of a transcript of the proceedings 
under the conditions established in FAR 9.406-3(b)(2)(ii).


<R05>
409.407  Suspension.


<R05>
409.407-3  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. When a contracting officer becomes 
aware of possible irregularities or any information which may be 
sufficient cause for suspension, the case shall be immediately referred 
through the HCA to the debarring official. The case must be accompanied 
by a complete statement of the facts along with a recommendation for 
action. Where the statement of facts indicates the irregularities to be 
possible criminal offenses, or for any other reason further 
investigation is considered necessary, the matter shall be referred to 
the HCA who should consult with the Office of Inspector General to 
determine if further investigation is required prior to referring it to 
the debarring official.
    (b) Decision-making process. If, after reviewing the recommendations 
and consulting with the Office of Inspector General and Office of the 
General Counsel, as appropriate, the debarring official determines 
suspension is justified, the debarring official shall initiate the 
proposed suspension in accordance with FAR 9.407-3(c) and notify the HCA 
of the action taken.
    (c) Fact-finding proceedings. For actions listed under FAR 9.407-
3(b)(2), the contractor shall be given the opportunity to appear at an 
informal hearing, similar in nature to the hearing for debarments as 
discussed in 409.406-3(c).


<R05>
409.470  Appeals.

    A debarred or suspended contractor may appeal the debarring 
official's decision by mailing or otherwise furnishing a written notice 
within 90 days from the date of the decision to the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals, Washington, DC 20250. A copy of 
the notice of appeal shall be furnished to the debarring officer from 
whose decision the appeal is taken. Appeals under subpart 409.4 shall be 
governed by the rules and procedures of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals set forth in 7 CFR part 24.


<R04>
   Subpart 409.5--Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest


<R05>
409.503  Waiver.

    (a) The HCA, on a non-delegable basis, is authorized to waive any 
general rule or procedure in FAR 9.5 when in the Government's interest.
    (b) Each request for waiver shall include:
    (1) The general rule or procedure proposed to be waived;
    (2) An analysis of the potential conflict, including the benefits 
and detriments to the Government and prospective contractors;

[[Page 110]]

    (3) A discussion of why the conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, 
or mitigated; and
    (4) Advice of counsel obtained under FAR 9.504(b).

disclose neither the number of offerors nor their identity except as 
authorized by FAR subpart 15.5. (See also FAR 5.403.)
    (b) The contracting officer shall obtain the following written 
agreement from the non-Government evaluator prior to the release of any 
proposal to that evaluator.

         AGREEMENT GOVERNING THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PROPOSALS

RFP_____________________________________________________________________
Offeror_________________________________________________________________
    1. To the best of my knowledge and belief, no conflict of interest 
exists that may diminish my capacity to perform an impartial and 
objective review of the offeror's proposal, or may otherwise result in a 
biased opinion or an unfair advantage. If a potential conflict of 
interest arises or if I identify such a conflict, I agree to notify the 
Government promptly concerning the potential conflict. In determining 
whether any potential conflict of interest exists, I agree to review 
whether my or my employer's relationships with other persons or 
entities, including, but not limited to, ownership of stocks, bonds, 
other outstanding financial interests or commitments, employment 
arrangements (past, present, or under consideration), and, to the extent 
known by me, all financial interests and employment arrangements of my 
spouse, minor children, and other members of my immediate household, may 
place me in a position of conflict, real or apparent, with the 
evaluation proceedings.
    2. I agree to use proposal information only for evaluation purposes. 
I understand that any authorized restriction on disclosure placed upon 
the proposal by the prospective contractor or subcontractor or by the 
Government shall be applied to any reproduction or abstracted 
information of the proposal. I agree to use my best effort to safeguard 
such information physically, and not to disclose the contents of, or 
release any information relating to, the proposal(s) to anyone outside 
of the Source Evaluation Board or other

[[Page 114]]

panel assembled for this acquisition, the Contracting Officer, or other 
individuals designated by the Contracting Officer.
    3. I agree to return to the Government all copies of proposals, as 
well as any abstracts, upon completion of the evaluation.

(Name and Organization)

(Date)

                           (End of provision)

    (c) The release of a proposal to a non-Government evaluator for 
evaluation does not constitute the release of information for purposes 
of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).
    (d) The contracting officer shall attach a cover page bearing the 
following notice: GOVERNMENT NOTICE FOR HANDLING PROPOSALS--This 
proposal shall be used and disclosed for evaluation purposes only. 
Attach a copy of this Government notice to every reproduction or 
abstract of the proposal. Any authorized restrictive notices which the 
submitter places on this proposal shall be strictly complied with. 
Disclosure of this proposal outside the Government for evaluation 
purposes shall be made only to the extent authorized by, and in 
accordance with, FAR 3.104-5, FAR 15.207, and AGAR 415.207.

<R05>

contracting and subcontracting opportunities to small, disadvantaged, 
minority, and women-owned businesses.


<R05>
419.201-70  Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU).

    The Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) 
develops rules, policy, procedures and guidelines for the effective 
administration of USDA's small and disadvantaged business procurement 
preference program to include minority and women-owned business.


<R05>
419.201-71  Small business coordinators.

    The head of the contracting activity (HCA) or a representative of 
the HCA shall designate in writing a small business coordinator in each 
contracting office. Supervisors of small business coordinators are 
encouraged to provide sufficient time for the coordinators to carry out 
their small business program duties. Coordinators' duties shall include, 
but not be limited to, the following:
    (a) Review each proposed acquisition expected to exceed the 
simplified acquisition threshold prior to its solicitation. The 
coordinator shall:
    (1) Recommend section 8(a) action and identify potential 
contractors, or
    (2) Identify available minority and women-owned businesses to be 
solicited by competitive procedures. Coordinators shall document the 
contract file with recommendations made and actions taken.
    (b) Participate in goal-setting procedures and planning activities 
and establish aggressive minority and women-owned business goals based 
on the annual review of advance acquisition plans.
    (c) Participate in the review of those contracts which require the 
successful offeror to submit written plans for the utilization of small 
and small disadvantaged businesses as subcontractors.
    (d) Ensure that purchases exceeding $2,500 and not exceeding the 
simplified acquisition threshold are reserved exclusively for small 
businesses, including minority and women-owned businesses. This policy 
shall be implemented unless the contracting officer is unable to obtain 
offers from two or more small business concerns that are competitive 
with market prices and in terms of quality and delivery of the goods or 
services being purchased.
    (e) Maintain comprehensive source listings of small businesses.
    (f) Upon written request, provide small, minority and women-owned 
businesses the bidders mailing lists of individuals receiving 
solicitations which will contain the subcontracting clause entitled 
``Utilization of Small Business Concerns and Small Disadvantaged 
Business Concerns.'' These lists may be limited to those supplies or 
services of major interest to the requesting firms.

[[Page 118]]

    (g) Develop a program of contacts with local, small, minority, and 
women-owned trade, business, and professional associations and 
organizations and Indian tribal councils to apprise them of USDA's 
program needs and recurring contract requirements.
    (h) Periodically meet with program managers to discuss requirements 
of the small business preference program, explore the feasibility of 
breaking large complex requirements into smaller lots suitable for 
participation by small firms, and encourage program managers to meet 
with these firms so that their capabilities can be demonstrated.
    (i) Establish internal operating procedures which implement the 
requirements of the regulations as set forth in this part 419. Compile 
data and prepare all reports pertaining to the small, minority and 
women-owned business activities. Ensure that these reports are accurate, 
complete and up-to-date.
    (j) Assist and counsel small business firms and especially those 
found to be nonresponsive or nonresponsible to help qualify them for 
future awards.
    (k) Review proposed large contract requirements to determine the 
potential for breaking out components suitable for purchase from small 
business firms.
    (l) Ensure that the SBA Resident Procurement Center Representative 
(PCR) is provided an opportunity and reasonable time to review any 
solicitation that meets the dollar threshold for small business and 
small disadvantaged business subcontracting plans.

    (a) Applicability. The AR&WPP applies to all USDA organizations; 
i.e., USDA mission areas, USDA corporations (as described in 31 U.S.C. 
9101), and USDA staff offices not included within a mission area.
    (b) Authority. The AR&WPP has been established to comply with the 
requirements of Executive Order 12873 to coordinate all environmental 
programs in the areas of procurement and acquisition, standards and 
specification review, facilities management, waste prevention and 
recycling, and logistics.
    (c) Responsibilities. (1) Each USDA organization will identify one 
or more AR&WPP Coordinators in writing to represent the mission area, 
serve on the Council of Coordinators, and work in conjunction with the 
USDA Environmental Executive.
    (2) Each USDA organization periodically will conduct an audit 
(survey or inventory) of the waste stream generated by the organization. 
The goals of the audit are:
    (i) To identify and measure the elements of waste generated in its 
operations;
    (ii) To identify processes, equipment, techniques, or materials 
which generate waste in energy or materials;
    (iii) To identify actions which can be taken to reduce and to 
recycle or recover the wastes generated; and
    (iv) To assign time frames to accomplish those actions.
    (3) Each USDA organization will implement an avoidance or recovery 
or recycling program based on the results of the waste stream audit.
    (4) Each USDA organization will implement a plan to install on-going 
waste prevention techniques.
    (5) Each USDA organization will ensure that responsibility for 
preparation, implementation, and monitoring of its affirmative 
procurement program is shared between program personnel and procurement 
personnel.
    (6) Each USDA organization will establish measurable goals by which 
the effectiveness of its participation in AR&WPP can be assessed on an 
annual basis.
    (7) Each USDA organization will sponsor annual awards to recognize 
the most innovative environmental program of the year.
    (d) Acquisition and administration. (1) Each USDA organization will 
annually review its product descriptions to enhance the use of recovered 
materials and environmentally preferable products and services by 
eliminating from the product description:
    (i) Any exclusion of recovered materials, and
    (ii) Any requirement that items be manufactured from virgin 
materials.
    (2) Each USDA organization will create a promotion program to 
internally and externally promote its desire to buy recycled products.
    (3) Each USDA organization will implement the USDA electronic 
acquisition system to reduce waste by eliminating unnecessary paper 
transactions and to foster accurate data collection and reporting of 
acquisitions.
    (4) Each USDA organization will establish an affirmative procurement 
program specifically for the needs and requirements of its own 
organization, to maximize environmental benefits, consistent with price, 
performance, and availability considerations.
    (5) Each USDA organization will ensure that the on-going inspection 
and production surveillance systems in place will monitor the production 
or the testing of goods and services to verify the recovered material 
contents reported.
    (6) Each USDA organization will include
    (i) Requirements in contracts for contractor operation of 
Government-owned or leased facilities to provide for waste prevention 
activities and the recycling of materials and
    (ii) Environmental and recycling factors in the selection process 
for the acquisition and management of real property.

<R04>
        Subpart 426.70--Preference for Selected Biobased Products


<R05>
426.7000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart supplements the FAR to implement the set-asides and 
preferences described in section 1665 of the Food, Agriculture, 
Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 5909).


<R05>
426.7001  Applicability.

    This subpart applies to USDA and all of its components, including 
corporations.


<R05>
426.7002  Authority.

    Section 1665 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 
1990 (7 U.S.C. 5909) authorizes USDA to establish set-asides and other 
preferences for products that have been assisted by the Alternative 
Agricultural Research and Commercialization Corporation (AARCC).


<R05>
426.7003  Policy.

    (a) AARCC provides financial assistance to private companies and 
other parties to commercialize nonfood, nonfeed products made from 
agricultural and forestry materials and animal by-products (biobased 
products). Biobased products by their nature are environmentally 
friendly, and, in many instances, use agricultural material that 
otherwise would be waste. It is the policy of USDA to acquire AARCC 
products to the maximum extent practicable. This policy applies to all 
acquisitions of products regardless of dollar value.
    (b) USDA shall satisfy its requirements for products the same or 
essentially the same as AARCC products by applying the preferences or 
set-asides described by this subpart.


<R05>
426.7004  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    AARCC products are products developed with assistance provided by 
AARCC as authorized by 7 U.S.C. 5905.
    Acquisitions of products means an acquisition of one or more 
products for the use of the Government.
    Acquisitions involving the use of products means an acquisition in 
which a Government contractor uses products in contract performance.
    Price preference means an amount, expressed as a percentage, to be 
used in the evaluation of offers in an acquisition of products.
    Set-aside means a requirement that vendors responding to a 
solicitation offer AARCC products.
    Solicitation includes actions taken under parts 12, 13, 14, 15, and 
36 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
    Technical evaluation preference means the use of an award factor or 
subfactor in which the Government expresses its preference for AARCC 
products.


<R05>
426.7005  Preference list.

    (a) The Office of Procurement and Policy Management (OPPM) and AARCC 
jointly shall establish and maintain a Preference List for AARCC 
products.
    (b) The Preference List shall contain the list of preferred 
products, source information for these products, the type(s) of 
preference to be applied, the beginning and ending dates for the use of 
preferences, and other terms established to define the preference given 
to a product.
    (c) The Preference List will be publicized within USDA by means of 
AGAR Advisories (see 401.371). Copies of the Preference List may be 
obtained from OPPM. The Preference List will

[[Page 126]]

also be posted on the World Wide Web at the USDA Procurement Home Page.


<R05>
426.7006  Use of a set-aside or a price preference.

    Acquisitions for products the same or essentially the same as those 
products appearing on the Preference List shall either be set-aside 
exclusively or shall include a price preference for those products shown 
on the Preference List. The actual price preference to be used shall be 
determined by the requiring office but may not exceed the percentage 
shown on the Preference List.


<R05>
426.7007  Use of a technical evaluation preference.

    Acquisitions involving the use of products the same or essentially 
the same as those products appearing on the Preference List shall 
include a technical evaluation preference, if authorized in the 
Preference List. The technical evaluation preference may be determined 
by the contracting officer specifically for each acquisition.


<R05>
426.7008  Identification of preferred products.

    (a) Products subject to a set-aside or technical preference shall be 
separately listed in the schedule, specification, or performance work 
statement.
    (b) Products subject to a price preference shall be separately 
listed in the schedule.


<R05>
426.7009  Contract provisions.

    (a) Each solicitation containing a price or technical preference 
under this subpart shall contain the provision 452.226-70, Preferred 
Products.
    (b) Each solicitation for products subject to a set-aside shall 
include the provision 452.226-71, Set-Aside For Mandatory Products.
    (c) Each solicitation for products subject to a price preference 
shall include the provision 452.226-72, Price Preference for Award.
    (d) Solicitations for products may contain both the provision in

identification of products by make and model.)
    (a) If items called for by this solicitation have been identified by 
a ``brand name or equal'' description, such identification is intended 
to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality 
and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Offers of 
``equal'' products (including products of the brand name manufacturer 
other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award 
if such products are clearly identified in the offer (see clause 
452.211-2) and are determined by the Contracting Officer to meet fully 
the salient characteristics requirements listed in the solicitation.

[[Page 146]]

    (b) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that it is 
offering an ``equal'' product, the offeror shall be considered as 
offering the brand name product(s) referenced in the solicitation.
    (c)(1) If the offeror proposes to furnish an ``equal'' product or 
products, the brand name(s), if any, and any other required information 
about the product(s) to be furnished shall be inserted in the space 
provided in the solicitation. The evaluation of offers and the 
determination as to the equality of the product(s) offered shall be the 
responsibility of the Government and will be based on information 
furnished by the offeror or identified in its offer as well as other 
information reasonably available to the contracting activity. Caution to 
offerors: The contracting activity is not responsible for locating or 
securing any information which is not identified in the offer and is not 
reasonably available to the contracting activity. Accordingly, to assure 
that sufficient information is available, the offeror must furnish as a 
part of its offer all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, 
drawings, or other information) necessary for the contracting activity 
to (i) determine whether the product offered meets the salient 
characteristics requirement of the solicitation, and (ii) establish 
exactly what the offeror proposes to furnish and what the Government 
would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information 
furnished may include specific reference to information previously 
furnished or to information otherwise available to the contracting 
activity.
    (2) If an offeror proposes to modify a product so as to make it 
conform to the requirements of the solicitation, the offer shall include 
(i) a clear description of such proposed modifications and (ii) clearly 
marked descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.

    (a) General Instructions. Proposals submitted in response to this 
solicitation shall be furnished in the following format with the numbers 
of copies as specified below.
    (1) The proposal must include a technical proposal and business 
proposal. Each of the parts shall be separate and complete so that 
evaluation of one may be accomplished independently from evaluation of 
the other. The technical proposal must not contain reference to cost; 
however, resource information (such as data concerning labor hours and 
categories, materials, subcontracts, etc.) must be contained in the 
technical proposal so that the contractor's understanding of the 
statement of work may be evaluated.
    (2) Offerors may, at their discretion, submit alternate proposals or 
proposals which deviate from the requirement; provided, that an offeror 
also submit a proposal for performance of the work as specified in the 
statement of work. Any ``alternate'' proposal may be considered if 
overall performance would be improved or not compromised, and if it is 
in the best interest of the Government. Alternate proposals, or 
deviations from any requirement of this RFP, must be clearly identified.
    (3) The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with the 
evaluation criteria set forth in Section M of this RFP.
    (4) Offerors shall submit their proposal(s) in the following format 
and the quantities specified:
    (a) ------* copies of the completed, signed offer (Sections A 
through K of the solicitation package)
    (b) ------* copies of the technical proposal
    (c) ------* copies of the business/cost proposal
    (b) Technical Proposal Instructions. The technical proposal will be 
used to make an evaluation and arrive at a determination as to whether 
the proposal will meet the requirements of the Government. Therefore, 
the technical proposal must present sufficient information to reflect a 
thorough understanding of the requirements and a detailed, description 
of the techniques, procedures and program for achieving the objectives 
of the specifications/statement of work. Proposals which merely 
paraphrase the requirements of the Government's specifications/ 
statement of work, or use such phrases as ``will comply'' or ``standard 
techniques will be employed'' will be considered unacceptable and will 
not be considered further. As a minimum, the proposal must clearly 
provide the following:
    (Contracting Officer shall identify in this section the minimum 
information required to evaluate each technical evaluation factor listed 
in Section M.)
    (c) Business Proposal Instructions.
    (1) Cost Proposal.
    In addition to any other requirements for cost/pricing information 
required in clause FAR 52.215-20, Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data 
or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data (OCT 1997), the following 
is required:
    (Contracting Officer shall identify additional information required 
if appropriate.)
    (2) Business Proposal.
    (a) Furnish financial statements for the last two years, including 
an interim statement for the current year, unless previously provided to 
the office issuing the RFP, in

[[Page 148]]

which case a statement as to when and where this information was 
provided may be furnished instead.
    (b) Specify the financial capacity, working capital and other 
resources available to perform the contract without assistance from any 
outside source.
    (c) Provide the name, location, and intercompany pricing policy for 
other divisions, subsidiaries, parent company, or affiliated companies 
that will perform work or furnish materials under this contract.

                           (End of provision)

    *Contracting officer shall insert number of copies required.

base bid item, plus or minus (in the order of priority listed in the 
schedule) those additive or deductive bid items providing the most 
features of the work within the funds determined by the government to be 
available before bids are opened. If addition of another bid item in the 
listed order of priority would make the award exceed such funds for all 
bidders, it shall be skipped and the next subsequent additive bid item 
in a lower amount shall be added if award therein can be made within 
such funds. For example, when the amount available is $100,000 and a 
bidder's base bid and four successive additives are $85,000, $10,000, 
$8,000, $6,000, and $4,000, the aggregate amount of the bid for purposes 
of award would be $99,000 for the base bid plus the first and fourth 
additives, the second and third additives being skipped because of each 
of them would cause the aggregate bid to exceed $100,000. In any case 
all bids shall be evaluated on the basis of the same additive or 
deductive bid items, determined as above provided. The listed order of 
priority need be followed only for determining the low bidder. After 
determination of the low bidder as stated, award in the best interests 
of the Government may be made on the selected first or base bid item and 
any combination of additive or deductive items for which funds are 
determined to be available at the time of the award, provided that

[[Page 152]]

award on such combination of bid items does not exceed the amount 
offered by any other conforming responsible bidder for the same 
combination of bid items.

<R04>
               Subpart 501.1--Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
501.101  Purpose.

    (a) The General Services Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) contains 
agency acquisition policies and practices, contract clauses, 
solicitation provisions, and forms that control the relationship between 
GSA and contractors and prospective contractors.
    (b) GSAR address rules directly to you, the contracting officer, 
unless otherwise indicated.


<R05>
501.103  Authority.

    GSA's Senior Procurement Executive issues the GSAR under the 
authority of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 
1949, as amended.


<R05>
501.104  Applicability.

    (a) General. The GSAR applies to contracts for suppliers or 
services, including construction.
    (b) Acquisition of leasehold interests in real property. Part 570 
establishes rules for the acquisition of leasehold interests in real 
property. Other provisions of 48 CFR chapter 5 (GSAR) do not apply to 
leases of real property unless specifically cross-reference in part 570.
    (c) Relationship to state. Some GSAR rules implement and interpret 
laws and other authorities affecting procurement. A GSAR rule 
specifically directed by statute has the force and effect of law.
    (d) GSAR/FAR Relationship. The GSAR may deviate from the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) if authorized. If the GSAR does not 
implement the FAR, the FAR alone governs.


<R05>
501.105  Issuance.


<R05>
501.105-1  Publication and code arrangement.

    The GSAR is published in the following sources:
    (a) Daily issue of the Federal Register.
    (b) Annual Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), as Chapter 5 of Title 
48.
    (c) GSA Acquisition Manual distributed within GSA.
    (d) GSA Home Page at http://www/gas.gov. Click on either 
``Government Agencies'' or on ``Business and Industry,'' the click on 
``Acquisition.''


<R05>
501.105-2  Arrangement of regulations.

    (a) The GSAR numbers and captions policies and procedures to 
correspond to how they appear in the FAR, e.g., 1.104 in the FAR is 
501.104 in the GSAR.
    (b) GSAR rules not implementing the FAR have numbers beginning with 
70, e.g., part 570, subsection 515.209-70.
    (c) The GSAR may have gaps in its numbering scheme because a FAR 
rule may not require GSAR implementation.


<R05>
501.105-3  Copies.

    The GSAR in CFR form may be purchased from: Superintendent of 
Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.

             Subpart 501.4--Deviations From the FAR and GSAR


<R05>
501.402  Policy.

    Uniformity is a goal of GSA's Acquisition Regulation System. Despite

    (a) Develop and test new procedures and techniques.
    (b) Adopt alternate procedures in the public interest for unique 
programmatic or managerial requirements
    (c) Deviate from a regulatory provision implementing a statutory

    (a) The Contracting Director approves individual deviations from the 
FAR and GSAR.
    (b) If GSA delegates authority to another agency and requires 
compliance with the GSAR as a condition of the delegation, the 
Contracting Director in the agency receiving the delegation may approve 
individual deviations from the GSAR unless the agency head receiving the 
delegation designates another official.
    (c) Send a copy of each deviation to GSA's Senior Procurement 
Executive (MV).


<R05>
501.404  Class deviations.

    (a) HCAs approve class deviations from the FAR and GSAR.
    (b) If GSA delegates authority to another agency and requires 
compliance with the GSAR as a condition of the delegation, the HCA in 
the agency receiving the delegation may approve class deviations from 
the GSAR unless the agency head receiving the delegation designates 
another official.
    (c) Send a copy of each deviation to GSA's Senior Procurement 
Executive (MV).
    (d) A request for class deviations must be supported by statements 
that fully describe the need for and the nature of the deviation.
    (e) Class deviations from the GSAR:
    (1) Expire in 12 months if not extended.
    (2) May be rescinded earlier by GSA's Senior Procurement Executive 
or by officials designated under paragraph (a) of this section without 
prejudice to any action taken previously.

of the GSA Board of Contract Appeals. Referrals for fact-finding are not 
made in cases arising from a conviction or indictment as defined in FAR 
9.403. If a referral is made, the fact-finding official takes all the

preponderance of the evidence.
    (d) The Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, may reject the 
findings of the fact-finding official only if the findings are clearly 
erroneous or arbitrary and capricious.

Government's rights under FAR 3.204(c) only after considering mitigating 
factors.

    (1) Prescribes procedures for safeguarding classified information 
required to be disclosed to contractors in connection with the 
solicitation of offers, and the award, performance, and termination of 
contracts.
    (2) Implements the requirements of the Department of Defense's

<R04>
            Subpart 504.5--Electronic Commerce in Contracting


<R05>
504.500  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart provides policy and procedure for use of GSA's 
Electronic Posting System (EPS).


<R05>
504.502  Policy.

    (a) The EPS is GSA's primary vehicle for disseminating synopses and 
written solicitations. GSA intends that the EPS will substitute for, not 
supplement, paper copies of solicitations. (Note that FAR 2.101 defines 
``in writing'' or ``written'' to include ``electronically transmitted 
and stored information.'')
    (b) This policy does not apply to orders placed against existing 
contracts, including Federal Supply Service schedule contracts.
    (c) Nothing in this policy limits your authority to obtain oral 
quotations or proposals as authorized by regulation (e.g., FAR 13.106-1 
or FAR 15.203(f)).


<R05>
504.570  Procedures for using the EPS.

    (a) You must use the EPS to issue any synopsis required by FAR part 
5 or GSAR part 505.

[[Page 167]]

    (b) You must issue each written solicitation on the EPS, except as 
provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (d) of this section.
    (c) Although GSA intends that the EPS will substitute for paper 
copies of solicitations, web-based transactions are not practical in 
some industries or in some geographic areas at this time.
    (1) If you expect that electronic access to a solicitation will 
result in adequate competition, distribute the solicitation only through 
the EPS. Include the following notice in the related synopsis:

    GSA is issuing this solicitation only electronically. Interested 
parties may access the solicitation at http://www.eps.gov. This site 
provides instructions for downloading the solicitation file.

    (2) If you believe that distribution of paper copies is necessary to 
ensure adequate competition, document the file to justify distribution 
of paper copies. Include the notice in paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
in the related synopsis, leaving out the first sentence.
    (d) In some cases, release of construction drawings must be 
controlled to ensure adequate security. In other cases, an exhibit or 
attachment incorporated in a solicitation may not be available 
electronically. In either of these cases, you must explain in both the 
synopsis and the solicitation how interested parties may obtain a copy. 
In addition to the notice required by paragraph (c), include a notice 
substantially the same as follows in both the synopsis and solicitation. 
Tailor the notice as necessary for the particular acquisition.

    This solicitation incorporates documents which are not available 
electronically. See [Identify the solicitation section that lists the 
subject documents]. Interested parties may request copies of these 
documents by writing the Contracting Officer at the address in [Identify 
address block in the solicitation].

    (e) The Electronic Posting System Manual provides detailed 
instructions for using the EPS. The Manual is available at http://
www.eps.gov/buyer.html.

    (1) Seriousness of the cause for debarment or suspension.
    (2) Extent of contract performance.
    (3) Potential costs of termination and reprocurement.
    (4) Need for or urgency of the requirement, contract coverage, and 
the impact of delay for reprocurement.
    (5) Availability of other safeguards to protect the Government's 
interest until completion of the contract.
    (6) Availability of alternate competitive sources to meet the 
requirement (e.g., other multiple award contracts, readily available 
commercial items, etc.).
    (d) The debarring official is the designee under FAR 9.405-1(c).

    The debarring official is the designee under FAR 9.405-2(a).


<R05>
509.406  Debarment.


<R05>
509.406-1  General.

    The debarring official is the designee under FAR 9.406-1(c).


<R05>
509.406-3  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral.
    (1) Refer to the debarring official matters involving serious 
contract improprieties or performance deficiencies. Performance 
deficiencies that continue over a period of time or apply to more than 
one contract may warrant debarment consideration.

[[Page 172]]

    (2) Refer possible criminal or fraudulent activities to the Office 
of the Inspector General (OIG). See 5 CFR 6701.107, Reporting Waste, 
Fraud, Abuse, and Corruption. If, after investigation, the OIG believes 
a cause for debarment exists, it will refer the matter to the debarring 
official for consideration of debarment action.
    (b) Reports. Include in referrals to the debarring official a report 
that contains at least the following:
    (1) The recommendation and supporting rationale.
    (2) A list of parties to be considered for possible debarment, 
including the contractor, principals, and affiliates. Include last known 
home and business addresses, zip codes, and DUNS Number.
    (3) A statement of facts.
    (4) Copies of documentary evidence and a list of witnesses. Include 
addresses and telephone numbers. Determine their availability to appear 
at a fact-finding proceeding and identify the subject matter of their 
testimony.
    (5) GSA's acquisition history with the contractor. Include recent 
experience, copies of the pertinent contracts, and an explanation of 
impact debarment would have on GSA programs. OIG referrals do not 
require this explanation; the debarring official will obtain the 
information directly from the contracting activity(s).
    (6) A list of any known active or potential criminal investigations, 
criminal or civil proceedings, or administrative claims before the Board 
of Contract Appeals.
    (7) A statement regarding the impact of the debarment action on GSA 
programs. This statement is not required for referrals by the Inspector 
General; the debarring official will obtain a statement directly from 
the contracting activity(s).
    (c) Review. The debarring official will review the report, and after 
coordinating with assigned legal counsel, either:
    (1) Initiate debarment action.
    (2) Decline debarment action.
    (3) Request additional information.
    (4) Refer the matter to the OIG for further investigation and 
development of a case file.
    (d) Decisionmaking process.
    (1) The debarring official will provide:
    (i) Notice of declinations, proposed debarments, and decisions to 
the referring activity.
    (ii) Notice of proposed debarment to each party being considered for 
debarment.
    (iii) Decision notices to each party after considering information 
in the administrative record and information and argument submitted by 
the affected party or parties.
    (2) A party proposed for debarment:
    (i) Has 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice to respond to 
the debarring official or the debarment becomes final.
    (ii) May request and receive a copy of the administrative record 
that was the basis for the proposed debarment. If information is 
withheld, the party will be notified and provided the reason.
    (iii) May request the opportunity to present information and 
argument in person to the debarring official. The debarring official 
will schedule an oral presentation within 20 calendar days of receipt of 
the request, unless a longer period of time is requested by the party. 
An oral presentation is informal and a transcript usually is not made. 
The party may supplement the oral presentation with written information 
and arguments.
    (iv) May identify to the debarring official material facts in 
dispute and the bases. For an action other than one based on a 
conviction of civil judgment, a party may request review and a written 
finding by a fact-finding official.
    (3) The debarring official will determine whether there is a genuine 
dispute of material fact. If so, the debarring official refers the 
matter to a fact-finding official, who will take the following action as 
appropriate:
    (i) Schedule a hearing within 20 calendar days after receipt of a 
request to resolve disputed facts.
    (ii) Grant extensions for good cause.
    (iii) Provide notice of scheduled hearing.
    (iv) Conduct hearings under rules consistent with FAR 9.406-3(b)(2).
    (v) Resolve facts in dispute and provide the debarring official with 
written

[[Page 173]]

findings of fact based on a preponderance of the evidence. The fact-
finding official provides the written findings of fact (together with a 
transcription of the proceeding, unless waived) within 20 calendar days 
after the hearing record closes.


<R05>
509.407  Suspension.


<R05>
509.407-1  General.

    The suspending official is the designee under FAR 9.407-1(d).


<R05>
509.407-3  Procedures.

    (a) General. The procedures in 509.406-3 apply to suspension actions 
except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Fact-finding.
    (1) Fact-finding will not be conducted in an action:
    (i) Based on an indictment.
    (ii) When the suspending official finds no genuine dispute of 
material facts.
    (2) If the action is not based on an indictment, the suspending 
official must coordinate with the Department of Justice or state 
prosecutorial authority through OIG. Based on the advice received, the 
suspending official will determine if fact-finding would impair 
substantial interests of the Federal or state Government. In an action 
not based on an indictment, a suspended party may:
    (i) Identify to the suspending official material facts in dispute 
and the bases.
    (ii) Request review and a written finding by a fact-finding official 
to resolve genuine disputes of material fact. For procedures involving a 
genuine dispute of material fact, see 509.406-3(d)(3).

instead of FAR 52.212-2.
    (b) Use of required provisions and clauses. Use only those 
provisions and clauses prescribed in this part. Unless the use of a 
provision or clause prescribed elsewhere in the GSAR is consistent with 
customary commercial practice for the item being acquired, disregard 
contrary instructions. Provisions and clauses prescribed in this part 
will be revised to reflect the applicability of new statutes and 
executive orders.
    (c) Discretionary use of GSAR provisions and clauses. Consistent

<R05>
514.201  Preparation of invitations for bids.


<R05>
514.201-1  Uniform contract format.

    Include the following notice in each solicitation:

    The information collection requirements contained in this 
solicitation/contract, are either required by regulation or approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act and assigned OMB Control No. 3090-0162.


<R05>
514.201-2  Part I--The Schedule.

    (a) When you use Standard Form 33, Solicitation, Offer and Award, 
include the following cautionary notice:

    Notice to Bidders--Use Item 13 of the Standard Form 33, 
Solicitation, Offer and Award, to offer prompt payment discounts. The 
Prompt Payment clause of this solicitation sets forth payment terms. Do 
not insert any statement in Item 13 which requires payment sooner than 
the time stipulated in the Prompt Payment clause. Example: If you insert 
``NET 20'' in Item 13, GSA will reject your offer as nonresponsive 
because the entry contradicts the 30 day payment terms specified in the 
Prompt Payment clause.

    (b) When you use any other authorized form (e.g., Standard Form 
1447, Solicitation/Contract), include the notice in paragraph (a) of 
this section. Change the reference to the form number, form title, and 
item number accordingly.


<R05>
Sec. 514.201-6  Solicitation provisions.

    When you will consider all or none bids, insert the provision at 
552.214-70, ``All or None'' Offers, in the solicitation. For 
requirements or indefinite quantity contracts, use Alternate I. Do not 
include this provision in solicitations when you require the bidder to 
submit bids on all items and will make only one award.


<R05>
514.201-7  Contract clauses.

    (a) Stock replenishment contracts. For some stock replenishment 
contracts, individual contractors may be unable to furnish the 
Government's monthly requirements. You may determine that progressive 
awards will be more expedient. In such cases, insert a clause 
substantially the same as the clause 552.214-71, Progressive Awards and 
Monthly Quantity Allocations, in the solicitation and contract.
    (b) Examinations of Records. (1) Insert 552.214-70, Examination of 
Records by GSA, in solicitations and contracts for supplies or services 
that exceed $100,000, and acquisitions of leasehold interests in real 
property that exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, that 
meet at least one of the following conditions:
    (i) Involve the use or disposition of Government-furnished property.
    (ii) Provide for advance payments, progress payments based on cost, 
or guaranteed loan.
    (iii) Contain a price warranty or price reduction clause.
    (iv) Include an economic price adjustment clause where the 
adjustment is not based solely on an established, third party index.
    (v) Are requirements, indefinite-quantity, or letter contracts as 
defined in FAR part 16.
    (vi) Contain the provision at FAR 52.223-4, Recovered Materials 
Certification.
    (2) You may modify the clause to define the specific area of audit 
(e.g., the

[[Page 178]]

use or disposition of Government-furnished property). Legal Counsel and 
the Assistant Inspector General--Auditing or Regional Inspector General-
-Auditing, as appropriate, must concur in any modifications to the 
clause.


<R05>
514.202  General rules for solicitation of bids.


<R05>
514.202-4  Bid samples.

    (a) Solicitation requirements. (1) When you require bid samples, 
require bidders to submit samples produced by the manufacturer whose 
products will be supplied under the contract.
    (2) The FAR limits use of bid samples to cases where you cannot 
describe some characteristics of a product adequately in the 
specification or purchase description. This usually applies to 
subjective characteristics. You may determine that you need to examine 
objective characteristics of bid samples to determine the responsiveness 
of a bid. Base your determination on past experience or other valid 
considerations. In the solicitation, separately list ``Subjective 
Characteristics'' and ``Objective Characteristics.''
    (3) A sample provision appears at 552.214-72, Bid Sample 
Requirements. You may use this provision as shown or modify it to fit 
the circumstances of a procurement.
    (b) Handling and disposition of samples. (1) Retain samples from 
accepted bids for the period of contract performance. If you have no 
outstanding claims regarding the contract, dispose of the samples at the 
end of the contract term following the bidder's instructions.
    (2) If you anticipate a claim regarding the contract, retain the bid 
samples until the claim is resolved.
    (3) Retain samples from unsuccessful bids until you make award. 
After award, dispose of these samples following the bidder's 
instructions.
    (c) Using bid samples. Include the information required by FAR 
14.202-4(e) in the solicitation. Provide the number, size, and full 
description of samples with instructions on how to submit bids. List the 
characteristics that you will examine. The list needs to include any 
aspect of the bid sample the acquisition team will examine to determine 
the product(s) acceptability.


<R05>
514.203  Methods of soliciting bids.


<R05>
514.203-1  Transmittal to prospective bidders.

    Prospective bidders, as used in FAR 14.203-1, include both the 
following:
    (a) The incumbent contractor, except when its written response to 
the notice of contract action under FAR subpart 5.2 states a negative 
interest.
    (b) Bidders that responded to recent solicitations for the same or 
similar items.


<R05>
514.270  Aggregate awards.


<R05>
514.270-1  Definition.

    Aggregate award means an arrangement whereby two or more separately-
priced line items are combined for award to that bidder whose bid will 
result in the lowest overall cost to the Government for the line items 
as a group. The individual price for each item does not have to be the 
lowest bid received. (See also the definition of a ``line item'' in FAR 
3.302.)


<R05>
514.270-2  Guidelines for use.

    (a) GSA usually solicits prices and reserves the right to make award 
for individual line items. In some cases it serves GSA's best interest 
to combine two or more line items for an aggregate award. Such cases 
include when:
    (1) Users desire uniformity of design, style, and finish (e.g., 
suites of household furniture).
    (2) The articles will be assembled and used as a unit, and different 
manufacturers' components may not be interchangeable.
    (3) Users have high demand for certain articles, but demand for 
related articles is insufficient to attract competitive bids (e.g., 
various sized of socket wrenches). Awarding the low-demand articles in 
conjunction with the high-demand articles may encourage competition.
    (4) One location (delivery point) has a large requirement, and 
another location has a requirement too small to individually attract 
competitive bids.

[[Page 179]]

    (5) Awarding and administering numerous small contracts for similar 
articles or services is impractical.
    (b) Before deciding to combine items for aggregate award, consider 
the following factors:
    (1) The capability of bidders to furnish the types and quantities of 
supplies or services in the aggregate.
    (2) How grouping delivery points will affect bidders.
    (3) Which combinations will accurately project the lowest overall 
cost to the Government.
    (c) Do not use an aggregate award if it will significantly restrict 
the number of eligible bidders.


<R05>
514.270-3  Evaluation factors for award.

    Clearly state in the solicitation the basis for evaluating bids for 
aggregate award. Require bidders to submit a price on each item within 
the group or a percentage to be added or subtracted from a list price. 
Advise bidders that failure to submit prices as required within a group 
makes a bid ineligible for award for that group.


<R05>
514.270-4  Grouping line items for aggregate award.

    (a) Type of contract. While this section addresses supply contracts 
(articles and delivery points), the same principles apply to service 
contracts (types of services and service areas).
    (b) Effect on compeition. Provide for full and open competition when 
you group items for award. Grouping items for award may preclude a 
significant of firms from bidding. This occurs if firms are unable to 
provide all the types or quanities of supplies or services, or make 
deliveries to the various delivery points included in the prospective 
aggregate group.
    (c) Grouping different articles. Include only related articles in an 
aggregate group. Related articles are those normally manufactured or 
produced by a majority of prospective bidders. Grouping unrelated 
articles often restricts competition unnecessarily.
    (d) Grouping geographic locations or delivery points. Consider the 
following guidelines before deciding to group different geographic 
locations or delivery points:
    (1) A delivery point may have sufficient requirements so that 
individual shipments involve economic production runs and carload or 
truckload quanities. In this case, list it as a separate line item.
    (2) The types of bidders (i.e., small or large firms, manufacturers 
or distributors, etc.) who respond to previous solicitations can provide 
important information. For example, if previous bidders are distributors 
with franchises in certain territories, grouping different territories 
could tend to restrict competition.
    (3) Transportation costs can affect competition and pricing. They 
may constitute a significant portion of the total delivered cost. Obtain 
the advice and assistance of transportation specialists before grouping 
geographic locations or delivery points. Depending upon the supplies 
being acquired:
    (i) Grouping widespread geographic locations or delivery points may 
reduce competition or result in higher prices. It can cause you to lose 
``area pricing'' advantages provided by a supplier with a single 
production point.
    (ii) Conversely, for many small commercial items (hand tools, locks, 
etc.), manufacturers may quote the same price for delivery anywhere in 
the U.S..
    (iii) Tariff boundaries can also affect how manufacturers price 
deliveries to different areas.


<R05>
514.270-5  Evaluation methodologies for aggregate awards.

    (a) Definite quantity contracts without options. For definite 
quantity contracts without options, the evaluated bid price is the total 
bid price, as adjusted for any price-related factors identified in the 
solicitation. This reflects the actual cost to the Government and will 
identify the most advantageous bid.
    (b) Indefinite quantity contracts, requirements contracts, and 
options. Indefinite quantity and requirements contracts use estimated 
quantities. Options involve the probability of whether and when the 
options will be exercised. These situations may result in unbalanced 
bids (see FAR 15.404-1(g)), leading to inaccurate evaluation of the 
projected cost and award to other than the most advantageous bid. To 
avoid

[[Page 180]]

unbalanced bids, GSA has two preferred methods for evaluating bids for 
aggregate awards: weight factors and price list.
    (1) Weight factors method. Assign a weight to each item in a group. 
The weight is based on the portion of quantities that item represents. 
To evaluate bids, multiply each unit price by its weight factor, then 
total the results.
    (2) Price list method. Establish prices for bidders to use as a base 
for preparing their bids. Prepare a list that identifies a base price 
for each item in a group. Bidders bid a percentage factor to add to or 
subtract from the base price.


<R05>
514.270-6  Guidelines for using the weight factors method.

    (a) Use the weight factors method when you have reliable estimates 
for the quantities needed in an acquisition. Reliable estimates of 
quantities form the foundation for:
    (1) Accurate evaluation of the projected cost of each bid.
    (2) An appropriate determination of which bid is most advantageous 
to the Government for the aggregate group.
    (b) Assign a weight factor to each item in a group. Develop the 
weight factor by calculating the portion of the total quantity in a 
defined group that each item represents.
    (c) To evaluate bid prices, first multiply the price bid for each 
item (unit price X quantity) by its weight factor. Then, add the 
subtotals together to project the cost for the aggregate group.
    (d) You may reduce estimated quantities to smaller numbers by a 
common denominator. This may help facilitate the computations involved 
in evaluating bids.
    (e) Consider all price-related factors you identified in the 
solicitation. Award to the responsive and responsible bidder with the 
lowest evaluated overall cost to the Government for the aggregate group. 
This represents the most advantageous bid.


<R05>
514.270-7  Guidelines for using the price list method.

    (a) General. The price list method helps avoid unbalanced bidding 
when you need to make aggregate awards, but lack accurate estimates of 
anticipated quantities. This method establishes base prices for bidders 
to use in preparing their bids.
    (b) Solicitation requirements. When you use the price list methods, 
in the solicitation:
    (1) Include the price list.
    (2) Include an estimate of requirements.
    (3) Require the bidder to express its price as ``net'' or as a 
percentage added to or subtracted from the list prices for each group. 
Require the bidder to quote only one percentage factor for each group. 
This means that the bidder provides one percentage factor that applies 
to every item in a group; not a separate percentage for each item. 
``Net'' indicates the bidder chooses to submit the list prices as its 
bid.
    (4) Identify the percentage factor in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section as a price related evaluation factor.
    (c) Developing list prices. You may develop price lists using one or 
more of the following sources:
    (1) Industry published prices.
    (2) Industry surveys.
    (3) Government cost estimates based on knowledge of the supplies or 
services and previous contract prices.
    (d) First time use for an item or service. The first time you use 
list prices for an item or service, give prospective bidders an 
opportunity to review the proposed list. Also provide information on how 
GSA will use the list prices. You may provide this information in a 
draft solicitation.
    (e) Balanced prices. Ensure that the list prices for the grouped 
items bear a reasonable and balanced relationship to one another. You 
may use prices from previous awards made using the weight factors method 
to develop price lists. Review those prices first to ensure they did not 
result from unbalanced bidding.
    (f) Evaluation and award. Consider all price-related factors 
identified in the solicitation. Award to the responsive and responsible 
bidder whose percentage factor produces the most favorable price to the 
Government. This represents the most advantageous bid.
    (g) Example. The following illustrates a bidding schedule 
arrangement for a

[[Page 181]]

group of items for aggregate award under the price list method:

 Drills, Twist, High Speed, Under Federal Specification (No. and Date), and Amendment (No. and Date), Amendment
                      (No. and Date) Wire Gauge Sizes, Straight Shank, Short Length, Type C
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Item No.        National Stock No.       Drill size       Est. quantity         Unit           List price
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                           Group 1 (Items 1 through 5)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.................      5133-00-189-9249  4.................           1,600  Pkg...............           10.80
5.................      5133-00-189-9250  5.................           2,000  Pkg...............           10.80
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The bid on each item above is the list price shown minus/plus ---- 
percent. (Bidder, insert ``net'' or a single percentage amount in the 
blank space and cross out minus or plus, as appropriate.)
    (h) Special considerations for contracts for store stock items. Show 
estimated quantities only if estimates of demand for each item within a 
group can be derived from Government records or verified contractor 
sales reports. Use only current estimates. If you cannot estimate the 
Government's needs, the solicitation may include past orders. (See CG 
Decision, B-209037, 82-2 CPD para 323 (1982).)
    (i) Special considerations for repair and alteration contracts. In 
the solicitation:
    (1) List the estimated quantities for work to be performed during 
both normal working hours and outside of normal working hours.
    (2) State the percent of work anticipated to be performed during 
normal working hours.
    (3) List the unit prices for work to be performed during both normal 
working hours and outside of normal working hours.
    (4) Define ``normal'' in terms of hours and days of the week.
    (5) Advise bidders of the previous year's total expenditures or 
portions of that total attributable to the listed items.
    (6) If you provide quantity estimates, state that the estimates are 
for information only and do not constitute guarantees or commitments to 
order items under the contract.
    (7) Solicit two percentage factors for the line item unit prices 
listed: one for the unit prices for work performed during normal working 
hours and the second for the unit prices for work performed outside of 
normal working hours.
    (8) You may require multiple percentages when the solicitation 
further groups unit prices by trade or business category.
    (9) For the evaluated bid price, add together the following 
percentages:
    (i) The percentage of work performed during normal work hours 
multiplied by the total estimate adjusted by the bidder's percentage 
factor for that portion of the work, plus
    (ii) The percentage of work performed during other than normal 
working hours multiplied by the total estimate adjusted by the bidder's 
percentage factor for that portion of the work.
    (10) Consider other price-related factors identified in the 
solicitation. Make award to the responsible and responsive bidder 
submitting the lowest overall evaluated bid price for the aggregate 
group. This represents the most advantageous bid.

    For proposals submitted in response to GAS solicitation no. --------
, I agree to the following:
    (a) To the best of my knowledge and belief, no conflict of interest 
exists that may either:
    (1) Diminish my capacity to impartially review the proposals 
submitted.
    (2) Or result in a biased opinion or unfair advantage.
    (b) In making the above statement, I have considered all the 
following factors that might place me in a position of conflict, real or 
apparent, with the evaluation proceedings:
    (1) All my stocks, bonds, other outstanding financial interests or 
commitments.
    (2) All my employment arrangements (past, present, and under

that may create an actual or apparent conflict of interest. If I learn 
of any such conflict, I will report it immediately to the Contracting 
Officer. I will perform no more duties related to evaluating proposals 
until I receive instructions on the matter.
    (e) I will use proposal information for evaluation purposes only. I 
understand that any authorized restriction on disclosure placed on the 
proposal by the prospective contractor, prospective subcontractor, or 
the Government applies to any reproduction or abstracted information of 
the proposal.
    (f) I will use my best efforts to safeguard proposal information 
physically. I will not disclose the contents of, nor release any 
information about, the proposals to anyone other than:
    (1) The Source Selection Evaluation Board or other panel assembled 
to evaluate proposals submitted in response to the solicitation 
identified above.
    (2) Other individuals designed by the contracting Officer.
    (g) After completing evaluation, I will return to the Government all 
copies of the proposals and any abstracts.
    (h) GSA Appropriations Act restriction: These restrictions are 
consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with or otherwise alter 
the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by Executive 
Order No. 12958; section 7211 of title 5, United States Code (governing 
disclosure of Congress); section 1034 of title 10, United States Code,

515.408  Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

      MAS Requests for Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data

    (a) You should use Alternative IV of the FAR provision at 52.215-20, 
Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other than Cost or 
Pricing Data, for MAS contracts to provide the format for submission of 
information other than cost or pricing data for MAS contracts. To 
provide uniformity in request under the MAS program, you should insert 
the following in paragraph (b) of the provision:
    (1) An offer prepared and submitted in accordance with the clause at 
552.212-70, Preparation of Offer (Multuiple Award Schedule).
    (2) Commercial sales practices. The Offeror shall submit information 
in the format provided in this solicitation in accordance with the 
instructions at Figure 515.4 of the GSA Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR 
515-2), or submit information in the Offeror's own format.
    (3) Any additional supporting information requested by the 
Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may require additional 
supporting information, but only to the extent necessary to determine 
whether the price(s) offered is fair and reasonable.
    (4) By submission of an offer in response to this solicitation, the 
Offeror grants the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative 
the right to examine, at any time before initial award, books, records, 
documents, papers, and other directly pertinent records to verify the 
pricing, sales and other data related to the supplies or services 
proposed in order to determine the reasonableness of price(s). Access 
does not extend to Offeror's cost or profit information of other data 
relevant solely to the Offeror's determination of the prices to be 
offered in the catalog or marketplace.
    (b) Insert the following format for commercial sales practices in 
the exhibits or attachments section of the solicitation and resulting 
contract (see FAR 12.303).

                    Commercial Sales Practices Format

Name of Offeror ---------- SIN(s) ------

    Note: Please refer to Clause 552.212-70, Preparation of Offer 
(Multiple Award Schedule), for additional information concerning your 
offer. Provide the following information for each SIN (or group of SINs 
or SubSIN for which information is the same).

    (1) Provide the dollar value of sales to the general public at or 
based on an established catalog or market price during the previous 12-
month period or the offerors last fiscal year: $--------. State 
beginning and ending of the 12 month period. Beginning -------- ending 
--------. In the event that a dollar value is not an appropriate measure 
of the sales, provide and describe your own measure of the sales of the 
item(s).
    (2) Show your total projected annual sales to the Government under 
this contract for the contract term, excluding options, for each SIN 
offered. If you currently hold a Federal Supply Schedule contract for 
the SIN the total projected annual sales should be based on your 
mostrecent 12 months of sales under that contract.

SIN ------------ $------------
SIN ------------ $------------
SIN ------------ $------------

    (3) Based on your written discounting policies (standard commercial 
sales practices in the event you do not have written discounting 
policies), are the discounts and any concessions which you offer the 
Government equal to or better than your best price (discount and 
concessions in any combination) offered to any customer acquiring the 
same items regardless of quantity or terms and conditions? YES---- NO--
-- (See definition of ``concession'' and ``discount'' in 552.212-70.)
    (4)(a) Based on your written discounting policies (standard 
commercial sales practices in the event you do not have written 
discounting policies), provide information as requested for each SIN (or 
group of SINs for which the information is the same) in accordance with 
the instructions at Figure 515.4, which is provided in this solicitation 
for your convenience. The information should be provided in the chart 
below or in an equivalent format developed by the offeror. Rows should 
be added to accommodate as many customers as required.

    (b) Do any deviations from your written policies or standard 
commercial sales practices disclosed in the above chart ever result in 
better discounts (lower prices) or concessions than indicated? YES-- 
NO--. If YES,

[[Page 186]]

explain deviations in accordance with the instructions at Figure 515.4, 
which is provided in this solicitation for your convenience.
    (5) If you are a dealer/reseller without significant sales to the 
general public, you should provide manufacturers' information required 
by paragraphs (1) through (4) above for each item/SINoffered, if the 
manufacturer's sales under any resulting contract are expected to exceed 
$500,000. You must also obtain written authorization from the 
manufacturer(s) for Government access, at any time before award or 
before agreeing to a modification, to the manufacturer's sales records 
for the purpose of verifying the information submitted by the 
manufacturer. The information is required in order to enable the 
Government to make a determination that the offered price is fair and 
reasonable. To expedite the review and processing of offers, you should 
advise the manufacturer(s) of this requirement. The contracting officer 
may require the information be submitted on electronic media with 
commercially available spreadsheet(s). The information may be provided 
by the manufacturer directly to the Government. If the manufacturer's 
item(s) is being offered by multiple dealers/resellers, only one copy of 
the requested information should be submitted to the Government. In 
addition, you must submit the following information along with a listing 
of contact information regarding each of the manufacturers whose 
products and/or services are included in the offer (include the 
manufacturer's name, address, the manufacturer's contact point, 
telephone number, and FAX number) for each model offered by SIN:
    (a) Manufacturer's Name.
    (b) Manufacturer's Part Number.
    (c) Dealer's/Reseller's Part Number.
    (d) Product Description.
    (e) Manufacturer's List Price.
    (f) Dealer's/Reseller's percentage discount from list price or net 
prices.

                             (End of Format)

    (c) Include the instructions for completing the commercial sales 
practices format in Figure 515.4 in solicitations issued under the MAS 
program.

    Figure 515.4--Instructions for Commercial Sales Practices Format

    If you responded ``yes'' to question (3), on the Commercial Sales 
Practices Format in paragraph (b) of this section, complete the chart in 
question (4)(a) for the customer(s) who receive your best discount. If 
you responded ``no'', complete the chart in question (4)(a) showing your 
written policies or standard sales practices for all customers or 
customer categories to whom you sell at a price (discounts and 
concessions in combination) that is equal to or better than the price(s) 
offered to the Government under this solicitation or with which the 
Offeror has a current agreement to sell at a discount which equals or 
exceeds the discount(s) offered under this solicitation. Such agreement 
shall be in effect on the date the offer is submitted or contain an 
effective date during the proposed multiple award schedule contract 
period. If your offer is lower than your price to other customers or 
customers categories, you will be aligned with the customer or category 
of customer that receives your best price for purposes of the Price 
Reductions clause at 552.238-75. The Government expects you to provide 
information required by the format in accordance with these instructions 
that is, to the best of your knowledge and belief, current, accurate, 
and complete as of 14 calender days prior to its submission. You must 
also disclose any changes in your price list(s), discounts and/or 
discounting policies which occur after the offer is submitted, but 
before the close of negotiations. If your discount practices vary by 
model or product line, the discount information should be by model or 
product line as appropriate. You may limit the number of models or 
product lines reported to those which exceed 75% of actual historical 
Government sales (commercial sales may be substituted if Government 
sales are unavailable) value of the special item number (SIN).

   Column 1--Identify the Applicable Customer or Category of Customer

    A ``customer'' is any entity, except the Federal Government, which 
acquires supplies or services from the Offeror. The term customer 
includes, but is not limited to original equipment manufacturers, value 
added resellers, state and local Governments, distributors, educational 
institutions (an elementary, junior high, or degree granting school 
which maintains a regular faculty and established curriculum and an 
organized body of students), dealers, national accounts, and end users. 
In any instance where the Offeror is asked to disclose information for a 
customer, the Offeror may disclose information by category of customer 
if the Offeror's discount policies or practices are the same for all 
customers in the category. (Use a separate line for each customer or 
category of customer.)

                     Column 2--Identify the Discount

    The term ``discount'' is as defined in solicitation clause 552.212-
70, Preparation of Offer (Multiple Award Schedule). Indicate the best 
discount (based on your written discounting policies or standard 
commercial discounting practices if you do not have written discounting 
policies) at which you sell to the customer or category of customer 
identified in column 1, without regard to quantity; terms and conditions 
of the agreements under which the discounts are given; and

[[Page 187]]

whether the agreements are written or oral. Net prices or discounts off 
of other price lists should be expressed as percentage discounts from 
the price list which is the basis of your offer. If the discount 
disclosed is a combination of various discounts (prompt payment, 
quantity, etc.), the percentage should be broken out for each type of 
discount. If the price lists which are the basis of the discounts given 
to the customers identified in the chart are different than the price 
list submitted upon which your offer is based, identify the type or 
title and date of each price list. The contracting officer may require 
submission of these price lists. To expedite evaluation, offerors may 
provide these price lists at the time of submission.

           Column 3--Identify the Quantity or Volume of Sales

    Insert the minimum quantity or sales volume which the identified 
customer or category of customer must either purchase/order, per order 
or within a specified period, to earn a discount indicate the time 
period.

  Column 4--Indicate the FOB Delivery Term for Each Identified Customer

    See FAR 47.3 for an explanation of FOB delivery terms.

  Column 5--Indicate Concessions Regardless of Quantity Granted to the 
               Identified Customer or Category of Customer

    Concessions are defined in solicitation clause 552.12-70, 
Preparation of Offers (Multiple Award Schedule). If the space provided 
is inadequate, the disclosure should be made on a separate sheet by 
reference.
    If you respond ``yes'' to question 4(b) in the Commercial Sales 
Practices Format, provide an explanation of the circumstances under 
which you deviate from your written policies or standard commercial 
sales practices disclosed in the chart on the Commercial Sales Practices 
Format and explain how often they occur. Your explanation should include 
a discussion of situations that lead to deviations from standard 
practice, an explanation of how often they occur, and the controls you 
employ to assure the integrity of your pricing. Examples of typical 
deviations may include, but are not limited to, one time goodwill 
discounts to charity organizations or to compensate an otherwise 
disgruntled customer; a limited sale of obsolete or damaged goods; the 
sale of sample goods to a new customer, or the sales of prototype goods 
for testing purposes.
    If deviations from your written policies or standard commercial 
sales practices disclosed in the chart on the Commercial Sales Practices 
Format are so significant and/or frequent that the Contracting Officer 
cannot establish whether the price(s) offered is fair and reasonable, 
then you may be asked to provide additional information. The Contracting 
Officer may ask for information to demonstrate that you have made 
substantial sales of the item(s) in the commercial market consistent 
with the information reflected on the chart on the Commercial Sales 
Practices Format, a description of the conditions surrounding those 
sales deviations, or other information that may be necessary in order 
for the Contracting Officer to determine whether your offered price(s) 
is fair and reasonable. In cases where additional information is 
requested the Contracting Officer will target the request in order to 
limit the submission of data to that needed to establish the 
reasonableness of the offered price.

                             (End of figure)

    (d) Insert the clause at 552.215-72, Price Adjustment--Failure to 
Provide Accurate Information, in solicitations and contracts under the 
MAS program.
    (e) You should use Alternate IV of FAR 52.215-21, Requirements for 
Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data--
Modifications, to provide for submission of information other than cost 
or pricing data for MAS contracts. To provide for uniformity in requests 
under the MAS program, you should insert the following in paragraph (b) 
of the clause:
    (1) Information required by the clause at 552.243-72, Modifications 
(Multiple Award Schedule).
    (2) Any additional supporting information requested by the 
Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may require additional 
supporting information, but only to the extent necessary to determine 
whether the price(s) offered is fair and reasonable.
    (3) By submitting a request for modification, the Contractor grants 
the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative the right to 
examine, at any time before agreeing to a modification, books, record, 
documents, papers, and other directly pertinent records to verify the 
pricing, sales and other data related to the supplies or services 
proposed in order to determine the reasonableness of price(s). Access 
does not extent to Contractor's cost or profit information or other data 
related solely to the Contractor's determination of the prices to be 
offered in the catalog or marketplace.

    (a) Unsolicited samples. The reference to FAR 14.404-2(d) in FAR 
14.202-4(g) does not apply.

    However, qualifications in the proposal that are at variance with 
the Government's requirements, constitute deficiencies. Resolve these as 
provided in FAR 15.306.

    (b) Solicitation requirements.
    (1) Use the clause at FR 52.214-20. The second sentence in paragraph 
(c) of the clause does not apply. Substitute a sentence substantially as 
follows:

    Failure of the bid samples to conform to all the required 
characteristics listed in the solicitation constitutes a deficiency in 
the proposal (see FAR 15.306).

    (2) In addition to listing subjective characteristics that you 
cannot adequately describe in the specification, you may list and 
evaluate objective characteristics. To include objective 
characteristics, you must determine that examination of such 
characteristics is essential to the acquisition of any acceptable 
product. Base your determination on past experience or other valid 
considerations.
    (c) FAR 52.215-1(c)(3) applies to samples received after the time 
set for receipt of offers.

<R05>
516.203-4  Contract clauses.

    (a) Multiple award schedules. Do not use FAR 52.216-2, 52.216-3, or 
52.216-4 in negotiated acquisitions based on discounts from established 
commercial catalogs or pricelists. Instead, use:
    (1) 552.216-70, Economic Price Adjustment--FSS Multiple Award 
Schedule Contracts, in a 1-year solicitation or contract.
    (2) 552.216-70 (Alternate I) in multiyear solicitations and 
contracts.
    (b) Stock or Special Order Program Contracts. In multiyear 
solicitations and contracts, after making the determination required by 
FAR 16.203-2, use 552.216-71, Economic Price Adjustment-Stock and 
Special Order Program Contract, or a clause prepared as authorized in 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this subsection.
    (1) If the contract includes one or more options to extend the term 
of the contract, use the clause with its Alternate I or a clause 
substantially the same as 552.216-71 with its Alternate I suitably 
modified.
    (2) In a contract requiring a minimum adjustment before the price 
adjustment mechanism is effectuated, use the basic clause with Alternate 
II or with Alternate I and Alternative II.
    (3) If the Producer Price Index is not an appropriate indicator for 
price adjustment, modify the clause to use an alternate indicator for 
adjusting prices. Similarly, if other aspects of 552.216-71 are not 
appropriate, use an alternate clause following established procedures.
    (c) Adjustments based on cost indexes of labor or material. (1) If 
you decide to

[[Page 189]]

provide for adjustments based on cost indexes of labor or material, 
prepare a clause that defines each of the following elements:
    (i) The type of labor and/or material subject to adjustment.
    (ii) The labor rates, including any fringe benefits and/or unit 
prices of materials that may be increased or decreased.
    (iii) The index(es) that will be used to measure changes in price 
levels and the base period or reference point from which changes will be 
measured.
    (iv) The period during which the price(s) will be subject to 
adjustment.

program items, when the contract authorizes FSS and other activities to 
issue delivery or task orders, insert the clause at 552.216-72, 
Placement of Orders. If only FSS will issue delivery or task orders, 
insert the clause with its Alternate I.
    (b) In solicitations and contracts for single or multiple award 
schedule program items, insert the clause at 552.216-72, Placement of 
Orders, with its Alternate II.
    (c) In solicitations and contracts for FSS Schedule 70 and the 
Corporate Schedule containing information technology Special Item 
Numbers, use 552.216-72, Placement of Orders, Alternate III, instead of 
Alternate II.
    (d) If the clause at 552.216-72 is prescribed, insert the provision 
at 552.216-73, Ordering Information, in solicitations for stock items 
and in other FSS solicitations. Use 552.216-73 Alternate I when 552.216-
72 Alternate I is prescribed. Use 552.216-73 Alternate II when 552.216-
72 Alternate II or Alternate III are prescribed.

design effort.
    (b) Contents of each letter contract. You must include the following 
information in the letter contract:
    (1) The scope. If you include the design effort, only authorize the 
A-E to perform those services that are independent of the design effort 
(for example, feasibility studies, existing facility surveys or site 
investigation, etc.). Do not authorize the A-E to begin the design 
effort before the letter contract is definitized.
    (2) A definitization schedule. Include dates for each of the 
following:
    (i) Submission of the design fee proposal.
    (ii) Start of negotiations.
    (iii) Definitization. This date must be no later than 90 days after

52.216-24, Limitation of Government Liability.
    (c) Unilateral price decision. If you must issue a unilateral price 
decision, the maximum contract amount must not exceed a reasonable price 
for the excludable items plus the 6 percent statutory fee limitation for

<R05>
525.302-70  Procurements for agencies under the Foreign Assistance Act.

    GSA procurements made directly for other agencies of items to be 
used outside the United States are made the Balance of Payments Program. 
The only exception is if GSA contracts as the agent for an agency 
governed by the Foreign Assistance Act (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.). If this 
exception applies, the contract will be governed by the policies and 
procedures of the agency instead of FAR 25.3 and 525.3. For example, GSA 
sometimes acts as agent for the Agency for International Development and

<R04>
      Subpart 525.5--Evaluating Foreign Officers--Supply Contracts


<R05>
525.570  Procurement of hand or measuring tools or stainless steel flatware 
for DOD.

    (a) Stainless steel flatware means special order and stock items of 
stainless steel flatware purchased for DOD, including, but not limited 
to, the following National Stock Numbers (NSN):

7340-00-060-6057
7340-00-205-3340
7340-00-241-8171
7340-00-559-8357

7340-00-688-1055
7340-00-721-6316
7340-00-721-6971

    (b) Purchases of hand or measuring tools or stainless steel flatware 
exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold by DOD must be domestic 
end products. In the case of stainless steel flatware, the Secretary of 
the Department concerned can make an exception. The individual must 
determine that a satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity produced 
in the United States or its possessions are not available when needed at 
domestic market prices.
    (c) If GSA solicitations of hand or measuring tools or stainless 
steel flatware include DOD requirements, GSA will apply the DOD 
restrictions. The bases for applying the DOD restriction to GSA 
acquisitions are:
    (1) DOD's restrictions apply to requisitions of such items from the 
GSA stock program.
    (2) The impracticality of establishing a dual supply system to 
satisfy the requirements of civilian and military agencies.
    (3) GSA may reject any offer when it is considered necessary for 
reasons of national interest.

interests in real property.
    (i) You may modify the date for constructive acceptance in 
subparagraph (b)(2) of the clause to specify a period longer than 7 
calendar days (but not to exceed 30 days) if necessary because of the 
nature of the services to be received, inspected or accepted by the

<R04>
                         Subpart 536.1--General


<R05>
536.101  Applicability.

    If a requirement in this part is inconsistent with a requirement in 
another GSAR part, this part takes precedence.


<R04>
     Subpart 536.2--Special Aspects of Contracting for Construction


<R05>
536.213  Special procedures for sealed bidding in construction contracting.


<R05>
536.213-3  Invitations for bids.


<R05>
536.213-370  Bids that include alternates.

    (a) The base bid must include all features essential to a sound and 
adequate building design. If it appears that funds available for a 
project may be insufficient to include all desired features in the base 
bid, you may issue a solicitation for a base bid and include one or more 
alternates in the order of priority. Use alternates only if they are 
clearly justified and involve substantial amounts of work in relation to 
the base bid. Their use must be limited and should involve only ``add'' 
alternates.
    (b) Before opening bids that include alternates, determine, and 
record in the contract file, the amount of funds available for the 
project. The amount recorded must be announced at the beginning of the 
bid opening. The amount is the controlling factor in determining the low 
bidder. This amount may be increased later when determining the 
alternate items to award to the low bidder if the following condition is 
met: the award amount of the base bid plus the combination of alternate 
items does not exceed the amount offered for the base bid and the same 
combination of alternate items by any other responsible bidder whose bid 
conforms to the solicitation. This requirement prevents the displacement 
of the low bidder by manipulating the alternates to be used.


<R05>
536.213-371  Bids that include options.

    (a) Subject to the limitations in paragraph (c) of this section, you 
may include options in contracts if it is in the Government's interest.
    (b) the appropriate use of options may include, but is not limited 
to, any of the following:
    (1) If additional work is anticipated but funds are not expected to 
be available at the time of award, and it would

[[Page 203]]

not be practicable to award a separate contract or to permit an 
additional contractor to work on the same site.
    (2) If fixed building equipment, e.g. elevators or escalators, will 
be installed under the construction contract and it is advantageous to 
have the installer of the equipment maintain and service the equipment 
during the warranty period.
    (c) You must not use options under any of the following conditions:
    (1) the prospective option represents known firm requirements for 
which funds are available unless competition for the option quantity is 
impracticable once the initial contract is awarded.
    (2) The contractor will incur undue risks; e.g., the price or 
availability of necessary materials or labor is not reasonably 
foreseeable.
    (d) Solicitations containing option provisions must state the period 
within which the options may be exercised.
    (e) Solicitations must state whether the basis of award is inclusive 
or exclusive of the options. Before issuing a solicitation that includes 
evaluated options, you must determine that there is reasonable certainty 
that funds will be made available to permit exercise of the option.


<R05>
536.213-372  Bids that include both alternates and options.

    (a) Solicitations may include both alternates and options if the 
conditions in 536.213-370, Bids that include alternates, and 536.213-
371, Bids that include options, are satisfied. In these solicitations, 
the low bidder for purposes of award is the responsible bidder offering 
the lowest aggregate price for the base bid and the alternates, in the 
order of priority listed in the solicitation, that provide the most work 
features within the funds available at bid opening, plus all options 
designated to be evaluated.
    (b) The basis of award may require the evaluation of options 
associated with alternates if the related alternate is selected.
    (c) Before opening bids that include both alternates and options, 
determine, and record in the contract file, the amount of funds 
available for the project (i.e., for the base bid and alternate work). 
The amount recorded must be announced at the beginning of the bid 
opening. This amount may be increased later when determining the 
alternate items to be awarded to the low bidder if the following 
condition is met: the award amount of the base bid and evaluated options 
plus the alternate items does not exceed the amount offered for the base 
bid, the evaluated options, and the same combination of alternate items 
by any other responsible bidder whose bid conforms to the solicitation.


<R05>
536.270  Exercise of options.

    (a) If exercising an option, notify the contractor, in writing, 
within the time period specified in the contract.
    (b) Exercise options only after determining that all the following 
conditions exist:
    (1) Funds are available.
    (2) The requirement covered by the option fulfills an existing 
Government need.
    (3) Exercising the option is the most advantageous method of 
satisfying the Government's need, price and other factors considered.
    (c) Before exercising an option, you must determine that the action 
complies with the option's terms and this section's requirements. 
Include your written determination in the contract file.
    (d) The contract modification, or other written document which 
notifies the contractor of the exercise of the option, must cite the 
option clause as authority. If exercising an unpriced or unevaluated 
option, cite the statutory authority permitting the use of other than 
full and open competition (see FAR 6.302 and 517.207).


<R05>
536.271  Project labor agreements.

    (a) Authority. This subpart implements the Presidential memorandum 
of June 5, 1997, on using project labor agreements (PLAs) on Federal 
construction projects. The Presidential memorandum authorizes executive 
departments and agencies to require PLAs on large and significant 
construction projects for facilities to be owned by a Federal department 
or agency.
    (b) Applicability. These policies and procedures apply to all GSA 
activities

[[Page 204]]

authorized to award contracts for construction of facilities to be owned 
by a Federal department or agency. You may use a PLA in leasehold 
arrangement, Federally funded projects, and other appropriate 
circumstances.
    (c) Definitions. Construction means construction, alteration, or 
repair (including dredging, excavating, and painting) of buildings, 
structures, or other real property. The terms buildings, structures, or 
other real property are defined further in Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) 36.102.
    Labor organization means a labor organization engaged in an industry 
affecting commerce, and any agent of such an organization, and includes 
any organization of any kind, and any agency, or employee representation 
committee, group, association, or plan so engaged in which employees 
participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of 
dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, 
rates of pay, hours, or other terms or conditions of employment, and any 
conference, general committee, joint or system board, or joint council 
so engaged which is subordinate to a national or international labor 
organization (42 U.S.C. 2000e(d)).
    Large and significant project means a Federal construction project 
with a total cost to the Federal Government of more than $5 million.
    Project Labor Agreement (PLA) means an agreement between the 
contractor, subcontractors, and the union(s) representing workers. Under 
a PLA, the contractor and subcontractors on a project and the union(s) 
agree on terms and conditions of employment for the project, 
establishing a framework for labor-management cooperation to advance the 
Government's procurement interest in cost, efficiency, and quality.
    (d) Policy. (1) You may, on a project-by-project basis, use a PLA on 
a large and significant project when both of the following conditions 
apply:
    (i) A PLA will advance the Government's procurement interests.
    (ii) No laws that apply to the specific construction project 
preclude the use of the PLA.
    (2) Do not require any contractor to enter into a PLA with any 
particular labor organization.
    (3) The use of a PLA is not intended to create any right or benefit, 
substantive or procedural enforceable by a nonfederal party against the 
United States, its departments, and agencies, its officers or employees, 
or any other person.
    (e) Procedures. (1) As part of procurement planning for construction 
projects with a total estimated cost to the Federal Government of more 
than $5 million, you may consider requiring a PLA.
    (2) To require a PLA, you must determine whether use of a PLA will 
advance the Government's procurement interests in all the following 
areas:
    (i) Cost, efficiency, and quality.
    (ii) Promoting labor-management stability.
    (iii) Promoting compliance with applicable legal requirements 
governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and 
employment standards, and other matters.
    (3) In making the determination required by paragraph (b) of this 
section, consult with the agency project or program manager and obtain 
guidance from the Agency Labor Advisor and assigned legal counsel. You 
should consider the following factors:
    (i) Whether past experience with construction projects in the 
location where the project will be performed indicates that a PLA will 
be effective.
    (ii) Whether delays in performance of the construction contract 
would have significant adverse impact on the mission of the agency or 
operation of the installation or facility.
    (iii) Whether any law applies to the specific construction project 
that would impede use of a PLA.
    (iv) Whether the labor organizations in the area can provide a 
reliable source of skilled, experienced building trades workers in all 
crafts needed on the job site for the project's duration (taking into 
consideration other major construction work in the area).
    (v) Whether the Government can benefit from uniform work rules and 
working conditions and established procedures for resolving labor 
disputes, no strike/no lock-out protections.
    (vi) Whether the Government can benefit from increased stability and

[[Page 205]]

labor peace that derives from greater labor-management cooperation.
    (vii) Whether the requirements for a PLA will unreasonably restrict 
competition.
    (viii) Other relevant information.
    (4) Document the rationale supporting your decision to require a PLA 
in the contract file.
    (5) Provide the following information to the Agency Labor Advisor 
(GSA Acquisition Policy Division (MVP)):
    (i) A brief description of the project.
    (ii) The estimated cost.
    (iii) A copy of the document supporting your decision to require a 
PLA.
    (iv) A copy of the solicitation.

536.602-1  Selection criteria.

    (a) FAR 36.602-1 requires that agencies include ``location in the 
general geographical area of the project and knowledge of locality of 
the project'' as one of several selection criteria.
    (1) Do not use this evaluation factor as a minimum qualification 
requirement for determining whether a firm is eligible to compete for a 
proposed project.
    (2) This factor must not exceed 5 percent of the total weight of all 
evaluation criteria. In order to receive maximum score for this factor, 
the architect-engineer firm(s) must demonstrate that at least 35 percent 
of the architect-engineer contract services (based on the total contract 
price) will be accomplished within the geographical boundaries 
established for the project.
    (3) Under an approved class deviation from FAR 36.602-1(a)(5), this 
factor does not apply to projects that the Chief Architect of GSA 
determines have national significance.
    (b) The public announcement (Commerce Business Daily notice) for a 
proposed project should identify the general geographical area of the 
project by either:
    (1) A radius in miles or other appropriate unit of measure.

Program must apply the geographical evaluation criteria in the second 
phase.
    (d) The public announcement (Commerce Business Daily notice) must 
provide the number of calendar days the architect-engineer of record has 
to establish a production capability within the general geographical 
area of the project. You may allow the architect-engineer of record up 
to 45 calendar days after contract award to establish this production 
capability.

<R04>
 Subpart 538.2--Establishing and Administering Federal Supply Schedules


<R05>
538.270  Evaluation of multiple award schedule (MAS) offers.

    (a) The Government will seek to obtain the offeror's best price (the 
best price given to the most favored customer). However, the Government 
recognizes that the terms and conditions of commercial sales vary and 
there may be legitimate reasons why the best price is not achieved.
    (b) Establish negotiation objectives based on a review of relevant 
data and determine price reasonableness.
    (c) When establishing negotiation objectives and determining price 
reasonableness, compare the terms and conditions of the MAS solicitation 
with the terms and conditions of agreements with the offeror's 
commercial customers. When determining the Government's price 
negotiation objectives, consider the following factors:
    (1) Aggregate volume of anticipated purchases.
    (2) The purchase of a minimum quantity or a pattern of historic 
purchases.
    (3) Prices taking into consideration any combination of discounts 
and concessions offered to commercial customers.
    (4) Length of the contract period.
    (5) Warranties, training, and/or maintenance included in the 
purchase price or provided at additional cost to the product prices.
    (6) Ordering and delivery practices.
    (7) Any other relevant information, including differences between 
the MAS solicitation and commercial terms and conditions that may 
warrant differentials between the offer and the discounts offered to the 
most favored commercial customer(s). For example, an offeror may incur 
more expense selling to the Government than to the customer who receives 
the offeror's best price, or the customer (e.g., dealer, distributor, 
original equipment manufacturer, other reseller) who receives the

[[Page 208]]

best price may perform certain value-added functions for the offeror 
that the Government does not perform. In such cases, some reduction in 
the discount given to the Government may be appropriate. If the best 
price is not offered to the Government, you should ask the offeror to 
identify and explain the reason for any differences. Do not require 
offerors to provide detailed cost breakdowns.
    (d) You may award a contract containing pricing which is less 
favorable than the best price the offeror extends to any commercial 
customer for similar purchases if you make a determination that both of 
the following conditions exist:
    (1) The prices offered to the Government are fair and reasonable, 
even though comparable discounts were not negotiated.
    (2) Award is otherwise in the best interest of the Government.


<R05>
538.271  MAS contract awards.

    (a) MAS awards will be for commercial items as defined in FAR 2.101. 
Negotiate contracts as a discount from established catalog prices.
    (b) Before awarding any MAS contract, determine that the offered 
prices are fair and reasonable (see FAR subpart 15.4 and 538.270). 
Document the negotiation and your determination using FAR 15.406-3 as 
guidance.
    (c) State clearly in the award document the price/discount 
relationship between the Government and the identified commercial 
customer (or category of customers) on which the award is predicated.


<R05>
538.272  MAS price reductions.

    (a) Section 552.238-75, Price Reductions, requires the contractor to 
maintain during the contract period the negotiated price/discount 
relationship (and/or term and condition relationship) between the 
eligible ordering activities and the offeror's customer or category of 
customers on which the contract award was predicated (see 538.271(c)). 
If a change occurs in the contractor's commercial pricing or discount 
arrangement applicable to the identified commercial customer (or 
category of customers) that results in a less advantageous relationship 
between the eligible ordering activities and this customer or category 
of customers, the change constitutes a ``price reduction.''
    (b) Make sure that the contractor understands the requirements of 
section 552.238-75 and agrees to report to you all price reductions as 
provided for in the clause.

Providing Accessibility for the Handicapped, if you include electronic 
office equipment items.
    (2) 552.237-71, Submission and Distribution of Authorized FSS 
Schedule Pricelists. In solicitations and contracts for FSS Schedule 70

Special Item Numbers, use Alternate I. If GSA is not prepared to accept 
electronic submissions for a particular schedule, delete:
    (i) Subparagraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(3).
    (ii) The subparagraph identifier ``(i)'' in (c)(1) and the word 
``and'' at the end of subparagraph (i).
    (3) 552.238-72, Identification of Products That Have Environmental 
Attributes.
    (4) 552.238-73, Cancellation.

<R05>
538.7000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes policies and procedures that implement 
statutory provisions authorizing non-federal organizations to use 
Schedule 70 and Corporate Schedule contracts containing information 
technology Special Item Numbers (SINs).


<R05>
538.7001  Definitions.

    Ordering activity (also called ``ordering agency'' and ``ordering 
office'') means an eligible ordering activity (see 552.238-78) 
authorized to place orders under Federal supply schedule contracts.
    Schedule 70, as used in this subpart, means Schedule 70 information 
technology contracts, and corporate schedule contracts containing 
information technology SINs. The Corporate Schedule is a compilation of 
multiple individual Federal Supply Schedules; therefore, only the SINs 
that fall under Schedule 70 of the Corporate Schedule will apply to 
Cooperative Purchasing. No other Schedules, or SINs, containing 
information technology outside of Schedule 70 SINs, and corporate 
schedule contracts containing Schedule 70 SINs, will apply.
    State and local government entities, as used in this subpart, means 
the states of the United States, counties, municipalities, cities, 
towns, townships, tribal governments, public authorities (including 
public or Indian housing agencies under the United States Housing Act of 
1937), school districts, colleges and other institutions of higher 
education, council of governments (incorporated or not), regional or 
interstate government entities, or any agency or instrumentality of the 
preceding entities (including any local educational agency or 
institution of higher education), and including legislative and judicial 
departments. The term does not include contractors of, or grantees of, 
State or local governments.
    (1) Local educational agency has the meaning given that term in 
section 8013 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 
U.S.C. 7713).
    (2) Institution of higher education has the meaning given that term 
in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1001(a)).
    (3) Tribal government means--
    (i) The governing body of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other 
organized group or community located in the continental United States 
(excluding the State of Alaska) that is recognized as eligible for the 
special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians 
because of their status as Indians; and
    (ii) Any Alaska Native regional or village corporation established 
pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et 
seq.).


<R05>
538.7002  General.

    (a) 40 U.S.C. 501, (the Act) authorizes the Administrator of General 
Services to procure and supply personal property and nonpersonal 
services for the use of Executive agencies. Under 40 U.S.C. 502, the 
goods and services available to executive agencies are also available to 
mixed ownership Government corporations, establishments within the 
legislative or judicial branches of Government (excepting the Senate, 
House of Representatives, Architect of the Capitol, and any activities 
under the direction of the Architect of the Capitol), the District of 
Columbia, and Qualified Non-profit Agencies.
    (b) Section 211 of the E-Government Act of 2002 amends 40 U.S.C. 502 
to authorize the Administrator of General Services to provide for use of 
certain Federal supply schedules of the GSA by a State or local 
government, which includes any State, local, regional, or tribal 
government, or any instrumentality thereof (including any local 
educational agency or institution of higher education).
    (c) State and local governments are authorized to procure only from 
the information technology Federal Supply Schedule (Schedule 70) 
contracts and Corporate Schedule contracts containing information 
technology SINs. A listing of the participating contractors and SINs for 
the products and services that are available through Schedule 70 and 
Corporate Schedule contracts containing information technology SINs, is 
available in GSA's Schedules e-Library at web site http://fss.gsa.gov/

<R05>
538.7003  Policy.

    Preparing solicitations when schedules are open to eligible non-
federal entities. When opening Schedule 70 and the Corporate Schedule 
containing information technology SINs, for use by eligible non-federal 
entities, the contracting officer must make minor modifications to 
certain Federal Acquisition Regulation and GSAM provisions and clauses 
in order to make clear distinctions between the rights and 
responsibilities of the U.S. Government in its management and regulatory 
capacity pursuant to which it awards schedule contracts and fulfills 
associated Federal requirements versus the rights and responsibilities 
of eligible ordering activities placing orders to fulfill agency needs. 
Accordingly, the contracting officer is authorized to modify the 
following FAR provisions/clauses to delete ``Government'' or similar 
language referring to the U.S. Government and substitute ``ordering 
activity'' or similar language when preparing solicitations and 
contracts to be awarded under Schedule 70 and the Corporate Schedule 
containing information technology SINs. When such changes are made, the 
word ``(DEVIATION)'' shall be added at the end of the title of the 
provision or clause. These clauses include but are not limited to:

    (b) 52.216-18, Ordering.
    (c) 52.216-19, Order Limitations.

    (l) 52.246-4, Inspection of Services-Fixed Price.
    (m) 52.246-6, Inspection-Time-and-Material and Labor-Hour.
    (n) 52.247-34, F.O.B. Destination.
    (o) 52.247-38, F.O.B. Inland Carrier Point of Exportation.


<R05>
538.7004  Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

    (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 552.238-77, 
Definition (Federal Supply Schedules), in solicitations and schedule 
contracts for Schedule 70 and the Corporate Schedule contracts 
containing information technology SINs.
    (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 552.238-78,

552.212-73  Evaluation--Commercial Items (Multiple Award Schedule).

    As prescribed in 512.301(a)(4), insert the following provision:

    Evaluation--Commercial Items (Multiple Award Schedule) (AUG 1997)

    (a) The Government may make multiple awards for the supplies or 
services offered in response to this solicitation that meet the 
definition of a ``commercial item'' in FAR 52.202-1. Awards may be made 
to those responsible offerors that offer reasonable pricing, conforming 
to the solicitation, and will be most advantageous to the Government, 
taking into consideration the multiplicity and complexity of items of 
various manufacturers and the differences in performance required to 
accomplish or produce required end results, production and distribution 
facilities, price, compliance with delivery requirements, and other 
pertinent factors. By providing a selection of comparable supplies or 
services, ordering activities are afforded the opportunity to fulfill 
their requirements with the item(s) that constitute the best value and 
that meet their needs at the lowest overall cost.
    (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or 
otherwise furnished to the offeror within the time for acceptance 
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without 
further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration 
time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether 
or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice 
of withdrawal is received before award.

                           (End of provision)

    Alternate I (AUG 1997). When anticipating competition of identical 
items, add the following paragraph after paragraph (b) of the basic 
provision.

    (c) The Government reserves the right to award only one contract for 
all or a part of a manufacturer's product line. When two or more 
offerors (e.g., dealers/resellers) offer the identical product, award 
may be made competitively to only one offeror on the basis of the lowest 
price. (Discounts for early payment will not be considered as an 
evaluation factor in determining the low offeror). During initial open 
season for an option period, any offers that are equal to or lower than 
the current contract price received for identical items will be 
considered. Current contractors will also be allowed to submit offers 
for identical items during this initial open season. The current 
contractor which has the identical item on contract will be included in 
the evaluation process. The Government will evaluate all offers and may 
award only one contract for each specified product or aggregate group.

552.214-70  ``All or None'' Offers.

    As prescribed in 514.201-6, insert the following provision:

                    ``All or None'' Offers (SEP 1999)

    (a) Unless awards in the aggregate are specifically precluded in 
this solicitation, the

[[Page 226]]

Government reserves the right to evaluate offers and make awards on all 
``all or none'' basis as provided below.
    (b) An offer submitted on an ``all or none'' or similar basis will 
be evaluated as follows: The lowest acceptable offer exclusive of the 
``all or none'' offer will be selected with respect to each item (or 
group of items when the solicitation provides for aggregate awards) and 
the total cost of all items thus determined shall be compared with the 
total of the lowest acceptable ``all or none'' offer. Award will be made 
to result in the lowest total cost to the Government.

                           (End of provision)

    Alternate I (SEP 1999). For a requirements or indefinite quantity 
contract, the following paragraph (b) shall be substituted in the basic 
provision:

    (b) An offer submitted on an ``all or none'' or similar basis will 
not be considered unless the offer is low on each item to which the 
``all or none'' offer is made applicable. The term ``each item'' as used 
in this provision refers either to an item that under the terms of the 
solicitation may be independently awarded, or to a group of items on 
which an award is to be made in the aggregate.


<R05>
552.214-71  Progressive Awards and Monthly Quantity Allocations.

    As prescribed in 514.201-7(a), insert the following clause:

     Progressive Awards and Monthly Quantity Allocations (SEP 1999)

    (a) Monthly quantity allocation.
    (1) Set forth below are the Government's estimated annual and 
monthly requirements for each stock item covered by this solicitation. 
Offerors shall indicate, in the spaces provided, the monthly quantity 
which they are willing to furnish of any item or group of items 
involving the use of the same production facilities. In making monthly 
allocations, offerors are urged to group as many items as possible. Such 
groupings will make it possible for the Government to make fullest use 
of the production capabilities of each offeror.
    (2) Offerors need not limit their monthly allocations to the 
Government's estimated monthly requirements, since additional 
unanticipated needs may occur during the period of the contract. If an 
offeror does not insert monthly allocation quantities, it will be deemed 
to offer to furnish all of the Government's requirements, even though 
they may exceed the stated estimated requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Progressive awards. If the low responsive offeror's monthly 
quantity allocation is less than the Government's estimated 
requirements, the Government may make progressive awards beginning with 
the low responsive offeror and including each next low responsive 
offeror to the extent necessary to meet the estimated requirements.
    (c) Ordering procedures. If progressive awards are made, orders will 
be placed first with the Contractor offering the lowest price on each 
item normally up to that Contractor's maximum quantity allocation and 
then, in the same manner, successively to other Contractors. When 
cumulative orders during any month, placed with a lower priced 
Contractor, equal or exceed 95 percent of its monthly quantity 
allocation, to avoid the placement of unduly small orders or the 
splitting of a subsequent order, the Government reserves the right to 
award the full quantity of the subsequent order to the next lower priced 
Contractor. In no case will orders be placed with any Contractor in 
excess of its monthly quantity allocation.

    (a) The Government, at its election, may reduce the price of this

remedies of the Government specified herein are not exclusive, and are 
in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under 
this contract.

the originally released index, not seasonally adjusted, published by the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor (Labor) for product 
code -------- found under Table --------.
    (b) During the term of the contract, the award price may be adjusted 
once upward or downward a maximum of *-------- percent. Any price 
adjustment for the product code shall be based upon the percentage 
change in the PPI released in the month prior to the initial month of 
the contract period specified in the solicitation for sealed bidding or

    (c) If the PPI is not available for the month of the base index or 
the updated index, the month with the most recently published PPI prior 
to the month determining the base index or updated index shall be used.
    (d) If a product code is discontinued, the Government and the 
Contractor will mutually agree to substitute a similar product code. If 
Labor designates an index with a new title and/or code number as 
continuous with the product code specified above, the new index shall be 
used.
    (e) Unless the Contractor's written request for a price adjustment 
resulting from the application of the formula in (b) above is received 
by the Contracting Officer within 30 calendar days of the release of the 
updated index, the Contractor shall have waived its right to an upward 
price adjustment for the balance of the contract. Alternatively, the 
Contracting Officer will unilaterally adjust the award price downward 
when appropriate using the updated index defined in (b) above.
    (f) Price adjustments shall be effective upon execution of a 
contract modification by the Government or on the 31st day following the 
release of the updated index, whichever is later, shall indicate the 
updated index and percent of change as well as the ACP, and shall not 
apply to delivery orders issued before the effective date.

product code shall be based upon the percentage change in the PPI 
released in the month prior to the initial month of the contract period 
specified in the solicitation for sealed bidding or the month prior to 
award in negotiation (the base index) and the PPI released in the third 
month before completion of the initial contract period stated in the 
solicitation (the updated index). This initial contract period may be 
less than 12 months. The formula for determining the Adjusted Contract 
Price (ACP) applicable to shipments during the first option period is--

    (2) For any subsequent option period, the price adjustment shall be 
the percentage change between the previously updated index (the new base 
index) and the PPI released 12 months later (the most recent updated 
index). This percentage shall be applied to the Current Contract Price 
(CCP). The formula for determining the ACP applicable to

[[Page 230]]

shipments for the subsequent option period(s) is--
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09JY99.002

    (e) Unless the Contractor's written request for a price adjustment 
resulting from the application of the formulas in (b) (1) or (2) above 
is received by the Contracting Officer within 30 calendar days of the 
date of the Government's preliminary written notice of its intent to 
exercise the option, the Contractors shall have waived its right to an 
upward price adjustment for that option period. Alternatively, the 
Contracting Officer in its written notice shall exercise the option at 
the CCP or at a reduced price when appropriate using the formulas in (b) 
(1) or (2) above.
    (f) Price adjustments shall be effected by execution of a contract 
modification by the Government indicating the most recent updated index 
and percent of change and shall apply to delivery orders placed on or 
after the first day of the option period.

following paragraph (g) to the basic clause.

    (g) No price adjustment will be made unless the percentage in the 
PPI is at least **---- percent.

                    Evaluation of Options (AUG 1990)

    (a) The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by 
determining the lowest base period price. When option year pricing is 
based on a formula (e.g., changes in the Producer Price Index or other 
common standard); option year pricing is automatically' considered when 
evaluating the base year price, as any change in price will be uniformly 
related to changes in market conditions. All options are therefore 
considered to be evaluated. Evaluation of options will not obligate the 
Government to exercise the option(s).
    (b) The Government will reject the offer if exceptions are taken to 
the price provisions of the Economic Price Adjustment clause, unless the 
exception results in a lower maximum option year price. Such offers will 
be evaluated without regard to the lower option year(s) maximum. 
However, if the offeror offering a lower maximum is awarded a contract, 
the award will reflect the lower maximum.

providing a mechanism for continuing a contractual relationship with a 
successful Offeror that performs at a level which meets or exceeds GSA's 
quality performance expectations as communicated to the Contractor, in 
writing, by the Contracting Officer or designated representative. When 
deciding whether to exercise the option, the Contracting Officer will 
consider the quality of the Contractor's past performance under this 
contract in accordance with 48 CFR 517.207.

    Where the set-aside portion of an item or group of items is awarded 
to a Contractor other than the one receiving the award on the 
corresponding non-set-aside portion, the Government will divide the 
requirements to be ordered between the two Contractors with the 
objective of achieving, as nearly as possible, a 50/50 division of the 
total value of orders placed after the award of the set-aside portion.

    The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring 
that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, HUBZone 
small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns to 
participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its 
efficient performance. GSA expects any subcontracting plan submitted

this commitment. Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business 
concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 
for construction), must demonstrate that its subcontracting plan 
represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, 
HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business 
concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.

 Preparation, Submission, and Negotiation of Subcontracting Plans (SEP 
                                  1999)

    (a) An offeror, other than a small business concern, submitting an 
offer that exceeds $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) shall submit a 
subcontracting plan with its initial offer. The subcontracting plan will 
be negotiated concurrently with price and any required technical and 
management proposals, unless the offeror submits a previously-approved 
commercial products plan.
    (b) Maximum practicable utilization of small, HUBZone small, small 
disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors 
is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits. 
The General Services Administration (GSA) expects that an offeror's 
subcontracting plan will reflect a commitment to assuring that small, 
HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business 
concerns are provided the maximum practicable opportunity, consistent 
with efficient contract performance, to participate as subcontractors in 
the performance of the resulting contract. An offeror submitting a 
commercial products plan can reflect this commitment through 
subcontracting opportunities it provides that relate to the offeror's 
production generally; i.e., for both its commercial and Government 
business.
    (c) GSA believes that this potential contract provides significant 
opportunities for the use of small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, 
and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors. Consequently, 
in addressing the eleven elements described at FAR 52.219-9(d) of the 
clause in this contract entitled Small Business Subcontracting Plan, the 
offeror shall:
    (1) Demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative 
and innovative program for involving small, HUBZone small, small 
disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns in performing the 
contract.
    (2) Include a description of the offeror's subcontracting strategies 
used in any previous contracts, significant achievements, and how this 
plan will build upon those earlier achievements.
    (3) Demonstrate through its plan that it understands the small 
business subcontracting program's objectives and GSA's expectations, and 
it is committed to taking those actions necessary to meet these goals or 
objectives.
    (d) In determining the acceptability of any subcontracting plan, the 
Contracting Officer will take each of the following actions:
    (1) Review the plan to verify that the offeror demonstrates an 
understanding of the small business subcontracting program's objectives 
and GSA's expectations with respect to the program and has included all 
the information, goals, and assurances required by FAR 52.219-9.
    (2) Consider previous goals and achievements of contractors in the 
small industry.
    (3) Consider information and potential sources obtained from 
agencies administering national and local preference programs and other 
advocacy groups in evaluating whether the goals stated in the plan 
adequately reflect the anticipated potential for subcontracting to 
small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small 
business concerns.
    (4) Review the offeror's description of its strategies, historical 
performance and significant achievements in placing subcontracts for the 
same or similar products or services with small, HUBZone small, small 
disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns. The offeror's 
description can apply to commercial as well as previous Government 
contracts.
    (e) Failure to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan and/or 
correct deficiencies in a plan within the time specified by the 
Contracting Officer shall make the offeror ineligible for award.

disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors

ensuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, 
HUBZone small, small disdvantaged, and women-owned small business 
concerns to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this 
contract, consistent with its efficient performance, must be reflected 
in the offeror's subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to the clause of 
this contract at FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.
    (2) In addressing the eleven elements described at FAR 52.219-9(d), 
the offeror shall demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a 
creative and innovative program for involving small, HUBZone small,

[[Page 234]]

small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns in 
performing this contract. An offeror submitting a commercial products 
plan can demonstrate its commitment in providing maximum practicable 
opportunities through subcontracting opportunities it provides to small, 
HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business 
concerns that relate to the offeror's production generally; i.e., for 
both its commercial and Government business.

offeror's subcontracting strategies used in previous contracts and 
significant achievements, with an explanation of how this plan will 
build upon those earlier achievements. Additionally, the offeror shall 
demonstrate through its plan that it understands the small business 
subcontracting program's objectives, GSA's expectations, and is 
committed to taking those actions necessary to meet these goals or 
objectives.
    (b) GSA believes that this contract provides significant 
opportunities for the use of small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged,

it is anticipated that an acceptable subcontracting plan will contain at 
least the following goals:

Small Business.......................................      ---- percent.
HUBZone Small Business...............................      ---- percent.
Small Disadvantaged Business.........................      ---- percent.
Women-Owned Small Business...........................      ---- percent.
 

    Note: Target goals are expressed as a percentage of planned 
subcontracting dollars.
    (c) In determining the acceptability of any subcontracting plan, the 
Contracting Officer will--
    (1) Review the plan to verify that the offeror has demonstrated an 
understanding of the small business subcontracting program's objectives 
and GSA's expectations with respect to the programs and has included all 
the information, goals, and assurances required by FAR 52.219-9;
    (2) Consider previous goals and achievements of contractors in the 
same industry;
    (3) Consider information and potential sources obtained from 
agencies administering national and local preference programs and other 
advocacy groups in evaluating whether the goals stated in the plan 
adequately reflect the anticipated potential for subcontracting to 
small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small 
business concerns; and
    (4) Review the offeror's description of its strategies, historical 
performance and significant achievements in placing subcontracts for the 
same or similar products or services with small, HUBZone small, small 
disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns. The offeror's 
description can apply to commercial as well as previous Government 
contracts.
    (d) Failure to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan and/or 
correct deficiencies in a plan within the time specified by the 
Contracting Officer shall make the offeror ineligible for award.

taxes. No adjustment will be made to cover taxes which may subsequently 
be imposed on this transaction or changes in the rates of currently 
applicable taxes. However, the Government will, upon the request of the 
Contractor, furnish evidence appropriate to establish exemption from any 
tax from which the Government is exempt and which was not included in 
the contract price.

552.232-1  Payments.

    As prescribed in 532.7104, insert the following clause:

              Payments (APR 1984) (Deviation FAR 52.232-1)

    (a) The Government shall pay the Contractor, without submission of 
invoices or vouchers, 30 days after the service period, the prices 
stipulated in this contract for supplies delivered and accepted or 
services rendered and accepted, less any deductions provided in this 
contract.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the Government will 
make payment on partial deliveries accepted by the Government if either:
    (1) The amount due on the deliveries warrants it.
    (2) The Contractor requests it and the amount due on the deliveries 
is at least $1,000 or 50 percent of the total contract price.
    (c) When processing payment, GSA's Finance Office will automatically 
generate the 12 digit invoice number using the ACT number assigned to 
the contract, followed by an abbreviated month and year of service 
(e.g., 84261554JUN7, for June 1997). The ACT number appears on the 
contract award document.

552.232-8  Discounts for Prompt Payment.

    As prescribed in 532.206, insert the following clause:

    Discounts for Prompt Payment (APR 1989) (Deviation FAR 52.232-8)

    (a) Discounts for early payment (hereinafter referred to as 
``discounts'' or ``the discount'') will be considered in evaluating the 
relationship of the offeror's concessions to the Government vis-a-vis 
the offeror's concessions to its commercial customers, but only to the 
extent indicated in this clause.
    (b) Discounts will not be considered to determine the low offeror in 
the situation described in the ``Offers on Identical Products'' 
provision of this solicitation.
    (c) Uneconomical discounts will not be considered as meeting the 
criteria for award established by the Government. In this connection, a 
discount will be considered uneconomical if the annualized rate of 
return for earning the discount is lower than the ``value of funds'' 
rate established by the Department of the Treasury and published 
quarterly in the Federal Register. The ``value of funds'' rate applied 
will be the rate in effect on the date specified for the receipt of 
offers.
    (d) Agencies required to use the resultant schedule will not apply 
the discount in determining the lowest delivered price pursuant to the 
FPMR, 41 CFR 101-26.408, if the agency determines that payment will 
probably not be made within the discount period offered. The same is 
true if the discount is considered uneconomical at the time of placement 
of the order.
    (e) Discounts for early payment may be offered either in the 
original offer or on individual invoices submitted under the resulting 
contract. Discounts offered will be taken by the Government if payment 
is made within the discount period specified.
    (f) Discounts that are included in offers become a part of the 
resulting contracts and are binding on the Contractor for all orders 
placed under the contract. Discounts offered only on individual invoices 
will be binding on the Contractor only for the particular invoice on 
which the discount is offered.
    (g) In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time 
shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of 
computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been 
made on the date which appears on the payment check or the date on which 
an electronic funds transfer was made.

                             (End of clause)

552.232-23  Assignment of Claims.

    As prescribed in 532.806, insert the following clause:

                     Assignment of Claims (SEP 1999)

    Because this is a requirements or indefinite quantity contract under 
which more than one agency may place orders, paragraph (a) of the 
Assignment of Claims clause (FAR 52.232-23) is inapplicable and the 
following is substituted therefor:
    In order to prevent confusion and delay in making payment, the 
Contractor shall not assign any claim(s) for amounts due or to become 
due under this contract. However, the Contractor is permitted to assign 
separately to a bank, trust company, or other financial institution, 
including any Federal lending agency, under the provisions of the 
Assignment of Claims Act, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 3727, 41 U.S.C. 15 
(hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''), all amounts due or to become 
due under any order amounting to $1,000 or more issued by any Government 
agency under this contract. Any such assignment

[[Page 238]]

takes effect only if and when the assignee files written notice of the 
assignment together with a true copy of the instrument of assignment 
with the contracting officer issuing the order and the finance office 
designated in the order to make payment. Unless otherwise stated in the 
order, payments to an assignee of any amounts due or to become due under 
any order assigned may, to the extent specified in the Act, be subject 
to reduction or set-off.

552.232-25  Prompt Payment.

    As prescribed in 532.908(a)(2), insert the following clause:

           Prompt Payment (JUL 1998) (Deviation FAR 52.232-25)

    Notwithstanding any other payment clause in this contract, the 
Government will make invoice payments and contract financing payments 
under the terms and conditions specified in this clause. Payment shall 
be considered as being made on the day a check is dated or the date of 
an electronic funds transfer. Definitions of pertinent terms are set 
forth in section 32.902 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. All days 
referred to in this clause are calendar days, unless otherwise 
specified. (However, see subparagraph (a)(4) of this clause concerning 
payments due on Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.)
    (a) Invoice payments. (1) The due date for making invoice payments 
by the designated payment office is:
    (i) For orders placed electronically by the General Services 
Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Service (FSS), and to be paid by GSA 
through electronic funds transfer (EFT), the later of the following two 
events:
    (A) The 10th day after the designated billing office receives a 
proper invoice from the Contractor. If the designated billing office 
fails to annotate the invoice with the date of receipt at the time of 
receipt, the invoice payment due date shall be the 10th day after the 
date of the Contractor's invoice; provided the Contractor submitted a 
proper invoice and no disagreement exists over quantity, quality, or 
Contractor compliance with contract requirements.
    (B) The 10th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered 
or services performed by the Contractor.
    (ii) For all other orders, the later of the following two events:
    (A) The 30th day after the designated billing office receives a 
proper invoice from the Contractor. If the designated billing office 
fails to annotate the invoice with the date of receipt at the time of 
receipt, the invoice payment due date shall be the 30th day after the 
date ofthe Contractor's invoice; provided the Contractor submitted a 
proper invoice and no disagreement exists over quantity, quality, or 
Contractor compliance with contract requirements.
    (B) The 30th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered 
or services performed by the Contractor.
    (iii) On a final invoice, if the payment amount is subject to 
contract settlement actions, acceptance occurs on the effective date of 
the contract settlement.
    (2) The General Services Administration will issue payment on the 
due date in (a)(1)(i) above if the Contractor complies with full cycle 
electronic commerce. Full cycle electronic commerce includes all the 
following elements:
    (i) The Contractor must receive and fulfill electronic data 
interchange (EDI) purchase orders (transaction set 850).
    (ii) The Contractor must generate and submit to the Government valid 
EDI invoices (transaction set 810) or submit invoices through the GSA 
Finance Center Internet-based invoice process. Internet-based invoices 
must be submitted using procedures provided by GSA.
    (iii) The Contractor's financial institution must receive and 
process, on behalf of the Contractor, EFT payments through the Automated 
Clearing House (ACH) system.
    (iv) The EDI transaction sets in (i) through (iii) above must adhere 
to implementation conventions provided by GSA.
    (3) If any of the conditions in(a)(2) above do not occur, the 10 day 
payment due dates in (a)(1) become 30 day payment due dates.
    (4) Certain food products and other payments.
    (i) Due dates on Contractor invoices for meat, meat food products, 
or fish; perishable agricultural commodities; and dairy products, edible 
fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils are--
    (A) For meat or meat food products, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of 
the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921 (7 U.S.C. 182 (3)), and as further 
defined in Pub. L. 98-181, including any edible fresh or frozen poultry 
meat, any perishable poultry meat food product, fresh eggs, an any 
perishable egg product, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 
7th day after product delivery.
    (B) For fresh or frozen fish, as defined in section 204(3) of the 
Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 4003(3)), as close as 
possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery.
    (C) For perishable agricultural commodities, as defined in section 
1(4) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1930 (7 U.S.C. 
499a(4)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day 
after product delivery, unless another date is specified in the 
contract.
    (D) For daily products, as defined in section 111(e) of the Dairy 
Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4502(e)), edible fats

[[Page 239]]

or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils, as close 
as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after the date on which 
a proper invoice has been received. Liquid milk, cheese, certain 
processed cheese products, butter, yogurt, ice cream, mayonnaise, salad 
dressing, and other similar products, fall within this classification. 
Nothing in the Act limits this classification to refrigerated products. 
When questions arise regarding the proper classification of a specific 
product, prevailing industry practices will be followed in specifying a 
contract payment due date. The burden of proof that a classification of 
a specific product is, in fact, prevailing industry practice is upon the 
Contractor making the representation.
    (ii) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for 
payment (e.g., periodic lease payments), the due date will be as 
specified in the contract.
    (5) Contractor's invoice. The Contractor shall prepare and submit 
invoices to the designated billing office specified in the contract. 
Notwithstanding paragraph (g) of the clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract 
Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items, if the Contractor submits hard-
copy invoices, submit only an original invoice. No copies of the invoice 
are required. A proper invoice must include the items listed in 
subdivisions (a)(5)(i) through (a)(5)(viii) of this clause. If the 
invoice does not comply with these requirements, it shall be returned 
within 7 days after the date the designated billing office received the 
invoice (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for 
perishable agricultural commodities, edible fats or oils, and food 
products prepared from edible fats or oils), with a statement of the 
reasons why it is not a proper invoice. Untimely notification will be 
taken into account in computing any interest penalty owed the Contractor 
in the manner described in subparagraph (a)(5) of this clause.
    (i) Name and address of the Contractor.
    (ii) Invoice date. (The Contractor is encouraged to date invoices as 
close as possible to the date of the mailing or transmission.)
    (iii) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered 
or services preformed (including order number and contract line item 
number).
    (iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, an extended 
prices of supplies delivered or services performed.
    (v) Shipping and payment terms (e.g., shipment number and date of 
shipment, prompt payment discount terms). Bill of lading number and 
weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government bills or 
lading.
    (vi) Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to 
be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice 
of assignment).
    (vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing 
address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.
    (viii) Any other information or documentation required by the 
contract (such as evidence of shipment).
    (ix) While not required, the Contractor is strongly encouraged to 
assign an identification number to each invoice.
    (6) Interest penalty. An interest penalty shall be paid 
automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the 
Contractor, if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions 
listed in subdivisions (a)(6)(i) through (a)(6)(iii) of this clause are 
met, if applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and 
Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made 
on the following business day without incurring a late payment interest 
penalty.
    (i) A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office.
    (ii) A receiving report or other Government documentation 
authorizing payment was processed, and there was no disagreement over 
quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with any contract term or 
condition.
    (iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due 
the Contractor for supplies delivered or services performed, the amount 
was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the 
Government and the Contractor.
    (7) Computing penalty amount. The interest penalty shall be at the 
rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of 
the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on 
the day after the due date, except where the interest penalty is 
prescribed by other governmental authority (e.g., tariffs). This rate is 
referred to as the ``Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,'' and it is 
published in the Federal Register semiannually on or about January 1 and 
July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the invoice principal 
payment amount approved by the Government until the payment date of such 
approved principal amount; and will be compounded in 30-day increments 
inclusive from the first day after the due date through the payment 
date. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be 
added to the approved invoice principal payment amount and will be 
subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day 
period. If the designated billing office failed to notify the Contractor 
of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in subparagraph 
(a)(5) of this clause, the due date on the corrected invoice will be 
adjusted by subtracting from such date the number of days taken beyond 
the prescribed notification of defects period. Any interest

[[Page 240]]

penalty owed the Contractor will be based on this adjusted due date. 
Adjustments will be made by the designated payment office for errors in 
calculating interest penalties.
    (i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might 
be due the Contractor, Government acceptance shall be deemed to have 
occurred constructively on the 7th day (unless otherwise specified in 
this contract) after the Contractor delivered the supplies or performed 
the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality or 
Contractor compliance with a contract provision. In the event that 
actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the 
determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date 
of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does, not 
however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, 
perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to 
fulfilling their responsibilities.
    (ii) The following periods of time will not be included in the 
determination of an interest penalty:
    (A) The period taken to notify the Contractor of defects in invoices 
submitted to the Government, but this may not exceed 7 days (3 days for 
meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for perishable agricultural 
commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products 
prepared from edible fats or oils).
    (B) The period between the defects notice and resubmission of the 
corrected invoice by the Contractor.
    (C) For incorrect electronic funds transfer (EFT) information, in 
accordance with the EFT clause of this contract.
    (iii) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the 
filing of a claim for such penalties under the clause at 52.233-1, 
Disputes, or for more than 1 year. Interest penalties of less than $1 
need not be paid.
    (iv) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to 
disagreement between the Government and the Contractor over the payment 
amount or other issues involving contract compliance or on amounts 
temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the 
contract. Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be 
payable, will be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233-1, 
Disputes.
    (8) Prompt payment discounts. An interest penalty also shall be paid 
automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the 
Contractor, if a discount for prompt payment is taken improperly. The 
interest penalty will be calculated as described in subparagraph (a)(7) 
of this clause on the amount of discount taken for the period beginning 
with the first day after the end of the discount period through the date 
when the Contractor is paid.
    (9) Additional interest penalty.
    (i) If this contract was awarded on or October 1, 1989, a penalty 
amount, calculated in accordance with subdivision (a)(9)(iii) of this 
clause, shall be paid in addition to the interest penalty amount if the 
Contractor--
    (A) Is owed an interest penalty of $1 or more;
    (B) Is not paid the interest penalty within 10 days after the date 
the invoice amount is paid; and
    (C) Makes a written demand to the designated payment office for 
additional penalty payment, in accordance with subdivision (a)(9)(ii) of 
this clause, postmarked not later than 40 days after the invoice amount 
is paid.
    (ii)(A) Contractors shall support written demands for additional 
penalty payments with the following data. No additional data shall be 
required. Contractors shall--
    (1) Specifically assert that late payment interest is due under a 
specific invoice, and request payment of all overdue late payment 
interest penalty and such additional penalty as may be required;
    (2) Attach a copy of the invoice on which the unpaid late payment 
interest was due; and
    (3) State that payment of the principal has been received, including 
the date of receipt.
    (B) Demands must be postmarked on or before the 40th day after 
payment was made, except that--
    (1) If the postmark is illegible or nonexistent, the demand must 
have been received and annotated with the date of receipt by the 
designated payment office on or before the 40th day after payment was 
made; or
    (2) If the postmark is illegible or nonexistent and the designated 
payment office fails to make the required annotation, the demand's 
validity will be determined by the date the Contractor has placed on the 
demand; provided such date is no later than the 40th day after payment 
was made.
    (iii)(A) The additional penalty shall be equal to 100 percent of any 
original late payment interest penalty, except--
    (1) The additional penalty shall not exceed $5,000;
    (2) The additional penalty shall never be less than $25; and
    (3) No additional penalty is owed if the amount of the underlying 
interest penalty is less than $1.
    (B) If the interest penalty ceases to accrue in accordance with the 
limits stated in subdivision (a)(5)(iii) of this clause, the amount of 
the additional penalty shall be calculated on the amount of interest 
penalty that would have accrued in the absence of these limits, subject 
to the overall limits on the additional penalty specified in subdivision 
(a)(7)(iii)(A) of this clause.
    (C) For determining the maximum and minimum additional penalties, 
the test shall

[[Page 241]]

be the interest penalty due on each separate payment made for each 
separate contract. The maximum and minimum additional penalty shall not 
be based upon individual invoices unless the invoices are paid 
separately. Where payments are consolidated for disbursing purposes, the 
maximum and minimum additional penalty determination shall be made 
separately for each contract therein.
    (D) The additional penalty does not apply to payments regulated by 
other Government regulations (e.g., payments under utility contracts 
subject to tariffs and regulation).
    (b) Contract financing payments. (1) Due dates for recurring 
financing payments. If this contract provides for contract financing, 
requests for payment shall be submitted to the designated billing office 
as specified in this contract or as directed by the Contracting Officer. 
Contract financing payments shall be made on the [insert day as 
prescribed by Agency head; if not prescribed, insert 30th day] day after 
receipt of a proper contract financing request by the designated billing 
office. In the event that an audit or other review of a specific 
financing request is required to ensure compliance with the terms and 
conditions of the contract, the designated payment office is not 
compelled to make payment by the due date specified.
    (2) Due dates for other contract financing. For advance payments, 
loans, or other arrangements that do not involve recurring submissions 
of contract financing requests, payment shall be in accordance with the 
corresponding contract terms or as directed by the Contracting Officer.
    (3) Interest penalty not applicable. Contract financing payments 
shall not be assessed an interest penalty for payment delays.
    (c) Fast payment procedure due dates. If this contract contains the 
clause at 52.213-1, Fast Payment Procedure, payments will be made within 
15 days after the date of receipt of the invoice.

    (a) Under the Inspection of Services clause of this contract, 
payments may be adjusted if any services do not conform with contract 
requirements. The Contracting Office or a designated representative will 
inform the Contractor, in writing, of the type and dollar amount of 
proposed deductions by the 10th workday of the month following the 
performance period for which the deductions are to be made.
    (b) The Contractor may, within 10 working days of receipt of the 
notification of the proposed deductions, present to the Contracting 
Officer specific reasons why any or all of the proposed deductions are 
not justified. Reasons must be solidly based and must provide specific 
facts that justify reconsideration and/or adjustment of the amount to be 
deducted. Failure to respond within the 10-day period will be 
interpreted to mean that the Contractor accepts the deductions proposed.
    (c) All or a portion of the final payment may be delayed or withheld 
until the Contracting Officer makes a final decision on the proposed 
deduction. If the Contracting Officer determines that any or all of the 
proposed deductions are warranted, the Contracting Officer shall so 
notify the Contractor, and adjust payments under the contract 
accordingly.

    Before final payment is made, the Contractor shall furnish the 
Contracting Officer with a release of all claims against the Government 
relating to this contract, other than claims in stated amounts that are 
specifically excepted by the Contractor from the release. If the 
Contractor's claim to amounts payable under the contract has been 
assigned under Assignment of Claims

    The authorization of performance of work under this contract during 
the initial contract period and any option or extension period(s) is 
contingent upon the appropriation of funds to procure this service. If 
the contract is awarded, extended, or option(s) exercised, the 
Government's obligation beyond the end of the fiscal year (September 
30), in which the award or extension is made or option(s) exercised, is 
contingent upon the availability of funds from which payment for the 
contract services can be made. No legal liability on the part of the 
Government for payment of any money beyond the end of the each fiscal 
year (September 30) shall arise unless or until funds are made available 
to the Contracting Officer for this procurement and written notice of 
such availability is given to the Contractor.

events:
    (i) The 10th day after the designated billing office receives a 
proper invoice from the Contractor. If the designated billing office

    The Government will make payments under the terms and conditions 
specified in this clause. Payment shall be considered as being made on 
the day a check is dated or an electronic funds transfer is made. All 
days referred to in this clause are calendar days, unless otherwise 
specified.
    (a) Payment due date.

[[Page 243]]

    (1) Rental Payments. Rent shall be paid monthly in arrears and will 
be due on the first workday of each month, and only as provided for by 
the lease.
    (i) When the date for commencement of rent falls on the 15th day of 
the month or earlier, the initial monthly rental payment under this 
contract shall become due on the first workday of the month following 
the month in which the commencement of the rent is effective.
    (ii) When the date for commencement of rent falls after the 15th day 
of the month, the initial monthly rental payment under this contract 
shall become due on the first workday of the second month following the 
month in which the commencement of the rent is effective.
    (2) Other payments. The due date for making payments other than rent 
shall be the later of the following two events:
    (i) The 30th day after the designated billing office has received a 
proper invoice from the Contractor.
    (ii) The 30th day after Government acceptance of the work or 
service. However, if the designated billing office fails to annotate the 
invoice with the actual date of receipt, the invoice payment due date 
shall be deemed to be the 30th day after the Contractor's invoice is 
dated, provided a proper invoice is received and there is no 
disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with 
contract requirements.
    (b) Invoice and inspection requirements for payments other than 
rent.
    (1) The Contractor shall prepare and submit an invoice to the 
designated billing office after completion of the work. A proper invoice

the work performed or services delivered within 7 days after the receipt 
of a proper invoice or notification of completion of the work or 
services unless a different period is specified at the time the order is 
placed. If actual acceptance occurs later, for the purpose of 
determining the payment due date and calculation of interest, acceptance 
will be deemed to occur on the last day of the 7 day inspection period. 
If the work or service is rejected for failure to conform to the 
technical requirements of the contract, the 7 days will be counted 
beginning with receipt of a new invoice or notification. In either case, 
the Contractor is not entitled to any payment or interest unless actual 
acceptance by the Government occurs.
    (c) Interest Penalty. (1) An interest penalty shall be paid 
automatically by the Government, without request from the Contractor, if 
payment is not made by the due date.
    (2) The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the 
Secretary of the Treasury under Section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act 
of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date. 
This rate is referred to as the ``Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,'' 
and it is published in the Federal Register semiannually on or about 
January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the 
payment amount approved by the Government and be compounded in 30-day 
increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through the 
payment date.
    (3) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the filing 
of a claim for such penalties under the clause at 52.233-1, Disputes, or 
for more than 1 year. Interest rates penalties of less than $1.00 need 
not be paid.
    (4) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to 
disagreement between the Government and Contractor over the payment 
amount or other issues involving contract compliance or on amounts 
temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the 
contract. Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be 
payable, will be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233-1, 
Disputes.

address shown on an actual invoice differs from that shown in paragraph

    The Contractor is required to perform all billings made pursuant to 
this contract. However, if the Contractor has dealers that participate 
on the contract and the billing/payment process by the Contractor for 
sales made by the dealer is a significant administrative burden, the 
following alternative procedures may be used. Where dealers are allowed 
by the Contractor to bill ordering activities and accept payment in the 
Contractor's name, the Contractor agrees to obtain from all dealers 
participating in the performance of the contract a written agreement, 
which will require dealers to--
    (1) Comply with the same terms and conditions regarding prices as 
the Contractor for sales made under the contract;
    (2) Maintain a system of reporting sales under the contract to the 
manufacturer, which includes--
    (i) The date of sale;
    (ii) The ordering activity to which the sale was made;
    (iii) The service or product/model sold;
    (iv) The quantity of each service or product/model sold;
    (v) The price at which it was sold, including discounts; and
    (vi) All other significant sales data.
    (3) Be subject to audit by the Government, with respect to sales 
made under the contract; and
    (4) Place orders and accept payments in the name of the Contractor 
in care of the dealer.
    An agreement between a Contractor and its dealers pursuant to this 
procedure will not establish privity of contract between dealers and the 
Government.

    (1) Indicate that it is a protest to the agency.
    (2) Be filed with the Contracting Officer.

presentation, a written presentation, or an oral presentation confirmed 
in writing, of arguments in support of the protest to the deciding 
official.
    (5) Include the information required by FAR 33.103(d)(2):

requesting either that the Contracting Officer or the Agency Protest 
Official for GSA decide the protest.

[[Page 247]]

    (e) The decision by the Agency Protest Official for GSA is an 
alternative to a decision by the Contracting Officer. The Agency Protest 
Official for GSA will not consider appeals from the Contracting 
Officer's decision on an agency protest.
    (f) The deciding Official must conduct a scheduling conference with 
the protester within three (3) days after the protest is filed. The 
scheduling conference will establish deadlines for oral or written 
arguments in support of the agency protest and for agency officials to 
present information in response to the protest issues. The deciding 
official may hear oral arguments in support of the agency protest at the 
same time as the scheduling conference, depending on availability of the 
necessary parties.
    (g) Oral conferences may take place either by telephone or in 
person. Other parties (e.g., representatives of the program office) may 
attend at the discretion of the deciding official.
    (h) The following procedures apply to information submitted in 
support of or in response to an agency protest:
    (1) The protester and the agency have only one opportunity to 
support or explain the substance of the protest (either orally, in 
writing, or orally confirmed in writing).
    (2) GSA procedures do not provide for any discovery.
    (3) The deciding official has discretion to request additional 
information from either the agency or the protester. However, the 
deciding official will normally decide protests on the basis of 
information provided by the protester and the agency.
    (4) Except as provided in paragraph (5)(ii) below, the parties are 
encouraged, but not required, to exchange information submitted to the 
Agency Protest Official for GSA.
    (5) If the agency makes a written response to the protest, the 
following filling requirements apply unless the deciding official 
approves other arrangements:
    (i) The agency must file its response to the protest with the 
deciding official within five (5) days after the filing of the protest.
    (ii) The agency must also provide the protester with a copy of the 
response on the same day it files the response with the deciding 
official. If the agency believes it needs to redact or withhold any 
information in the response from the protester, it must obtain the 
approval of the deciding official.
    (i) The deciding official will resolve the protest through informal 
presentations or meetings to the maximum extent practicable.
    (j) An interested party may represent itself or be represented by 
legal counsel. GSA will not reimburse the party for any legal fees 
related to the agency protest.
    (k) GSA will stay award or suspend contract performance in 
accordance with FAR 33.103(f). The stay or suspension, unless over-
ridden, remains in effect until the protest is decided, dismissed, or 
withdrawn.
    (l) The deciding official will make a best effort to issue a 
decision on the protest within twenty-eight (28) days after the filing 
date. The decision may be oral or written. If the decision is 
communicated orally to the protester, the deciding official will confirm 
in writing within three (3) days after the decision.
    (m) GSA may dismiss or stay proceedings on an agency protest if a 
protest on the same or similar basis is filed with a protest forum 
outside of GSA.

552.236-73  Basis of Award--Construction Contract.

    As prescribed in 536.570-4, insert the following provision or the 
appropriate Alternate:

            Basis of Award--Construction Contract (APR 1985)

    (a) The low bidder for purposes of award is the responsible bidder 
offering the lowest price for the base bid (consisting of the lump sum 
bid and any associated unit price bids extended by the applicable number 
of units shown on the bid form). See Standard Form 1442, Solicitation, 
Offer, and Award and the provision entitled ``Contract Award--Sealed 
Bidding.''
    (b) A bid may be rejected as nonresponsive if the bid is materially 
unbalanced as to bid prices. A bid is unbalanced when the bid is based 
on prices significantly less than cost for some work and significantly 
overstated for other work.

                           (End of provision)

    Alternate I (APR 1985). if the solicitation includes a base bid and 
options, the Contracting Officer shall delete paragraph (a) of the basic 
provision and insert paragraph (a) substantially as follows:

    (a) The low bidder for purposes of award is the responsible bidder 
offering the lowest aggregate price for (1) the base bid (consisting of 
the lump sum bid and any associated unit price bids extended by the 
applicable number of units shown on the bid form) plus (2) all options 
designated to be evaluated. The evaluation of options will not obligate 
the Government to exercise the options. See Standard Form 1442, 
Solicitation, Offer, and Award and the provision entitled ``Contract 
Award--Sealed Bidding.''
    Alternate II (APR 1985). If the solicitation includes a base bid and 
alternates, the Contracting Officer shall delete paragraph (a) of the 
basic provision and insert paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) substantially as 
follows:

    (a) The low bidder for purposes of award is the responsible bidder 
offering the lowest aggregate price for (1) the base bid (consisting of 
the lump sum bid and any associated unit price bids extended by the 
applicable number of units shown on the bid form) plus (2) those 
alternates in the order of priority listed in the solicitation that 
provide the most features of work within the funds available at bid 
opening. See the provision entitled ``Contract Award--Sealed Bidding.''
    (c) Alternates will be added to the base bid in the order listed in 
the solicitation (see Standard Form 1442, Solicitation, Offer, and 
Award). If the addition of an alternate would make all bids exceed the 
funds available at bid opening, that alternate shall be skipped and the 
next subsequent alternate in a lower amount shall be added, provided 
that the aggregate of base bid and the selected alternates do not exceed 
the funds available at bid opening. For example, when the amount 
available is $100,000 and a bidder's base bid is $85,000, with its 
separate bids on four successive alternatives being $10,000, $8,000, 
$6,000, and $4,000, the aggregate amount of the bid for purposes of 
selecting the alternates would be $99,000 (base bid plus the first and 
four alternates). The second and third alternates are skipped because 
each of them would cause the aggregate of the base bid and alternates to 
exceed the $100,000 amount

[[Page 249]]

available when considered with the first alternate. All bids shall be 
evaluated on the basis of the same alternates.
    (d) After the low bidder has been determined in accordance with 
paragraph (a), an award may be made to that low bidder on the base bid, 
plus any combination of alternates for which funds are available at the 
time of award, but only if the award amount does not exceed the amount 
offered by any other responsible bidder. If the base bid plus the 
proposed combination of alternates exceed the amount offered by any 
other responsible bidder for thesame combination of alternates, the 
award cannot be made on that combination of alternates.

    Alternate III (APR 1985). If the solicitation includes a base bid, 
alternates, and options, the Contracting Officer shall delete paragraph 
(a) of the basic provision and insert paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) 
substantially as follows:

    (a) The low bidder for purposes of award is the responsible bidder 
offering the lowest aggregate price for (1) the base bid (consisting of 
the lump sum bid and any associated unit price bids extended by the 
applicable number of units shown on the bid form) plus (2) those 
alternates in the order of priority listed in the solicitation that 
provide the most features of work within the funds available at bid 
opening plus (3) all options designated to be evaluated except those 
options associated with alternates which are skipped during the 
selection process outlined in paragraph (c) below. The evaluation of 
options will not obligate the Government to exercise the options. See 
the provision entitled ``Contract Award--Sealed Bidding.''
    (c) Alternates will be added to the base bid in the order listed in 
the solicitation (see Standard Form 1442, Solicitation, Offer, or 
Award). If the addition of an alternate would make all bids exceed the 
funds available at bid opening, that alternate shall be skipped and the 
next subsequent alternate in a lower amount shall be added, provided 
that the aggregate of base bid and the selected alternates do not exceed 
the funds available at bid opening. For example, when the amount 
available is $100,000 and a bidder's base bid is $85,000, with its 
separate bids on four successive alternates being $10,000, $8,000, 
$6,000, and $4,000, the aggregate amount of the bid for purposes of 
selecting the alternates would be $99,000 (base bid plus the first and 
fourth alternates). The second and third alternates are skipped because 
each of them would cause the aggregate of the base bid and alternates to 
exceed the $100,000 amount available when considered with the first 
alternate. All bids shall be evaluated on the basis of the same 
alternates.
    (d) After the low bidder has been determined in accordance with 
paragraph (a), award may be made to that low bidder on the base bid and 
evaluated options plus any combination of alternates for which funds are 
available at the time of award, but only if that low bidder is still low 
on the sum thereof plus any previously unevaluated options designated to 
be evaluated which are associated with proposed alternates that were 
skipped during the selection under paragraph (c). If that low bidder is 
not still low, award cannot be made on the proposed combination of 
alternates.

follows:
    (a) In case of difference between small and large-scale drawings, 
the large-scale drawings shall govern. Schedules on any contract drawing 
shall take precedence over conflicting information on that or any other 
contract drawing. On any of the drawings where a portion of the work is 
detailed or drawn out and the remainder is shown in outline, the parts 
detailed or drawn out shall apply also to all other like portions of the 
work.
    (b) Where the word ``similar'' occurs on the drawings, it shall have 
a general meaning and not be interpreted as being identical, and all 
details shall be worked out in relation to their location and their 
connection with other parts of the work.
    (c) Standard Details or Specification Drawings are applicable when 
listed, bound with the specifications, noted on the drawings or 
referenced elsewhere in the specifications. Where the notes on the

Drawings and the specifications, the specifications will govern. In case 
of difference between the Standard Details or Specification Drawings and 
their drawings prepared specifically for this contract, the later shall 
govern.

552.238-72  Identification of Products That Have Environmental Attributes.

    As prescribed in 538.273(a)(3), insert the following clause:

Identification of Products That Have Environmental Attributes (SEP 2003)

    (a) Several laws, Executive orders, and Agency directives require 
Federal buyers to purchase products that are less harmful to the 
environment, when they are life cycle cost-effective (see FAR Subpart 
23.7). The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) requires 
contractors to highlight environmental products under Federal Supply 
Service schedule contracts in various communications media (e.g., 
publications and electronic formats).
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause--
    Energy-efficient product means a product that--
    (1) Meets Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency 
criteria for use of the ENERGY STAR[reg] trademark label; or
    (2) Is in the upper 25 percent of efficiency for all similar 
products as designated by the Department of Energy's Federal Energy 
Management Program.
    GSA Advantage! is an on-line shopping mall and ordering system that 
provides customers with access to products and services under GSA 
contracts.
    Other environmental attributes refers to product characteristics 
that provide environmental benefits, excluding recovered materials and 
energy and water efficiency. Several examples of these characteristics 
are biodegradable, recyclable, reduced pollutants, ozone safe, and low 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
    Post-consumer material means a material or finished product that has 
served its intended use and has been discarded for disposal or recovery, 
having completed its life as a consumer item. Post-consumer material is 
part of the broader category of ``recovered material.'' The 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed a list of EPA-
designated products in their Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPGs) 
to provide Federal agencies with purchasing recommendations on specific 
products in a Recovered Materials Advisory Notice (RMAN). The RMAN 
contains recommended recovered and post-

[[Page 255]]

consumer material content levels for the specific products designated by 
EPA (40 CFR part 247 and http://www.epa.gov/cpg/).
    Recovered materials means waste materials and by-products recovered 
or diverted from solid waste, but the term does not include those 
materials and by-products generated from, and commonly reused within, an 
original manufacturing process (Executive Order 13101 and 42 U.S.C. 
6903(19) and http://www.epa.gov/cpg/). For paper and paper products, see 
the definition at FAR 11.301 (42 U.S.C. 6962(h)).
    Remanufactured means factory rebuilt to original specifications.
    Renewable energy means energy produced by solar, wind, geothermal, 
and biomass power.
    Renewable energy technology means--
    (1) Technologies that use renewable energy to provide light, heat, 
cooling, or mechanical or electrical energy for use in facilities or 
other activities; or
    (2) The use of integrated whole-building designs that rely upon 
renewable energy resources, including passive solar design.
    (c)(1) The offeror must identify products that--
    (i) Are compliant with the recovered and post-consumer material 
content levels recommended in the Recovered Materials Advisory Notices 
(RMANs) for EPA-designated products in the CPG program (http://
www.epa.gov/cpg/);
    (ii) Contain recovered materials that either do not meet the 
recommended levels in the RMANs or are not EPA-designated products in 
the CPG program (see FAR 23.401 and http://www.epa.gov/cpg/);
    (iii) Are energy-efficient, as defined by either ENERGY STAR[reg] 
and/or FEMP's designated top 25th percentile levels (see ENERGY 
STAR[reg] at http://www.energystar.gov/ and FEMP at http://
www.eere.energy.gov/femp/procurement/);
    (iv) Are water-efficient;
    (v) Use renewable energy technology;
    (vi) Are remanufactured; and
    (vii) Have other environmental attributes.
    (2) These identifications must be made in each of the offeror's 
following mediums:
    (i) The offer itself.
    (ii) Printed commercial catalogs, brochures, and pricelists.
    (iii) Online product website.
    (iv) Electronic data submission for GSA Advantage! submitted via 
GSA's Schedules Input Program (SIP) software or the Electronic Data 
Inter-change (EDI). Offerors can use the SIP or EDI methods to indicate 
environmental and other attributes for each product that is translated 
into respective icons in GSA Advantage!.
    (d) An offeror, in identifying an item with an environmental 
attribute, must possess evidence or rely on a reasonable basis to 
substantiate the claim (see 16 CFR part 260, Guides for the Use of 
Environmental Marketing Claims). The Government will accept an offeror's 
claim of an item's environmental attribute on the basis of--
    (1) Participation in a Federal agency-sponsored program (e.g., the 
EPA and DOE ENERGY STAR[reg] product labeling program);
    (2) Verification by an independent organization that specializes in 
certifying such claims; or
    (3) Possession of competent and reliable evidence. For any test, 
analysis, research, study, or other evidence to be ``competent and 
reliable,'' it must have been conducted and evaluated in an objective 
manner by persons qualified to do so, using procedures generally 
accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results.

                         Cancellation (SEP 1999)

    Either party may cancel this contract in whole or in part by 
providing written notice. The cancellation will take effect 30 calendar 
days after the other party receives the notice of cancellation. If the 
Contractor elects to cancel this contract, the Government will not 
reimburse the minimum guarantee.

552.238-74  Industrial Funding Fee and Sales Reporting.

    As prescribed in 538.273(b)(1), insert the following clause:

         Industrial Funding Fee and Sales Reporting (JULY 2003)

    (a) Reporting of Federal Supply Schedule Sales. The Contractor shall 
report all contract sales under this contract as follows:
    (1) The Contractor shall accurately report the dollar value, in U.S. 
dollars and rounded to the nearest whole dollar, of all sales under this 
contract by calendar quarter (January 1-March 31, April 1-June 30, July 
1-September 30, and October 1-December 31). The dollar value of a sale 
is the price paid by the Schedule user for products and services on a 
Schedule task or delivery order. The reported contract sales value shall 
include the Industrial Funding Fee (IFF). The Contractor shall maintain 
a consistent accounting method of sales reporting, based on the 
Contractor's established commercial accounting practice. The acceptable 
points at which sales may be reported include--
    (i) Receipt of order;

[[Page 256]]

    (ii) Shipment or delivery, as applicable;
    (iii) Issuance of an invoice; or
    (iv) Payment.
    (2) Contract sales shall be reported to FSS within 30 calendar days 
following the completion of each reporting quarter. The Contractor shall 
continue to furnish quarterly reports, including ``zero'' sales, through 
physical completion of the last outstanding task order or delivery order 
of the contract.
    (3) Reportable sales under the contract are those resulting from 
sales of contract items to authorized users unless the purchase was 
conducted pursuant to a separate contracting authority such as a 
Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC); a separately awarded FAR 
Part 12, FAR Part 13, FAR Part 14, or FAR Part 15 procurement; or a non-
FAR contract. Sales made to state and local governments under 
Cooperative Purchasing authority shall be counted as reportable sales 
for IFF purposes.
    (4) The Contractor shall electronically report the quarterly dollar 
value of sales, including ``zero'' sales, by utilizing the automated 
reporting system at an Internet website designated by the General 
Services Administration (GSA)'s Federal Supply Service (FSS). Prior to 
using this automated system, the Contractor shall complete contract 
registration with the FSS Vendor Support Center (VSC). The website 
address, as well as registration instructions and reporting procedures, 
will be provided at the time of award. The Contractor shall report sales 
separately for each National Stock Number (NSN), Special Item Number 
(SIN), or sub-item.
    (5) The Contractor shall convert the total value of sales made in 
foreign currency to U.S. dollars using the ``Treasury Reporting Rates of 
Exchange'' issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Financial 
Management Service. The Contractor shall use the issue of the Treasury 
report in effect on the last day of the calendar quarter. The report is 
available from Financial Management Service, International Funds Branch, 
Telephone: (202) 874-7994, Internet: http://www.fms.treas.gov/intn.html.
    (b) The Contractor shall remit the IFF at the rate set by GSA's FSS.
    (1) The Contractor shall remit the IFF to FSS in U.S. dollars within 
30 calendar days after the end of the reporting quarter; final payment 
shall be remitted within 30 days after physical completion of the last 
outstanding task order or delivery order of the contract.
    (2) The IFF represents a percentage of the total quarterly sales 
reported. This percentage is set at the discretion of GSA's FSS. GSA's 
FSS has the unilateral right to change the percentage at any time, but 
not more than once per year. FSS will provide reasonable notice prior to 
the effective date of the change. The IFF reimburses FSS for the costs 
of operating the Federal Supply Schedules Program and recoups its 
operating costs from ordering activities. Offerors must include the IFF 
in their prices. The fee is included in the award price(s) and reflected 
in the total amount charged to ordering activities. FSS will post notice 
of the current IFF at http://72a.fss.gsa.gov/ or successor website as 
appropriate.
    (c) Within 60 days of award, an FSS representative will provide the 
Contractor with specific written procedural instructions on remitting 
the IFF. FSS reserves the unilateral right to change such instructions 
from time to time, following notification to the Contractor.
    (d) Failure to remit the full amount of the IFF within 30 calendar 
days after the end of the applicable reporting period constitutes a 
contract debt to the United States Government under the terms of FAR 
Subpart 32.6. The Government may exercise all rights under the Debt 
Collection Improvement Act of 1996, including withholding or setting off 
payments and interest on the debt (see FAR clause 52.232-17, Interest). 
Should the Contractor fail to submit the required sales reports, falsify 
them, or fail to timely pay the IFF, this is sufficient cause for the 
Government to terminate the contract for cause.

552.238-75  Price Reductions.

    As prescribed in 538.273(b)(2), insert the following clause:

                       Price Reductions (SEP 1999)

    (a) Before award of a contract, the Contracting Officer and the 
Offeror will agree upon (1) the customer (or category of customers) 
which will be the basis of award, and (2) the Government's price or 
discount relationship to the identified customer (or category of 
customers). This relationship shall be maintained through out the 
contract period. Any change in the Contractor's commercial pricing or 
discount arrangement applicable to the identified customer (or category 
of customers) which disturbs this relationship shall constitute a price 
reduction.
    (b) During the contract period, the Contractor shall report to the 
Contracting Officer all price reductions to the customer (or category of 
customers) that was the basis of award. The Contractor's report shall 
include an explanation of the conditions under which the reductions were 
made.
    (c)(1) A price reduction shall apply to purchases under this 
contract if, after the date negotiations conclude, the Contractor--
    (i) Revises the commercial catalog, pricelist, schedule or other 
document upon which

[[Page 257]]

contract award was predicated to reduce prices;
    (ii) Grants more favorable discounts or terms and conditions than 
those contained in the commercial catalog, pricelist, schedule or other 
documents upon which contract award was predicated; or
    (iii) Grants special discounts to the customer (or category of 
customers) that formed the basis of award, and the change disturbs the 
price/discount relationship of the Government to the customer (or 
category of customers) that was the basis of award.
    (2) The Contractor shall offer the price reduction to the Government 
with the same effective date, and for the same time period, as extended 
to the commercial customer (or category of customers).
    (d) There shall be no price reduction for sales--
    (1) To commercial customers under firm, fixed-price definite 
quantity contracts with specified delivery in excess of the maximum 
order threshold specified in this contract;
    (2) To Federal agencies; or
    (3) Caused by an error in quotation or billing, provided adequate 
documentation is furnished by the Contractor to the Contracting Officer.
    (e) The Contractor may offer the Contracting Officer a voluntary 
Governmentwide price reduction at any time during the contract period.
    (f) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any price 
reduction subject to this clause as soon as possible, but not later than 
15 calendar days after its effective date.
    (g) The contractor will be modified to reflect any price reduction 
which becomes applicable in accordance with this clause.

     Use of Federal Supply Schedule Contracts by Certain Entities--
                   Cooperative Purchasing (JULY 2003)

    (a) If an entity identified in paragraph (b) of the clause at 
552.238-78, Scope of Contract (Eligible Ordering Activities), elects to 
place an order under this contract, the entity agrees that the order 
shall be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) When the Contractor accepts an order from such an entity, a 
separate contract is formed which incorporates by reference all the 
terms and conditions of the Schedule contract except the Disputes 
clause, the patent indemnity clause, and the portion of the Commercial 
Item Contract Terms and Conditions that specifies ``Compliance with laws 
unique to Government contracts'' (which applies only to contracts with 
entities of the Executive branch of the U.S. Government). The parties to 
this new contract which incorporates the terms and conditions of the 
Schedule contract are the individual ordering activity and the 
Contractor. The U.S. Government shall not be liable for the performance 
or nonperformance of the new contract. Disputes which cannot be resolved 
by the parties to the new contract may be litigated in any State or 
Federal court with jurisdiction over the parties, applying Federal 
procurement law, including statutes, regulations and case law, and, if 
pertinent, the Uniform Commercial Code. To the extent authorized by law, 
parties to this new contract are encouraged to resolve disputes through 
Alternative Dispute Resolution.
    (2) Where contract clauses refer to action by a Contracting Officer 
or a Contracting Officer of GSA, that shall mean the individual 
responsible for placing the order for the ordering activity (e.g., FAR 
52.212-4 at paragraph (f) and FSS clause I-FSS-249 B.)
    (3) As a condition of using this contract, eligible ordering 
activities agree to abide by all terms and conditions of the Schedule 
contract, except for those deleted clauses or portions of clauses 
mentioned in paragraph (a)(1) of this clause. Ordering activities may 
include terms and conditions required by statute, ordinance, regulation 
or order as a part of a statement of work (SOW) or statement of 
objective (SOO) to the extent that these terms and conditions do not 
conflict with the terms and conditions of the Schedule contract. The 
ordering activity and the Contractor expressly acknowledge that, in 
entering into an agreement for the ordering activity to purchase goods 
or services from the Contractor, neither the ordering activity nor the 
Contractor will look to, primarily or in any secondary capacity, or file 
any claim against the United States or any of its agencies with respect 
to any failure of performance by the other party.
    (4) The ordering activity is responsible for all payments due the 
Contractor under the contract formed by acceptance of the ordering 
activity's order, without recourse to the agency of the U.S. Government, 
which awarded the Schedule contract.
    (5) The Contractor is encouraged, but not obligated, to accept 
orders from such entities. The Contractor may, within 5 days of receipt 
of the order, decline to accept any order, for any reason. The 
Contractor shall fulfill orders placed by such entities, which are not 
declined within the 5-day period.

[[Page 259]]

    (6) The supplies or services purchased will be used for governmental 
purposes only and will not be resold for personal use. Disposal of 
property acquired will be in accordance with the established procedures 
of the ordering activity for the disposal of personal property.
    (b) If the Schedule Contractor accepts an order from an entity 
identified in paragraph (b) of the clause at 552.238-78, Scope of 
Contract (Eligible Ordering Activities), the Contractor agrees to the 
following conditions:
    (1) The ordering activity is responsible for all payments due the 
Contractor for the contract formed by acceptance of the order, without 
recourse to the agency of the U.S. Government, which awarded the 
Schedule contract.
    (2) The Contractor is encouraged, but not obligated, to accept 
orders from such entities. The Contractor may, within 5 days of receipt 
of the order, decline to accept any order, for any reason. The 
contractor shall decline the order using the same means as those used to 
place the order. The Contractor shall fulfill orders placed by such 
entities, which are not declined within the 5-day period.
    (c) In accordance with clause 552.238-74, Industrial Funding Fee and 
Sales Reporting, the Contractor must report the quarterly dollar value 
of all sales under this contract. When submitting sales reports, the 
contractor must report two dollar values for each Special Item Number: 
(1) the dollar value for sales to entities identified in paragraph (a) 
of the clause at 552.238-78, Scope of Contract (Eligible Ordering 
Activities), and (2) the dollar value for sales to entities identified 
in paragraph (b) of clause 552.238-78.

representative.
    (ii) For proposals in excess of $5,000, the claim for equitable 
adjustment shall be submitted in the form of a lump sum proposal

                     Overhead, Profit and Commission

    (2) The allowable overhead shall be determined in accordance with 
the contract cost principles and procedures in Part 31 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 31) in effect on the date of this 
contract. The percentages for profit and commission shall be negotiated 
and may vary according to the nature, extent and complexity of the work 
involved, but in no case shall exceed the following unless the 
Contractor demonstrates entitlement to a higher percentage:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                     Profit         Commission
                                                           Overhead                (percent)        (percent)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Contractor on work performed by other than  ...............................  ...............              10
 his own forces.
To first tier subcontractor on work performed  ...............................  ...............              10
 by his subcontractors.
To Contractor and/or the subcontractors for    To be Negotiated...............              10   ...............
 that portion of the work performed with
 their respective forces.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Not more than four percentages will be allowed regardless of the 
number of tier subcontractors. The Contractor shall not be allowed a 
commission on the commission received by a first tier subcontractor. 
Equitable adjustments for deleted work shall include credits for 
overhead, profit and commission. On proposals covering both increases 
and decreases in the amount of the contract, the application of overhead 
and profit shall be on the net change in direct costs for the Contractor 
or subcontractor performing the work.
    (3) The Contractor shall submit with the proposal his request for 
time extension (if any), and shall include sufficient information and 
dates to demonstrate whether and to what extent the change will delay 
the contract in its entirety.
    (4) In considering a proposal, the Government shall make check 
estimates in detail, utilizing unit prices where specified or agreed 
upon, with a view to arriving at an equitable adjustment.
    (5) After receipt of a proposal the Contracting Officer shall act 
thereon, within 30 days; provided however, that when the necessity to 
proceed with a change does not allow time properly to check a proposal 
or in the event of failure to reach an agreement on a proposal, the 
Government may order the Contractor to proceed on the basis of price to 
be determined at the earliest practicable date. Such price shall not be 
more than the increase or less than the decrease proposed.
    (6) If a mutually acceptable agreement cannot be reached, the 
Contracting Officer may determine the price unilaterally.
    (b) The provisions of the ``Differing Site Conditions'' clause 
prescribed by FAR 52.236-2 are supplemented as follows: The Contractor 
shall submit all claims for equitable adjustment in accordance with, and 
subject to the requirements and limitations set out in paragraph (a) of 
this ``Equitable Adjustments'' clause.

<R05>
552.246-17  Warranty of Supplies of a Noncomplex Nature

    As prescribed in 546.710(a), insert the following clause:

 Warranty of Supplies of a Noncomplex Nature (DEC 1990) (Deviation FAR 
                               52.246-17)

    (a) Definitions. ``Acceptance,'' as used in this clause, means the 
act of an authorized representative of the Government by which the 
Government assumes for itself, or as an agent of another, ownership of 
existing supplies, or approves specific services as partial or complete 
performance of the contract.

[[Page 262]]

    ``Correction,'' as used in this clause, means the elimination of a 
defect.
    ``Supplies,'' as used in this clause, means the end item furnished 
by the Contractor and related services required under the contract. The 
word does not include ``data.''
    (b) Contractor's obligations.
    (1) Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government of 
supplies furnished under this contract, or any condition of this 
contract concerning the conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor warrants 
that for --------*--------
    (i) All supplies furnished under this contract will be free from 
defects in material or workmanship and will conform with the 
requirements of this contract; and
    (ii) The preservation, packaging, packing, and marking, and the 
preparation for, and method of, shipment of such applies will conform 
with the requirements of this contract.
    (2) When return, correction, or replacement is required, the 
Contractor shall be responsible for all costs attendant to the return, 
correction or replacement of the nonconforming supplies. Any removal in 
connection with the above shall be done by the Contractor at its 
expense. However, the Contractor's liability for the transportation 
charges shall not exceed an amount equal to the cost of transportation 
by the usual commercial method of shipment between the place of delivery 
specified in the contract and the Contractor's plant, and return.
    (3) Any supplies or parts thereof, corrected or furnished in 
replacement under this clause, shall also be subject to the terms of 
this clause to the same extent as supplies initially delivered. The 
warranty, with respect to supplies or parts thereof, shall be equal in 
duration to that in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause and shall run from 
the date of delivery of the corrected or replaced supplies.
    (4) All implied warranties of merchantability and ``fitness for a 
particular purpose'' are excluded from any obligation contained in this 
contract.
    (c) Remedies available to the Government.
    (1) The Contracting Officer shall give written notice to the 
Contractor of any breach of warranties in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
clause with --------*--------. This notice shall contain information 
concerning the deficiencies found, the location of the nonconforming 
supplies, and the quantity involved.
    (2) Within a reasonable time after the notice, the Contracting 
Officer may either--
    (i) Require, by written notice, the prompt correction or replacement 
of any supplies or parts thereof (including preservation, packaging, 
packing, and marking) that do not conform with the requirements of this 
contract within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this clause; or
    (ii) Retain such supplies and reduce the contract price by an amount 
equitable under the circumstances. When the nature of the defect in the 
nonconforming item is such that the defect affects an entire batch or 
lot of material, then the equitable price adjustment shall apply to the 
entire batch or lot of material from which the nonconforming item was 
taken.
    (3)(i) If the contract provides for inspection of supplies by 
sampling procedures, conformance of supplies or components subject to 
warranty action shall be determined by the applicable sampling 
procedures in the contract. The Contracting Officer--
    (A) May, for sampling purposes, group any supplies delivered under 
this contract;
    (B) Shall require the size of the sample to be that required by 
sampling procedures specified in the contract for the quantity of 
supplies on which warranty action is proposed;
    (C) May project warranty sampling results over supplies in the same 
shipment or other supplies contained in other shipments even though all 
of such supplies are not present at the point of reinspection; provided, 
that the supplies remaining are reasonably representative of the 
quantity on which warranty action is proposed; and
    (D) Need not use the same lot size as on original inspection or 
reconstitute the original inspection lots.
    (ii) Within a reasonable time after notice of any breach of the 
warranties specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Contracting 
Officer may exercise one or more of the following options:
    (A) Require an equitable adjustment in the contract price for any 
group of supplies.
    (B) Screen the supplies grouped for warranty action under this 
clause at the Contractor's expense and return all nonconforming supplies 
to the Contractor for correction or replacement.
    (C) Require the Contractor to screen the supplies at locations 
designated by the Government within the continental United States and to 
correct or replace all nonconforming supplies.
    (D) Return the supplies grouped for warranty action under this 
clause to the Contractor (irrespective of the f.o.b. point or the point 
of acceptance) for screening and correction or replacement. All costs 
incurred by the Government in returning the nonconforming supplies, 
including costs to the freight carrier resulting from the Contractor's 
refusal to accept their return, shall be for the Contractor's account.
    (4)(i) The Contracting Officer may, by contract or otherwise, 
correct or replace the nonconforming supplies with similar supplies from 
another source and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned to the 
Government thereby if the Contractor--
    (A) Fails to make redelivery of the corrected or replaced supplies 
within the time established for their return; or

[[Page 263]]

    (B) Fails either to accept return of the nonconforming supplies or 
fails to make progress after their return to correct or replace them so 
as to endanger performance of the delivery schedule, and in either of 
these circumstances does not cure such failure within a period of 10 
days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in 
writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying 
such failure.
    (ii) Instead of correction or replacement by the Government, the 
Contracting Officer may require an equitable adjustment of the contract 
price for all nonconforming supplies, including batch or lot materials 
which either have been consumed or other disposition has been made. In 
addition, if the Contractor fails to furnish timely disposition 
instructions, the Contracting Officer may return the supplies for 
screening and correction or replacement under subparagraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) 
above; store the nonconforming supplies for the Contractor's account; 
sell the nonconforming supplies to the highest bidder on the open market 
and apply the proceeds against the accumulated storage and other costs, 
including the cost of the sale; or otherwise dispose of the 
nonconforming supplies for the Contractor's account in a reasonable 
manner. The Government is entitled to reimbursement from the Contractor, 
or from the proceeds of such disposal, for the reasonable expenses of 
the care and disposition of the nonconforming supplies, as well as for 
excess costs incurred or to be incurred.
    (5) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this 
clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the 
Government by any other clause of this contract.
    (6) Unless otherwise provided, this warranty is applicable both 
within and outside the continental limits of the United States.
    (7) In addition to other marking requirements of this contract, the 
Contractor shall stamp or mark the supplies delivered or otherwise 
furnish notice with the supplies of the existence of the warranty. The 
marking should briefly include (i) a statement that the warranty exists, 
(ii) the substance of the warranty, (iii) its duration, and (iv) whom to 
notify if the supplies are found to be defective.

                             (End of clause)

    * State the specific period of time after delivery or the specified 
event whose occurrence will terminate the warranty period; e.g., the 
number of miles or hours of use, or combination of any applicable event 
or periods of time.
    ** Insert specific period of time; e.g., ``45 days from the last 
delivery under this contract,'' or ``45 days after discovery of the 
defect.'' The number of days specified shall be no less than 30.
    Alternate I (DEC 1990). As prescribed in 546.710(a)(1), substitute 
the following for paragraph (b)(1) of the basic clause and delete 
paragraph (b)(4) of the basic clause.

    (1) Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government of 
supplies furnished under this contract, or any condition of this 
contract concerning the conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor warrants 
that for --------*-------- all supplies furnished--
    (i) Are of a quality to pass without objection in the trade under 
the contract description;
    (ii) Are fit for the ordinary purposes for which the supplies are 
used;
    (iii) Are within the variations permitted by the contract, and are 
of an even kind, quality, and quantity within each unit and among all 
units;
    (iv) Are adequately contained, packaged, and marked as the contract 
may require; and
    (v) Conform to the promises or affirmations of fact made on the 
container.

    Alternate II (DEC 1990). As prescribed in 546.710(a)(2), substitute 
the following paragraph for paragraph (b)(1) of the basic clause:

    (1) Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government of 
supplies furnished under this contract, or any condition of this 
contract concerning the conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor warrants 
that for --------*-------- all supplies furnished--
    (i) Conform to the specifications except that in the case of solvent 
systems, the viscosity may exceed the specified maximum by 10 Kreb 
Units, unless otherwise specified elsewhere in this contract; and
    (ii) Are suitable for their intended purpose as stated in this 
contact.

    Alternate III (DEC 1990). As prescribed in 546.710(a)(3), substitute 
the following for paragraph (b)(1) of the basic clause, redesignate 
paragraph (c) of the basic clause as paragraph (d), and add the 
following as paragraph (c) in the basic clause:

    (1) Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government of 
supplies furnished under this contract, or any condition of this 
contract concerning the conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor warrants 
that for --------*--------, beginning with the first day of the first 
full month following the month of manufacture marked on the container, 
all supplies furnished retain their original characteristics to the 
extent that the supplies remain suitable for the intended use as stated 
in this contract (i) under actual

[[Page 264]]

application conditions or (ii) when tested in accordance with 
requirements stated elsewhere in this contract.
    (c) Government surveillance and testing.
    (1) During this period, surveillance will be maintained on supplies 
warehoused in Government facilities; and the supplies will be tested 
periodically to determine their suitability for intended use. Sampling 
for surveillance testing will be in accordance with Military Standard 
No. 105, and such testing will be made after NORMAL MIXING, STIRRING, OR 
SHAKING, in accordance with directions either furnished with the 
supplies or as shown in the applicable specifications.
    (2) Surveillance testing will be based on storage stability 
requirements set forth in the contract specification, or purchase 
description on the basis of salient characteristics (e.g., viscosity or 
sag flow, curing time, strip adhesion or tensile shear, etc.) 
established by GSA as appropriate to determine suitability for intended 
use. In the case of brand name items not covered by detailed purchase 
descriptions, surveillance testing may be based on salient 
characteristics included in the manufacturer's data sheets. If storage 
stability requirements showing allowable variations are not included in 
applicable specifications or elsewhere in the contract, material will be 
considered suitable for intended use if the salient characteristics vary 
not more than 20 percent from the originally specified values (i.e., 
those applicable to acceptance testing of the supplies) for noncritical 
end-use items, and not more then 10 percent for critical end-use items.

552.246-70  Source Inspection by Quality Approved Manufacturer.

    As prescribed in 546.302-70, insert the following clause:

      Source Inspection by Quality Approved Manufacturer (SEP 1999)

    (a) Inspection system and inspection facilities.
    (1) The inspection system maintained by the Contractor under the 
Inspection of Supplies--Fixed Price clause (FAR 52.246-2) of this 
contract shall be maintained throughout the contract period and shall 
comply with all requirements of editions in effect on the date of the 
solicitation of either Federal Standard 368 or the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 9001 (ANSI/ASQC Q 91) 
(Quality Systems--Model for Quality Assurance in Design/Development, 
Production, Installation and Servicing), or ISO Standard 9002 (ANSI/ASQC 
Q 92) (Quality Systems--Model for Quality Assurance in Production and 
Installation). The ISO 9000 family of standards is a set of worldwide 
standards used to document, implement and demonstrate quality assurance 
systems. When using the ISO option the Contractor's quality system must 
be registered by a third party registrar accredited by either the 
Registrar Accreditation Board (RAB) or an organization recognized as 
equivalent. A written description of the inspection system shall be made 
available to the Government before contract award. The Contractor shall 
immediately notify the Contracting Officer and the designated GSA 
quality assurance office of any changes made in the inspection system 
during the contract period. As used herein, the term ``inspection 
system'' means the Contractor's own facility or any other facility 
acceptable to the Government that will be used to perform inspections or 
tests of materials and components before incorporation into end articles 
and for inspection of such end articles before shipment. When the 
manufacturing plant is located outside of the United States, the 
Contractor shall arrange delivery of the items from a plant or warehouse 
located in the United States (including Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands) equipped to perform all inspections and tests required by the 
contract or specifications to evidence conformance therewith, or shall 
arrange with a testing laboratory or other facility in the United 
States, acceptable to the Government, to perform the required 
inspections and tests.
    (2) In addition to the requirements in Federal Standard 368, ISO 
9001 or ISO 9002 records shall include the date when inspection and 
testing were performed. These records shall be available for (i) 3 years 
after final payment; or (ii) 4 years from the end of the Contractor's 
fiscal year in which the record was created, whichever period expires 
first.
    (3) Offerors are required to specify, in the space provided 
elsewhere in this solicitation, the name and address of each 
manufacturing plant or other facility where supplies will be available 
for inspection, indicating the item number(s) to which each applies.
    (4) Within 10 calendar days after receipt of the written notice of 
award, the Contractor shall provide the Administrative Contracting 
Officer with the name of the individual and an alternate that will be 
responsible for inspecting each shipment under this contract.
    (b) Inspection and receiving reports.
    (1) For each shipment released, one of the officials named by the 
Contractor under paragraph (a)(4) above shall sign a Quality Approved 
Manufacturer Certificate certifying that supplies have been inspected 
and found to comply with contract requirements. The certification shall 
read as follows:
    ``I certify that all items in this shipment have been listed herein, 
and have been inspected and found to comply with all requirements of the 
contract.''

[[Page 265]]

                    Signature of Certifying Official

    (2) For shipments made to military facilities, the Contractor shall 
prepare and distribute the DD Form 250, Material Inspection and 
Receiving Report, or computer formatted equivalent of the form not later 
than the close of business the workday following shipment. The 
certification above shall be placed in block 16 on this form. The 
Contractor will be provided a supply of the DD Form 250 with complete 
instructions for preparation and distribution.
    (3) For shipments made to civilian facilities only, the Contractor 
shall prepare and distribute not later than the close of business the 
workday following shipment a certification of inspection and conformance 
for the identified items, in accordance with instructions furnished at 
the time of award. The Contractor may furnish the requisite information 
on the DD Form 250 or computer formatted equivalent, company letterhead, 
or invoice document.
    (c) Inspection by Government personnel.
    (1) Although the Government will normally rely upon the Contractor's 
certification as to the quality of supplies shipped, it reserves the 
right under the Inspection of Supplies--Fixed Price clause to inspect 
and test all supplies called for by this contract, before acceptance, at 
all times and places, including the point of manufacture. When the 
Government notifies the Contractor of its intent to inspect supplies 
before shipment, the Contractor shall notify or arrange for 
subcontractors to notify the designated GSA quality assurance office 7 
workdays before the date when supplies will be ready for inspection. 
Shipment shall not be made until inspection by the Government is 
completed and shipment is authorized by the Government.
    (2) Government inspection responsibility will be assigned the GSA 
quality assurance office which has jurisdiction over the State in which 
the Contractor's or subcontractor's plant or other designated point for 
inspection is located.
    (3) During the contract period, a Government representative may 
periodically select samples of supplies produced under this contract for 
verification inspection and testing. Samples sent to a Government 
testing facility will be disposed of as follows: Samples from an 
accepted lot, not damaged in the testing process, will be returned 
promptly to the Contractor after completion of tests. Samples damages in 
the testing process will be disposed of as requested by the Contractor. 
Samples from a rejected lot will be returned to the Contractor or 
disposed of in a time and manner agreeable to both the Contractor and 
the Government.
    (d) Quality deficiencies.
    (1) Notwithstanding any other clause of this contract concerning the 
conclusiveness of acceptance by the Government, any supplies or 
production lots shipped under this contract found to be defective in 
material or workmanship, or otherwise not in conformity with the 
requirements of this contract within a period of --------*-------- 
months after acceptance shall, at the Government's option, be replaced, 
repaired or otherwise corrected by the Contractor at no cost to the 
Government within 30 calendar days (or such longer period as the 
Government may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice to replace 
or correct. The Contractor shall remove, at its expense, supplies 
rejected or required to be replaced, repaired or corrected. When the 
nature of the defect affects an entire batch or lot of supplies, and the 
Contracting Officer determines that correction can best be accomplished 
by retaining the nonconforming supplies and reducing the contract price 
by an amount equitable under the circumstances, then the equitable price 
adjustment shall apply to the entire batch or lot of supplies from which 
the nonconforming item was taken.
    (2) If supplies in process, shipped, or awaiting shipment to fill 
Government orders are found not to comply with contract requirements, or 
if deficiencies in either plant quality or process controls are found, 
the Contractor may be issued a Quality Deficiency Notice (QDN). Upon 
receipt of a QDN, the Contractor shall take immediate corrective action 
and shall suspend shipment of the supplies covered by the QDN until such 
time as corrective action has been completed. The Contractor shall 
notify the GSA quality assurance office, within 5 workdays, of 
corrective action taken or to be taken to permit on site verification by 
a Government representative. Shipments of nonconforming supplies will be 
returned at the Contractor's expense and may constitute cause for 
termination. Delays due to the insurance of a QDN do not constitute 
excusable delay under the Default clause. Failure to complete corrective 
action in a timely manner may result in termination of this contract.
    (3) This contract may be terminated for default if subsequent 
Government inspection discloses that plant quality or process controls 
are not being maintained, supplies which do not meet the requirements of 
the specification are being shipped, or there is failure to comply with 
any other requirement of this clause.
    (e) Additional cost for inspection and testing. The Contractor will 
be charged for any additional cost of inspection/testing or 
reinspecting/retesting supplies for the reasons stated in paragraph (e) 
of FAR 52.246-2, Inspection of Supplies--Fixed Price. When inspection or 
testing is performed by or under the direction of GSA, charges will be 
at the rate of $--------*-------- per man-hour or fraction thereof if 
the inspection is at a GSA distribution center; $--------*-------- per

[[Page 266]]

man-hour or fraction thereof, plus travel costs incurred, if the 
inspection is at any other location; and $--------*-------- per man-hour 
or fraction thereof for laboratory testing, except that when a testing 
facility other than a GSA laboratory performs all or part of the 
required tests, the Contractor shall be assessed the actual cost 
incurred by the Government as a result of testing at such facility. When

agreement, or other written communication from the carrier(s) quoting 
the rates/charges that would have applied for shipments to the standard 
contract destination.
    (2) If (i) shipments to the new destination are made by the 
Contractor's owned or leased trucks or (ii) shipments to the original 
destination were or would have been made by the Contractor's owned or 
leased trucks, the Government shall determine the adjustment by 
substituting a rate equal to 70 percent of the lowest applicable rate 
published in common carrier rates as of the date of shipment for the 
Contractor's actual rate or contemplated transportation costs.
    (d) If the copies of paid freight bills for a diverted shipment do 
not show, or make readily available, each of the following items,the 
Contractor shall supply a written statement showing the item(s):
    (1) Full name of each carrier in the routing.
    (2) Number of containers.
    (3) Gross shipping weight.

    ``Discussions'' are negotiations that occur after establishment of 
the competitive range that may, at the contracting Officer's discretion, 
result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal.
    ``In Writing'' or ``Written'' means any worded or numbered 
expression which can be read, reproduced, and later communicated,

[[Page 271]]

and includes electronically transmitted and stored information.
    ``Proposal modification'' is a change made to a proposal before the 
solicitation's closing date and time, or made in response to an 
amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award.
    ``Proposal revision'' is a change to a proposal made after the 
solicitation closing date, at the request of as allowed by a Contracting 
Officer as the result or of negotiations.
    ``Time,'' if stated as a number of days, is calculated using 
calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, 
Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a 
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the 
next working day.
    (b) Amendments to solicitations. If this solicitation is amended, 
all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors 
shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the 
date and time specified in the amendment(s).
    (c) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.
    (1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) 
are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to 
proposals shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or 
packages. Offers must be:
    (i) Submitted on the forms prescribed and furnished by the 
Government as a part of this solicitation or on copies of those forms, 
and
    (ii) Signed. The person signing an offer must initial each erasure 
or change appearing on any offer form. If the offeror is a partnership, 
the names of the partners composing the firm must be included with the 
offer.
    (2) Late proposals and revisions.
    (i) The Government will not consider any proposal received at the 
office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for 
receipt of offers unless it is received before the Government makes 
award and it meets at least one of the following conditions:
    (A) It was sent by registered or certified mail not later than the 
5th calendar day before the date specified for receipt of offers (e.g., 
an offer submitted in response to solicitation requiring receipt of 
offers by the 20th of the month must have been mailed by the 15th).
    (B) It was sent by mail (or telegram or facsimile, if authorized) or 
hand-carried (including delivery by a commercial carrier) if it is 
determined by the Government that the late receipt was due primarily to 
Government mishandling after receipt at the Government installation.
    (C) It was sent by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day 
Service-Post Office to Addressee, not later than 5:00 p.m. at the place 
of mailing two working days prior to the date specified for receipt of 
proposals. The term ``working days'' excludes weekends and U.S. Federal 
holidays.
    (D) It was transmitted through an electronic commerce method 
authorized by the solicitation and was received at the initial point of 
entry of the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one 
working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals.
    (E) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received 
at the activity designated for receipt of offers and was under the 
Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers, and 
the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would 
not unduly delay the procurement.
    (F) It is the only proposal received.
    (ii) Any modification or revision of a proposal or response to 
request for information, including any final proposal revision, is 
subject to the same conditions as in subparagraphs (c)(2)(i)(A) through 
(c)(2)(i)(E) of this provision.
    (iii) The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing 
of a late proposal or modification or revision sent either by registered 
or certified mail is the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service postmark both 
on the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. or 
Canadian Postal Service. Both postmarks must show a legible date or the 
proposal, response to a request for information, or modification or 
revision shall be processed as if mailed late. ``Postmark'' means a 
printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of a postage 
meter machine impression) that is readily identifiable without further 
action as having been supplied and affixed by employees of the U.S. or 
Canadian Postal Service on the date of mailing. Therefore, offerors or 
respondents should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand 
cancellation bull's eye postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or 
wrapper.
    (iv) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the 
Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that 
installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of 
receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements 
of Government personnel.
    (v) The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of

[[Page 272]]

(c)(2)(iii) of this provision, excluding postmarks of the Canadian 
Postal Service. Therefore, offerors or respondents should request the 
postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation bull's eye postmark on 
both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.
    (vi) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this provision, a late 
modification or revision of an otherwise successful proposal that makes 
its terms more favorable to the Government will be considered at any 
time it is received and may be accepted.
    (vii) An offeror may withdraw its proposal by written notice or 
telegram (including mailgram) received at any time before award. If the 
solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, an offeror may withdraw its 
proposal via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the 
conditions specified in the provision entitled ``Facsimile Proposals.'' 
Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized 
representative, if the representative's identity is made known and the 
representative signs a receipt for the proposal before award.
    (viii) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal 
Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office 
designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the 
solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of 
the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, 
the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be 
extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the 
first work day on which normal Government processes resume. If no time 
is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., 
local time, for the designated Government office.
    (3) Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning this 
solicitation will be furnished promptly to all other prospective 
offerors, if that information is necessary in submitting offers or if 
the lack of it would be prejudicial to any other prospective offeror.
    (4) Offerors may submit modifications to their proposals at any time 
before the solicitation closing date and time, and may submit 
modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at 
any time before award.
    (5) Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or 
allowed by the Contracting Officer.
    (6) The Government will construe an offer to be in full and complete 
with this solicitation unless the offer describes any deviation in the 
offer.
    (7) Offerors may submit proposals that depart from stated 
requirements. Such a proposal shall clearly identify why the acceptance 
of the proposal would be advantageous to the Government. The proposal 
must clearly identify and explicitly define any deviations from the 
terms and conditions of the solicitation, as well as the comparative 
advantage to the Government. The Government reserves the right to amend 
the solicitation to allow all offerors an opportunity to submit revised 
proposals based on the revised requirements.
    (d) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. An offeror that 
includes in its proposal data that it does not want disclosed to the 
public for any purpose, or use by the Government except for evaluation 
purposes, must meet both of the following conditions:
    (1) Mark the title page with the following legend:
    This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the 
Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed--in whole or 
in part--for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, 
however, a lease is awarded to this offeror as a result of--or in 
connection with--the submission of this data, the Government shall have 
the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided 
in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the 
Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is 
obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to 
this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other 
identification of sheets].
    (2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following 
legend:
    Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the 
restriction on the title page of this proposal.
    (e) Lease award.
    (1) The Government intends to award a lease resulting from this 
solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the 
best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and 
subfactors in the solicitation.
    (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is 
in the Government's interest.
    (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities 
in proposals received.
    (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a lease 
after conducting discussions with offerors whose proposals have been 
determined to be within the competitive range. If the Contracting 
Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be 
in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient 
competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the 
number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that 
will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated 
proposals. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the 
offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

[[Page 273]]

    (5) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not 
constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
    (6) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if 
the price proposed are materially unbalanced between line terms or 
subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable 
total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is 
significantly overstated or understand as indicated by the application 
of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the 
Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an 
unacceptable risk to the Government.
    (7) The unconditional written acceptance of an offer establishes a 
valid contract.
    (8) The Government may disclose the following information in 
postaward debriefings to other offerors:
    (i) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the 
successful offeror;
    (ii) The overall making of all offerors, when any making was 
developed by the agency during source selection; and
    (iii) A summary of the rationale for award.

                           (End of provision)

    Alternate I (MAR 1998). As prescribed in 570.602, substitute the 
following paragraph for paragraph (c)(2)(i) of the basic provision:

    (i) Any offer received at the office designated in the solicitation 
after the exact time specified for receipt of final proposal revisions 
will not be considered unless it is received before award is made and it 
meets one of the following conditions--

    Alternate II (MAR 1998). As prescribed in 570.602, substitute the 
following paragraph for paragraph (e)(4) of the basic provision:

    (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a lease 
without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in 
FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain 
the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. 
The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the 
Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the 
Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would 
otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an 
efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may 
limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest 
number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly 
rated proposals.

Officer has discretion to accept alternatives to certain architectural 
characteristics and safety features defined elsewhere in this

building and they meet the above criteria, the Government will award to 
the lowest priced historic property offered.

date, the Government may by notice to the Lessor terminate this lease. 
Such termination is effective when received by Lessor. The Lessor and 
the Lessor's sureties, if any, are jointly and severally liable for any 
damages to the Government resulting from such termination, as provided 
in this clause. The Government is entitled to the following damages:
    (1) The Government's aggregate rent, estimated real estate tax, and 
operating cost adjustments for the firm term and all option terms of its 
replacement lease or leases, in excess of the aggregate rent and 
estimated real estate tax and operating cost adjustments for the term. 
If the Government procures replacement premises for a term (including 
all option terms) in excess of this lease term, the Lessor is not liable 
for excess Government rent or adjustments during such excess lease term.
    (2) All administrative and other costs the Government incurs in 
procuring a replacement lease or leases.
    (3) Other, additional relief provided for in this lease, at law, or 
in equity.

[[Page 278]]

    (b) Damages to which the Government is entitled under this clause 
are due and payable thirty (30) days following the date Lessor receives 
notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such damages.
    (c) Delivery by Lessor of less than the minimum usable square 
footage required by this lease shall in no event be construed as 
substantial completion, except as the Contracting Officer permits.
    (d) The Government shall not terminate this lease under this clause 
nor charge the Lessor with damages under this clause, if (1) the delay 
in substantially completing the work arises from excusable delays, and 
(2) the Lessor within 10 days from the beginning of any such delay 
(unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer) provides notice 
to the Contracting Officer of the causes of delay. The Contracting 
Officer shall ascertain the facts and the extent of delay. If the facts 
warrant, the Contracting Officer shall extend the delivery date, to the 
extent of such delay at no additional costs to the Government. A time 
extension is the sole remedy of the Lessor.

                             (End of clause)

552.270-19  Progressive Occupancy.

    As prescribed in 570.603, insert the following clause:

                    Progressive Occupancy (SEP 1999)

    The Government shall have the right to elect to occupy the space in 
partial increments prior to the substantial completion of the entire 
leased premises, and the Lessor agrees to schedule its work so as to 
deliver the space incrementally as elected by the Government. The 
Government shall pay rent commencing with the first business day 
following substantial completion of the entire leased premise unless the 
Government has elected to occupy the leased premises incrementally. In 
case of incremental occupancy, the Government shall pay rent pro rata 
upon the first business day following substantial completion of each 
incremental unit. Rental payments shall become due on the first workday 
of the month following the month in which an increment of space is 
substantially complete, except that should an increment of space be 
substantially completed after the fifteenth day of the month, the 
payment due date will be the first workday of the second month following 
the month in which it was substantially complete. The commencement date 
of the firm lease term will be a complete determined from all rent 
commencement dates.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
552.270-20  Payment.

    As prescribed in 570.603, insert the following clause:

                           Payment (SEP 1999)

    (a) When space is offered and accepted, usable square footage 
delivered will be confirmed by either:
    (1) The Government's measurement of plans submitted by the 
successful offeror as approved by the Government, and an inspection of 
the space to verify that the delivered space conforms with such plans.
    (2) A mutual on-site measurement of the space if the Contracting 
Officer determines it necessary.
    (b) The Government will not pay for space in excess of the amount of 
usable square footage stated in the lease.
    (c) If the amount of usable square footage delivered is less than 
the amount agreed to in the lease, the lease will be modified to reflect 
the amount of usable space delivered and the annual rental will be 
adjusted as follows:
    Usable square feet (USF) not delivered multiplied by one plus the 
common area factor (CAF), multiplied by the rate per rentable square 
foot (RSF). That is:

USF x (1+CAF) x Rate per RSF = Reduction in Annual Rent.

                             (End of clause)

    As prescribed in 570.603, insert the following clause:

              Effect of Acceptance and Occupancy (SEP 1999)

    Neither the Government's acceptance of the premises for occupancy, 
nor the Government's occupancy thereof, shall be construed as a waiver 
of any requirement of or right of the Government under this Lease, or as 
otherwise prejudicing the Government with respect to any such 
requirement or right.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
552.270-22  Default by Lessor During the Term.

              Default By Lessor During the Term (SEP 1999)

    (a) Each of the following shall constitute a default by Lessor under 
this lease:

[[Page 279]]

    (1) Failure to maintain, repair, operate or service the premises as 
and when specified in this lease, or failure to perform any other 
requirement of this lease as and when required provided any such failure 
shall remain uncured for a period of thirty (30) days next following 
Lessor's receipt of notice thereof from the Contracting Officer or an 
authorized representative.
    (2) Repeated and unexcused failure by Lessor to comply with one or 
more requirements of this lease shall constitute a default 
notwithstanding that one or all such failures shall have been timely 
cured pursuant to this clause.
    (b) If a default occurs, the Government may, by notice to Lessor, 
terminate this lease for default and if so terminated, the Government 
shall be entitled to the damages specified in the Default in Delivery-
Time Extensions clause.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
552.270-23  Subordination, Nondisturbance and Attornment.

    As prescribed in 570.603, insert the following clause:

         Subordination, Nondisturbance and Attornment (SEP 1999)

    (a) Lessor warrants that it holds such title to or other interest in 
the premises and other property as is necessary to the Government's 
access to the premises and full use and enjoyment thereof in accordance 
with the provisions of this lease. Government agrees, in consideration 
of the warranties and conditions set forth in this clause, that this 
lease is subject and subordinate to any and all recorded mortgages, 
deeds of trust and other liens now or hereafter existing or imposed upon 
the premises, and to any renewal, modification or extension thereof. It 
is the intention of the parties that this provision shall be self-
operative and that no further instrument shall be required to effect the 
present or subsequent subordination of this lease. Government agrees, 
however, within twenty (20) business days next following the Contracting 
Officer's receipt of a written demand, to execute such instruments as 
Lessor may reasonably request to evidence further the subordination of 
this lease to any existing or future mortgage, deed of trust or other 
security interest pertaining to the premises, and to any water, sewer or 
access easement necessary or desirable to serve the premises or 
adjoining property owned in whole or in part by Lessor if such easement 
does not interfere with the full enjoyment of any right granted the 
Government under this lease.
    (b) No such subordination, to either existing or future mortgages, 
deeds of trust or other lien or security instrument shall operate to 
affect adversely any right of the Government under this lease so long as 
the Government is not in default under this lease. Lessor will include 
in any future mortgage, deed of trust or other security instrument to 
which this lease becomes subordinate, or in a separate nondisturbance 
agreement, a provision to the foregoing effect. Lessor warrants that the 
holders of all notes or other obligations secured by existing mortgages, 
deeds of trust or other security instruments have consented to the 
provisions of this clause, and agrees to provide true copies of all such 
consents to the Contracting Officer promptly upon demand.
    (c) In the event of any sale of the premises or any portion thereof 
by foreclosure of the lien of any such mortgage, deed of trust or other 
security instrument, or the giving of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the 
Government will be deemed to have attorned to any purchaser, purchasers, 
transferee or transferees of the premises or any portion thereof and its 
or their successors and assigns, and any such purchasers and transferees 
will be deemed to have assumed all obligations of the Lessor under this 
lease, so as to establish direct privity of estate and contract between 
Government and such purchasers or transferees, with the same force, 
effect and relative priority in time and right as if the lease had 
initially been entered into between such purchasers or transferees and 
the Government; provided, further, that the Contracting Officer and such 
purchasers or transferees shall, with reasonable promptness following 
any such sale or deed delivery in lieu of foreclosure, execute all such 
revisions to this lease, or other writings, as shall be necessary to 
document the foregoing relationship.
    (d) None of the foregoing provisions may be deemed or construed to 
imply a waiver of the Government's rights as a sovereign.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
552.270-24  Statement of Lease.

    As prescribed in 570.603, insert the following clause:

                      Statement of Lease (SEP 1999)

    (a) The Contracting Officer will, within thirty (30) days next 
following the Contracting Officer's receipt of a joint written request 
from Lessor and a prospective lender or purchaser of the building, 
execute and deliver to Lessor a letter stating that the same is issued 
subject to the conditions stated in this clause and, if such is the 
case, that (1) the lease is in full force and effect; and (2) the date 
to which the rent and other charges have been paid in advance, if any; 
and (3) whether any notice of default has been issued.

[[Page 280]]

    (b) Letters issued pursuant to this clause are subject to the 
following conditions:
    (1) That they are based solely upon a reasonably diligent review of 
the Contracting Officer's lease file as of the date of issuance;
    (2) That the Government shall not be held liable because of any 
defect in or condition of the premises or building;
    (3) That the Contracting Officer does not warrant or represent that 
the premises or building comply with applicable Federal, State and local 
law; and
    (4) That the Lessor, and each prospective lender and purchaser are 
deemed to have constructive notice of such facts as would be 
ascertainable by reasonable prepurchase and precommitment inspection of 
the Premises and Building and by inquiry to appropriate Federal, State 
and local Government officials.

                             (End of clause)

    The Government may, at any time and from time to time, substitute 
any Government agency or agencies for the Government agency or agencies, 
if any, named in the lease.

                          No Waiver (SEP 1999)

    No failure by either party to insist upon the strict performance of 
any provision of this lease or to exercise any right or remedy 
consequent upon a breach thereof, and no acceptance of full or partial 
rent or other performance by either party during the continuance of any 
such breach shall constitute a waiver of any such breach of such 
provision.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
552.270-27  Integrated Agreement.

    As prescribed in 570.603, insert the following clause:

                     Integrated Agreement (SEP 1999)

    This Lease, upon execution, contains the entire agreement of the 
parties and no prior written or oral agreement, express or implied, 
shall be admissible to contradict the provisions of the Lease.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
552.270-28  Mutuality of Obligation.

    As prescribed in 570.603, insert the following clause:

                   Mutuality of Obligation (SEP 1999)

    The obligations and covenants of the Lessor, and the Government's 
obligation to pay rent and other Government obligations and covenants, 
arising under or related to this Lease, are interdependent. The 
Government may, upon issuance of and delivery to Lessor of a final 
decision asserting a claim against Lessor, set off such claim, in whole 
or in part, as against any payment or payments then or thereafter due 
the Lessor under this lease. No setoff pursuant to this clause shall 
constitute a breach by the Government of this lease.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
552.270-29  Acceptance of Space.

    As prescribed in 570.603, insert the following clause:

                     Acceptance of Space (SEP 1999)

    (a) When the Lessor has completed all alterations, improvements, and 
repairs necessary to meet the requirements of the lease, the Lessor 
shall notify the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer or 
designated representative shall promptly inspect the space.
    (b) The Government will accept the space and the lease term will 
begin after determining that the space is substantially complete and 
contains the required usable square footage as indicated in Paragraph 
1.1, Amount and Type of Space, of this solicitation.

                             (End of clause)

<R05>
570.102  Definitions.

    Acquisition means the acquiring by lease of an interest in improved 
real property for use by the Federal Government, whether the space 
already exists or must be constructed.
    Contract means lease.
    Contractor means lessor.
    Landlord or lessor means any individual, firm, partnership, trust, 
association, State or local government, or other legal entity that 
leases real property to the Government.
    Lease or leasehold interest in real property means a conveyance to 
the Government of the right of exclusive possession of real property for 
a definite period of time by a landlord. It may include operational 
services provided by the landlord.
    Lessee or tenant means the United States of America.
    Operational services means services that support use of a leased 
property, such as heating, ventilation, air condition, utilities, and 
custodial services.
    Rent and related services means that consideration paid for the use 
of leased property plus the costs of operational services whether 
furnished by the lessor, the Government, or both.
    Simplified lease acquisition procedures mean the procedures for 
awarding leases at or below the simplified lease acquisition threshold.
    Simplified lease acquisition threshold Means $100,000 average annual 
rent for the term of the lease, including option periods and excluding 
the cost of operational services.
    Small business means a concern including affiliates, which is 
organized for profit, is independently-owned and operated, is not 
dominant in the field of leasing commercial real estate, and has annual 
average gross receipts of $15 million or less for the preceding three 
fiscal years.
    Solicitation for Offers (SFO) means invitation for bids in sealed 
bidding or request for proposals in negotiations.
    Space in buildings means the premises leased, or to be leased, 
including improvements. Its quantity is normally expressed in square 
feet. It does not include space acquired by the power of eminent domain, 
donation, or condemnation, nor acquisitions of bare or unimproved land.
    Substantially as follows or substantially the same as, when used in 
prescribing a provision or clause, means that you may prepare and use a 
variation of that provision or clause to accommodate requirements 
peculiar to an individual acquisition. The variation must include the 
salient features of the FAR or GSAR provision or clause. It must also be 
consistent with the intent, principle, and substance of the FAR or GSAR 
provision or clause and related coverage on the subject matter.


<R05>
570.103  Authority to lease.

    (a) The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 
U.S.C. 490(h)(1)), as amended, and Section 1 of the Reorganization Plan 
No. 18 of 1950 (40 U.S.C. 490 Note) authorize the Administrator of 
General Services to acquire leasehold interests in real property for use 
by Federal agencies. The authority is limited to leases for buildings 
and improvement that bind the Government for periods not exceeding 20 
years.
    (b) You have exclusive authority to enter into and administer leases 
on the Government's behalf to the extent provided in your certificate of 
appointment as a contracting officer.


<R05>
570.104  Competition.

    Unless you use the simplified procedures in subpart 570.2, the 
competition requirements of FAR part 6 apply to acquisition of leasehold 
interests in real property.


<R05>
570.105  Methods of contracting.


<R05>
570.105-1  Contracting by negotiation.

    Contracting by negotiation is usually appropriate for acquiring 
space in a building through a lease contract. You will usually need to 
conduct discussions with offerors about their proposals and consider 
factors other than price in making the award.

[[Page 284]]


<R05>
570.105-2  Two-phase design-build selection procedures.

    Unless you use another acquisition procedure authorized by law, you 
must use the two-phase design-build selection procedures in section 303M 
of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as 
amended, for lease construction projects. This includes lease 
construction projects with options to purchase the real property leased. 
Use the procedures in section 303M when you meet the conditions in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:
    (a) You anticipate the lease will involve the design and 
construction of a public building, facility, or work for lease to the 
Government.
    (b) You determine the procedures are appropriate for entering into a 
lease construction contract based on the following:
    (1) You expect to receive three or more offers.
    (2) Offerors will need to perform design work before developing a 
price.
    (3) Offerors will incur a substantial amount of expense in preparing 
offers.
    (4) You consider criteria such as the following:
    (i) The extent to which the project requirements have been 
adequately defined.
    (ii) The time constraints for delivery of the project.
    (iii) The capability and experience of potential contractors.
    (iv) The suitability of the project for use of the two-phase 
selection procedures.
    (v) The capability of the agency to manage the two-phase selection 
process.
    (vi) Other criteria established by the HCA.


<R05>
570.105-3  Sealed bidding.

    For sealed bidding, use the procedures in FAR part 14. In most cases 
you should not use sealed bidding to acquire space in buildings unless 
you meet all the following conditions:
    (a) You have a preselected site.
    (b) A building will be constructed on the site using Government 
furnished plans and specifications.
    (c) The Government will lease the building.


<R05>
570.106  Publicizing/Advertising.

    (a) Subparts 505.101, 505.202, and 505.203 define requirements for 
publicizing lease actions.
    (b) Instead of issuing separate advertisements for multiple, known 
leasing actions, you may include the actions in one consolidated 
advertisement.


<R05>
570.107  Oral presentations.

    You may use oral presentations for acquisitions of leasehold 
interests in real property. Follow the procedures in FAR 15.102.


<R05>
570.108  Responsibility determination.

    (a) Determine that the prospective awardee is responsible with 
respect to the lease under consideration. The standards in FAR 9.104 
apply. As part of the determination that a prospective contractor is 
otherwise qualified and eligible for award, review the List of Parties 
Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.
    (b) Your signature on the contract is deemed an affirmative 
determination.
    (c) If you find an offeror nonresponsible, sign and place in the 
contract file a determination of nonresponsibility. State the basis for 
the determination.
    (d) If you find a small business concern nonresponsible, the 
procedures at FAR 19.6 apply. Place all documents and reports supporting 
a determination of responsibility or nonresponsibility in the lease 
file.

    Use simplified lease acquisition procedures to the maximum extent 
practicable for actions at or below the simplified lease acquisition 
threshold.


<R05>
570.203  Procedures.


<R05>
570.203-1  Market survey.

    Conduct a market survey to identify potential sources. Use 
information available in GSA or from other sources to identify locations 
that will meet the Government's requirements.


<R05>
570.203-2  Competition.

    (a) Solicit at least three sources to promote competition to the 
maximum extent practicable. If you have repeated requirements for space 
in the same market, and if practicable, invite two sources not included 
in the most recent solicitation to submit offers.
    (b) If you solicit only one source, document the file to explain the 
lack of competition.


<R05>
570.203-3  Soliciting offers.

    (a) Solicit offers by providing each prospective offeror a proposed 
short form lease or SFO. The short form lease or SFO must provide all 
the following information:
    (1) A description of the Government's requirements.
    (2) All award factors, including price or cost, and any significant 
subfactors you will consider in awarding the lease.
    (3) A statement of the relative importance of the evaluation factors 
and subfactors.
    (4) A statement of whether all evaluation factors other than cost or 
price, when combined, are either:
    (i) Significantly more important than cost or price.
    (ii) Approximately equal in importance to cost or price.
    (iii) Significantly less important than cost or price.
    (5) Either in full text or by reference, applicable FAR provisions 
and contract clauses required by 570.6.
    (b) As necessary, review with prospective offerors the Government's 
requirements, pricing matters, evaluation procedures and submissions of 
offers.


<R05>
570.203-4  Negotiations, evaluation, and award.

    (a) If you need to conduct negotiations, use the procedures in 
570.307.
    (b) Evaluate offers in accordance with the solicitation. Evaluate 
prices and document the lease file to demonstrate whether the proposed 
contract prices are fair and reasonable.
    (c) If the total price, including options, exceeds $500,000, 
consider whether you need cost and pricing data to determine that the 
price is fair and reasonable. In most cases the exceptions at FAR 
15.403-1 will apply.

[[Page 286]]

    (d) If the total contract value of the lease, including options, 
will exceed $500,000, the proposed awardee must provide an acceptable 
small business subcontracting plan. This requirement does not apply if 
the proposed awardee is a small business concern.
    (e) Make award to the responsible offeror whose proposal is most 
advantageous to the Government considering price and other factors 
included in the solicitation.

<R04>
   Subpart 570.4--Special Aspects of Contracting for Continued Space 
                              Requirements


<R05>
570.401  Renewal options.

    (a) Exercise of options. Before exercising an option to renew, 
follow the procedures in 517.202 and 517.207. The contract must first 
provide the right to renew the lease.
    (b) Market survey. Before exercising an option to renew a lease, 
review current market information to ensure the rental rate in the 
option is fair and reasonable.


<R05>
570.402  Succeeding leases.


<R05>
570.402-1  General.

    (a) If a succeeding lease for the continued occupancy of space in a 
building does not exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, you 
may use the simplified procedures in 570.2. Explain the absence of 
competition in the contract file.
    (b) If a succeeding lease will exceed the simplified lease 
acquisition threshold, you may enter into the lease under either of the 
following conditions:
    (1) You do not identify any potential acceptable locations.
    (2) You identify potential acceptable locations, but a cost-benefit 
analysis indicates that award to an offeror other than the present 
lessor will result in substantial relocation costs or duplication of 
costs to the Government, and the Government cannot expect to recover 
such costs through competition.


<R05>
570.402-2  Publicizing/Advertising.

    Publish a notice if required by 505.101(c). The notice should:
    (a) Indicate the Government's lease is expiring.
    (b) Describe the requirement in terms of type and quantity of space.
    (c) Indicate the Government is interested in considering alternative 
space if economically advantageous.
    (d) Advise prospective offerors that the Government will consider 
the cost of moving, alterations, etc., when deciding whether it should 
relocate.
    (e) Provide a contact person for those interested in providing space 
to the Government.


<R05>
570.402-3  Market survey.

    Conduct a market survey following 570.301.


<R05>
570.402-4  No potential acceptable locations.

    If you do not identify any potential acceptable locations through 
the advertisement or the market survey, you may prepare a justification 
to negotiate directly with the present lessor. Fully document the 
efforts to locate alternative sources. Prepare the justification and 
obtain approval following FAR 6.3 and 506.3.


<R05>
570.402-5  Potential acceptable locations.

    If you identify potential acceptable locations through the 
advertisement or market survey, conduct a cost-benefit analysis 
following the procedures in 570.402-6. Based on the results of the cost-
benefit analysis, take appropriate action as follows:
    (a) If the cost-benefit analysis indicates that the Government will 
recover relocation costs and duplication of costs through competition, 
develop an SFO and negotiate with all interested parties following 
570.3.
    (b) If the cost-benefit analysis indicates that the Government 
cannot expect to recover relocation costs and duplication of costs 
through competition, prepare a justification for approval in accordance 
with FAR 6.3 and 506.3. Explain both:
    (1) How you performed the cost-benefit analysis.
    (2) That the cost-benefit analysis indicates that award to any other 
offeror will likely result in substantial costs to the Government that 
the Government cannot expect to recover through competition.

[[Page 289]]


<R05>
570.402-6  Cost-benefit analysis.

    (a) The cost-benefit analysis must consider all the following:
    (1) The prices of other potentially available properties.
    (2) Relocation costs, including estimated costs for moving, 
telecommunications, and alterations, amortized over the firm term of the 
lease.
    (3) Duplication of costs to the Government.
    (4) Other appropriate considerations.
    (b) Establish the prices for other potentially available properties 
by requesting each prospective offeror to provide an informational 
quotation for standard space for comparison purposes.
    (1) Adjust the prices quoted for standard space for any special 
requirements.
    (2) You do not need a formal SFO to obtain the informational 
quotation. However, you must provide a general description of the 
Government's needs.
    (3) If you obtain oral quotations, document the following 
information, as a minimum:
    (i) Name and address of the firm solicited.
    (ii) Name of the firm's representative providing the quote.
    (iii) Price(s) quoted.
    (iv) Description of the space and services for which the quote is 
provided.
    (v) Name of the Government employee soliciting the quotation.
    (vi) Date of the conversation.
    (4) Compare the informational quotations to the present lessor's 
price, adjusted to reflect the anticipated price for a succeeding lease.


<R05>
570.403  Expansion requests.

    (a) If the expansion space is in the general scope of the lease, you 
may acquire the space through a modification without further 
justification under FAR 6.3.
    (b) If the expansion space needed is outside the general scope of 
the lease, determine whether it is more prudent to provide the expansion 
space by supplemental agreement to the existing lease or to satisfy the 
requirement by competitive means.
    (1) Conduct a market survey to determine the availability of 
suitable alternative locations.
    (2) If you identify alternate locations that can satisfy the total 
requirement, perform a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether it is 
in the Government's best interest to relocate. Consider, as appropriate.
    (i) The cost of the alternate space compared to the cost of 
expanding at the existing location.
    (ii) The cost of moving.
    (iii) The cost of duplicating existing improvements.
    (iv) The cost of the unexpired portion of the firm lease term. If a 
termination is possible, use the actual cost of such an action.
    (v) the cost of disruption to the agency's operation.
    (c) If you determine not to use competitive procedures and the 
expansion space is outside the general scope of the lease:
    (1) If the estimated value of the acquisition does not exceed the 
simplified lease acquisition threshold, document the file as required by 
570.203-2(b).
    (2) If the estimated value of the acquisition exceeds the simplified 
lease acquisition threshold, prepare a justification for approval under 
FAR 6.3 and 506.3.


<R05>
570.404  Superseding leases.

    (a) Consider executing a superseding lease to replace an existing 
lease when the Government need numerous or detailed modifications to the 
space that would cause complications or substantially change the present 
lease.
    (b) If the value of the superseding lease exceeds the simplified 
lease acquisition threshold, the justification and approval requirements 
in FAR 6.3 and 506.3 apply. If the cost does not exceed the simplified 
lease acquisition threshold, you may use the simplified procedures in 
570.2 and explain the absence of competition in the file.


<R05>
570.405  Lease extensions.

    (a) This section applies to extension of the term of a lease to 
provide for continued occupancy on a short-term basis.
    (b) If the value of a lease extension will exceed the simplified 
lease acquisition threshold, the justification and approval requirements 
in FAR 6.3 and 506.3 apply. For extensions that will

[[Page 290]]

not exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, you may use the 
simplified procedures in 570.2 and explain the absence of competition in 
the file.
    (c) FAR 6.302-1 permits contracting without providing for full and 
open competition when the property or services needed by the agency are 
available from only one responsible source and no other type of property 
or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. This authority may 
apply to lease extensions in situations such as the following:
    (1) The agency occupying the leased space is scheduled to move into 
other Federally controlled space, but encounters unexpected delays in 
preparing the new space for occupancy.
    (2) The Government encounters unexpected delays outside of its 
control in acquiring replacement space.
    (3) The Government is consolidating various agencies occupying the 
leased space and you need to extend the terms of some leases to 
establish a common expiration date.


<R04>
   Subpart 570.5--Special Aspects of Contracting for Lease Alterations


<R05>
570.501  General.

    (a) Acquire alterations through a modification to an existing lease 
if you meet all the following conditions:
    (1) The alterations fall in the general scope of the lease. Consider 
whether the work can be regarded as fairly and reasonably an inseparable 
part of the lease requirement originally contracted for.
    (2) The lessor is willing to perform the proposed alterations at a 
fair and reasonable price.
    (3) It is in the Government's interest to acquire the alterations 
from the lessor.
    (b) If proposed alterations are outside the general scope of the 
existing lease, decide whether to acquire the alterations through 
either:
    (1) A supplemental lease agreement, justified and approved under 
570.502-1.
    (2) Government performance or a separate contract. The lease must 
first provide the Government the right to perform alterations to the 
leased space.


<R05>
570.502  Alterations by the lessor.

    These procedures apply to alterations you acquire directly from a 
lessor by modification or supplement lease agreement.


<R05>
570.502-1  Justification and approval requirements.

    If the proposed alterations are outside the general scope of the 
lease and you plan to acquire them from the lessor without competition, 
the following justification and approval requirements apply:
    (a) If the alteration project will exceed the simplified lease 
acquisition threshold, the justification and approval requirements in 
FAR 6.3 and 506.3 apply.
    (b) If the alteration project will exceed $2,500, but not the 
simplified lease acquisition threshold, you may use simplified 
acquisition procedures and explain the absence of competition in the 
file.
    (c) If the alternation project will not exceed $2,500, no 
justification and approval is required.


<R05>
570.502-2  Procedures.

    (a) Scope of work. Prepare a scope of work for each alteration 
project.
    (b) Independent Government estimate. Obtain an independent 
Government estimate for each alteration project, including changes to 
existing alteration agreements with the lessor.
    (c) Request for proposal. (1) Provide the scope of work to the 
lessor, including any plans and specifications, and request a proposal. 
Indicate in the request for proposal if the Government will make 
progress payments and provide for retainage, when appropriate.
    (2) Request sufficient cost or price information to permit a price 
analysis.
    (d) Audits. If you require cost or pricing data and the alteration 
project will exceed $500,000, request an audit.
    (e) Proposal evaluation. (1) Determine if the proposal meets the 
Government's requirements.
    (2) Analyze price or cost. At a minimum, compare the proposed cost 
to the independent estimate and, if applicable, any audit received.
    (3) Analyze profit following FAR 15.404-4.

[[Page 291]]

    (4) Document your analysis under this paragraph and the resulting 
negotiation objectives.
    (f) Price negotiations. (1) Exercise sound judgment. You may make 
reasonable compromises as necessary.
    (2) The negotiated price should provide the lessor with the greatest 
incentive for efficient and economical performance.
    (3) Document negotiations in the contract file.
    (g) Award. Use GSA Form 276, Supplemental Lease Agreement. If the 
modification does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, you 
may use GSA Form 300, Order for Supplies or Services. Reference the 
lease on the form.
    (h) Inspection and payment. Do not make final payment for 
alterations until the work is:
    (1) Inspected by a qualified Government employee or independent 
Government contractor.
    (2) Confirmed as completed in a satisfactory manner.

[64 FR 37265, July 9, 1999; 64 FR 49844, Sept. 14, 1999]


<R05>
570.503  Alterations by the Government or through a separate contract.

    (a) If the Government chooses to exercise its right to make the 
alterations rather than contracting directly with the lessor, the 
Government may either:
    (1) Have Federal employees perform the work.
    (2) Contract out the work using standard contracting procedures that 
apply to a construction contract performed on Federal property.
    (b) If the Government decides to contract for the work, invite the 
lessor, as well as all other prospective contractors, to submit an offer 
for the project.

following, unless you determine that the provision is not appropriate:

552.270-1 Instructions to Offerors--Acquisition of Leasehold Interests 
          in Real Property. Use Alternate I if you decide that it is 
          advantageous to the Government to allow offers to be submitted 
          up to the exact time specified for award. Use Alternate II if 
          the Government intends to award without discussions. These two 
          alternates are not exclusive.
552.270-2 Historic Preference.
552.270-3 Parties to Execute Lease.

that exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, unless you 
determine that a clause is not appropriate. You do not require a 
deviation under 570.604 to determine that a clause in this section is 
not appropriate. Use the clauses at your discretion in actions at or 
below the simplified lease acquisition threshold.

552.270-4 Definitions. You must use this clause if you use 570.270-28.
552.270-5 Subletting and Assignment.

          loss to the Government resulting from late delivery.
552.270-16 Adjustment for Vacant Premises.
552.270-17 Delivery and Condition.
552.270-18 Default in Delivery--Time Extensions.

552.270-29 Acceptance of Space.


<R05>
570.604  Deviations to provisions and clauses.

    (a) You need a deviation approved under 501.4 to omit any required 
provision or clause.
    (b) You also need an approved deviation to modify the language of a 
provision or clause mandated by statute (e.g., GSAR 552.203-5, Covenant 
Against Contingent Fees, FAR 52.215-2, Audit and Records--Negotiation). 
The authorizing statue must allow for a waiver.

of the issuing agency before you can delete or modify them. For example, 
52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled 
Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era; and 52.222-36, Affirmative 
Action for Workers with Disabilities, require the approval of the 
Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs 
before they can be deleted from or modified in the SFO or lease.

                          Subpart 570.7--Forms


<R05>
570.701  Standard forms.

    Use Standard Form 2, U.S. Government Lease for Real Property, to

actions requiring the agreement of both parties. This includes actions 
such as amending an existing lease to acquire additional space,

settling restoration claims, and acquiring alterations.
    (c) You may use GSA Form 1364, Proposal To Lease Space, to obtain 
offers from prospective offerors.

(DOSAR) in terms of establishment, relationship to the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR), arrangement, applicability, and deviation 
procedures.

[53 FR 26159, July 11, 1988, as amended at 59 FR 66750, Dec. 28, 1994]


<R04>
               Subpart 601.1--Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
601.101  Purpose.

    The DOSAR is issued to provide Department guidance in accordance 
with the policy cited in FAR 1.301(a)(2). The portions of this 
regulation that affects the relationship between a Department of State 
organization and a contractor or potential contractor are published in 
this chapter 6 of title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations, in 
accordance with FAR 1.301(b).

[59 FR 66750, Dec. 28, 1994]


<R05>
601.105  Issuance.


<R05>
601.105-3  Copies.

601.106  OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) requires 
that Federal agencies obtain approval from the Office of Management and 
Budget before collecting information from ten (10) or more members of 
the public. Individuals are not required to respond to information 
collection unless the OMB number and burden estimate information is 
provided. Accordingly, the information and recordkeeping requirements 
contained in this regulation have been approved by OMB under OMB Control 
Number 1405-0050. The burden estimate is 225,302 hours.

<R05>
601.201-1  The two councils.

    The Office of the Procurement Executive (A/OPE) represents the 
Department of State (DOS) on the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council. 
The Procurement Executive shall appoint a representative for this 
purpose. A/OPE is responsible for coordinating with all interested DOS 
elements proposed FAR revisions and for advocating FAR revisions sought 
by the Department.

[53 FR 26159, July 11, 1988, as amended at 59 FR 66750, Dec. 28, 1994]


<R04>
              Subpart 601.3--Agency Acquisition Regulations


<R05>
601.301  Policy.

    (a) The Assistant Secretary of State for Administration is the 
agency head for the purposes of FAR 1.301 (see Delegation of Authority 
No. 120 (34 FR 18095, October 30, 1969), as amended by Delegation of 
Authority No. 120-4 (59 FR 38022, July 26, 1994)). Under Delegation of 
Authority No. 120-5 (59 FR 62771, December 6, 1994), the Assistant 
Secretary of State for Administration redelegated to the Procurement 
Executive the authority to prescribe, promulgate, and amend DOS 
acquisition policies, rules, and regulations.
    (b) The Department of State Acquisition Regulation (DOSAR) is 
prescribed under the authority of 22 U.S.C. 2658 and 40 U.S.C. 486(c).
    (c) The DOSAR implements and supplements the FAR.

[59 FR 66751, Dec. 28, 1994, as amended at 64 FR 43620, Aug. 11, 1999]


<R05>
601.302  Limitations.

    (a) The FAR and the DOSAR apply to all DOS acquisitions of personal 
property and services, including construction, both within and outside 
the United States, unless expressly excluded by this subpart, or exempt 
from the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as 
amended (40 U.S.C. 474(7)), or undertaken pursuant to section 208 of the 
State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended (22 U.S.C. 
4308), or the Foreign Service Buildings Act of 1926, as amended (22 
U.S.C. 292 et seq.).
    (b) At posts where Joint Administrative Offices have been formed, 
the FAR and the DOSAR apply to all Agency for International Development 
(AID) administrative and technical support acquisitions, except in those 
areas which have been exempted by the cognizant administrative office.

[53 FR 26159, July 11, 1988, as amended at 59 FR 66751, Dec. 28, 1994; 
64 FR 43620, Aug. 11, 1999]


<R05>
601.303  Publication and codification.

    (a) The DOSAR is issued as Chapter 6 of Title 48, Code of Federal 
Regulations. The DOSAR is established as Chapter 6 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulations System. The DOSAR is divided into the same 
parts, subparts, sections, subsections, and paragraphs as is the FAR. 
However, when the FAR coverage is adequate by itself there will be no 
corresponding DOSAR coverage. Where the DOSAR implements a specific 
part, subpart, section, or subsection of the FAR, the DOSAR coverage is 
numbered and titled to correspond to the appropriate FAR number and 
title, except that the DOSAR number will include a 6 or 60 such that 
there will always be three numbers to the left of the decimal. For 
example, the DOSAR implementation of FAR 14.1 is shown as 614.1 and the 
DOSAR implementation of FAR 1.301 is shown as 601.301. Materials that 
supplement the FAR are assigned the numbers 70 and up. For example, 
DOSAR requires additional definitions than those used in FAR; this 
supplementary material is provided in 602.101-70.
    (b) The DOSAR and its revisions are published in the Federal 
Register and in the Code of Federal Regulations, both of which may be 
purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing 
Office, Washington, DC 20402.
    (c) The DOSAR shall be referenced in the same manner as described at 
FAR 1.105-2(c).

shall remain in effect until May 19, 2001.
    (b) Procedures. Contracting officers at overseas contracting 
activities are not required to prepare an individual determination and 
findings to document their decision to waive the CBD notice 
requirements.
    (c) Competition requirements. Nothing in this section waives the 
requirement to obtain competition as required by FAR part 6 and DOSAR 
(48 CFR) part 606. Competition, including the use of written

<R05>
606.302-6  National security.

    (b) This subsection applies to all acquisitions involving national 
security information, regardless of dollar amount. In no case shall 
information be classified in order to restrict competition. Information 
may be classified only when its authorized disclosure could be expected 
to cause damage to national security.
    (c) (1) The Chief, Controls Division, Office of Intelligence 
Liaison, Directorate for Coordination, Bureau of Intelligence and 
Research, is responsible for reviewing and certifying on any proposed 
acquisitions derived from or funded or administered by intelligence 
community agencies that involve sensitive compartmented information and 
ensuring that the provisions of Executive Order 12958 and FAR 6.302-6 
have been met. The Chief, Information Security Programs Division, Office 
of Information Security Technology, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, is 
responsible for reviewing and certifying on all other proposed 
acquisitions funded by the Department of State that involve national 
security information and ensuring that the provisions of Executive Order 
12958 and FAR 6.302-6 have been met. When disclosure of the Department's 
needs through full and open competition would compromise national 
security, the Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition 
shall include the following specific information:
    (i) How national security would be compromised if the Department of 
State's (or other agencies') needs were disclosed in the Commerce 
Business Daily;
    (ii) Why the CBD synopsis cannot be worded in such a manner that 
national security would not be compromised;
    (iii) Necessity for access to classified information to prepare 
technical and/or cost proposal and level of security clearance required;
    (iv) Necessity for access to classified information to perform the 
proposed contract and level of security clearance required;
    (v) Number and value of contracts that the justification covers; and
    (vi) A statement as follows: ``I hereby certify that the national 
security concerns of the referenced acquisition(s) meet the criteria set 
forth in Executive Order 12958 and FAR 6.302-6''.
    (2) Any acquisition involving national security information shall be 
publicized in the Commerce Business Daily unless disclosure of the 
agency's needs would compromise national security.
    (3) The contracting officer is responsible for soliciting offers 
from as many potential sources as is practicable under the 
circumstances. However, given the sensitivity required for acquisitions 
involving national security information, it is expected that 
requirements offices will work closely with the contracting officer in 
maximizing competition.

606.370  Department of State standardization program.

    (a) It is the Department's policy to promote full and open 
competition in all procurement actions. The authority at 41 U.S.C. 
253(c)(1) shall be used with respect to standardization when only 
specified makes and models of equipment will satisfy the Department's 
needs and only one source is available. This policy applies to all 
acquisitions involving standardization, regardless of dollar amount.
    (b) Contracts awarded under the authority at 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) 
shall be supported by the written justification described in FAR 6.303. 
The contracting officer, requirements office, procuring activity 
competition advocate, and the Procurement Executive shall approve all 
Justifications for Other than Full and Open Competition that cite 
standardization of technical equipment as justification to restrict 
competition. The Administrative Officer at each post is the procuring 
activity competition advocate for that post and the requirements office 
at post is the embassy functional office responsible for identifying the 
need to contract.
    (c) Procurement of specified makes and models of technical equipment 
and systems, for which there is only one source of supply, is considered 
other than full and open competition. Such procurements shall be 
supported by an approved Justification for Other than Full and Open 
Competition. The justification shall include the content requirements of 
FAR 6.303-2. The justification shall also address potential cost savings 
in areas such as inventory, operations, training, maintenance, repairs, 
and administrative and management support. Areas of consideration for 
potential cost savings shall be supported by detailed estimates as 
attachments to the justification. Justifications shall specify an 
effective period, which shall bear a reasonable relationship to the life 
of the technical equipment. The effective period shall not exceed six 
years with a review at the end of the first three years. Periodic 
reviews shall be made during the standardization period to determine 
whether the standardization should be continued, revised or canceled.

    (a) Prior to making a decision to terminate, based on the

proposed action reviewed and approved by:
    (1) The Office of the Legal Adviser;
    (2) An individual one level above the contracting officer; and
    (3) For overseas posts, A/OPE.
    (b) Termination for default. Termination for default under a 
contract's default clause is appropriate when the circumstances giving 
rise to the debarment or suspension also constitute a default in the 
contractor's performance of that contract. Debarment or suspension of 
the contractor for reasons unrelated to the performance of that contract 
may not support a termination for default.
    (c) Termination for convenience or cancellation. Termination for 
convenience or cancellation under appropriate contract clauses should be 
considered when the contractor presents a significant risk to the 
Government in completing a current contract and when such termination 
for convenience or cancellation is determined to be in the Government's 
best interests. In making this determination, the contracting officer 
should consider such factors as the--
    (1) Seriousness of the cause for debarment or suspension;
    (2) Extent of contract performance;
    (3) Potential costs to the Government;
    (4) Urgency of the requirement and the impact of the delay; and/or
    (5) Availability of other safeguards to protect the Government's

    (6) The fact-finding panel shall conduct its hearing in accordance 
with rules promulgated by the fact-finding official. The rules shall be 
as informal as is practicable, consistent with FAR 9.406-3(b) The fact-
finding official is responsible for making the transcribed record of the 
hearing, unless the contractor and the fact-finding panel agree to waive 
the requirement for a transcript.
    (7) The fact-finding official shall deliver written findings and the 
transcribed record, if made, to the debarring official within 30 
calendar days after the hearing. The findings shall resolve any facts in 
dispute based on a preponderance of the evidence presented and recommend 
whether a cause for debarment exists.
    (c) Notice of proposal to debar. (1) Upon receipt of a complete 
referral and after consulting with the Office of the Legal Adviser, the 
debarring official shall decide whether to initiate debarment action.

section establishes the Department of State's metric conversion 
guidelines.
    (b) Applicability. This section applies to all DOS acquisitions, 
except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause 
significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to U.S. firms.
    (c) Definitions.
    Dual system means the use of both traditional and metric systems. 
For example, an item is designated, produced and described in inch-pound 
values with soft metric values also shown for information or comparison.
    Hard metric means the use of only standard metric (SI) measurements 
in specifications, standards, supplies and services.

[[Page 313]]

    Hybrid system means the use of both traditional and hard metric 
values in specifications, standards, supplies and services.
    Measurement sensitive means any item having an application or 
meaning depending substantially on some measured quantity. For example, 
measurement sensitive items include product or performance criteria and 
standards binding on others, such as emission levels, size and weight 
limitations, etc.
    Metric system means the International System of Units (Le System 
International d'Unites (SI)) of the International Bureau of Weights and 
Measures.
    Metrication means any act that increases metric system use, 
including metric training and initiation or conversion of measurement 
sensitive processes and systems to the metric system.
    Soft metric means the result of mathematical conversion of inch-
pound measurements to metric equivalents. The physical dimensions, 
however, are not changed.
    Traditional system of weights and measurements means the predominant 
weight and measurement system currently used in the United States, also 
referred to as the ``inch-pound system.'' The traditional system 
includes such commonly used units as inch, foot, yard, mile, pint, 
quart, gallon, bushel, ounce (fluid and avoirdupois), pound, degree 
Fahrenheit, ampere, candela, and second.
    (d) Procedures. (1) DOS contracting activities shall implement the 
metric system in a manner consistent with 15 U.S.C. 205a, et seq.
    (2) All DOS contracting activities shall use the metric system in 
acquisition consistent with security, operations, economic, technical, 
logistical, training and safety requirements.
    (3) The Department shall encourage industry to adopt the metric 
system by acquiring commercially available metric products and services 
that meet the Department's needs whenever practical. Toward this end, 
solicitations for DOS acquisitions shall:
    (i) State all measurement sensitive requirements in metric terms 
whenever possible. Alternatives to hard metric are soft, dual and hybrid 
metric terms. The Metric Handbook for Federal Officials regarding the 
selection of proper metric units and symbols is available from the 
National Technical Information Service; and
    (ii) For contracts expected to exceed $500,000 contracting officers 
shall return to the requirements office all specifications and 
statements of work that are not expressed in some form of metric terms 
unless the requirements office has prepared a justification, for the 
approval of the contracting officer, for the use of non-metric 
specifications or statements of work. The justification shall be in a 
format as prescribed by the head of the contracting activity. Option 
year prices shall be considered when computing the $500,000 threshold.
    (4) Waivers are not required when ordering from Federal Supply 
Schedules.
    (5) Valid justifications for non-metric specifications or statements 
of work include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Existing specifications or standards are in inch-pound units, 
unless conversion of the existing specifications or standards is 
necessary or advantageous to the Government. Unnecessary retrofit of 
existing systems with new metric components should be avoided if the 
total cost of the retrofit, including redesign costs, exceeds $50,000;
    (ii) Metric is not the accepted industry system with respect to a 
business-related activity; however, soft, hybrid, or dual systems may be 
used during the transition to hard metric;
    (iii) The use of metric is impractical or is likely to cause 
significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to U.S. firms.
    (6) The contracting officer shall review and, if acceptable, approve 
the waiver prior to the release of the solicitation. The waiver shall be 
placed in the contract file. If the waiver is not approved, the 
contracting officer shall return it to the requirements office with an 
explanation for the disapproval.
    (7) The in-house operating metric costs shall be identified. 
Identification includes, but is not limited to, the cost of metric aids, 
tools, equipment, training and increased cost to develop metric 
specifications. All contracting activities and requirements offices 
shall

[[Page 314]]

maintain a record of any costs and/or savings brought about by metric 
conversion.
    (8) Bulk (loose, unpacked) materials shall be specified and 
purchased in metric or dual units.
    (9) Measuring devices, shop and laboratory equipment shall be 
purchased in metric or dual units.
    (10) Shipping allowances, bills of lading and other shipping 
documents shall be expressed in metric or dual units.

assistance program.


<R05>
619.705-1  General support of the program.

    It is the Department's policy to incorporate its current fiscal year 
goals as negotiated with the SBA into all pertinent Department 
solicitations, in addition to the standard subcontract clauses. 
Incorporation of the goals does not require that large business prime 
contractors must subcontract, but does require that to the extent they 
plan to subcontract, specific goals be established for doing business 
with small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned firms. Where funds are 
available, an incentive clause such as that found in FAR 52.219-10, 
Incentive Subcontracting Program for Small and Small Disadvantaged 
Business Concerns, is encouraged.

[59 FR 66760, Dec. 28, 1994]


<R05>
619.705-3   Preparing the solicitation.

    To further promote the use of small, disadvantaged, and women-owned 
firms by large prime contractors, contracting officers are encouraged to 
consider the adequacy of the subcontracting plans, and/or past 
performance in achieving negotiated subcontract goals, as part of the 
overall evaluation of the technical proposals.

<R05>

small disadvantaged businesses are afforded the maximum practicable 
opportunity to participate as subcontractors. A/SDBU shall recommend to 
the contracting officer changes needed to subcontracting plans found to 
be deficient.

subcontracting plans.
    (b) Contracting officers shall collect subcontracting data from 
contractors required to establish subcontracting plans in support of 
small and small disadvantaged business concerns. This data shall be 
collected annually and semiannually, using Standard Form 295, Summary 
Subcontracting Report, for the annual submissions, and Standard Form

contracting officer shall establish the price with the selected 8(a) 
contractor.

cited in 619.800, the contracting officer shall submit the name, 
address, and telephone number of the low offeror (in sealed bid 
acquisitions) or the apparent successful offeror (in negotiated

<R05>
623.400  Scope of subpart.

    The affirmative procurement program is applicable to all domestic 
acquisitions of items currently designated by an EPA guideline or by 
future guidelines promulgated by EPA. The requirements of this section 
are not applicable to acquisitions made and/or performed outside the 
United States or its possessions.


<R05>
623.404  Procedures.

    (b)(2) The requirements office initiating an acquisition is 
responsible for determining whether recovered materials should be 
included in the specifications. Requirements offices may purchase EPA 
designated items containing other than recovered materials only if one 
of the exemptions listed in FAR 23.404(b)(3) applies. If the 
requirements office determines to acquire EPA designated items that do 
not contain recovered materials, a written justification must be 
submitted to the head of the contracting activity.
    (i) Contracts for the purchase of, or requiring the supply of, any 
EPA designated item shall require that the item conform to the EPA 
guidelines, unless an exception has been approved by the head of the 
contracting activity in accordance with FAR 23.404(b)(3) and DOSAR 
623.404(b)(3).
    (ii) Contracting officers shall promote the fact that the Department 
is seeking to buy items containing recovered materials at pre-bid and 
pre-proposal conferences, when appropriate. Other means of promotion may 
include a specific notice on a solicitation's cover letter, calling 
attention to the requirement for recovered materials.
    (iii) Contracting officers shall include FAR clause 52.223-9 to 
ensure that contractors estimate, certify, and verify the amount of 
recovered material used in the performance of the contract.
    (iv) The effectiveness of the program shall be reviewed annually by 
A/OPE. An assessment will be made to determine if greater use of 
recovered materials is possible for the existing requirements or if 
recovered materials are causing undue delay, lack of competition, 
unreasonable prices, or an unacceptable level of performance.
    (3) The head of the contracting activity is the agency head for the 
purpose of FAR 23.404(b)(3).

<R05>
628.305  Overseas workers' compensation and war-hazard insurance.

    (a) It is the Department's policy that acquisitions for services, 
including construction but excluding personal services contracts, which 
require contractor personnel to perform work outside of the United 
States, shall include the contractual obligation for coverage under the 
Defense Base Act (42 U.S.C. Sections 1651-1654, as amended). For the 
purpose of this section only, ``contractor personnel'' includes 
individuals who are either:
    (1) United States citizens or residents, or
    (2) Hired in the United States or its possessions.
    (b) The Department of State has entered into a contract with an 
insurance broker and carrier to provide Defense Base Act insurance, at a 
fixed rate for services and construction, to cover DOS contracts which 
will require performance overseas by United States citizens, residents, 
or those employed in the United States. In countries where local 
nationals and/or third country nationals will be employed to perform the 
contract, such countries have been waived by the Secretary of Labor. 
Whenever such insurance is required under the contract, the contracting 
officer shall insert the clause at 652.228-71, Worker's Compensation 
Insurance (Defense Base Act)--Services. If the contract is for 
construction, the contracting officer shall insert the clause with its 
Alternate I.
    (c) Upon award of a contract which requires Defense Base Act 
insurance, the contracting officer shall notify the successful offeror 
of the name of the insurance broker from which the contractor should 
acquire insurance.
    (d) The authority to request a waiver from the Secretary of Labor of 
a particular country, as set forth in FAR 28.305(d), is reserved to the 
Secretary of State. The Department has obtained blanket waivers from the 
Secretary of Labor for all contracts for services, including 
construction, awarded and/or performed overseas. The waivers apply to 
all individuals who are not employees hired in the United States, or who 
are not United States citizens or residents.

solicitations for fixed-price or construction contracts to be performed 
outside the United States by United States citizens, residents, and/or

which a private buyer would guard against

through insurance. There may be occasions, however, when a contractor's 
assumption of such risks is in the best interest of the Government. The 
clause in paragraph (b) below is authorized for use on those occasions. 
In the determination of its use, the contracting officer should weigh 
the advantages it provides against the likelihood of a resultant 
increase in the contract price.
    (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 652.228-70, 
Indemnification, in solicitations and contracts when it is determined 
that the contractor's assumption of risk is in the best interest of the 
Government.

available at the time of contract award and the contracting officer 
executes a determination and findings, approved by the requirements 
office, justifying the need for incremental funding due to the 
unavailability of funds.

<R04>
                   Subpart 633.2--Disputes and Appeals


<R05>
633.203  Applicability.

    The Procurement Executive is the agency head for the purposes of FAR 
33.203(b).


<R05>
633.214-70  Alternative dispute resolution.

    (a) Policy. The Department's goal is to resolve contract disputes 
before the issuance of a contracting officer's final decision under the 
Contract Disputes Act. Contracting officers shall consider all possible 
means of reaching a negotiated settlement, consistent with the 
Government's best interests, before issuing a final decision on a 
contractor claim under the process outlined in FAR 33.206 through 
33.211.
    (b) When to use ADR. (1) Factors favoring ADR. Contracting officers 
should consider using ADR in those cases where:
    (i) Only facts are in dispute;
    (ii) The facts are clearly not favorable to the Government;

[[Page 336]]

    (iii) The anticipated costs (in time and money) are less than the 
anticipated costs of litigation;
    (iv) Settlement attempts have reached an impasse;
    (v) ADR techniques have been used successfully in similar 
situations;
    (vi) There is a need for independent expert analysis; or,
    (vii) The claim has merit but its value is overstated.
    (2) Factors disfavoring ADR. The following circumstances do not 
favor use of ADR:
    (i) Cases involving disputes controlled by clear legal precedent, 
making compromise difficult;
    (ii) The resolution will have a significant impact on other pending 
cases or on the future conduct of Department business;
    (iii) The dispute is primarily over issues of law;
    (iv) A decision of precedential value is needed;
    (v) A significant policy question is involved;
    (vi) A full public record of the proceeding is important;
    (vii) The outcome could significantly involve persons who are not 
parties to the contract;
    (viii) The costs of pursuing an ADR procedure (in time and money) 
exceed the cost of litigation;
    (ix) The nature of the case may cause ADR to be used merely for 
delay or discovery; or,
    (x) The case involves criminal violations.
    (3) Initial action. Immediately upon receipt of a claim, the 
contracting officer shall send a letter acknowledging receipt of the 
claim and soliciting the contractor's views on submitting this claim for 
ADR. In every dispute, the first step toward resolution shall be 
unassisted negotiations, in which the parties try to work out the 
disagreement among themselves. If this fails, before issuing a final 
decision, the contracting officer shall consult first with the head of 
the contracting activity, and contact the Office of the Legal Adviser 
and A/OPE to determine whether the disagreement appears susceptible to 
resolution by ADR. Consideration shall be given to pursuing additional 
fact-finding or designating a neutral expert in the disputed issue to 
provide an advisory opinion.
    (c) Methods of ADR. If the initial action to resolve the dispute 
fails, and the contracting officer issues a final decision which is 
appealed, ADR may still be feasible. The GSBCA issues a notice regarding 
ADR to all contractors who file appeals under the Contract Disputes Act. 
This notice describes the following ADR techniques, which contracting 
officers are urged to discuss with contractors at any time:
    (1) Settlement judge. A settlement judge is either an administrative 
judge or hearing examiner who is appointed by the parties in dispute for 
the purpose of facilitating settlement. The agenda is flexible and based 
on the specifics of the individual dispute. By holding a frank, in-depth 
discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each party's position, the 
settlement judge may be able to foster a settlement of the dispute. The 
settlement judge may meet with the parties jointly or individually, and 
the settlement judge's recommendations are not binding. Typically, the 
settlement judge's opinions, based on his or her experience in handling 
prior disputes, will help the parties realize whether their arguments 
have merit or not.
    (2) Minitrial. A minitrial is not an actual trial but rather a 
flexible, expedited, but structured procedure in which each party 
presents an abbreviated version of its position both to a neutral 
advisor (who may be appointed by the GSBCA) and to principals of the 
parties who have full contractual authority to conclude a settlement. 
The parties mutually decide on the form of presentation without regard 
to traditional judicial proceedings or rules of evidence. An advance 
agreement by the parties specifies the procedure to be followed in 
making presentations, as well as the role of the neutral advisor. Upon 
conclusion of the presentations, settlement negotiations are conducted. 
The neutral advisor may assist the parties in negotiating settlement, 
including making non-binding recommendations.
    (3) Summary trial with binding decision. A summary trial with 
binding decision is a procedure in which the scheduling

[[Page 337]]

of an appeal is expedited and the parties try their appeal informally 
before an administrative judge or panel of judges. The length of the 
trial and the time for presentation and decision are tailored to the 
needs of the particular case. Trial procedures and rules applicable to 
appeals are modified or eliminated to expedite resolution of the appeal. 
The parties must agree, however, that all decisions, rulings, and orders 
by the judge(s) are final, conclusive, and not appealable, and may not 
be set aside, except for fraud. A summary ``bench'' decision is issued 
at the conclusion of the trial or a summary written decision will be 
issued within ten (10) days of either the trial's conclusion or receipt 
of a trial transcript.
    (4) Mediation. Mediation is a process in which a neutral and 
impartial third party assists the Government and the contractor in 
conflict to negotiate an acceptable settlement of contested issues. The 
mediator is jointly selected and is asked by the disputing parties to 
assist them to reach a voluntary agreement. The mediator has no 
decisionmaking authority and cannot impose a decision. Mediation 
assistance involves working with the parties to improve their 
communications, clarify or interpret data, identify key issues to be 
discussed, design an effective negotiation process, generate settlement 
options, or help to identify or formulate areas of agreement. Additional 
information on alternative dispute resolution and mediation resources is 
available at the following address on the Internet: http://www.adrr.com
    (5) Arbitration. Non-binding arbitration is a process in which a 
dispute is jointly submitted by the Government and a contractor to an 
impartial and neutral person or panel who provides a written, non-
binding opinion used as a guide for negotiations toward a settlement. 
Although the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-
552) allows agencies to use binding arbitration, the law provides that 
the agency head may vacate any arbitration award within 30 days after it 
is served on all parties. For this reason, non-binding arbitration is 
preferable. Additional information on alternative dispute resolution and 
mediation resources is available at the following address on the 
Internet: http://www.adrr.com
    (6) Partnering. Partnering involves an agreement in principle to 
share the risks involved in completing a project, and to establish and 
promote a partnership environment. Partnering itself is not a 
contractual agreement and it does not create any legally enforceable 
rights, but instead partnering seeks to create a new cooperative 
attitude in completing Government contracts. The three basic steps in 
partnering are:
    (i) Establish the new relationship through personal contact among 
the principals for the Government and the contractor before the work 
begins;
    (ii) Prepare a joint statement of goals establishing common 
objectives in specific detail for reaching the goals; and,
    (iii) Identify specific dispute prevention processes designed to 
head off problems, evaluate performance, and promote cooperation. 
Additional information on alternative dispute resolution and mediation 
resources is available at the following address on the Internet: http://
www.adrr.com
    (d) ADR procedures. The ADR method shall be selected voluntarily by 
both the Government and the contractor. Both parties shall agree on the 
procedures to be followed, including the agenda and amount of time 
allowed for each party to present its case. The parties may choose not 
to have a written transcript or hearing on the record, as this might 
inhibit settlement. Also, the decision rendered, if any, should not be 
considered to establish any precedent for future litigation unless the 
parties agree otherwise. In cases where the parties agree to pay jointly 
for a third-party neutral advisor, it is recommended that the parties 
and the advisor agree on a fair and reasonable price. The Government 
would then issue a simplified acquisition (if the dollar amount does not 
exceed the simplified acquisition limitation) for 50% of the agreed 
price, and the advisor would submit separate invoices (each for 50% of 
the price) to the Government and the contractor.

    (a) The Department of State's Competition Advocate is responsible 
for assisting industry in removing restrictive requirements from 
Department of State solicitations and removing barriers to full and open 
competition and use of commercial items. If such a solicitation is 
considered competitively restrictive or does not appear properly 
conducive to competition and commercial practices, potential offerors 
are encouraged to first contact the contracting officer for the 
respective solicitation. If concerns remain unresolved, contact the 
Department of State Competition Advocate on (703) 516-1680, by fax at 
(703) 875-6155, or write to: Department of State, Competition Advocate, 
Office of the Procurement Executive (A/OPE), Suite 603, SA-6, 
Washington, DC 20522-0602.
    (b) The Department of State's Acquisition Ombudsman has been 
appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors and contractors 
during the preaward and postaward phases of this acquisition. The role 
of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting 
officer, the Technical Evaluation Panel or Source Evaluation Board, or 
the selection official. The purpose of the ombudsman is to facilitate 
the communication of concerns, issues, disagreements, and 
recommendations of interested parties to the appropriate Government 
personnel, and work to resolve them. When requested and appropriate, the 
ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the 
concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of 
proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of formal 
contract disputes. Interested parties are invited to contact the 
contracting activity ombudsman, [insert name], at [insert telephone and 
fax numbers]. For an American Embassy or overseas post, refer to the 
numbers below for the Department Acquisition Ombudsman. Concerns, 
issues, disagreements, and recommendations which cannot be resolved at a 
contracting activity level may be referred to the Department of State 
Acquisition Ombudsman at (703) 516-1680, by fax at (703) 875-6155, or

652.216-71  Price Adjustment.

    As prescribed in 616.203-4, insert a clause substantially the same 
as follows:

                       Price Adjustment (AUG 1999)

    (a) The contract price may be increased or decreased in actual costs 
of direct service labor which result directly from laws enacted and 
effective during the term of this contract by the [insert name of 
country] Government. Direct service labor costs include only the costs 
of wages and direct benefits (such as social security, health insurance, 
unemployment compensation insurance) paid to or incurred for the direct 
benefit of personnel performing services under one of the categories 
listed in Section [identify section number] of this contract. Price 
adjustments will include only changes in direct service labor costs 
incurred in order to comply with the requirements of the law. No 
adjustment will be made under this clause with respect to labor costs of 
personnel not performing direct service labor under the categories of 
Section [identify section], nor for overhead, profit, general and 
administrative (G&A) costs, taxes or any other costs whatsoever.
    (b) For the contracting officer to consider any request for 
adjustment, the contractor shall demonstrate in writing:
    (1) That the change in the law occurred during the term of this 
contract and subsequent to the award date of this contract; and,
    (2) That the change in the law could not have been reasonably 
anticipated prior to contract award; and,
    (3) How the change in the law directly affects the contractor's 
costs under this contract.
    (c) The contractor shall present data that clearly supports any 
request for adjustment. This data shall be submitted no later than 30 
calendar days after the changes in the law

[[Page 348]]

have been made public. This data shall include, but not be limited to, 
the following:
    (1) The calculation of the amount of adjustment requested; and,
    (2) Documentation which identifies and provides the appropriate 
portions of the text of the particular law from which the request is 
derived.
    (d) In order to establish the change between the requested adjusted 
rate and the original rate, the contractor shall support the appropriate 
data and composition of the original rate and the requested adjusted 
rate. This shall include details regarding specific hourly rates paid to 
individual employees. For contracts paid in U.S. dollars, the 
contractor's request for price adjustment shall present data reflecting:
    (1) The exchange rate in effect on the date of the contractor's 
proposal that was accepted for the basic contract; and
    (2) The current exchange rate and its effect on payment of workers 
in local currency. The allowable adjustment shall be limited to the 
extent to which increases in direct service labor costs due to host 
country law changes are not offset by exchange rate gains.
    (e) Only direct cost changes mandated by enacted laws shall be 
considered for adjustment under this contract. Changes for purposes of 
maintaining parity of pay between employees at the minimum mandated 
levels and employees already paid at levels above the newly mandated 
minimums shall not be considered. Therefore, if the contractor elects to 
increase payments to employees who are already being paid at or above 
the mandated amounts, such increased costs shall be borne solely by the 
contractor and shall not be justification for an increase in the hourly 
and monthly rates under this contract.
    (f) Any request for adjustment shall be presented by signature of an 
officer or general partner of the contractor having overall 
responsibility for the conduct of the contractor's affairs.
    (g) No adjustment shall be made to the contract price that relates 
to any indirect, overhead, or fixed costs, profit or fee. Only the 
changes in direct service labor wages (and any benefits based directly 
on wages) shall be considered by the U.S. Government as basis for 
contract price changes.
    (h) No request by the contractor for an adjustment under this clause 
shall be allowed if asserted after final payment has been made under 
this contract.
    (i) This clause shall only apply to laws enacted by the [insert name 
of country] Government meeting the criterion set forth above in 
paragraph (b). No adjustments shall be made due to currency fluctuations 
in exchange rates.

DOS contracting officer

[[Page 349]]

shall also coordinate with SBA prior to processing any novation 
agreement. The DOS contracting officer may assign contract 
administration functions to a contract administration office.
    (c) The contractor agrees:
    (1) to notify the DOS contracting officer, simultaneous with its 
notification to SBA (as required by SBA's 8(a) regulations), when the 
owner or owners upon whom 8(a) eligibility is based, plan to relinquish 
ownership or control of the concern. Consistent with 15 U.S.C. 
637(a)(21), transfer of ownership or control shall result in termination 
of the contract for convenience, unless SBA waives the requirement for 
termination prior to the actual relinquishing of ownership and control; 
and,
    (2) to adhere to the requirements of FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on

 Section 8(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as Amended (AUG 
                                  1999)

    (a) Section 8(a) of the U.S. Export Administration Act of 1979, as 
amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)), prohibits compliance by U.S. persons with 
any boycott fostered by a foreign country against a country which is 
friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any 
form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation. The Boycott 
of Israel by Arab League countries is such a boycott, and therefore, the 
following actions, if taken with intent to comply with, further, or 
support the Arab League Boycott of Israel, are prohibited activities 
under the Export Administration Act:
    (1) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to do business 
with or in Israel, with any Israeli business concern, or with any 
national or resident of Israel, or with any other person, pursuant to an 
agreement of, or a request from or on behalf of a boycotting country;
    (2) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to employ or 
otherwise discriminating against any person on the basis of race, 
religion, sex, or national origin of that person or of any owner, 
officer, director, or employee of such person;
    (3) Furnishing information with respect to the race, religion, or 
national origin of any U.S. person or of any owner, officer, director, 
or employee of such U.S. person;
    (4) Furnishing information about whether any person has, has had, or 
proposes to have any business relationship (including a relationship by 
way of sale, purchase, legal or commercial representation, shipping or 
other transport, insurance, investment, or supply) with or in the State 
of Israel, with any business concern organized under the laws of the 
State of Israel, with any Israeli national or resident, or with any 
person which is known or believed to be restricted from having any 
business relationship with or in Israel;
    (5) Furnishing information about whether any person is a member of, 
has made contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved 
in the activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which 
supports the State of Israel; and,
    (6) Paying, honoring, confirming, or otherwise implementing a letter 
of credit which contains any condition or requirement against doing 
business with the State of Israel.
    (b) Under Section 8(a), the following types of activities are not 
forbidden ``compliance

[[Page 350]]

with the boycott,'' and are therefore exempted from Section 8(a)'s 
prohibitions listed in paragraphs (a)(1)-(6) above:
    (1) Complying or agreeing to comply with requirements:
    (i) Prohibiting the import of goods or services from Israel or goods 
produced or services provided by any business concern organized under 
the laws of Israel or by nationals or residents of Israel; or,
    (ii) Prohibiting the shipment of goods to Israel on a carrier of

document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the name of 
the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the supplier of the 
shipment or the name of the provider of other services, except that no 
information knowingly furnished or conveyed in response to such 
requirements may be stated in negative, blacklisting, or similar 
exclusionary terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of 
shipments as may be permitted by such regulations in order to comply 
with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks and 
confiscation;
    (3) Complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business 
with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or 
national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurance, suppliers of 
services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods 
which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when 
imported into the boycotting country;
    (4) Complying or agreeing to comply with the export requirements of 
the boycotting country relating to shipments or transshipments of 
exports to Israel, to any business concern of or organized under the 
laws of Israel, or to any national or resident of Israel;
    (5) Compliance by an individual or agreement by an individual to 
comply with the immigration or passport requirements of any country with 
respect to such individual or any member of such individual's family or 
with requests for information regarding requirements of employment of 
such individual within the boycotting country; and,
    (6) Compliance by a U.S. person resident in a foreign country or 
agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country with 
respect to his or her activities exclusively therein, and such 
regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the 
laws or regulations of that foreign country governing imports into such 
country of trademarked, trade named, or similarly specifically 
identifiable products, or components of products for his or her own use,

    As prescribed in 632.705-70, insert the following clause:

                     Limitation of Funds (AUG 1999)

    (a) Of the total price in Section B (or the ``Prices'' section), 
only the amount stated on the contract award document or subsequent 
modifications is now available for payment and obligated under this 
contract. It is anticipated that from time to time, additional funds 
will be obligated under the contract until the total price of the 
contract is obligated.
    (b) The Government is not obligated to pay or reimburse the 
contractor more than the amount obligated pursuant to this clause. The 
contractor agrees to perform the contract up to the point at which the 
total amount paid and payable by the Government (including amounts 
payable for subcontracts and settlement costs if this contract is 
terminated for convenience) approximates but does not exceed the total 
amount obligated.
    (c)(1) It is contemplated that funds now obligated under this 
contract will cover the work to be performed until [contracting officer 
insert date].
    (2) If the contractor considers the funds obligated under this 
contract to be insufficient to cover the work to be performed until that 
date, or another date agreed to by the parties, the contractor shall 
notify the contracting officer in writing and indicate the date on which 
it expects expended funds to approximate 75 percent of the total amount 
obligated. The notice shall state the estimated amount of additional 
funds required to continue performance through the date specified in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this clause or another date agreed to by the 
parties.
    (3) If, after notification is provided pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) 
of this clause, additional funds are not obligated, or an earlier date 
than the date in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause is not agreed to, the 
contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance under this 
contract (including actions under the termination clause of this 
contract) beyond the funds obligated for contract performance.
    (d) When additional funds are obligated from time to time for 
continued performance of this contract, the contract shall be modified 
to increase the funds obligated and to indicate the period of 
performance for which funds are applicable. The contractor may notify 
the contracting officer as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this clause 
regarding any additional funds obligated.

[[Page 354]]

    (e) If the contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the 
performance of work under this contract, solely by reason of the 
Government's failure to obligate additional funds in amounts sufficient 
for the timely performance of this contract, an equitable adjustment may 
be made to the price, or time of delivery, or both.
    (f) This clause shall become inoperative upon obligation of funds 
sufficient to cover the full price stated in the contract, except for 
rights and obligations then existing under this clause.
    (g) Nothing in this clause shall affect the Government's right to 
terminate the contract for convenience or default.

    (a) General. The contractor shall provide and maintain work 
environments and procedures which will safeguard the public and 
Government personnel, property, materials, supplies, and equipment 
exposed to contractor operations and activities; avoid interruptions of 
Government operations and delays in project completion dates; and, 
control costs in the performance of this contract. For these purposes, 
the contractor shall:
    (1) Provide appropriate safety barricades, signs and signal lights;
    (2) Comply with the standards issued by any local government 
authority having jurisdiction over occupational health and safety 
issues; and,
    (3) Ensure that any additional measures the contracting officer 
determines to be reasonably necessary for this purpose are taken.
    (4) [The contracting officer shall specify additional requirements 
regarding safety if the work involves scaffolding or other work at 
heights above 2 meters, trenches or other excavation greater than 1 
meter, earth moving equipment, electrical hazards, work in confined 
spaces (limited exits, potential for oxygen less than 19.5%, toxic or 
combustible atmosphere, potential for solid or liquid engulfment, or 
other hazards considered to be immediately dangerous to life or health 
such as water tanks, transformer vaults, sewers, cisterns, etc.), or 
hazardous materials (especially those used indoors, e.g., paints, 
solvents, etc.).]
    (b) Records. The contractor shall maintain an accurate record of 
exposure data on all accidents incident to work performed under this 
contract resulting in death, traumatic injury, occupational disease, or 
damage to or theft of property, materials, supplies, or equipment. The 
contractor shall report this data in the manner prescribed by the 
contracting officer.
    (c) Subcontracts. The contractor shall be responsible for its 
subcontractors' compliance with this clause.
    (d) Written program. Before commencing work, the contractor shall:
    (1) Submit a written plan for implementing this clause; and,
    (2) Meet with the contracting officer to discuss and develop a 
mutual understanding relative to administration of the overall safety 
program.
    (e) Notification. The contracting officer shall notify the 
contractor of any non-compliance with these requirements and the 
corrective actions required. This notice, when delivered to the 
contractor or the contractor's representative on site, shall be deemed 
sufficient notice of the non-compliance and corrective action required. 
After receiving the notice, the contractor shall immediately take 
corrective action. If the contractor fails or refuses to promptly take 
corrective action, the contracting officer may issue an order suspending 
all or part of the work until satisfactory corrective action has been 
taken. The contractor shall not be entitled to any equitable adjustment 
of the contract price or extension of the performance schedule on any 
suspension of work order issued under this clause.

    (a) The contractor shall obtain a Department of State building pass

Passes will be issued by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Office of 
Procedural Security, Domestic Facilities Division. They shall be used

Memorial Day
Independence Day

Any other day designated by Federal law, Executive Order, or 
Presidential Proclamation.

    (b) When any such day falls on a Saturday, the preceding Friday is 
observed; when any such day falls on a Sunday, the following Monday is 
observed. Observance of such days by Government personnel shall not be 
cause for additional period of performance or entitlement to 
compensation except as set forth in the contract. If the contractor's 
personnel work on a holiday, no form of holiday or other premium 
compensation will be reimbursed either as a direct or indirect cost, 
unless authorized pursuant to an overtime clause elsewhere in this 
contract.
    (c) When the Department of State grants administrative leave to its 
Government employees, assigned contractor personnel in Government 
facilities shall also be dismissed. However, the contractor agrees to 
continue to provide sufficient personnel to perform round-the-clock 
requirements of critical tasks already in operation or scheduled, and 
shall be guided by the instructions issued by the contracting officer or 
his/her duly authorized representative.
    (d) For fixed-price contracts, if services are not required or 
provided because the building is closed due to inclement weather, 
unanticipated holidays declared by the President, failure of Congress to 
appropriate funds, or similar reasons, deductions will be computed as 
follows:
    (1) The deduction rate in dollars per day will be equal to the per 
month contract price divided by 21 days per month.
    (2) The deduction rate in dollars per day will be multiplied by the 
number of days services are not required or provided. If services are 
provided for portions of days, appropriate adjustment will be made by 
the contracting officer to ensure that the contractor is compensated for 
services provided.
    (e) If administrative leave is granted to contractor personnel as a 
result of conditions stipulated in any ``Excusable Delays'' clause of 
this contract, it will be without loss to the contractor. The cost of 
salaries and wages to the contractor for the period of any such excused 
absence shall be a reimbursable item of direct cost hereunder for

employees whose regular time is normally charged, and a reimbursable 
item of indirect cost for employees whose time is normally charged 
indirectly in accordance with the contractor's accounting policy.

    (a) Each packing box shall be of solid construction in accordance 
with best commercial practices and sufficiently strong in direct ratio 
to the weight of the contents to withstand excessively rough handling 
while in transit overseas. It shall be constructed of lumber that is 
well seasoned, reasonably sound, free from bad cross grain and from 
knots or knotholes that interfere with nailing or that occupy more than 
\1/3\ of the width of the piece of lumber. Box shall be constructed with 
three-way corners and diagonal bracing. All nails shall be cement-
coated, of correct size and properly spaced to avoid splitting or 
warping, and shall be driven into the grain of the wood. Dimension of 
lumber shall be in accordance with the following table, dependent upon

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Each box shall be lined with waterproof paper and shall be bound 
with 19.05mm<gr-thn-eq> steel straps firmly stapled in position to 
prevent the straps from slipping off the box. Articles must be secured 
and braced inside the shipping container to prevent the articles from 
shifting.
    (c) Packing cases weighing 453.5kg and more must be equipped with 
skids. Each skid shall consist of two end sections of 50.8 x 152.4mm 
lumber placed flat and a center section of 50.8 x 101.6mm lumber placed 
flat and then arranged in line to provide 254mm forklift spaces between 
center and end sections. When goods are ready for shipment, the 
Contractor shall prepare four (4) copies of a packing list, indicating 
the contract and, if applicable, order numbers; case number; itemized 
list of contents; net and gross weights in kilograms; and outside 
dimensions, including all clears, of each shipping container. The 
Contractor shall provide three (3) copies of the packing list to the 
U.S. Despatch Agent as specified in the contract or order. The 
Contractor shall place the fourth copy of the packing list in packing 
case number one, which shall be marked as such so that it is easily 
identified by the consignee. Upon receipt of the packing list, the 
Despatch Agent will furnish export marks and instructions regarding 
shipment

to the port specified, depending upon steamer services available at the 
time.
    (d) The export marks shall be stenciled on one side of each box 
reserved for that purpose, and the appropriate case number stenciled in 
the lower left-hand corner of the same side. The contract and, as 
necessary, order numbers, net and gross weights in kilograms shall be 
stenciled on the same side. However, if the size of the box is too small 
to accommodate all stenciling on one side, the contract and order 
numbers and weights may be stenciled on the side opposite that used for 
the export marks and case number.
    (e) The contract and, as necessary, order numbers must appear on all 
containers and papers relating to this clause.
