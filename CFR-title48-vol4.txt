                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1996), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

                               THIS TITLE

    Title 48--Federal Acquisition Regulations System is composed of 
eight volumes. The chapters in these volumes are arranged as follows: 
Chapter 1 (parts 1 to 51), chapter 1 (parts 52 to 99), chapter 2 (parts 
201 to 251 and parts 252 to 299), chapters 3 to 6, chapters 7 to 14, 
chapters 15 to 28 and chapter 29 to end. The contents of these volumes 
represent all current regulations codified under this title of the CFR 
as of October 1, 1996.

    The Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 1 are those 
government-wide acquisition regulations jointly issued by the General 
Services Administration, the Department of Defense, and the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Chapters 2 through 99 are 
acquisition regulations issued by individual government agencies. Parts 
1 to 69 in each of chapters 2 through 99 are reserved for agency 
regulations implementing the Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 
1 and are numerically keyed to them. Parts 70 to 99 in chapters 2 
through 99 contain agency regulations supplementing the Federal 
acquisition regulations.

    The OMB control numbers for the Federal Acquisition Regulations 
System appear in section 1.106 of chapter 1. For the convenience of the 
user section 1.106 is reprinted in the Finding Aids section of the 
second volume containing chapter 1 (parts 52 to 99).

    The two volumes containing chapter 1 include an index to the Federal 
acquisition regulations. The second volume, containing chapter 1 (parts 
52 to 99), includes contract clauses and forms.

    For this volume, Ann Elise Maso was Chief Editor. The Code of 
Federal Regulations publication program is under the direction of 
Richard L. Claypoole, assisted by Alomha S. Morris.

<R05>
Sec. 252.203-7000  Statutory prohibitions on compensation to former Department of Defense employees.

    As prescribed in 203.170-4, use the following clause:

 Statutory Prohibition on Compensation to Former Department of Defense 
                          Employees (NOV 1995)

    (a) Definitions.
    As used in this clause--
    (1) Armed Forces means the uniformed military services, excluding 
the U.S. Coast Guard.
    (2) Compensation means any payment, gift, benefit, reward, favor, or 
gratuity which is provided directly or indirectly for services rendered 
by the person accepting such payment, gift, benefit, reward, favor, or 
gratuity, and which has a fair market value in excess of $250. 
Compensation is indirectly provided if it is paid to an entity other 
than the individual, specifically in exchange for services performed by 
the individual.
    (3) Defense contractor means an entity (including affiliates and 
subsidiaries which clearly engage in the performance of Department of 
Defense (DoD) contracts) that contracts directly with the DoD to supply 
goods or services. ``Defense contractor'' does not include a State or 
local government or any person who contracts to supply the Department of 
Defense only commercial items.
    (4) Designated agency ethics official means a DoD officer or 
employee who has been appointed to administer the provisions of the 
Ethics in Government Act, as amended.
    (5) Former DoD employee means a person who served in the DoD in a 
civilian position for which the rate of pay was equal to or greater than 
the minimum rate of pay for grade GS-13 of the General Schedule, or 
served in the Armed Forces in a pay grade of 04 or higher.
    (6) Former DoD official means--
    (i) A former DoD employee who spent the majority of working days 
during the last two years of DoD service performing a procurement 
function relating to:
    (A) A DoD contract, at a site or plant that was owned or operated by 
the Contractor, and which was the principal location of such person's 
performance of that procurement function; or
    (B) A major defense system and, in the performance of such function, 
participated on any occasion personally and substantially in a manner 
involving decision making responsibilities with respect to a contract 
for that system through contact with the Contractor;
    (ii) An individual who served in a civilian position for which the 
rate of pay is equal to or greater than the minimum rate of pay for a 
Senior Executive Service position or other executive position at the 
same or higher level, and an individual who served in the Armed Forces 
in the pay grade of 07 or higher, if such individual during the last two 
years of DoD service--
    (A) Acted as one of the primary Government representatives in the 
negotiation with a defense contractor of a DoD contractual action in an 
amount in excess of $10 million; or
    (B) Acted as one of the primary Government representatives in the 
negotiation of a settlement of an unresolved claim of such a defense 
contractor in an amount in excess of $10 million. An unresolved claim 
shall be, for the purposes of this section, valued by the greater of the 
amount of the claim or the amount of the settlement.
    (7) Major defense contractor means any business entity which, during 
the Government fiscal year preceding the Government fiscal year in which 
compensation was first provided to a former DoD employee, was awarded 
DoD contracts in a total amount of $10 million or more.
    (8) Major defense system means a combination of elements that will 
function together to produce the capability required to fulfill a 
mission need. Elements may include hardware, equipment, software, or any 
combination thereof, but exclude construction or other improvements to 
real property. A system shall be considered a major defense system if--

[[Page 10]]

    (i) The DoD is responsible for the system and the total expenditures 
(based on fiscal year 1980 constant dollars) for research, development, 
test and evaluation for the system, are estimated to exceed $75 million 
or the eventual total expenditure for procurement is estimated to exceed 
$300 million; or
    (ii) The system is designated a major system by the head of the 
agency responsible for the system.
    (9) Negotiation means exchanges of positions between representatives 
of the Government and a contractor with the view of reaching agreement 
regarding respective liabilities of the parties on a particular contract 
or claim. It includes deliberations regarding contract specifications, 
terms of delivery, allowability of costs, pricing of change orders, etc.
    (10) Primary Government representative means, if more than one 
Government representative is involved in any particular transaction, the 
official or officials supervising the Government's effort in the matter. 
To act as a ``representative'' requires personal and substantial 
participation in the transaction, by personal presence, telephone 
conversation, or similar involvement with representatives of a 
contractor.
    (11) Procurement-related function (or procurement function) means 
any function relating to--
    (i) The negotiation, award, administration, or approval of a 
contract;
    (ii) The selection of a contractor;
    (iii) The approval of a change in a contract;
    (iv) The performance of quality assurance, operational and 
developmental testing, the approval of payment, or auditing under a 
contract; or
    (v) The management of a procurement program.
    (b) Prohibition on compensation. (1) 10 U.S.C. 2397b and 2397c 
prohibit a major defense contractor from offering or providing any 
compensation valued in excess of $250 to a former DoD official who left 
DoD service on or after April 16, 1987, and who, while employed by DoD, 
performed procurement-related functions in connection with that defense 
contractor. This prohibition runs for the two year period beginning on 
the date of the official's separation from service in DoD.
    (2) The Contractor, if a major defense contractor, agrees not to 
provide, for the two year period, any compensation to the former DoD 
official.
    (3) DoD employees may request from their Designated Agency Ethics 
Official (DAEO) a written opinion on the applicability of 10 U.S.C. 
2397b prior to the acceptance of compensation. If the opinion of the 
DAEO is that the law is not applicable, and that the individual may 
accept compensation from the Contractor, there shall be a conclusive 
presumption that the offering and the acceptance of such compensation is 
not a violation of the statute.
    (c) Report concerning former DoD employees. (1) The Contractor shall 
submit a separate written report, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this clause, for each calendar year covered by this contract (extending 
through final payment) if the calendar year commenced after the end of a 
Government fiscal year in which the Contractor was awarded one or more 
DoD contracts aggregating $10 million or more. In multidivisional 
corporations, the corporate headquarters, and each segment which 
contracts directly with the Government, shall report separately. Each 
report shall list those persons employed or otherwise compensated, who 
are former DoD employees who left service on or after April 16, 1987, 
if--
    (i) They were compensated by the Contractor during the reporting 
period; and
    (ii) The compensation was provided within two years after the person 
left service in the DoD.
    (2) The report shall contain:
    (i) Each person's name and the agency in which the person was 
employed or served on active duty during the last two years of service 
with DoD;
    (ii) Each person's job title(s) during the last two years of service 
with DoD, and a list of major defense systems on which each person 
performed any work;
    (iii) A complete description (exclusive of proprietary information) 
of any work that each person is performing, or did perform, on behalf of 
the Contractor during the calendar year covered by the report. If the 
work is classified, the Contractor may use a generalized description 
which will not compromise its classified nature;
    (iv) An identification of each major defense system on which each 
individual has performed any work on behalf of the Contractor.
    (3) Submit each report not later than April 1 of the year following 
the end of the calendar year for which the report is being made. Send 
reports to the Office of the Assistant General Counsel (Legal Counsel), 
Standards of Conduct Office, Attn: OAGC/LC, Pentagon, Washington, DC 
20301-1600.
    (4) A properly executed DD Form 1787 (Employment, Report of DoD and 
Defense Related) may be submitted to satisfy the reporting requirement 
as to any single person.
    (5) The Contractor need not submit duplicate reports to the 
Government. Submission of a report meeting the requirements of this 
clause, under another, concurrent contract with DoD will satisfy the 
reporting requirement of this contract.
    (d) Penalties for failure to comply--(1) Civil fines. A Contractor 
who knowingly offers or provides any compensation to a former DoD 
official in violation of the statute, and who

[[Page 11]]

knew or should have known that the acceptance of such compensation would 
be in violation of such statute, shall be subject to a civil fine, not 
to exceed $500,000.
    (2) Liquidated damages. (i) For each knowing violation of the 
statutory prohibition on providing compensation, the Contractor agrees 
to pay to the Government as liquidated damages the greater of either 
$100,000, or three times the total amount of compensation paid by the 
Contractor to the former DoD official during the period in which such 
compensation was in violation of the statutory prohibition.
    (ii) Liability for liquidated damages under this clause survives 
final payment under this contract and may be recouped against payments 
due under other contracts with the Contractor.
    (iii) Liquidated damages will be computed based upon the number of 
actual violations by the Contractor, and not on the number of contracts 
in which this clause appears.
    (3) Administrative penalty. If the Contractor knowingly fails to 
file a report in accordance with paragraph (c) of this clause, the 
Contractor shall be subject to an administrative penalty not to exceed 
$10,000. The final determination of the penalty to be charged to the 
Contractor shall be made by the Secretary of Defense or designee after 
the Contractor is afforded an opportunity for an agency hearing on the 
record in accordance with agency hearing procedures. The Secretary's 
determination shall form a part of the record and shall be subject to 
judicial review under chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code.
    (e) The rights and remedies under this clause are in addition to, 
and do not limit, any rights afforded the Government under this contract 
or as otherwise provided by law.

                             (End of clause)

the item) is not in excess of the Contractor's established price in 
effect on the date set for opening of bids (or the contract date if this 
is a negotiated contract) for like quantities of the same item. This 
price is the net price after applying any applicable standard trade 
discounts offered by the Contractor from its catalog, list, or schedule 
price.
    (c) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of 
the amount and effective date of each decrease in any established price.

[[Page 21]]

effective date of the decrease in the Contractor's established price.
    (3) This contract shall be modified accordingly.
    (4) The Contractor shall certify on each invoice that each unit

increased by the same percentage that the established price is 
increased, and this contract shall be modified accordingly, provided--
    (1) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under 
this contract shall not exceed 10 percent of the original contract unit 
price;
    (2) The increased contract unit price shall be effective on the 
effective date of the increase in the applicable established price if 
the Contractor's written request is received by the Contracting Officer 
within ten days of the change. If it is not, the effective date of the 
increased unit price shall be the date of receipt of the request by the 
Contracting Officer; and
    (3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities 
scheduled for delivery before the effective date of the increased 
contract unit price unless the Contractor's failure to deliver before 
that date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault 
or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default 
clause of this contract.
    (4) The Contracting Officer shall not execute a modification 
incorporating an increase in a contract unit price under this clause 
until the increase is verified.
    (e) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor's written 
request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either 
party, any portion of the contract affected by the requested increase 
and not delivered at the time of such cancellation, except as follows--
    (1) The Contractor may after that time deliver any items which the

within ten days after the Contractor receives the cancellation notice, 
were completed or in the process of manufacture at the time of receipt 
of the cancellation notice.
    (2) The Government shall pay for those items at the contract unit 
price increased to the extent provided by paragraph (d) of this clause.

this clause, or if there is no cancellation, the Contractor shall 
continue deliveries according to the delivery schedule of the contract. 
The Contractor shall be paid for those deliveries at the contract unit 
price increased to the extent provided by paragraph (d) of this clause.

[[Page 22]]

accounting period shall be used in lieu of month.
    (b) Each contract unit price shall be subject to revision, under the 
terms of this clause, to reflect changes in the cost of labor and steel. 
For purpose of this price revision, the proportion of the contract unit 
price attributable to costs of labor not otherwise included in the price 
of the steel item identified under the base steel index definition in 
paragraph (a) shall be ______ percent, and the proportion of the 
contract unit price attributable to the cost of steel shall be ______ 
percent. (See note 5.)
    (c)(1) Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the labor index 
shall be computed by dividing the total straight time earnings of the 
Contractor's employees in the shop identified in paragraph (a) for any 
given month by the total number of straight time hours worked by those 
employees in that month.
    (2) Any revision in a contract unit price to reflect changes in the

percent of the contract unit price by a fraction, of which the numerator 
shall be the current steel index and the denominator shall be the base 
steel index); and
    (iii) The amount equal to ______ percent of the original contract 
unit price (representing that portion of the unit price which relates 
neither to the cost of labor nor the cost of steel, and which is 
therefore not subject to revision (see note 5)).
    (4) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under 
this contract shall not exceed ten percent of the original contract unit 
price.
    (5) Computations shall be made to the nearest one-hundredth of one 
cent.
    (f)(1) Pending any revisions of the contract unit prices, the 
Contractor shall be paid the contract unit price for deliveries made.
    (2) Within 30 days after final delivery (or such other period as may 
be authorized by the Contracting Officer), the Contractor shall furnish 
a statement identifying and certifying the correctness of--
    (i) The average straight time hourly earnings of the Contractor's 
employees in the shop identified in paragraph (a) that are relevant to 
the computations of the base labor index and the current labor index; 
and
    (ii) The Contractor's established prices (see note 6), including all 
applicable extras for like quantities of the item that are relevant to 
the computation of the base steel index and the current steel index.
    (3) Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall 
make available all records used in the computation of the labor indices.
    (4) Upon receipt of the certified statement, the Contracting Officer 
will compute the revised contract unit prices and modify the contract 
accordingly. No modification to this contract will be made pursuant to 
this clause until the Contracting Officer has verified the revised 
established price (see note 6).
    (g)(1) In the event any item of this contract is subject to a total 
or partial termination for convenience, the month in which the 
Contractor receives notice of the termination, if prior to the month in 
which delivery is required, shall be considered the month in which 
delivery of the terminated item is required for the purposes of 
determining the current labor and steel indices under paragraphs (c) and 
(d).
    (2) For any item which is not terminated for convenience, the month 
in which delivery is required under the contract shall continue to apply 
for determining those indices with respect to the quantity of the non-
terminated item.
    (3) If this contract is terminated for default, any price revision 
shall be limited to the quantity of the item which has been delivered by 
the Contractor and accepted by the Government prior to receipt by the 
Contractor of the notice of termination.
    (h) If the Contractor's failure to make delivery of any required 
quantity arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault 
or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the clause of 
this contract entitled ``Default,'' the quantity not delivered shall be 
delivered as promptly as possible after the cessation of the cause of 
the failure, and the delivery schedule set forth in this contract shall 
be amended accordingly.

the time specified in a job order or any extension;
    (2) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of the job order;

arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or 
negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include acts of 
God or of the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its 
sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine 
restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, and unusually severe weather.
    (c) If the Contractor's failure to perform is caused by the default 
of a subcontractor, and if such default arises out of causes beyond the 
control of both the Contractor and subcontractor, and without the fault 
or negligence of either, the Contractor shall not be liable for any 
excess costs for failure to perform, unless the supplies or services to 
be furnished by the subcontractor were obtainable from other sources in 
sufficient time to

determined by the Contracting Office to be necessary for that purpose.
    (iii) If the cost to the Government of the work procured or 
completed (after adjusting such cost to exclude the effect of changes in 
the plans and specifications made subsequent to the date of termination) 
exceeds the price fixed for work under the job order (after adjusting 
such price on account of changes in the plans and specifications made 
before the date of termination), the Contractor, or the Contractor's 
surety, if any, shall be liable for such excess.
    (2) The Government, in addition to any other rights provided in this 
clause, may require the Contractor to transfer title and delivery to the 
Government, in the manner and to the extent directed by the Contracting

protect and preserve property in possession of the Contractor in which 
the Government has an interest.
    (ii) The Government shall pay to the Contractor the job order price 
for completed items of work delivered to and accepted by the Government, 
and the amount agreed upon by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer 
for manufacturing materials delivered to and accepted by the Government, 
and for the protection and preservation of property. Failure to agree 
shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of

the delay arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault 
or negligence of the Contractor. Subject to the provisions of the 
Disputes clause of the Master Agreement, the Contracting Officer shall 
ascertain the facts and the extent of the delay and shall extend the 
time for performance when in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, 
the findings of fact justify an extension.
    (g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this 
clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights 
and remedies provided by law under this agreement.

against the content of products delivered in any other monthly period.
    (d) The Contractor shall identify the tare weights of all containers 
on the shipping documents, and furnish a copy to the Government 
inspector at destination. The tare weight of dispenser containers shall

are included in a single delivery, the Contractor shall furnish the tare 
weight and identifying characteristics of each type of container.
    (e) The Government shall inspect a representative sample of the line

within the time period specified by the Contracting Officer, the 
Government has the right to direct the Contractor to cease performance 
on all or part of this contract. The Contractor shall not resume

corrective action was effective and the Contracting Officer so informs 
the Contractor.
    (4) The Contracting Officer may remove Government personnel at any 
time the Contractor is in noncompliance with any safety requirement of 
this clause.
    (5) If the direction to cease work or the removal of Government

enforcement of the safety requirements of this contract, this does not

[[Page 47]]

including this paragraph (g), in every subcontract that involves 
ammunition or explosives.
    (i) The clause shall include a provision allowing authorized

programs, implementation, and facilities as the Government determines 
necessary.
    (ii) Note: The Government Contracting Officer or authorized 
representative shall notify the prime Contractor of all findings 
concerning subcontractor safety and compliance with the manual. The 
Contracting Officer or authorized representative may furnish copies to 
the subcontractor. The Contractor in turn shall communicate directly 
with the subcontractor, substituting its name for references to ``the 
Government''. The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors shall also 
include provisions to allow direction to cease performance of the 
subcontract if a serious uncorrected or recurring safety deficiency 
potentially causes an imminent hazard to DoD personnel, property, or 
contract performance.
    (2) The Contractor agrees to ensure that the subcontractor complies 
with all contract safety requirements. The Contractor will determine the 
best method for verifying the adequacy of the subcontractor's 
compliance.
    (3) The Contractor shall ensure that the subcontractor understands 
and agrees to the Government's right to access to the subcontractor's 
facilities, personnel, and safety program documentation to perform 
safety surveys. The Government performs these safety surveys of 
subcontractor facilities solely to prevent the occurrence of any mishap 
which would endanger the safety of DoD personnel or otherwise adversely 
impact upon the Government's contractual interests.
    (4) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer or 
authorized representative before issuing any subcontract when it 
involves ammunition or explosives. If the proposed subcontract 
represents a change in the place of performance, the Contractor shall 
request approval for such change in accordance with the clause of this 
contract entitled ``Change in Place of Performance--Ammunition and 
Explosives''.

substances included in Schedules I and II, as defined by section 802(6) 
of title 21 of the United States Code, the possession of which is

not mean the use of a controlled substance pursuant to a valid 
prescription or other uses authorized by law.
    (b) The Contractor agrees to institute and maintain a program for 
achieving the objective of a drug-free work force. While this clause 
defines criteria for such a program, contractors are encouraged to 
implement alternative approaches comparable to the criteria in paragraph 
(c) that are designed to achieve the objectives of this clause.
    (c) Contractor programs shall include the following, or appropriate 
alternatives:
    (1) Employee assistance programs emphasizing high level direction, 
education, counseling, rehabilitation, and coordination with available 
community resources;

[[Page 48]]

illegal drug use by Contractor employees;
    (3) Provision for self-referrals as well as supervisory referrals to 
treatment with maximum respect for individual confidentiality consistent 
with safety and security issues;
    (4) Provision for identifying illegal drug users, including testing 
on a controlled and carefully monitored basis. Employee drug testing 
programs shall be established taking account of the following:
    (i) The Contractor shall establish a program that provides for 
testing for the use of illegal drugs by employees in sensitive 
positions. The extent of and criteria for such testing shall be 
determined by the Contractor based on considerations that include the 
nature of the work being performed under the contract, the employee's 
duties, the efficient use of Contractor resources, and the risks to 
health, safety, or national security that could result from the failure 
of an employee adequately to discharge his or her position.
    (ii) In addition, the Contractor may establish a program for 
employee drug testing--
    (A) When there is a reasonable suspicion that an employee uses 
illegal drugs; or
    (B) When an employee has been involved in an accident or unsafe 
practice;
    (C) As part of or as a follow-up to counseling or rehabilitation for 
illegal drug use;
    (D) As part of a voluntary employee drug testing program.
    (iii) The Contractor may establish a program to test applicants for 
employment for illegal drug use.
    (iv) For the purpose of administering this clause, testing for 
illegal drugs may be limited to those substances for which testing is 
prescribed by section 2.1 of subpart B of the ``Mandatory Guidelines for 
Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs'' (53 FR 11980 (April 11 1988)), 
issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.
    (d) Contractors shall adopt appropriate personnel procedures to deal 
with employees who are found to be using drugs illegally. Contractors 
shall not allow any employee to remain on duty or perform in a sensitive 
position who is found to use illegal drugs until such times as the 
Contractor, in accordance with procedures established by the Contractor, 
determines that the employee may perform in such a position.
    (e) The provisions of this clause pertaining to drug testing program 
shall not apply to the extent they are inconsistent with state or local 
law, or with an existing collective bargaining agreement; provided that 
with respect to the latter, the Contractor agrees that those issues that 
are in conflict will be a subject of negotiation at the next collective 
bargaining session.

    (ii) An end product manufactured in the United States if the cost of 
its qualifying country components and its components which are mined, 
produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the 
cost of all its components. The cost of components shall include 
transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the end product 
and U.S. duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate may be 
issued). Consider a component to have been mined, produced, or 
manufactured in the United States (regardless of its source in fact) if 
the end product in which it is incorporated is manufactured in the 
United States and the component is of a class or kind--
    (A) Determined to be not mined, produced, or manufactured in the 
United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial 
quantities and of a satisfactory quality; or
    (B) Which the Secretary concerned determines would be inconsistent 
with the public interest to apply the restrictions of the Buy American 
Act.
    (6) Nonqualifying country end product means an end product which is 
neither a domestic end product nor a qualifying country end product.
    (7) Qualifying country end product means--
    (i) An unmanufactured end product mined or produced in a qualifying 
country; or
    (ii) An end product manufactured in a qualifying country if the cost 
of the components mined, produced, or manufactured in the qualifying 
country and its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the 
United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components.
    (b) This clause implements the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a-d) in 
a manner that will encourage a favorable international balance of 
payments by providing a preference

[[Page 51]]

to domestic end products over other end products, except for end 
products which are qualifying country end products.
    (c) The Contractor agrees that it will deliver only domestic end 
products unless, in its offer, it specified delivery of other end 
products in the Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Certificate or 
the Buy American Act--Trade Agreements--Balance of Payments Program 
Certificate. An offer certifying that a qualifying country end product 
will be supplied requires the Contractor to deliver a qualifying country 
end product or a domestic end product.
    (d) The offered price of nonqualifying country end products must 
include all applicable duty. Generally, when the Buy American Act is 
applicable, each nonqualifying country offer is adjusted for the purpose 
of evaluation by adding 50 percent of the offer, inclusive of duty.

Notice of Prohibition of Certain Contracts With Foreign Entities for the 
          Conduct of Ballistic Missile Defense RDT&E (May 1994)

    (a) Definitions.
    (1) Competent means the ability of an offeror to satisfy the 
requirements of the solicitation. This determination is based on a 
comprehensive assessment of each offeror's proposal including 
consideration of the specific areas of evaluation criteria in the 
relative order of importance described in the solicitation.
    (2) Foreign firm means a business entity owned or controlled by one 
or more foreign nationals or a business entity in which more than 50 
percent of the stock is owned or controlled by one or more foreign 
nationals.

[[Page 60]]

    (3) U.S. firm means a business entity other than a foreign firm.
    (b) This provision implements section 222 of the Defense 
Authorization Act for FYs 1988 and 1989 (Pub. L. 100-180) prohibiting 
the award of certain contracts, for the conduct of Ballistic Missile 
Defense (BMD) Program research, development, test, or evaluation 
(RDT&E), to foreign governments or firms.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this provision, any funds 
appropriated to, or for the use of, the DoD, may not be used to enter 
into or carry out any contract, including any contract awarded as a 
result of a broad agency announcement (BAA), with a foreign government 
or firm if the contract provides for the conduct of RDT&E in connection 
with the BMD. Foreign governments and firms, however, are encouraged to 
submit offers since this provision is not intended to restrict BMD 
access to unique foreign expertise when contract performance requires a 
level of competency unavailable in the United States.
    (d) The prohibition does not apply to a foreign government or firm 
if--
    (1) The contract will be performed within the United States;
    (2) The contract is exclusively for RDT&E in connection with 
antitactical ballistic missile systems;
    (3) The foreign government or firm agrees to share a substantial 
portion of the total contract cost. The foreign share is considered 
substantial where it is equitable with respect to the relative benefits 
to be derived from the contract by the United States and the foreign 
parties. For example, if the contract is more beneficial to the foreign 
party, its share of the costs should be correspondingly higher; or
    (4) The U.S. Government determines that the contract cannot be 
competently performed by a U.S. firm at a price equal to or less than 
the price at which the RDT&E can be performed by a foreign government or 
firm.
    (e) The Offeror hereby certifies that (________) it is (________) is 
not a U.S. firm.

Sec. 252.227-7013  Rights in technical data--Noncommercial items.

    As prescribed in 227.7103-6(a), use the following clause:

        Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items (NOV 1995)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause:
    (1) Computer data base means a collection of data recorded in a form 
capable of being processed by a computer. The term does not include 
computer software.
    (2) Computer program means a set of instructions, rules, or routines 
recorded in a form that is capable of causing a computer to perform a 
specific operation or series of operations.
    (3) Computer software means computer programs, source code, source 
code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, 
processes, flow charts, formulae and related material that would enable 
the software to be reproduced, recreated, or recompiled. Computer 
software does not include computer data bases or computer software 
documentation.
    (4) Computer software documentation means owner's manuals, user's 
manuals, installation instructions, operating instructions, and other 
similar items, regardless of storage medium, that explain the 
capabilities of the computer software or provide instructions for using 
the software.
    (5) Detailed manufacturing or process data means technical data that 
describe the steps, sequences, and conditions of manufacturing, 
processing or assembly used by the manufacturer to produce an item or 
component or to perform a process.
    (6) Developed means that an item, component, or process exists and 
is workable. Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or 
the process practiced. Workability is generally established when the 
item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to 
demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that 
there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, 
how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish 
workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, 
and the state of the art. To be considered ``developed,'' the item, 
component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered 
for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component, 
or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 
35 of the United States Code.
    (7) Developed exclusively at private expense means development was 
accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs 
not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.
    (i) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest 
practicable level.
    (ii) Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than 
the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional 
development costs necessary to complete development shall not be 
considered when determining whether development was at government, 
private, or mixed expense.

[[Page 73]]

    (8) Developed exclusively with government funds means development 
was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.
    (9) Developed with mixed funding means development was accomplished 
partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not 
allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged 
directly to a government contract.
    (10) Form, fit, and function data means technical data that 
describes the required overall physical, functional, and performance 
characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if 
applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to 
permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable 
items.
    (11) Government purpose means any activity in which the United 
States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with 
international or multi-national defense organizations, or sales or 
transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or 
international organizations. Government purposes include competitive 
procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, perform, display, or disclose technical data for commercial 
purposes or authorize others to do so.
    (12) Government purpose rights means the rights to--
    (i) Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose 
technical data within the Government without restriction; and
    (ii) Release or disclose technical data outside the Government and 
authorize persons to whom release or disclosure has been made to use, 
modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose that data for 
United States government purposes.
    (13) Limited rights means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in 
part, within the Government. The Government may not, without the written 
permission of the party asserting limited rights, release or disclose 
the technical data outside the Government, use the technical data for 
manufacture, or authorize the technical data to be used by another 
party, except that the Government may reproduce, release or disclose

    (iii) The Contractor, its subcontractors, and suppliers are not 
required to provide the Government additional rights to use, modify, 
reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data 
furnished to the Government with limited rights. However, if the 
Government desires to obtain additional rights in technical data in 
which it has limited rights, the Contractor agrees to promptly enter 
into negotiations with the Contracting Officer to determine whether 
there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. All technical 
data in which the Contractor has granted the Government additional 
rights shall be listed or described in a license agreement made part of 
the contract. The license shall enumerate the additional rights granted 
the Government in such data.
    (4) Specifically negotiated license rights. The standard license 
rights granted to the Government under paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3)

and to seek relief solely from the party who has improperly used, 
modified, reproduced, released, performed, displayed, or disclosed 
Contractor data marked with restrictive legends.
    (c) Contractor rights in technical data. All rights not granted to 
the Government are retained by the Contractor.
    (d) Third party copyrighted data. The Contractor shall not, without 
the written approval of the Contracting Officer, incorporate any 
copyrighted data in the technical data to be delivered under this 
contract unless the Contractor is the copyright owner or has obtained 
for the Government the license rights necessary to perfect a license or 
licenses in the deliverable data of the appropriate scope set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this clause, and has affixed a statement of the license 
or licenses obtained on behalf of the Government and other persons to 
the data transmittal document.
    (e) Identification and delivery of data to be furnished with 
restrictions on use, release, or disclosure. (1) This paragraph does not 
apply to restrictions based solely on copyright.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this clause, technical 
data that the Contractor asserts should be furnished to the Government 
with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure are identified in an 
attachment to this contract (the Attachment). The Contractor shall not 
deliver any data with restrictive markings unless the data are listed on 
the Attachment.
    (3) In addition to the assertions made in the Attachment, other 
assertions may be identified after award when based on new information 
or inadvertent omissions unless the inadvertent omissions would have 
materially affected the source selection decision. Such identification 
and assertion shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer as soon as 
practicable prior to the scheduled date for delivery of the data, in the 
following format, and signed by an official authorized to contractually 
obligate the Contractor: Identification and Assertion of Restrictions on 
the Government's Use, Release, or Disclosure of Technical Data.
    The Contractor asserts for itself, or the persons identified below, 
that the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose the following 
technical data should be restricted--

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Technical data to be furnished with     Basis for assertion      Asserted rights      Name of person asserting
           restrictions \1\                       \2\                category \3\           restrictions \4\    
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(LIST)................................  (LIST)................  (LIST)...............  (LIST)                   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ If the assertion is applicable to items, components or processes developed at private expense, identify both
  the data and each such item, component, or process.                                                           
\2\ Generally, the development of an item, component, or process at private expense, either exclusively or      
  partially, is the only basis for asserting restrictions on the Government's rights to use, release, or        
  disclose technical data pertaining to such items, components, or processes. Indicate whether development was  
  exclusively or partially at private expense. If development was not at private expense, enter the specific    
  reason for asserting that the Government's rights should be restricted.                                       
\3\ Enter asserted rights category (e.g., government purpose license rights from a prior contract, rights in    
  SBIR data generated under another contract, limited or government purpose rights under this or a prior        
  contract, or specifically negotiated licenses).                                                               
\4\ Corporation, individual, or other person, as appropriate.

                  (End of identification and assertion)

    (4) When requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall 
provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to 
evaluate the Contractor's assertions. The Contracting Officer reserves 
the right to add the Contractor's assertions to the Attachment and 
validate any listed assertion, at a later date, in accordance with the 
procedures of the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data 
clause of this contract.
    (f) Marking requirements. The Contractor, and its subcontractors or 
suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to 
use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical 
data to be delivered under this contract by marking the deliverable data 
subject to restriction. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this 
clause, only the following legends are authorized under this contract: 
the government purpose rights legend at paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; 
the limited rights legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause; or the 
special license rights legend at paragraph (f)(4) of this clause; and/or 
a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.
    (1) General marking instructions. The Contractor, or its 
subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the 
appropriate legend on all technical data that qualify for such markings. 
The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmittal document or 
storage container and, for printed material, each page of the printed 
material containing technical data for which restrictions are asserted. 
When only portions of a page of printed material are subject to the 
asserted restrictions, such portions shall be identified by circling, 
underscoring, with a note, or other appropriate identifier. Technical 
data transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to 
another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. Reproductions 
of technical data or any

[[Page 76]]

portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall also reproduce 
the asserted restrictions.
    (2) Government purpose rights markings. Data delivered or otherwise 
furnished to the Government purpose rights shall be marked as follows:

                        Government Purpose Rights

Contract No.____________________________________________________________

Contractor Name_________________________________________________________

Contractor Address______________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________

Expiration Date_________________________________________________________
    The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose these technical data are restricted by paragraph 
(b)(2) of the Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items clause 
contained in the above identified contract. No restrictions apply after 
the expiration date shown above. Any reproduction of technical data or 
portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the 
markings.

                             (End of legend)

    (3) Limited rights markings. Data delivered or otherwise furnished 
to the Government with limited rights shall be marked with the following 
legend:

                             Limited Rights

Contract No.____________________________________________________________

Contractor Name_________________________________________________________

Contractor Address______________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________
    The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose these technical data are restricted by paragraph 
(b)(3) of the Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items clause 
contained in the above identified contract. Any reproduction of 
technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also 
reproduce the markings. Any person, other than the Government, who has 
been provided access to such data must promptly notify the above named 
Contractor.

                             (End of legend)

    (4) Special license rights markings. (i) Data in which the 
Government's rights stem from a specifically negotiated license shall be 
marked with the following legend:

                         Special License Rights

    The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose these data are restricted by Contract No. 
________________ (Insert contract number) ________________, License No. 
________________ (Insert license identifier) ________________. Any 
reproduction of technical data or portions thereof marked with this 
legend must also reproduce the markings.

                             (End of legend)

    (ii) For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include 
government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see 
paragraph (b)(5) of this clause).
    (5) Pre-existing data markings. If the terms of a prior contract or 
license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to 
use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical 
data deliverable under this contract, and those restrictions are still 
applicable, the Contractor may mark such data with the appropriate 
restrictive legend for which the data qualified under the prior contract 
or license. The marking procedures in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause 
shall be followed.
    (g) Contractor procedures and records. Throughout performance of 
this contract, the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers that 
will deliver technical data with other than unlimited rights, shall--
    (1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to 
assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the 
terms of this clause; and
    (2) Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any 
restrictive markings on technical data delivered under this contract.
    (h) Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings. (1) 
Unjustified technical data markings. The rights and obligations of the 
parties regarding the validation of restrictive markings on technical 
data furnished or to be furnished under this contract are contained in 
the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this 
contract. Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning 
inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the 
Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with 
the procedures in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data clause of this contract, a restrictive marking is determined to be 
unjustified.
    (2) Nonconforming technical data markings. A nonconforming marking 
is a marking placed on technical data delivered or otherwise furnished 
to the Government under this contract that is not in the format 
authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings is not 
subject to the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data 
clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the 
Contractor of a nonconforming marking and the Contractor fails to remove 
or correct such marking within sixty (60) days, the Government may 
ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any 
nonconforming marking.

[[Page 77]]

    (i) Relation to patents. Nothing contained in this clause shall 
imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as 
affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to 
the Government under any patent.
    (j) Limitation on charges for rights in technical data. (1) The 
Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including, but 
not limited to, license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights 
in technical data to be delivered under this contract when--
    (i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater 
rights in the data; or
    (ii) The data are available to the public without restrictions.
    (2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause--
    (i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any 
tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in 
subcontractor or supplier technical data, if the subcontractor or 
supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government 
contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and
    (ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, 
or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data will 
be delivered.
    (k) Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers. (1) The Contractor 
shall ensure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers 
under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10 U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, 
and delivery processes of paragraph (e) of this clause are recognized 
and protected.
    (2) Whenever any technical data for noncommercial items is to be 
obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government 
under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in the 
subcontract or other contractual instrument, and require its 
subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to 
identify the parties. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or 
diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher-tier 
subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's 
technical data.
    (3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or 
supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher-tier contractor, 
subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the 
prime contract for data which may be submitted with other than unlimited 
rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or 
supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such data directly to 
the Government, rather than through a higher-tier contractor, 
subcontractor, or supplier.
    (4) The Contractor and higher-tier subcontractors or suppliers shall 
not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain 
rights in technical data from their subcontractors or suppliers.
    (5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize 
and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data as an 
excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligations to the 
Government.

                             (End of clause)

                         Alternate I (June 1995)

    As prescribed in 227.7103-6(b), add the following paragraph (l) to 
the basic clause:
    (l) Publication for sale. (1) This paragraph only applies to 
technical data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rights or 
a license to make an unrestricted release of technical data.
    (2) The Government shall not publish a deliverable technical data 
item or items identified in this contract as being subject to paragraph 
(l) of this clause or authorize others to publish such data on its 
behalf if, prior to publication for sale by the Government and within 
twenty-four (24) months following the date specified in this contract 
for delivery of such data or the removal of any national security or 
export control restrictions, whichever is later, the Contractor 
publishes that item or items for sale and promptly notifies the 
Contracting Officer of such publication(s). Any such publication shall 
include a notice identifying the number of this contract and the 
Government's rights in the published data.
    (3) This limitation on the Government's right to publish for sale 
shall continue as long as the data are reasonably available to the 
public for purchase.

(End of identification and assertion)
    (4) When requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall 
provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to 
evaluate the Contractor's assertions. The Contracting Officer reserves 
the right to add the Contractor's assertions to the Attachment and 
validate any listed assertion, at a later date, in accordance with the 
procedures of the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software 
clause of this contract.
    (f) Marking requirements. The Contractor, and its subcontractors or 
suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to 
use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer 
software by marking the deliverable software or documentation subject to 
restriction. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this clause, only 
the following legends are authorized under this contract; the government 
purpose rights legend at paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; the restricted 
rights legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause; or the special license 
rights legend at paragraph (f)(4) of this clause; and/or a notice of 
copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.
    (1) General marking instructions. The Contractor, or its 
subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the 
appropriate legend on all computer software that qualify for such 
markings. The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmitted 
document or software storage container and each page, or portions 
thereof, of printed material containing computer software for which 
restrictions are asserted. Computer software transmitted directly from 
one computer or computer terminal to another shall contain a notice of 
asserted restrictions. However, instructions that interfere with or 
delay the operation of computer software in order to display a 
restrictive rights legend or other license statement at any time prior 
to or during use of the computer software, or otherwise cause such 
interference or delay, shall not be inserted in software that will or 
might be used in combat or situations that simulate combat conditions, 
unless the Contracting Officer's written permission to deliver such 
software has been obtained prior to delivery. Reproductions of computer 
software or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, shall 
also reproduce the asserted restrictions.
    (2) Government purpose rights markings. Computer software delivered 
or otherwise furnished to the Government with government purpose rights 
shall be marked as follows:

    The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose this software are restricted by paragraph (b)(3) of 
the Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer 
Software Documentation clause contained in the above identified 
contract. Any reproduction of computer software or portions thereof 
marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings. Any person, 
other than the Government, who has been provided access to such software 
must promptly notify the above named Contractor.

                             (End of legend)

    (ii) For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include 
government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see 
paragraph (b)(5) of this clause).
    (5) Pre-existing markings. If the terms of a prior contract or 
license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to 
use, modify, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software or 
computer software documentation and those restrictions are still 
applicable, the Contractor may mark such software or documentation with 
the appropriate restrictive legend for which the software qualified 
under the prior contract or license. The marking procedures in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this clause shall be followed.
    (g) Contractor procedures and records. Throughout performance of 
this contract, the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers that 
will deliver computer software or computer software documentation with 
other than unlimited rights, shall--
    (1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to 
assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the 
terms of this clause; and
    (2) Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any 
restrictive markings on computer software or computer software 
documentation delivered under this contract.
    (h) Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings. (1) 
Unjustified computer software or computer software documentation 
markings. The rights and obligations of the parties regarding the 
validation of restrictive markings on computer software or computer 
software documentation furnished or to be furnished under this contract 
are contained in the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer 
Software and the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data 
clauses of this contract, respectively. Notwithstanding any provision of 
this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may 
ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, 
in accordance with the procedures of those clauses, a restrictive 
marking is determined to be unjustified.
    (2) Nonconforming computer software or computer software 
documentation markings. A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on 
computer software or computer software documentation delivered or 
otherwise furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in 
the format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming 
markings is not subject to the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--
Computer Software or the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the 
Contractor of a nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor 
fails to remove or correct such markings within sixty (60) days, the 
Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct 
any nonconforming markings.
    (i) Relation to patents. Nothing contained in this clause shall 
imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as 
affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to 
the Government under any patent.
    (j) Limitation on charges for rights in computer software or 
computer software documentation. (1) The Contractor shall not charge to 
this contract any cost, including but not limited to license fees, 
royalties, or similar charges, for rights in computer software or 
computer software documentation to be delivered under this contract 
when--
    (i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater 
rights in the software or documentation; or
    (ii) The software or documentation are available to the public 
without restrictions.
    (2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause--
    (i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any 
tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in 
subcontractor or supplier computer software or computer software 
documentation, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for

[[Page 83]]

such rights under any other Government contract or under a license 
conveying the rights to the Government; and
    (ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, 
or mailing the documents or other media in which the software or 
documentation will be delivered.
    (k) Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers. (1) Whenever any 
noncommercial computer software or computer software documentation is to 
be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the 
Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same 
clause in its subcontracts or other contractual instruments, and require 
its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to 
identify the parties. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or 
diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher tier 
subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's 
computer software or computer software documentation.
    (2) The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall 
not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain 
rights in computer software or computer software documentation from 
their subcontractors or suppliers.
    (3) The Contractor shall ensure that subcontractor or supplier 
rights are recognized and protected in the identification, assertion, 
and delivery processes required by paragraph (e) of this clause.
    (4) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize 
and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in computer software or 
computer software documentation as an excuse for failing to satisfy its 
contractual obligation to the Government.

                             (End of clause)

                         Alternate I (Jun. 1995)

    As prescribed in 227.7203-6(a)(2), add the following paragraph (l) 
to the basic clause:

    (l) Publication for sale. (1) This paragraph only applies to 
computer software or computer software documentation in which the 
Government has obtained unlimited rights or a license to make an 
unrestricted release of the software or documentation.
    (2) The Government shall not publish a deliverable item or items of 
computer software or computer software documentation identified in this 
contract as being subject to paragraph (l) of this clause or authorize 
others to publish such software or documentation on its behalf if, prior 
to publication for sale by the Government and within twenty-four (24) 
months following the date specified in this contract for delivery of 
such software or documentation, or the removal of any national security 
or export control restrictions, whichever is later, the Contractor 
publishes that item or items for sale and promptly notifies the 
Contracting Officer of such publication(s). Any such publication shall 
include a notice identifying the number of this contract and the 
Government's rights in the published software or documentation.
    (3) This limitation on the Government's rights to publish for sale 
shall continue as long as the software or documentation are reasonably 
available to the public for purchase.

<R05>
Sec. 252.227-7018  Rights in noncommercial technical data and computer software--Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program.

    As prescribed in 227.7104(a), use the following clause:

  Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software--Small 
         Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program (Jun. 1995)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause:
    (1) Commercial computer software means software developed or 
regularly used for nongovernmental purposes which--
    (i) Has been sold, leased, or licensed to the public;
    (ii) Has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the public;
    (iii) Has not been offered, sold, leased, or licensed to the public 
but will be available for commercial sale, lease, or license in time to 
satisfy the delivery requirements of this contract; or
    (iv) Satisfies a criterion expressed in paragraph (a)(1)(i), (ii), 
or (iii) of this clause and would require only minor modification to 
meet the requirements of this contract.
    (2) Computer database means a collection of recorded data in a form 
capable of being processed by a computer. The term does not include 
computer software.
    (3) Computer program means a set of instructions, rules, or 
routines, recorded in a form that is capable of causing a computer to 
perform a specific operation or series of operations.
    (4) Computer software means computer programs, source code, source 
code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, 
processes, flow charts, formulae, and related material that would enable 
the software to be reproduced, re-created, or recompiled. Computer 
software does not include computer databases or computer software 
documentation.
    (5) Computer software documentation means owner's manuals, user's 
manuals, installation instructions, operating instructions, and other 
similar items, regardless of storage medium, that explain the 
capabilities of the computer software or provide instructions for using 
the software.
    (6) Detailed manufacturing or process data means technical data that 
describe the steps, sequences, and conditions of manufacturing, 
processing or assembly used by the manufacturer to produce an item or 
component or to perform a process.
    (7) Developed means--
    (i) (Applicable to technical data other than computer software 
documentation.) An item, component, or process, exists and is workable. 
Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process 
practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, 
component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to 
demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that 
there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, 
how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish 
workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, 
and the state of the art. To be considered ``developed,'' the item, 
component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered 
for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component 
or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 
35 of the United States Code;
    (ii) A computer program has been successfully operated in a computer 
and tested to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons 
skilled in the art that the program can reasonably be expected to 
perform its intended purpose;
    (iii) Computer software, other than computer programs, has been 
tested or analyzed to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable 
persons skilled in the art that the software can reasonably be expected 
to perform its intended purpose; or
    (iv) Computer software documentation required to be delivered under 
a contract has been written, in any medium, in sufficient detail to 
comply with requirements under that contract.
    (8) Developed exclusively at private expense means development was 
accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs 
not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.
    (i) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest 
practicable level.
    (ii) Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than 
the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional

[[Page 87]]

development costs necessary to complete development shall not be 
considered when determining whether development was at government, 
private, or mixed expense.
    (9) Developed exclusively with government funds means development 
was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.
    (10) Developed with mixed funding means development was accomplished 
partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not 
allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged 
directly to a government contract.
    (11) Form, fit, and function data means technical data that describe 
the required overall physical, functional, and performance 
characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if 
applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to 
permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable 
items.
    (12) Generated means technical data or computer software first 
created in the performance of this contract.
    (13) Government purpose means any activity in which the United 
States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with 
international or multi-national defense organizations or sales or 
transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or 
international organizations. Government purposes include competitive 
procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer 
software for commercial purposes or authorize others to do so.
    (14) Limited rights means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in 
part, within the Government. The Government may not, without the written 
permission of the party asserting limited rights, release or disclose 
the technical data outside the Government, use the technical data for 
manufacture, or permit the technical data to be used by another party, 
except that the Government may reproduce, release or disclose such data 
or permit the use or reproduction of the data by persons outside the 
Government if reproduction, release, disclosure, or use is--
    (i) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or
    (ii) A release or disclosure of technical data (other than detailed 
manufacturing or process data) to, or use of such data by, a foreign 
government that is in the interest of the Government and is required for 
evaluational or informational purposes;
    (iii) Subject to a prohibition on the further reproduction, release 
disclosure, or use of the technical data; and
    (iv) The Contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is 
notified of such reproduction, release, disclosure, or use.
    (15) Minor modification means a modification that does not 
significantly alter the nongovernmental function or purpose of computer 
software or is of the type customarily provided in the commercial 
marketplace.
    (16) Noncommercial computer software means software that does not 
qualify as commercial computer software under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
clause.
    (17) Restricted rights apply only to noncommercial computer software 
and mean the Government's rights to--
    (i) Use a computer program with one computer at one time. The 
program may not be accessed by more than one terminal or central 
processing unit or time shared unless otherwise permitted by this 
contract;
    (ii) Transfer a computer program to another Government agency 
without the further permission of the Contractor if the transferor 
destroys all copies of the program and related computer software 
documentation in its possession and notifies the licensor of the 
transfer. Transferred programs remain subject to the provisions of this 
clause;
    (iii) Make the minimum number of copies of the computer software 
required for safekeeping (archive), backup, or modification purposes;
    (iv) Modify computer software provided that the Government may--
    (A) Use the modified software only as provided in paragraphs (a)(17) 
(i) and (iii) of this clause; and
    (B) Not release or disclose the modified software except as provided 
in paragraphs (a)(17) (ii), (v) and (vi) of this clause;
    (v) Permit contractors or subcontractors performing service 
contracts (see 37.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation) in support 
of this or a related contract to use computer software to diagnose and 
correct deficiencies in a computer program, to modify computer software 
to enable a computer program to be combined with, adapted to, or merged 
with other computer programs or when necessary to respond to urgent 
tactical situations, provided that--
    (A) The Government notifies the party which has granted restricted 
rights that a release or disclosure to particular contractors or 
subcontractors was made;
    (B) Such contractors or subcontractors are subject to the non-
disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 of the Defense Federal Acquisition 
Regulation Supplement (DFARS or are Government contractors receiving

    (4) When requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall 
provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to 
evaluate the Contractor's assertions. The Contracting Officer reserves 
the right to add the Contractor's assertions to the Attachment and 
validate any listed assertions, at a later date, in accordance with the 
procedures of the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software 
and/or Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clauses of 
this contract.
    (f) Marking requirements. The Contractor, and its subcontractors or 
suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to 
use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical 
data or computer software to be delivered under this contract by marking 
the deliverable data or software subject to restriction. Except as 
provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this clause, only the following markings 
are authorized under this contract: the limited rights legend at 
paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; the restricted rights legend at 
paragraph (f)(3) of this clause, the SBIR data rights legend at 
paragraph (f)(4) of this clause, or the special license rights legend at 
paragraphs (f)(5) of this clause; and/or a notice of copyright as 
prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.
    (1) General marking instructions. The Contractor, or its 
subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the 
appropriate legend to all technical data and computer software that 
qualify for such markings. The authorized legends shall be placed on the 
transmittal document or storage container and, for printed material, 
each page of the printed material containing technical data or computer 
software for which restrictions are asserted. When only portions of a 
page of printed material are subject to the asserted restrictions, such 
portions shall be identified by circling, underscoring, with a note, or 
other appropriate identifier. Technical data or computer software 
transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to another 
shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. However, instructions 
that interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in order 
to display a restrictive rights legend or other license statement at any

    (ii) For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include 
government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see 
paragraph (b)(6) of this clause).
    (6) Pre-existing data markings. If the terms of a prior contract or 
license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to 
use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical 
data or computer software, and those restrictions are still applicable, 
the Contractor may mark such data or software with the appropriate 
restrictive legend for which the data or software qualified under the 
prior contract or license. The marking procedures in paragraph (f)(1) of 
this clause shall be followed.
    (g) Contractor procedures and records. Throughout performance of 
this contract, the Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that 
will deliver technical data or computer software with other than 
unlimited rights, shall--
    (1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to 
assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the 
terms of this clause; and
    (2) Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any 
restrictive markings on technical data or computer software delivered 
under this contract.
    (h) Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings.
    (1) Unjustified markings. The rights and obligations of the parties 
regarding the validation of restrictive markings on technical data or 
computer software furnished or to be furnished under this contract are 
contained in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data 
and the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software clauses 
of this contract, respectively. Notwithstanding any provision of this 
contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore 
or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in 
accordance with the applicable procedures of those clauses, a 
restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.
    (2) Nonconforming markings. A nonconforming marking is a marking 
placed on technical data or computer software delivered or otherwise 
furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in the 
format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings 
is not subject to the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data or the Validation of Asserted

[[Page 92]]

Restrictions--Computer Software clause of this contract. If the 
Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking 
or markings and the Contractor fails to remove or correct such markings 
within sixty (6)) days, the Government may ignore or, at the 
Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming markings.
    (i) Relation to patents. Nothing contained in this clause shall 
imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as 
affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to 
the Government under any patent.
    (j) Limitation on charges for rights in technical data or computer 
software. (1) The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, 
including but not limited to, license fees, royalties, or similar 
charges, for rights in technical data or computer software to be 
delivered under this contract when--
    (i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater 
rights in the data or software; or
    (ii) The data are available to the public without restrictions.
    (2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause--
    (i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any 
tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in 
subcontractor of supplier technical data or computer software, if the 
subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other 
Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the 
Government; and
    (ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, 
or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data or 
computer software will be delivered.
    (k) Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers. (1) the Contractor 
shall assure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers 
under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10 U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, 
and delivery processes required by paragraph (e) of this clause are 
recognized and protected.
    (2) Whenever any noncommercial technical data or computer software 
is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the 
Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same 
clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, and require 
its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to 
identify the parties. The Contractor shall use the Technical Data--
Commercial Items clause of this contract to obtain technical data 
pertaining to commercial items, components, or processes. No other 
clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the 
Contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a 
subcontractor's or supplier's technical data or computer software.
    (3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or 
supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher tier contractor, 
subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the 
prime contract for technical data which may be submitted with other than 
unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor 
or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such technical 
data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher tier 
contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.
    (4) The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall 
not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain 
rights in technical data or computer software from their subcontractors 
or suppliers.
    (5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize 
and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data or 
computer software as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual 
obligation to the Government.

                             (End of clause)

                         Alternate I (June 1995)

    As prescribed in 227.7104(d), add the following paragraph (l) to the 
basic clause:
    (l) Publication for sale. (1) This paragraph applies only to 
technical data or computer software delivered to the Government with 
SBIR data rights.
    (2) Upon expiration of the SBIR data rights period, the Government 
will not exercise its right to publish or authorize others to publish an 
item of technical data or computer software identified in this contract 
as being subject to paragraph (l) of this clause if the Contractor, 
prior to the expiration of the SBIR data rights period, or within two 
years following delivery of the data or software item, or within twenty-
four months following the removal of any national security or export 
control restrictions, whichever is later, publishes such data or 
software item(s) and promptly notifies the Contracting Officer of such 
publication(s). Any such publication(s) shall include a notice 
identifying the number of this contract and the Government's rights in 
the published data.
    (3) This limitation on the Government's right to publish for sale 
shall continue as long as the technical data or computer software are 
reasonably available to the public for purchase.

<R05>
Sec. 252.227-7019  Validation of asserted restrictions--Computer software.

    As prescribed in 227.7104(e)(3) or 227.7203-6(c), use the following 
clause:

   Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software (June 1995)

    (a) Definitions. (1) As used in this clause, unless otherwise 
specifically indicated, the term ``Contractor'' means the Contractor and 
its subcontractors or suppliers.
    (2) Other terms used in this clause are defined in the Rights in 
Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software 
Documentation clause of this contract.
    (b) Justification. The Contractor shall maintain records sufficient 
to justify the validity of any markings that assert restrictions on the 
Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, 
release, or disclose computer software delivered or required to be 
delivered under this contract and shall be prepared to furnish to the 
Contracting Officer a written justification for such restrictive 
markings in response to a request for information under paragraph (d) or 
a challenge under paragraph (f) of this clause.
    (c) Direct contact with subcontractors or suppliers. The Contractor 
agrees that the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this 
clause directly with subcontractors or suppliers at any tier who assert 
restrictions on the Government's right to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, perform, display, or disclose computer software. Neither this 
clause, nor any action taken by the Government under this clause, 
creates or implies privity of contract between the Government and the 
Contractor's subcontractors or suppliers.
    (d) Requests for information. (1) The Contracting Officer may 
request the Contractor to provide sufficient information to enable the 
Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's asserted restrictions. 
Such information shall be based upon the records required by this clause 
or other information reasonably available to the Contractor.
    (2) Based upon the information provided, if the--
    (i) Contractor agrees that an asserted restriction is not valid, the 
Contracting Officer may--
    (A) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at the Contractor's 
expense; or
    (B) Return the computer software to the Contractor for correction at 
the Contractor's expense. If the Contractor fails to correct or strike 
the unjustified restrictions and return the corrected software to the 
Contracting Officer within sixty (60) days following receipt of the 
software, the Contracting Officer may correct the strike the markings at 
the Contractor's expense.
    (ii) Contracting Officer concludes that the asserted restriction is 
appropriate for this contract, the Contracting Officer shall so notify 
the Contractor in writing.
    (3) The Contractor's failure to provide a timely response to a 
Contracting Officer's request for information or failure to provide 
sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate an 
asserted restriction shall constitute reasonable grounds for questioning 
the validity of an asserted restriction.
    (e) Government right to challenge and validate asserted 
restrictions. (1) The Government, when there are reasonable grounds to 
do so, has the right to review and challenge the validity of any 
restrictions asserted by the Contractor on the Government's rights to 
use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer 
software delivered, to be delivered under this contract, or otherwise 
provided to the Government in the performance of this contract. Except 
for software that is publicly available, has been furnished to the 
Government without restrictions, or has been otherwise made available 
without restrictions, the Government may exercise this right only within 
three years after the date(s) the software is delivered or otherwise 
furnished to the Government, or three years following final payment 
under this contract, whichever is later.
    (2) The absence of a challenge to an asserted restriction shall not 
constitute validation under this clause. Only a Contracting Officer's 
final decision or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a 
court of competent jurisdiction that sustain the validity of an asserted 
restriction constitute validation of the restriction.
    (f) Challenge procedures. (1) A challenge must be in writing and 
shall--
    (i) State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted 
restriction;
    (ii) Require the Contractor to respond within sixty (60) days;
    (iii) Require the Contractor to provide justification for the 
assertion based upon records kept in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this clause and such other documentation that are reasonably available 
to the Contractor, in sufficient detail to enable the Contracting 
Officer to determine the validity of the asserted restrictions; and
    (iv) State that a Contracting Officer's final decision, during the 
three-year period preceding this challenge, or action of a court of 
competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals that sustained the 
validity of an identical assertion made by the Contractor (or a 
licensee) shall serve as justification for the asserted restriction.
    (2) The Contracting Officer shall extend the time for response if 
the Contractor submits a written request showing the need for additional 
time to prepare a response.

[[Page 94]]

    (3) The Contracting Officer may request additional supporting 
documentation if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor's 
explanation does not provide sufficient evidence to justify the validity 
of the asserted restrictions. The Contractor agrees to promptly respond 
to the Contracting Officer's request for additional supporting 
documentation.
    (4) Notwithstanding challenge by the Contracting Officer, the 
parties may agree on the disposition of an asserted restriction at any 
time prior to a Contracting Officer's final decision or, if the 
Contractor has appealed that decision, filed suit, or provided notice of 
an intent to file suit, at any time prior to a decision by a court of 
competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals.
    (5) If the Contractor fails to respond to the Contracting Officer's 
request for information or additional information under paragraph (f)(1) 
of this clause, the Contracting Officer shall issue a final decision, in 
accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, pertaining to the 
validity of the asserted restriction.
    (6) If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing the written 
explanation furnished pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this clause, or 
any other available information pertaining to the validity of an 
asserted restriction, determines that the asserted restriction has--
    (i) Not been justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue promptly 
a final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this 
contract, denying the validity of the asserted restriction; or
    (ii) Been justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue promptly a 
final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, 
validating the asserted restriction.
    (7) A Contractor receiving challenges to the same asserted 
restriction(s) from more than one Contracting Officer shall notify each 
Contracting Officer of the other challenges. The notice shall also state 
which Contracting Officer initiated the first in time unanswered 
challenge. The Contracting Officer who initiated the first in time 
unanswered challenge, after consultation with the other Contracting 
Officers who have challenged the restrictions and the Contractor, shall 
formulate and distribute a schedule that provides the contractor a 
reasonable opportunity for responding to each challenge.
    (g) Contractor appeal--Government obligation. (1) The Government 
agrees that, notwithstanding a Contracting Officer's final decision 
denying the validity of an asserted restriction and except as provided 
in paragraph (g)(3) of this clause, it will honor the asserted 
restriction--
    (i) For a period of ninety (90) days from the date of the 
Contracting Officer's final decision to allow the Contractor to appeal 
to the appropriate Board of Contract Appeals or to file suit in an 
appropriate court;
    (ii) For a period of one year from the date of the Contracting 
Officer's final decision if, within the first ninety (90) days following 
the Contracting Officer's final decision, the Contractor has provided 
notice of an intent to file suit in an appropriate court; or
    (iii) Until final disposition by the appropriate Board of Contract 
Appeals or court of competent jurisdiction, if the Contractor has: (A) 
appealed to the Board of Contract Appeals or filed suit an appropriate 
court within ninety (90) days; or (B) submitted, within ninety (90) 
days, a notice of intent to file suit in an appropriate court and filed 
suit within one year.
    (2) The Contractor agrees that the Government may strike, correct, 
or ignore the restrictive markings if the Contractor fails to--
    (i) Appeal to a Board of Contract Appeals within ninety (90) days 
from the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision;
    (ii) File suit in an appropriate court within ninety (90) days from 
such date; or
    (iii) File suit within one year after the date of the Contracting 
Officer's final decision if the Contractor had provided notice of intent 
to file suit within ninety (90) days following the date of the 
Contracting Officer's final decision.
    (3) The agency head, on a nondelegable basis, may determine that 
urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit awaiting the filing of 
suit in an appropriate court, or the rendering of a decision by a court 
of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals. In that event, 
the agency head shall notify the Contractor of the urgent or compelling 
circumstances. Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of this clause, the 
Contractor agrees that the agency may use, modify, reproduce, release, 
perform, display, or disclose computer software marked with (i) 
government purpose legends for any purpose, and authorize others to do 
so; or (ii) restricted or special license rights for government purposes 
only. The Government agrees not to release or disclose such software 
unless, prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is 
subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 of the 
Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), or is a 
Government contractor receiving access to the software for performance 
of a Government contract that contains the clause at DFARS 252.227-7025, 
Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information 
Marked with Restrictive Legends. The agency head's determination may be 
made at any time after the date of the Contracting Officer's final 
decision and shall not affect the Contractor's right to damages against 
the United States, or other relief provided by law, if its asserted 
restrictions are ultimately upheld.

[[Page 95]]

    (h) Final disposition of appeal or suit. If the Contractor appeals 
or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the 
Contracting Officer's decision is:
    (1) Sustained--
    (i) Any restrictive marking on such computer software shall be 
struck or corrected at the contractor's expense or ignored; and
    (ii) If the asserted restriction is found not to be substantially 
justified, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for payment 
of the cost to the Government of reviewing the asserted restriction and 
the fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) 
incurred by the Government in challenging the restriction, unless 
special circumstances would make such payment unjust.
    (2) Not sustained--
    (i) The Government shall be bound by the asserted restriction; and
    (ii) If the challenge by the Government is found not to have been 
made in good faith, the Government shall be liable to the Contractor for 
payment of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 
2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Contractor in defending the restriction.
    (i) Flowdown. The Contractor shall insert this clause in all 
contracts, purchase orders, and other similar instruments with its 
subcontractors or suppliers, at any tier, who will be furnishing 
computer software to the Government in the performance of this contract. 
The clause may not be altered other than to identify the appropriate 
parties.

     Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data (NOV 1995)

    (a) Definitions. The terms used in this clause are defined in the 
Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items clause of this contract.
    (b) Contracts for commercial items--presumption of development at 
private expense. Under a contract for a commercial item, component, or 
process, the Department of Defense shall presume that a Contractor's 
asserted use or release restrictions are justified on the basis that the 
item, component, or process was developed exclusively at private 
expense. The Department shall not challenge such assertions unless 
information the Department demonstrates that the item, component, or 
process was not developed exclusively at private expense.
    (c) Justification. The Contractor or subcontractor at any tier is 
responsible for maintaining records sufficient to justify the validity 
of its markings that impose restrictions on the Government and others to 
use, duplicate, or disclose technical data delivered or required to be 
delivered under the contract or subcontract. Except under contracts for 
commercial items, the Contractor or subcontractor shall be prepared to 
furnish to the Contracting Officer a written justification for such 
restrictive markings in response to a challenge under paragraph (e) of 
this clause.
    (d) Prechallenge request for information. (1) The Contracting 
Officer may request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish a written 
explanation for any restriction asserted by the Contractor or 
subcontractor on the right of the United States or others to use 
technical data. If, upon review of the explanation submitted, the 
Contracting Officer remains unable to ascertain the basis of the 
restrictive marking, the Contracting Officer may further request the 
Contractor or subcontractor to furnish additional information in the 
records of, or otherwise in the possession of or reasonably available 
to, the Contractor or subcontractor to justify the validity of any 
restrictive marking on technical data delivered or to be delivered under 
the contract or subcontract (e.g., a statement of facts accompanied with 
supporting documentation). The Contractor or subcontractor shall submit 
such written data as requested by the Contracting Officer within the 
time required or such longer period as may be mutually agreed.
    (2) If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing the written data 
furnished pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, or any other 
available information pertaining to the validity of a restrictive 
marking, determines that reasonable grounds exist to question the 
current validity of the marking and that continued adherence to the 
marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition 
of the item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, 
the Contracting Officer shall follow the procedures in paragraph (e) of 
this clause.
    (3) If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond to the 
Contracting Officer's request for information under paragraph (d)(1) of 
this clause, and the Contracting Officer determines that continued 
adherence to the marking would make impracticable the subsequent 
competitive acquisition of the item, component, or process to which the 
technical data relates, the Contracting Officer may challenge the 
validity of the marking as described in paragraph (e) of this clause.
    (e) Challenge. (1) Notwithstanding any provision of this contract 
concerning inspection and acceptance, if the Contracting Officer 
determines that a challenge to the restrictive marking is warranted, the 
Contracting Officer shall send a written challenge notice to the 
Contractor or subcontractor asserting the restrictive markings. Such 
challenge shall--
    (i) State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted 
restriction;

[[Page 101]]

    (ii) Require a response within sixty (60) days justifying and 
providing sufficient evidence as to the current validity of the asserted 
restriction;
    (iii) State that a DoD Contracting Officer's final decision, issued 
pursuant to paragraph (g) of this clause, sustaining the validity of a 
restrictive marking identical to the asserted restriction, within the 
three-year period preceding the challenge, shall serve as justification 
for the asserted restriction if the validated restriction was asserted 
by the same Contractor or subcontractor (or any licensee of such 
Contractor or subcontractor) to which such notice is being provided; and
    (iv) State that failure to respond to the challenge notice may 
result in issuance of a final decision pursuant to paragraph (f) of this 
clause.
    (2) The Contracting Officer shall extend the time for response as 
appropriate if the Contractor or subcontractor submits a written request 
showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.
    (3) The Contractor's or subcontractor's written response shall be 
considered a claim within the meaning of the Contract Disputes Act of 
1978 (41 U.S.C. 601, et seq.), and shall be certified in the form 
prescribed at 33.207 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, regardless 
of dollar amount.
    (4) A Contractor or subcontractor receiving challenges to the same 
restrictive markings from more than one Contracting Officer shall notify 
each Contracting Officer of the existence of more than one challenge. 
The notice shall also state which Contracting Officer initiated the 
first in time unanswered challenge. The Contracting Officer initiating 
the first in time unanswered challenge after consultation with the 
Contractor or subcontractor and the other Contracting Officers, shall 
formulate and distribute a schedule for responding to each of the 
challenge notices to all interested parties. The schedule shall afford 
the Contractor or subcontractor an opportunity to respond to each 
challenge notice. All parties will be bound by this schedule.
    (f) Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor fails to 
respond. Upon a failure of a Contractor or subcontractor to submit any 
response to the challenge notice, other than a failure to respond under 
a contract for commercial items, the Contracting Officer will issue a 
final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with the 
Disputes clause of this contract pertaining to the validity of the 
asserted restriction. This final decision shall be issued as soon as 
possible after the expiration of the time period of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) 
or (e)(2) of this clause. Following issuance of the final decision, the 
Contracting Officer will comply with the procedures in paragraphs (g)(2) 
(ii) through (iv) of this clause.
    (g) Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor responds. (1) if 
the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor or subcontractor 
has justified the validity of the restrictive marking, the Contracting 
Officer shall issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor 
sustaining the validity of the restrictive marking, and stating that the 
Government will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking. This 
final decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after receipt of 
the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or 
within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the 
Contractor or subcontractor that the Government will require. The 
notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be 
made within sixty (60) days after receipt of the response to the 
challenge notice.
    (2)(i) If the Contracting Officer determines that the validity of 
the restrictive marking is not justified, the Contracting Officer shall 
issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance 
with the Disputes clause of this contract. Notwithstanding paragraph (e) 
of the Disputes clause, the final decision shall be issued within sixty 
(60) days after receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response 
to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the 
Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor of the 
longer period that the Government will require. The notification of a 
longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within sixty 
(60) days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.
    (ii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the 
restrictive marking of a period of ninety (90) days from the issuance of 
the Contracting Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of 
this clause. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that, if it intends 
to file suit in the United States Claims Court it will provide a notice 
of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within ninety (90) 
days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer's final decision under 
paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. If the Contractor or subcontractor 
fails to appeal, file suit, or provide a notice of intent to file suit 
to the Contracting Officer within the ninety (90)-day period, the 
Government may cancel or ignore the restrictive markings, and the 
failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to take the required action 
constitutes agreement with such Government action.
    (iii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the 
restrictive marking where a notice of intent to file suit in the United 
States Claims Court is provided to the Contracting Officer within ninety 
(90) days from the issuance of the final decision under paragraph 
(g)(2)(i) of this clause. The Government will no longer be

[[Page 102]]

bound, and the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Government 
may strike or ignore the restrictive markings, if the Contractor or 
subcontractor fails to file its suit within one (1) year after issuance 
of the final decision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of 
an agency determines, on a nondelegable basis, that urgent or compelling 
circumstances will not permit waiting for the filing of a suit in the 
United States Claims Court, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that 
the agency may, following notice to the Contractor or subcontractor, 
authorize release or disclosure of the technical data. Such agency 
determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final 
decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right 
to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are 
ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided 
by law.
    (iv) The Government agrees that it will be bound by the restrictive 
marking where an appeal or suit is filed pursuant to the Contract 
Disputes Act until final disposition by an agency Board of Contract 
Appeals or the United States Claims Court. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable 
basis, following notice to the Contractor that urgent or compelling 
circumstances will not permit awaiting the decision by such Board of 
Contract Appeals or the United States Claims Court, the Contractor or 
subcontractor agrees that the agency may authorize release or disclosure 
of the technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time 
after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the 
Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United 
States where its restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue 
other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.
    (h) Final disposition of appeal or suit. (1) If the Contractor or 
subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of 
the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is sustained--
    (i) The restrictive marking on the technical data shall be 
cancelled, corrected or ignored; and
    (ii) If the restrictive marking is found not to be substantially 
justified, the Contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate, shall be 
liable to the Government for payment of the cost to the Government of 
reviewing the restrictive marking and the fees and other expenses (as 
defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Government in 
challenging the marking, unless special circumstances would make such 
payment unjust.
    (2) If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, 
upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's 
decision is not sustained--
    (i) The Government shall continue to be bound by the restrictive 
marking; and
    (ii) The Government shall be liable to the Contractor or 
subcontractor for payment of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 
U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Contractor or subcontractor in 
defending the marking, if the challenge by the Government is found not 
to have been made in good faith.
    (i) Duration of right to challenge. The Government may review the 
validity of any restriction on technical data, delivered or to be 
delivered under a contract, asserted by the Contractor or subcontractor. 
During the period within three (3) years of final payment on a contract 
or within three (3) years of delivery of the technical data to the 
Government, whichever is later, the Contracting Officer may review and 
make a written determination to challenge the restriction. The 
Government may, however, challenge a restriction on the release, 
disclosure or use of technical data at any time if such technical data--
    (1) Is publicly available;
    (2) Has been furnished to the United States without restriction; or
    (3) Has been otherwise made available without restriction. Only the 
Contracting Officer's final decision resolving a formal challenge by 
sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking constitutes 
``validation'' as addressed in 10 U.S.C. 2321.
    (j) Decision not to challenge. A decision by the Government, or a 
determination by the Contracting Officer, to not challenge the 
restrictive marking or asserted restriction shall not constitute 
``validation.''
    (k) Privity of contract. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that 
the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this clause directly 
with subcontractors at any tier that assert restrictive markings. 
However, this clause neither creates nor implies privity of contract 
between the Government and subcontractors.
    (l) Flowdown. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees to insert this 
clause in contractual instruments with its subcontractors or suppliers 
at any tier requiring the delivery of technical data, except contractual 
instruments for commercial items or commercial components.

Sec. 252.228-7001  Ground and flight risk.

    As prescribed in 228.370(b), use the following clause:

                    Ground and Flight Risk (SEP 1996)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
    (1) Aircraft, unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, means--
    (i) Aircraft to be delivered to the Government under this contract 
(either before or after Government acceptance), including complete 
aircraft and aircraft in the process of being manufactured, 
disassembled, or reassembled; provided that an engine, portion of a wing 
or a wing is attached to a fuselage of the aircraft; and
    (ii) Aircraft, whether in a state of disassembly or reassembly, 
furnished by the Government to the Contractor under this contract, 
including all property installed, in the process of installation, or 
temporarily removed; provided that the aircraft and property are not 
covered by a separate bailment agreement.
    (2) Contractor's premises means those premises designated in the 
Schedule or in writing by the Contracting Officer, and any other place 
the aircraft is moved for safeguarding.
    (3) Flight means any flight demonstration, flight test, taxi test, 
or other flight made in the performance of this contract, or for the 
purpose of safeguarding the aircraft, or previously approved in writing 
by the Contracting Officer.
    (i) For land based aircraft, flight begins with the taxi roll from a 
flight line on the Contractor's premises and continues until the 
aircraft has completed the taxi roll in returning to a flight line on 
the Contractor's premises;
    (ii) For seaplanes, flight begins with the launching from a ramp on 
the Contractor's premises and continues until the aircraft has completed 
its landing run and is beached at a ramp on the Contractor's premises;
    (iii) For helicopters, flight begins upon engagement of the rotors 
for the purpose of take-off from the Contractor's premises and continues 
until the aircraft has returned to the ground on the Contractor's 
premises and the rotors are disengaged; and

[[Page 104]]

    (iv) For vertical take-off aircraft, flight begins upon 
disengagement from any launching platform or device on the Contractor's 
premises and continues until the aircraft has been engaged to any 
launching platform or device on the Contractor's premises;
    (v) All aircraft off the Contractor's premises shall be considered 
to be in flight when on the ground or water for reasonable periods of 
time following emergency landings, landings made in performance of this 
contract, or landings approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.
    (4) Flight crew member means the pilot, the co-pilot, and, unless 
otherwise provided in the Schedule, the flight engineer, navigator, and 
bombardier-navigator when assigned to their respective crew positions 
for the purpose of conducting any flight on behalf of the Contractor. If 
required, a defense systems operator may also be assigned as a flight 
crew member.
    (5) In the open means located wholly outside of buildings on the 
Contractor's premises or other places described in the Schedule as being 
in the open. Government furnished aircraft shall be considered to be 
located in the open at all times while in the Contractor's possession, 
care, custody, or control.
    (6) Operation means operations and tests of the aircraft and its 
installed equipment, accessories, and power plants, while the aircraft 
is in the open or in motion. The term does not apply to aircraft on any 
production line or in flight.
    (b) Except as may be specifically provided in the Schedule as an 
exception to this clause, the Government assumes the risk of damage to, 
or loss or destruction of aircraft in the open, during operation, and in 
flight. The Contractor shall not be liable to the Government for such 
damage, loss, or destruction.
    (c) The Government's assumption of risk for aircraft in the open 
shall continue unless the Contracting Officer finds that the aircraft is 
in the open under unreasonable conditions, and the Contractor fails to 
take prompt corrective action.
    (1) The Contracting Officer, when finding aircraft in the open under 
unreasonable conditions, shall notify the Contractor in writing of the 
unreasonable conditions and require the Contractor to make corrections 
within a reasonable time.
    (2) Upon receipt of the notice, the Contractor shall promptly 
correct the cited conditions, regardless of whether there is agreement 
that the conditions are unreasonable. If the Contracting Officer later 
determines that the cited conditions were not unreasonable, an equitable 
adjustment shall be made in the contract price for any additional costs 
incurred in correcting the conditions. Any dispute as to the 
unreasonableness of the conditions or the equitable adjustment shall be 
considered a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.
    (3) If the Contracting Officer finds that the Contractor failed to 
act promptly to correct the cited conditions or failed to correct the 
conditions within a reasonable time, the Contracting Officer may 
terminate the Government's assumption of risk for any aircraft in the 
open under the cited conditions. The termination will be effective at 
12:01 am on the fifteenth day following the day the written notice is 
received by the Contractor. If the Contracting Officer later determines 
that the Contractor acted promptly to correct the cited conditions or 
that the time taken by the Contractor was not unreasonable, an equitable 
adjustment shall be made in the contract price for any additional costs 
incurred as a result of termination of the Government's assumption of 
risk. Any dispute as to the timeliness of the Contractor's action or the 
equitable adjustment shall be considered a dispute under the Disputes 
clause of this contract.
    (4) If the Government terminates its assumption of risk, the risk of 
loss for Government-furnished property shall be determined in accordance 
with the Government Property clause of this contract.
    (5) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer 
when unreasonable conditions have been corrected. If the Government 
elects to again assume the risk of loss and relieve the Contractor of 
liabilities, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor. The 
Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the contract 
price for any insurance costs extending from the end of the third 
working day after the Contractor notice of correction until the 
Contractor is notified that the Government will assume the risk of loss. 
If the Government does not again assume the risk of loss and conditions 
have been corrected, the Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable 
adjustment for insurance costs, if any, extending after the third 
working day.
    (d) The Government's assumption of risk shall not extend to damage, 
loss, or destruction of aircraft which--
    (1) Results from failure of the Contractor, due to willful 
misconduct or lack of good faith of any of the Contractor's managerial 
personnel, to maintain and administer a program for the protection and 
preservation of aircraft in the open and during operation in accordance 
with sound industrial practice. The term Contractor's managerial 
personnel means the Contractor's directors, officers, and any of the 
Contractor's managers, superintendents, or other equivalent 
representatives who supervise or direct all or substantially all of the 
Contractor's business; or all or substantially all of the Contractor's 
operations at any one plant or separate location

[[Page 105]]

at which this contract is performed; or a separate and complete major 
industrial operation in connection with the performance of this 
contract;
    (2) Is sustained during flight if the flight crew members have not 
been approved in writing by the Government Flight Representative, who 
has been authorized in accordance with the combined regulation entitled 
``Contractor's Flight and Ground Operations'' (Air Force Regulation 55-
22, Army Regulation 95-20, NAVAIR Instruction 3710.1C, and Defense 
Logistics Agency Manual 8210.1);
    (3) Occurs in the course of transportation by rail, or by conveyance 
on public streets, highways, or waterways, except for Government-
furnished property;
    (4) Is covered by insurance;
    (5) Consists of wear and tear; deterioration (including rust and 
corrosion); freezing; or mechanical, structural, or electrical breakdown 
or failure, unless these are the result of other loss, damage or 
destruction covered by this clause. (This exclusion does not apply to 
Government-furnished property if damage consists of reasonable wear and 
tear or deterioration, or results from inherent vice in the property.); 
or
    (6) Is sustained while the aircraft is being worked on and is a 
direct result of the work unless such damage, loss, or destruction would 
be covered by insurance which would have been maintained by the 
Contractor, but for the Government's assumption of risk.
    (e) With the exception of damage, loss, or destruction in flight, 
the Contractor assumes the risk and shall be responsible for the first 
$25,000 of loss or damage to aircraft in the open or during operation 
resulting from each separate event, except for reasonable wear and tear 
and to the extent the loss or damage is caused by negligence of 
Government personnel. If the Government elects to require that the 
aircraft be replaced or restored by the Contractor to its condition 
immediately prior to the damage, the equitable adjustment in the price 
authorized by paragraph (i) of this clause shall not include the dollar 
amount of the risk assumed by the Contractor. In the event the 
Government does not elect repair or replacement, the Contractor agrees 
to credit the contract price or pay the Government $25,000 (or the 
amount of the loss, if less) as directed by the Contracting Officer.
    (f) A subcontractor shall not be relieved from liability for damage, 
loss, or destruction of aircraft while in its possession or control, 
except to the extent that the subcontract, with the written approval of 
the Contracting Officer, provides for relief from each liability. In the 
absence of approval, the subcontract shall contain provisions requiring 
the return of aircraft in as good condition as when received, except for 
reasonable wear and tear or for the utilization of the property in 
accordance with the provisions of this contract. Where a subcontractor 
has not been relieved from liability, and damage, loss, or destruction 
occurs, the Contractor shall enforce liability against the subcontractor 
for the benefit of the Government.
    (g) The Contractor warrants that the contract price does not and 
will not include, except as may be authorized in this clause, any charge 
or contingency reserve for insurance covering damage, loss, or 
destruction of aircraft while in the open, during operation, or in 
flight when the risk has been assumed by the Government, even if the 
assumption may be terminated for aircraft in the open.
    (h) In the event of damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft in the 
open, during operation, or in flight, the Contractor shall take all 
reasonable steps to protect the aircraft from further damage, to 
separate damaged and undamaged aircraft, to put all aircraft in the best 
possible order and further, except in cases covered by paragraph (e) of 
this clause, the Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer a 
statement of--
    (1) The damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft;
    (2) The time and origin of the damage, loss, or destruction;
    (3) All known interests in commingled property of which aircraft are 
a part; and
    (4) The insurance, if any, covering the interest in commingled 
property.
    Except in cases covered by paragraph (e) of this clause, the 
Contracting Officer will make an equitable adjustment in the contract 
price for expenditures made by the Contractor in performing the 
obligations under this paragraph.
    (i) If prior to delivery and acceptance by the Government, aircraft 
is damaged, lost, or destroyed and the Government assumed the risk, the 
Government shall either--
    (1) Require that the aircraft be replaced or restored by the 
Contractor to the condition immediately prior to the damage, in which 
event the Contracting Officer will make an equitable adjustment in the 
contract price and the time for contract performance; or
    (2) Terminate this contract with respect to the aircraft, in which 
event the Contractor shall be paid the contract price for the aircraft 
(or, if applicable, any work to be performed on the aircraft) less any 
amount the Contracting Officer determines--
    (i) It would have cost the Contractor to complete the aircraft (or 
any work to be performed on the aircraft) together with anticipated 
profit on uncompleted work; and
    (ii) Would be the value of the damaged aircraft or any salvage 
retained by the Contractor.
    The Contracting Officer shall prescribe the manner of disposition of 
the damaged, lost,

[[Page 106]]

or destroyed aircraft, or any parts of the aircraft. If any additional 
costs of such disposition are incurred by the Contractor, a further 
equitable adjustment will be made in the amount due the Contractor. 
Failure of the parties to agree upon termination costs or an equitable 
adjustment with respect to any aircraft shall be considered a dispute 
under the Disputes clause.
    (j) In the event the Contractor is reimbursed or compensated by a 
third person for damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft and has also 
been compensated by the Government, the Contractor shall equitably 
reimburse the Government. The Contractor shall do nothing to prejudice 
the Government's right to recover against third parties for damage, 
loss, or destruction. Upon the request of the Contracting Officer or 
authorized representative, the Contractor shall at Government expense 
furnish to the Government all reasonable assistance and cooperation 
(including the prosecution of suit and the execution of instruments of 
assignment of subrogation) in obtaining recovery.
    (k) The Contractor agrees to be bound by the operating procedures 
contained in the combined regulation entitled ``Contractor's Flight and 
Ground Operations'' in effect on the date of contract award.

as set forth in this clause and Defense FAR Supplement 232.502-1-71.

[[Page 109]]

    (1) The progress payment rate of this contract is ________ percent. 
This percentage applies instead of the customary uniform progress 
payment rate and liquidation rate of the Progress Payments clause.
    (2) The progress payment rate of this contract was determined by the 
DoD Cash Flow Computer Model (name) dated ____________, using percent as 
the minimum rate for the Contractor's investment (as a weighted average 
of costs) in its work in process inventory over the life of the 
contract.
    (b) If actual and projected cash flow data generated during contract 
performance reveal that the customary flexible progress payment rate 
will result in a Contractor investment in work in process inventory more 
than two percentage points higher or lower than the minimum rate of 
Contractor investment specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause, the 
progress payment rate shall be redetermined by using the DoD Cash Flow 
Computer Model. Unless it contained an error, the version of the DoD 
Cash Flow Computer Model identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause 
shall be used for any redetermination. The customary flexible progress 
payment rate shall not be less than the customary uniform progress 
payment rate that would have applied to this contract absent flexible 
progress payment procedures, and the progress payment rate shall not be 
greater than 100 percent.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this clause, if at any time the 
flexible progress payment rate is determined to be overstated because 
any factual data submitted by the Contractor in support of the rate 
computation was not current, accurate, and complete at the time the 
flexible progress payment rate was established, the progress payment 
rate shall be reduced to the rate that should have been calculated using 
the model specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. The Contractor 
shall pay interest in accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause on 
all resulting overpayments, computed from the date of the Government's 
overpayment, to the date of liquidation of the overpayment. Payment of 
any unliquidated overpayment and interest shall be due 30 days after the 
date of the first written demand for payment.
    (d) Interest shall be simple interest at the rate established by the 
Secretary of the Treasury as provided in section 12 of the Contract 
Disputes Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-563), which is applicable at the time 
the Government made the overpayment, and then at the rate applicable for 
each six month period as fixed by the Secretary, until the overpayment 
is liquidated.
    (e) Flexible progress payment terms will be made available to 
subcontractors in accordance with paragraph (j) of the Progress Payments 
clause and Defense FAR Supplement 232.502-1-71(b)(4).

payments made by the Contractor, as a mentor firm, to a small 
disadvantaged business, as a protege firm, pursuant to an approved

protege firm shall be paid and administered as if there were 100 percent 
progress payments. The Contractor shall include as a separate attachment

Payment, a request for reimbursement of advance payments made to a 
protege firm. The attachment shall provide a separate calculation of

of advance payments made to that protege.

payments shall be made via public voucher. The Contractor shall show the 
amounts of advance payments made to each protege on the public voucher,

            Limitation of Government's Obligation (Aug. 1993)

    (a) Contract line item(s) ______* through ______* are incrementally 
funded. For these item(s), the sum of $______* of the total price is 
presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An 
allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (i) of this clause.
    (b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the 
Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount 
payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of 
termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, 
approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The 
Contractor will not be obligated to continue work on those item(s) 
beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to 
reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the 
contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the 
clause entitled ``Termination for Convenience of the Government.'' As 
used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the 
event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience 
includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for 
those items(s).
    (c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in 
paragraph (i) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting 
Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the 
Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the 
total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for 
termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total 
amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable 
item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that 
point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, 
needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next 
scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (i) of 
this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The 
notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated 
amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely 
performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a 
subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in 
paragraph (i) of this clause, or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If 
after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date 
identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute 
date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which 
additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this 
contract entitled ``Termination for Convenience of the Government.''

[[Page 111]]

    (d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of 
the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, 
the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which 
will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraph (b) through 
(d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted 
funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified 
accordingly.
    (e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot 
additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient 
for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in 
paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or 
is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if 
additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in 
the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling 
prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or 
both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will 
be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the 
clause entitled ``Disputes.''
    (f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot 
additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) 
identified in paragraph (a) of this clause.
    (g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the 
rights of the Government under the clause entitled ``Default.'' The 
provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds 
for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. 
This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded except 
with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning 
equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this 
clause.
    (h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to 
terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled 
``Termination for Convenience of the Government.''
    (i) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to 
this contract in accordance with the following schedule:

On execution of contract.............................................$    

(month) (day), 199x..................................................$    

(month) (day), 199y..................................................$

following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the basic clause.

$______* is presently available for payment and allotted to this

exceeding $100,000 shall bear, at the time of submission, the following 
certificate given by an individual who has knowledge of the basis of the

supporting data, and knowledge of the claim or request:
    I certify that the claim is made in good faith, that the supporting 
data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief;

for which the Contracting believes the Government is liable; and that I 
am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor.

disclosure of all relevant facts, including cost and pricing data.

does not apply to:
    (1) Requests for routine contract payments; for example, those for 
payment for accepted supplies and services, routine vouchers under cost-
reimbursement type contracts, and progress payment invoices; or
    (2) Final adjustments under incentive provisions of contracts.
    (d) In those situations where no claim certification for the 
purposes of 10 U.S.C. 2410e has been submitted prior to the inception of 
a contract dispute, a single certification, using the language 
prescribed by the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) but 
signed by an individual who is authorized to bind the contractor and who 
has knowledge of the basis of the claim or request, knowledge of the 
accuracy and completeness of the supporting data, and knowledge of the 
claim or request, will satisfy the certification requirements of both 
statutes.

    (e) If this is a request for equitable adjustment under a 
substantially completed contract or a completed contract, the 
certification will be expanded to include the following:
    This claim includes only costs for performing the alleged change, 
and does not include any costs which have already been reimbursed or 
which have been separately claimed. All indirect costs claimed are 
properly allocable to the alleged change in accordance with applicable 
acquisition regulations. I am aware that the submission of a false claim 
to the Government can result in the assessment of significant criminal 
and civil penalties and fines.

Sec. 252.236-7005  Airfield safety precautions.

    As prescribed in 236.570(b)(3), use the following clause. At some 
airfields, the width of the primary surface is 1,500 feet (750 feet on 
each side of the runway centerline). In such instances, substitute the 
proper width in the clause.

                 Airfield Safety Precautions (Dec. 1991)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
    (1) Landing areas means--
    (i) The primary surfaces, comprising the surface of the runway, 
runway shoulders, and lateral safety zones. The length of each primary 
surface is the same as the runway length. The width of each primary 
surface is 2,000 feet (1,000 feet on each side of the runway 
centerline);
    (ii) The clear zone beyond the ends of each runway, i.e., the 
extension of the primary surface for a distance of 1,000 feet beyond 
each end of each runway;
    (iii) All taxiways, plus the lateral clearance zones along each side 
for the length of the taxiways (the outer edge of each lateral clearance 
zone is laterally 250 feet from the far or opposite edge of the taxiway, 
e.g., a 75-foot-wide taxiway would have a combined width of taxiway and 
lateral clearance zones of 425 feet); and
    (iv) All aircraft parking aprons, plus the area 125 feet in width 
extending beyond each edge all around the aprons.
    (2) Safety precaution areas means those portions of approach-
departure clearance zones and transitional zones where placement of 
objects incident to contract performance might result in vertical 
projections at or above the approach-departure clearance, or the 
transitional surface.
    (i) The approach-departure clearance surface is an extension of the 
primary surface and the clear zone at each end of each runway, for a 
distance of 50,000 feet, first along an inclined (glide angle) and then 
along a horizontal plane, both flaring symmetrically about the runway 
centerline extended.
    (A) The inclined plane (glide angle) begins in the clear zone 200 
feet past the end of the runway (and primary surface) at the same 
elevation as the end of the runway. It continues upward at a slope of 
50:1 (1 foot vertically for each 50 feet horizontally) to an elevation 
of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation. At that point the 
plane becomes horizontal, continuing at that same uniform elevation to a 
point 50,000 feet longitudinally from the beginning of the inclined 
plane (glide angle) and ending there.
    (B) The width of the surface at the beginning of the inclined plane 
(glide angle) is the same as the width of the clear zone. It then flares 
uniformly, reaching the maximum width of 16,000 feet at the end.
    (ii) The approach-departure clearance zone is the ground area under 
the approach-departure clearance surface.
    (iii) The transitional surface is a sideways extension of all 
primary surfaces, clear zones, and approach-departure clearance surfaces 
along inclined planes.
    (A) The inclined plane in each case begins at the edge of the 
surface.
    (B) The slope of the incline plane is 7:1 (1 foot vertically for 
each 7 feet horizontally). It continues to the point of intersection 
with the--
    (1) Inner horizontal surface (which is the horizontal plane 150 feet 
above the established airfield elevation); or
    (2) Outer horizontal surface (which is the horizontal plane 500 feet 
above the established airfield elevation), whichever is applicable.
    (iv) The ``transitional zone'' is the ground area under the 
transitional surface. (It adjoins the primary surface, clear zone, and 
approach-departure clearance zone.)
    (b) General. (1) The Contractor shall comply with the requirements 
of this clause while--
    (i) Operating all ground equipment (mobile or stationary);
    (ii) Placing all materials; and
    (iii) Performing all work, upon and around all airfields.
    (2) The requirements of this clause are in addition to any other 
safety requirements of this contract.
    (c) The Contractor shall--
    (1) Report to the Contracting Officer before initiating any work;
    (2) Notify the Contracting Officer of proposed changes to locations 
and operations;
    (3) Not permit either its equipment or personnel to use any runway 
for purposes other than aircraft operation without permission of the 
Contracting Officer, unless the runway is--
    (i) Closed by order of the Contracting Officer; and
    (ii) Marked as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this clause;

[[Page 121]]

    (4) Keep all paved surfaces, such as runways, taxiways, and 
hardstands, clean at all times and, specifically, free from small stones 
which might damage aircraft propellers or jet aircraft;
    (5) Operate mobile equipment according to the safety provisions of 
this clause, while actually performing work on the airfield. At all 
other times, the Contractor shall remove all mobile equipment to 
locations--
    (i) Approved by the Contracting Officer;
    (ii) At a distance of at least 750 feet from the runway centerline, 
plus any additional distance; and
    (iii) Necessary to ensure compliance with the other provisions of 
this clause; and
    (6) Not open a trench unless material is on hand and ready for 
placing in the trench. As soon as practicable after material has been 
placed and work approved, the Contractor shall backfill and compact 
trenches as required by the contract. Meanwhile, all hazardous 
conditions shall be marked and lighted in accordance with the other 
provisions of this clause.
    (d) Landing areas. The Contractor shall--
    (1) Place nothing upon the landing areas without the authorization 
of the Contracting Officer;
    (2) Outline those landing areas hazardous to aircraft, using (unless 
otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer) red flags by day, and 
electric, battery-operated low-intensity red flasher lights by night;
    (3) Obtain, at an airfield where flying is controlled, additional 
permission from the control tower operator every time before entering 
any landing area, unless the landing area is marked as hazardous in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this clause;
    (4) Identify all vehicles it operates in landing areas by means of a 
flag on a staff attached to, and flying above, the vehicle. The flag 
shall be three feet square, and consist of a checkered pattern of 
international orange and white squares of 1 foot on each side (except 
that the flag may vary up to ten percent from each of these dimensions);
    (5) Mark all other equipment and materials in the landing areas, 
using the same marking devices as in paragraph (d)(2) of this clause; 
and
    (6) Perform work so as to leave that portion of the landing area 
which is available to aircraft free from hazards, holes, piles of 
material, and projecting shoulders that might damage an airplane tire.
    (e) Safety precaution areas. The Contractor shall--
    (1) Place nothing upon the safety precaution areas without 
authorization of the Contracting Officer;
    (2) Mark all equipment and materials in safety precaution areas, 
using (unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer) red flags 
by day, and electric, battery-operated, low-intensity red flasher lights 
by night; and
    (3) Provide all objects placed in safety precaution areas with a red 
light or red lantern at night, if the objects project above the 
approach-departure clearance surface or above the transitional surface.

    As prescribed in 236.570(b)(5), use the following provision:

                 Additive or Deductive Items (Dec. 1991)

    (a) The low offeror and the items to be awarded shall be determined 
as follows--
    (1) Prior to the opening of bids, the Government will determine the 
amount of funds available for the project.
    (2) The low offeror shall be the Offeror that--
    (i) Is otherwise eligible for award; and
    (ii) Offers the lowest aggregate amount for the first or base bid 
item, plus or minus (in the order stated in the list of priorities in 
the bid schedule) those additive or deductive items that provide the 
most features within the funds determined available.
    (3) The Contracting Officer shall evaluate all bids on the basis of 
the same additive or deductive items.
    (i) If adding another item from the bid schedule list of priorities 
would make the award exceed the available funds for all offerors, the 
Contracting Officer will skip

[[Page 122]]

that item and go to the next item from the bid schedule of priorities; 
and
    (ii) Add that next item if an award may be made that includes that 
item and is within the available funds.
    (b) The Contracting Officer will use the list of priorities in the 
bid schedule only to determine the low offeror. After determining the 
low offeror, an award may be made on any combination of items if--
    (1) It is in the best interest of the Government;
    (2) Funds are available at the time of award; and
    (3) The low offeror's price for the combination to be awarded is 
less than the price offered by any other responsive, responsible 
offeror.
    (c) Example. The amount available is $100,000. Offeror A's base bid 
and four additives (in the order stated in the list of priorities in the 
bid Schedule) are $85,000, $10,000, $8,000, $6,000, and $4,000. Offeror 
B's base bid and four additives are $80,000, $16,000, $9,000, $7,000, 
and $4,000. Offeror A is the low offeror. The aggregate amount of 
offeror A's bid for purposes of award would be $99,000, which includes a 
base bid plus the first and fourth additives. The second and third 
additives were skipped because each of them would cause the aggregate 
bid to exceed $100,000.

          Identification of Uncompensated Overtime (Apr. 1992)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this provision--
    (1) Uncompensated overtime means the hours worked in excess of an 
average of 40 hours per week by direct charge employees who are exempt 
from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), without additional 
compensation. Compensated personal absences, such as holidays, 
vacations, and sick leave, shall be included in the normal work week for 
purposes of computing uncompensated overtime hours.
    (2) Uncompensated overtime rate is the rate which results from 
multiplying the hourly rate for a 40 hour work week by 40, and then 
dividing by the proposed hours per week. For example, 45 hours proposed 
on a 40 hour work week basis at $20.00 would be converted to an 
uncompensated overtime rate of $17.78 per hour. ($20  x  40) divided by 
45=$17.78.
    (b) For any hours proposed against which an uncompensated overtime 
rate is applied, the Offeror shall identify in its proposal the hours in 
excess of an average of 40 hours per week, at the same level of detail 
as compensated hours, and the uncompensated overtime rate per hour, 
whether at the prime or subcontract level. This includes uncompensated 
overtime hours that are in indirect cost pools for personnel whose 
regular hours are normally charged direct.
    (c) The Offeror's accounting practices used to estimate 
uncompensated overtime must be consistent with its cost accounting 
practices used to accumulate and report uncompensated overtime hours.
    (d) Proposals which include unrealistically low labor rates, or 
which do not otherwise demonstrate cost realism, will be considered in a 
risk assessment and evaluated for award in accordance with that 
assessment.
    (e) The Offeror shall include a copy of its policy addressing 
uncompensated overtime with its proposal.

with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state 
authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial 
appeal and regulatory bodies which regulate a company owned by the same 
entity which creates the regulatory body are not ``governmental 
regulatory bodies.''
    (b) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under 
this agreement/contract in accordance with--
    (1) All applicable tariffs, rates, charges, rules, regulations, or 
requirements;
    (i) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and

[[Page 129]]

case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of 
facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.
    (f) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders--Common 
Carriers clause, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the

paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified 
shall be equitably adjusted under applicable tariffs filed by the 
Contractor with the regulatory commission in effect at the time of 
deferral or change. If no tariffs are in effect, the Government and the 
Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure

    (a) If the Government cancels any of the services ordered under this 
agreement/contract, before the services are made available to the 
Government, or terminates any of these services after they are made 
available to the Government, the Government shall reimburse the 
Contractor for the actual nonrecoverable costs the Contractor has 
reasonably incurred in providing facilities and equipment for which the 
Contractor has no foreseeable reuse.
    (b) The amount of the Government's liability upon cancellation or 
termination of any of the services ordered under this agreement/contract 
will be determined under applicable tariffs governing cancellation and 
termination charges which--

[[Page 130]]

    (1) Are filed by the Contractor with a governmental regulatory body, 
as defined in the Rates, Charges, and Services--Common Carriers clause 
of this agreement/contract;
    (2) Are in effect on the date of termination; and
    (3) Provide specific cancellation or termination charges for the 
facilities and equipment involved or show how to determine the charges.
    (c) The amount of the Government's liability upon cancellation or 
termination of any of the services ordered under this agreement/
contract, which are not subject to a governmental regulatory body, will 
be determined under a mutually agreed schedule in the communication 
services authorization (CSA) or other contractual document.
    (d) If no applicable tariffs are in effect on the date of 
cancellation or termination or set forth in the applicable CSA or other 
contractual document, the Government's liability will be determined 
under the following settlement procedures--
    (1) The Contractor agrees to provide the Contracting Officer, in 
such reasonable detail as the Contracting Officer may require, certified 
inventory schedules covering all items of property or facilities in the 
Contractor's possession, the cost of which is included in the Basic 
Cancellation or Termination Liability for which the Contractor has no 
foreseeable reuse.
    (2) The Contractor shall use its best efforts to sell property or 
facilities when the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse or when the 
Government has not exercised its option to take title under the title to 
Telecommunications Facilities and Equipment clause of this agreement/
contract. The Contractor shall apply any proceeds of the sale to reduce 
any payments by the Government to the Contractor under a cancellation or 
termination settlement.
    (3) The Contractor shall record actual nonrecoverable costs under 
established accounting procedures prescribed by the cognizant 
governmental regulatory authority or, if no such procedures have been 
prescribed, under generally accepted accounting procedures applicable to 
the provision of telecommunication services for public use.
    (4) The actual nonrecoverable costs are the installed costs of the 
facilities and equipment, less cost of reusable materials, and less net 
salvage value. Installed costs shall include the actual cost of 
equipment and materials specifically provided or used, plus the actual 
cost of installing (including engineering, labor, supervision, 
transportation, rights-of-way, and any other items which are chargeable 
to the capital accounts of the Contractor) less any costs the Government 
may have directly reimbursed the Contractor under the Special 
Construction and Equipment Charges clause of this agreement/contract. 
Deduct from the Contractor's installed cost, the net salvage value 
(salvage value less cost of removal). In determining net salvage value, 
give consideration to foreseeable reuse of the facilities and equipment 
by the Contractor. Make allowance for the cost of dismantling, removal, 
reconditioning, and disposal of the facilities and equipment when 
necessary either to the sale of facilities or their reuse by the 
Contractor in another location.
    (5) The Basic Cancellation Liability is defined as the actual 
nonrecoverable cost which the Government shall reimburse the Contractor 
at the time services are cancelled. The Basic Termination Liability is 
defined as the nonrecoverable cost amortized in equal monthly increments 
throughout the liability period. Upon termination of services, the 
Government shall reimburse the Contractor for the nonrecoverable cost 
less such costs amortized to the date services are terminated. Establish 
the liability period as mutually agreed to but not to exceed ten years.
    (6) When the Basic Cancellation or Termination Liability established 
by the CSA or other contractual document is based on estimated costs, 
the Contractor agrees to settle on the basis of actual cost at the time 
of termination or cancellation.
    (7) The Contractor agrees that, if after settlement but within the 
termination liability period of the services, should the Contractor make 
reuse of equipment or facilities which were treated as nonreusable or 
nonsalvagable in the settlement, the Contractor shall reimburse the 
Government for the value of the equipment or facilities.
    (8) The Contractor agrees to exclude--
    (i) Any costs which are not included in determining cancellation and 
termination charges under the Contractor's standard practices or 
procedures; and
    (ii) Charges not ordinarily made by the Contractor for similar 
facilities or equipment, furnished under similar circumstances.
    (e) The Government may, under such terms and conditions as it may 
prescribe, make partial payments and payments on account against costs 
incurred by the Contractor in connection with the canceled or terminated 
portion of this agreement/contract. The Government may make these 
payments if in the opinion of the Contracting Officer the total of the 
payments is within the amount the Contractor is entitled. If the total 
of the payments is in excess of the amount finally agreed or determined 
to be due under this clause, the Contractor shall pay the excess to the 
Government upon demand.
    (f) Failure to agree shall be a dispute concerning a question of 
fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause.

    (b) If at any time the Government requires that telecommunications 
facilities or equipment be relocated within the Contractor's service 
area, the Government shall have the option of paying the costs of 
relocating the facilities or equipment in lieu of paying any termination 
or cancellation charge under the Cancellation or Termination of Orders-
Common Carriers clause of this agreement/contract. The Basic Termination 
Liability applicable to the facilities or equipment in their former 
location shall continue to apply to the facilities and equipment in 
their new location. Monthly rental charges shall continue to be paid 
during the period.
    (c) When there is another requirement or foreseeable reuse in place 
of canceled or terminated facilities or equipment, no charge shall apply 
and the Basic Cancellation or Termination Liability shall be 
appropriately reduced. When feasible, the Contractor shall promptly 
reuse discontinued channels or facilities, including equipment for which

costing of material transactions.
    (2) Assess its MMAS and take reasonable action to comply with the 
MMAS standards in paragraph (f) of this clause.
    (c) Applicability. Paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause apply only 
if the Contractor--
    (1) Is a large business; and
    (2) Received, in its fiscal year preceding award of this contract, 
Department of Defense prime contracts or subcontracts, and their 
modifications totaling--
    (i) $70 million or more; or

[[Page 135]]

    (2) An MMAS disclosure is adequate when the Contractor has provided 
the Administrative Contracting Officer with documentation which--
    (i) Accurately describes those policies, procedures, and practices 
that the Contractor currently uses in its MMAS; and
    (ii) Provides sufficient detail for the Government to reasonably 
make an informed judgment regarding the adequacy of the MMAS.
    (3) An MMAS demonstration is adequate when the Contractor has 
provided the Administrative Contracting Officer--
    (i) Sufficient evidence to demonstrate the degree of compliance of 
its MMAS with the standards at paragraph (f) of this clause; and
    (ii) Identification of any significant deficiencies, the estimated 
cost impact of the deficiency, and a comprehensive corrective action 
plan.
    (4) The Contractor shall disclose significant changes in its MMAS to 
the Administrative Contracting Officer within 30 days of implementation.

information as privileged or confidential, the Contractor shall--
    (i) Notify the Government representative to whom the information is 
submitted, i.e., the ACO, or the auditor; and
    (ii) Ensure an appropriate legend is on the face of the document(s) 
at the time of submission.
    (e) Deficiencies. (1) If the Contractor receives a report which 
identifies deficiencies in its MMAS, the Contractor agrees to respond as 
follows--
    (i) If the Contractor agrees with the report findings and 
recommendations, the Contractor shall--
    (A) Within 30 days, state its agreement in writing; and

integrity, and comply with the following:
    (1) Have an adequate system description including policies, 
procedures, and operating instructions which comply with the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation and Defense FAR Supplement;
    (2) Ensure that costs of purchased and fabricated material charged 
or allocated to a contract are based on valid time-phased requirements 
as impacted by minimum/economic order quantity restrictions--
    (i) A 98 percent bill of material accuracy and a 95 percent master 
production schedule accuracy are desirable as a goal in order to ensure 
that requirements are both valid and appropriately time-phased.
    (ii) If systems have accuracy levels below these, the Contractor 
shall demonstrate that--
    (A) There is no material harm to the Government due to lower 
accuracy levels; and
    (B) The cost to meet the accuracy goals is excessive in relation to 
the impact on the Government;
    (3) Provide a mechanism to identify, report, and resolve system 
control weaknesses and manual override. Systems should identify 
operational exceptions such as excess/residual inventory as soon as 
known;
    (4) Provide audit trails and maintain records (manual and those in 
machine readable form) necessary to evaluate system logic and to verify 
through transaction testing that the system is operating as desired;
    (5) Establish and maintain adequate levels of record accuracy, and 
include reconciliation of recorded inventory quantities to physical 
inventory by part number on a periodic basis. A 95 percent accuracy 
level is desirable. If systems have an accuracy level below 95 percent, 
the Contractor shall demonstrate that--
    (i) There is no material harm to the Government due to lower 
accuracy levels; and
    (ii) The cost to meet the accuracy goal is excessive in relation to 
the impact on the Government;
    (6) Provide detailed descriptions of circumstances which will result 
in manual or system generated transfers of parts;
    (7) Maintain a consistent, equitable, and unbiased logic for costing 
of material transactions--
    (i) The Contractor shall maintain and disclose written policies 
describing the transfer methodology and the loan/pay-back technique.
    (ii) The costing methodology may be standard or actual cost, or any 
of the inventory costing methods in 48 CFR 9904.411-50(b). Consistency 
shall be maintained across all contract and customer types, and from 
accounting period to accounting period for initial charging and transfer 
charging.
    (iii) The system should transfer parts and associated costs within 
the same billing period. In the few instances where this may not be 
appropriate, the Contractor may accomplish the material transaction 
using a loan/pay-back technique. The ``loan/pay-back technique'' means 
that the physical part is

[[Page 136]]

moved temporarily from the contract, but the cost of the part remains on 
the contract. The procedures for the loan/pay-back technique must be 
approved by the Administrative Contracting Officer. When the technique 
is used, the Contractor shall have controls to ensure--
    (A) Parts are paid back expeditiously;
    (B) Procedures and controls are in place to correct any overbilling 
that might occur;
    (C) Monthly, at a minimum, identification of the borrowing contract 
and the date the part was borrowed; and
    (D) The cost of the replacement part is charged to the borrowing 
contract;
    (8) Where allocations from common inventory accounts are used, have 
controls (in addition to those in paragraphs (b)(2) and (7) of this 
clause) to ensure that--
    (i) Reallocations and any credit due are processed no less 
frequently than the routine billing cycle;
    (ii) Inventories retained for requirements which are not under 
contract are not allocated to contracts; and
    (iii) Algorithms are maintained based on valid and current data;
    (9) Notwithstanding FAR 45.505-3(f)(1)(ii), have adequate controls 
to ensure that physically commingled inventories that may include 
material for which costs are charged or allocated to fixed-price, cost-
reimbursement, and commercial contracts do not compromise requirements 
of any of the standards in paragraphs (f)(1) through (8) of this clause. 
Government furnished material shall not be--
    (i) Physically commingled with other material; or
    (ii) Used on commercial work; and
    (10) Be subjected to periodic internal audits to ensure compliance 
with established policies and procedures.

                             (End of clause)

    (2) Measurement of performance (value for completed tasks); and
    (3) Generation of timely and reliable information for the cost/
schedule status report (C/SSR).
    (b) As a minimum, the Contractor's management procedures must 
provide for--
    (1) Establishing the time-phased budgeted cost of work scheduled 
(including work authorization, budgeting, and scheduling), the budgeted 
cost for work performed, the actual cost of work performed, the budget 
at completion, the estimate at completion, and provisions for 
subcontractor performance measurement and reporting;

    (3) Incorporating changes to the contract budget base for both 
Government directed changes and internal replanning;
    (4) Establishing constraints to preclude subjective adjustment of 
data to ensure performance measurement remains realistic. Unless the 
Contracting Officer provides prior written approval, in no case shall 
the total allocated budget exceed the contract budget base. For cost 
reimbursement contracts, the contract budget base shall exclude changes 
for cost growth increases, other than for authorized changes to the 
contract scope; and
    (5) Establishing the capability to accurately identify and explain 
significant cost and schedule variances, both on a cumulative basis and 
projected at completion basis.
    (c) The Offeror/Contractor may use a cost/schedule control system

planning, control and data generation in actual operation and satisfy 
the requirements of paragraph (a) of this clause.
    (e) The Contractor shall provide access to all pertinent records, 
company procedures, and data requested by the Contracting Officer, or 
authorized representative, to--
    (1) Show proper implementation of the procedures generating the cost 
schedule information being used to satisfy the C/SSR contractual data 
requirements to the Government; and
    (2) Ensure continuing application of the accepted company procedures 
in satisfying the C/SSR data item.

[[Page 137]]

    (f) The Contractor shall submit any substantive changes to the 
procedures and their impact to the Contracting Officer for review.
    (g) The Contractor shall require a subcontractor to furnish C/SSR in 
each case where the subcontract is other than firm fixed-price, is 12 
months or more in duration, and has critical or significant tasks 
related to the prime contract. Critical or significant tasks shall be 
defined by mutual agreement between the Government and Contractor. Each 
subcontractor's reported cost and schedule information shall be 
incorporated into the Contractor's C/SSR.

    As prescribed in 251.107, use the following clause:

           Ordering From Government Supply Sources (May 1995)

    (a) When placing orders under Federal Supply Schedules or Personal 
Property Rehabilitation Price Schedules, the Contractor shall follow the 
terms of the applicable schedule and authorization. Include in each 
order:
    (1) A copy of the authorization (unless a copy was previously 
furnished to the Federal Supply Schedule or Personal Property 
Rehabilitation Price Schedule contractor).
    (2) The following statement: This order is placed under written 
authorization from ____________ dated ____________.

In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of 
this order and those of your Federal Supply Schedule contract or 
Personal Property Rehabilitation Price Schedule contract, the latter 
will govern.
    (3) The completed address(es) to which the Contractor's mail, 
freight, and billing documents are to be directed.
    (b) If a Federal Supply Schedule contractor refuses to honor an 
order placed by a Government contractor under an agency authorization, 
the Contractor shall report the circumstances to the General Services 
Administration, FFN, Washington, DC 20406, with a copy to the 
authorizing office.
    (c) When placing orders under nonmandatory schedule contracts and 
requirements contracts, issued by the General Services Administration 
(GSA) Office of Information Resources Management, for automated data 
processing equipment, software and maintenance, communications equipment 
and supplies, and teleprocessing services, the Contractor shall follow 
the terms of the applicable contract and the procedures in paragraph (a) 
of this clause.

    (1) Comply with the requirements of the Contracting Officer's

purchases made from DoD supply sources, this means within 30 days of the 
date of a proper invoice (see also Defense Federal Acquisition 
Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 251.105). For purposes of computing 
interest for late Contractor payments, the Government's invoice is 
deemed to be a demand for payment in accordance with the Interest clause 
of this contract. The Contractor's failure to pay may also result in the 
DoD supply source refusing to honor the requisition (see DFARS 
251.102(f)) or in the Contracting Officer terminating the Contractor's 
authorization to use DoD supply sources. In the event the Contracting 
Officer decides to terminate the authorization due to the Contractor's 
failure to pay in a timely manner, the Contracting Officer shall provide 
the Contractor with prompt written notice of the intent to terminate the 
authorization and the basis for such action. The Contractor shall have 
10 days after receipt of the Government's notice in which to provide 
additional information as to why the authorization should not be 
terminated. Such termination shall not provide the Contractor with an 
excusable delay for failure to perform or complete the contract in 
accordance with the terms of the contract, and the Contractor shall be 
solely responsible for any increased costs.
    (e) Only the Contractor may request authorization for subcontractor 
use of Government supply sources. The Contracting Officer will not grant 
authorizations for subcontractor use without approval of the Contractor.
    (f) Government invoices shall be submitted to the Contractor's 
billing address, and Contractor payments shall be sent to the Government 
remittance address specified below:

Contractor's Billing Address (include point of contact and telephone 
number):

Government Remittance Address (include point of contact and telephone 
number):

from the Government, the cost or expense of any use of IFMS vehicles and

                Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals

Approved 1 May 1962.
Revised 1 May 1969.
Revised 1 September 1973.
Revised 1 July 1979.

                             Part 1--Charter

    1. There is created the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals 
which is hereby designated as the authorized representative of the 
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the 
Navy and the Secretary of the Air Force, in hearing, considering and 
determining appeals by contractors from decisions of contracting 
officers or their authorized representatives or other authorities on 
disputed questions. These appeals may be taken (a) pursuant to the 
Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. Sec. 601, et seq.), (b) 
pursuant to the provisions of contracts requiring the decision by the 
Secretary of Defense or by a Secretary of a Military Department or their 
duly authorized representative or board, or (c) pursuant to the 
provisions of any directive whereby the Secretary of Defense or the 
Secretary of a Military Department has granted a right of appeal not 
contained in the contract on any matter consistent with the contract 
appeals procedure. The Board may determine contract disputes for other 
departments and agencies by agreement. The Board shall operate under 
general policies established or approved by the Under Secretary of 
Defense (Research and Engineering).
    2. Membership of the Board shall consist of attorneys at law who 
have been qualified in the manner prescribed by the Contract Disputes 
Act of 1978. Members of the Board are hereby designated Administrative 
Judges. There shall be appointed from members of the Board a chairman 
and two or more vice-chairmen. Appointment of the chairman and vice-
chairmen and other members of the Board shall be made by the Under 
Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) and the Assistant 
Secretaries of the Military Departments responsible for procurement. The 
chairman and vice-chairmen shall serve in that capacity for a two-year 
term unless sooner removed or reappointed for an additional term or 
terms. The Under Secretary will also designate the order in which the 
vice-chairmen will act for the chairman in his absence. In the absence 
of a vice-chairman, the chairman or acting chairman may designate a 
member of the Board to serve as a temporary vice-chairman.
    3. It shall be the duty and obligation of the members of the Armed 
Services Board of Contract Appeals to decide appeals on the record of 
the appeal to the best of their knowledge and ability in accordance with 
applicable contract provisions and in accordance with law and regulation 
pertinent thereto.
    4. The chairman of the Board shall be responsible for establishing 
appropriate divisions of the Board to provide for the most effective and 
expeditous handling of appeals. He shall be reponsible for assigning 
appeals to the divisions for decision without regard to the military 
department or other procuring agency which entered into the contract. A 
division may consist of one or more members of the Board. The chairman 
shall designate one member of each division as the division head. The 
division heads and the chairman and vice-chairmen shall constitute the 
senior deciding group of the Board. A majority of the members of a 
division or of the senior deciding group shall constitute a quorum for 
the transaction of the business of each, respectively. Decisions of the 
Board shall be by majority vote of the members of a division 
participating and the chairman and a vice-chairman, unless the chairman 
refers the appeal for decision by the senior deciding group. The 
decision of the Board in cases so referred to the senior deciding group 
shall be by majority vote of the participating members of that group. 
The chairman may refer an appeal of unusual difficulty, significant 
precedential importance, or serious dispute within the normal decision 
process for decision by the senior deciding group. An appeal involving 
$50,000 or less may be decided by a single member or fewer members of 
the Board than hereinbefore provided for cases of unlimited dollar 
amount, under accelerated or expedited procedures as provided in the 
Rules of the Board and the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.
    5. The Board shall have all powers necessary and incident to the 
proper performance of its duties. Subject to the approval of the Under 
Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) and the Assistant 
Secretaries of the Military Departments responsible for procurement, the 
Board shall adopt its own methods of procedure, and rules and 
regulations for its conduct and for the preparation and presentation of 
appeals and issuance of opinions. The Military Departments and other 
procuring agencies shall provide

[[Page 182]]

legal personnel to prepare and present the contentions of the 
departments or agencies in relation to appeals filed with the Board. It 
shall not be necessary for the Board, unless it otherwise desires, to 
communicate with more than one trial attorney in each of the departments 
or agencies concerning the preparation and presentation of appeals and 
the obtaining of all records deemed by the Board to be pertinent 
thereto.
    6. Any member of the Board or any examiner, designated by the 
chairman, shall be authorized to hold hearings, examine witnesses, and 
receive evidence and argument for consideration and determination of the 
appeal by the designated division. A member of the Board shall have 
authority to administer oaths and issue subpoenas as specified in 
section 11 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. The chairman may 
request orders of the court in cases of contumacy or refusal to obey a 
subpoena in the manner prescribed in that section.
    7. The chairman shall be responsible for the internal organization 
of the Board and for its administration. He shall provide within 
approved ceilings for the staffing of the Board with non-member 
personnel, including hearing examiners, as may be required for the 
performance of the functions of the Board. The chairman shall appoint a 
recorder of the Board. Such personnel shall be responsible to and shall 
function under the direction, supervision and control of the chairman.
    8. The Board will be serviced by the Department of the Army for 
administrative support for its operations as required. Administrative 
support will include budgeting, funding, fiscal control, manpower 
control and utilization, personnel administration, security 
administration, supplies, and other administrative services. The 
Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Office of the Secretary 
of Defense will participate in financing the Board's operations on an 
equal basis and to the extent determined by the Assistant Secretary of 
Defense (Comptroller). The cost of processing appeals for departments 
and agencies other than those in the Department of Defense will be 
reimbursed.
    9. The chairman of the Board will furnish the Secretary of Defense 
and to the Secretaries of the Military Departments by October 31 of each 
year a report containing an account of the Board's transactions and 
proceedings for the preceding fiscal year. Within 30 days following the 
close of a calendar quarter, the chairman shall forward a report of the 
Board's proceedings for the quarter to the Under Secretary of Defense 
(Research and Engineering), the Assistant Secretaries of the Military 
Departments responsible for procurement, and to the Director of the 
Defense Logistics Agency. Such reports shall disclose the number of 
appeals received, cases heard, opinions rendered, current reserve of 
pending matters, and such other information as may be required.
    10. The Board shall have a seal bearing the following inscription: 
``Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.'' This seal shall be affixed 
to all authentications of copies of records and to such other 
instruments as the Board may determine.
    11. This revised charter is effective April 21, 1980.

                                 Preface

                 I. Jurisdiction for Considering Appeals

    The Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (referred to herein as 
the Board) shall consider and determine appeals from decisions of 
contracting officers pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 Pub. 
L. 95-563, 41 U.S.C. 601-613) relating to contracts made by (i) the 
Departments of Defense, Army, Navy and Air Force or (ii) any other 
executive agency when such agency or the Administrator for Federal 
Procurement Policy has designated the Board to decide the appeal.

               II. Location and Organization of the Board

    (a) The Board's address is Skyline Six, 5109 Leesburg Pike, 7th 
Floor, Falls Church, VA 22041, telephone (202) 756-8500 (receptionist), 
756-8502 (recorder).
    (b) The Board consists of a chairman, two or more vice chairmen, and 
other members, all of whom are attorneys at law duly licensed by a 
state, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia. Board 
members are designated Administrative Judges.
    (c) There are a number of divisions of the Armed Services Board of 
Contract Appeals, established by the Chairman of the Board in such 
manner as to provide for the most effective and expeditious handling of 
appeals. The Chairman and a Vice Chairman of the Board act as members of 
each division. Appeals are assigned to the divisions for decision 
without regard to the military department or other procuring agency 
which entered into the contract involved. Hearing may be held by a 
designated member (Administrative Judge), or by a duly authorized 
examiner. Except for

[[Page 183]]

appeals processed under the expedited or accelerated procedure, the 
decision of a majority of a division constitutes the decision of the 
Board, unless the chairman refers the appeal to the Board's Senior 
Deciding Group (consisting of the chairman, vice chairmen and all 
division heads), in which event a decision of a majority of that group 
constitutes the decision of the Board. Appeals referred to the Senior 
Deciding Group are those of unusual difficulty, significant precedential 
importance, or serious dispute within the normal division decision 
process. For decisions of appeals processed under the expedited or 
accelerated procedure, see rules 12.2(c) and 12.3(b).

                         Preliminary Procedures

    1. Appeals, How Taken. (a) Notice of an appeal shall be in writing 
and mailed or otherwise furnished to the Board within 90 days from the 
date of receipt of a contracting officer's decision. A copy thereof 
shall be furnished to the contracting officer from whose decision the 
appeal is taken.
    (b) Where the contractor has submitted a claim of $50,000 or less to 
the contracting officer and has requested a written decision within 60 
days from receipt of the request, and the contracting officer has not 
done so, the contractor may file a notice of appeal as provided in 
subparagraph (a) above, citing the failure of the contracting officer to 
issue a decision.
    (c) Where the contractor has submitted a properly certified claim 
over $50,000 to the contracting officer or has requested a decision by 
the contracting officer which presently involves no monetary amount 
pursuant to the Disputes clause, and the contracting officer has failed 
to issue a decision within a reasonable time, taking into account such 
factors as the size and complexity of the claim, the contractor may file 
a notice of appeal as provided in subparagraph (a) above, citing the 
failure of the contracting officer to issue a decision.
    (d) Upon docketing of appeals filed pursuant to (b) or (c) hereof, 
the Board may, at its option, stay further proceedings pending issuance 
of a final decision by the contracting officer within such period of 
time as is determined by the Board.
    (e) In lieu of filing a notice of appeal under (b) or (c) hereof, 
the contractor may request the Board to direct the contracting officer 
to issue a decision in a specified period of time, as determined by the 
Board, in the event of undue delay on the part of the contracting 
officer.
    2. Notice of Appeal, Contents of. A notice of appeal should indicate 
that an appeal is being taken and should identify the contract (by 
number), the department and/or agency involved in the dispute, the 
decision from which the appeal is taken, and the amount in dispute, if 
known. The notice of appeal should be signed personally by the appellant 
(the contractor taking the appeal), or by the appellant's duly 
authorized representative or attorney. The complaint referred to in rule 
6 may be filed with the notice of appeal, or the appellant may designate 
the notice of appeal as a complaint, if it otherwise fulfills the 
requirements of a complaint.
    3. Docketing of Appeals. When a notice of appeal in any form has 
been received by the Board, it shall be docketed promptly. Notice in 
writing shall be given to the appellant with a copy of these rules, and 
to the contracting officer.
    4. Preparation, Content, Organization, Forwarding, and Status of 
Appeal File-- (a) Duties of Contracting Officer--Within 30 days of 
receipt of an appeal, or notice that an appeal has been filed, the 
contracting officer shall assemble and transmit to the Board an appeal 
file consisting of all documents pertinent to the appeal, including:
    (1) The decision from which the appeal is taken;
    (2) The contract, including pertinent specifications, amendments, 
plans and drawings;
    (3) All correspondence between the parties relevant to the appeal, 
including the letter or letters of claim in response to which the 
decision was issued;
    (4) Transcripts of any testimony taken during the course of 
proceedings, and affidavits or statements of any witnesses on the matter 
in dispute made prior to the filing of the notice of appeal with the 
Board; and
    (5) Any additional information considered relevant to the appeal.
    Within the same time above specified the contracting officer shall 
furnish the appellant a copy of each document he transmits to the Board, 
except those in subparagraph (a)(2) above. As to the latter, a list 
furnished appellant indicating specific contractual documents 
transmitted will suffice.
    (b) Duties of the Appellant--Within 30 days after receipt of a copy 
of the appeal file assembled by the contracting officer, the appellant 
shall transmit to the Board any documents not contained therein which he 
considers relevant to the appeal, and furnish two copies of such 
documents to the government trial attorney.
    (c) Organization of Appeal File--Documents in the appeal file may be 
originals or legible facsimiles or authenticated copies, and shall be 
arranged in chronological order where practicable, numbered 
sequentially, tabbed, and indexed to identify the contents of the file.
    (d) Lengthy Documents--Upon request by either party, the Board may 
waive the requirement to furnish to the other party copies of bulky, 
lengthy, or out-of-size documents in the appeal file when inclusion 
would be burdensome. At the time a party files with the Board a document 
as to which such a waiver has been granted he shall notify the other

[[Page 184]]

party that the document or a copy is available for inspection at the 
offices of the Board or of the party filing same.
    (e) Status of Documents in Appeal File--Documents contained in the 
appeal file are considered, without further action by the parties, as 
part of the record upon which the Board will render its decision. 
However, a party may object, for reasons stated, to consideration of a 
particular document or documents reasonably in advance of hearing or, if 
there is no hearing, of settling the record. If such objection is made, 
the Board shall remove the document or documents from the appeal file 
and permit the party offering the document to move its admission as 
evidence in accordance with rules 13 and 20.
    (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the filing of the rule 4 (a) and 
(b) documents may be dispensed with by the Board either upon request of 
the appellant in his notice of appeal or thereafter upon stipulation of 
the parties.
    5. Motions. (a) Any motion addressed to the jurisdiction of the 
Board shall be promptly filed. Hearing on the motion shall be afforded 
on application of either party. However, the Board may defer its 
decision on the motion pending hearing on both the merits and the 
motion. The Board shall have the right at any time and on its own 
initiative to raise the issue of its jurisdiction to proceed with a 
particular case, and shall do so by an appropriate order, affording the 
parties an opportunity to be heard thereon.
    (b) The Board may entertain and rule upon other appropriate motions.
    6. Pleadings--(a) Appellant--Within 30 days after receipt of notice 
of docketing of the appeal, the appellant shall file with the Board an 
original and two copies of a complaint setting forth simple, concise and 
direct statements of each of its claims. Appellant shall also set forth 
the basis, with appropriate reference to contract provisions, of each 
claim and the dollar amount claimed, to the extent known. This pleading 
shall fulfill the generally recognized requirements of a complaint, 
although no particular form is required. Upon receipt of the complaint, 
the Board shall serve a copy of it upon the Government. Should the 
complaint not be received within 30 days, appellant's claim and appeal 
may, if in the opinion of the Board the issues before the Board are 
sufficiently defined, be deemed to set forth its complaint and the 
Government shall be so notified.
    (b) Government--Within 30 days from receipt of the complaint, or the 
aforesaid notice from the Board, the Government shall prepare and file 
with the Board an original and two copies of an answer thereto. The 
answer shall set forth simple, concise and direct statements of 
Government's defenses to each claim asserted by appellant, including any 
affirmative defenses available. Upon receipt of the answer, the Board 
shall serve a copy upon appellant. Should the answer not be received 
within 30 days, the Board may, in its discretion, enter a general denial 
on behalf of the Government, and the appellant shall be so notified.
    (c) A party who intends to raise an issue concerning the law of a 
foreign country shall give notice in his pleadings or other reasonable 
written notice. The Board, in determining foreign law, may consider any 
relevant material or source, including testimony, whether or not 
submitted by a party or admissible under Rules 11, 13 or 20. The 
determination of foreign law shall be treated as a ruling on a question 
of law.
    7. Amendments of Pleadings or Record. The Board upon its own 
initiative or upon application by a party may order a party to make a 
more definite statement of the complaint or answer, or to reply to an 
answer. The Board may, in its discretion, and within the proper scope of 
the appeal, permit either party to amend its pleading upon conditions 
fair to both parties. When issues within the proper scope of the appeal, 
but not raised by the pleadings, are tried by express or implied consent 
of the parties, or by permission of the Board, they shall be treated in 
all respects as if they had been raised therein. In such instances, 
motions to amend the pleadings to conform to the proof may be entered, 
but are not required. If evidence is objected to at a hearing on the 
ground that it is not within the issues raised by the pleadings, it may 
be admitted within the proper scope of the appeal, provided, however, 
that the objecting party may be granted a continuance if necessary to 
enable it to meet such evidence.
    8. Hearing Election. After filing of the Government's answer or 
notice from the Board that it has entered a general denial on behalf of 
the Government, each party shall advise whether it desires a hearing as 
prescribed in Rules 17 through 25, or whether it elects to submit its 
case on the record without a hearing, as prescribed in Rule 11.
    9. Prehearing Briefs. Based on an examination of the pleadings, and 
its determination of whether the arguments and authorities addressed to 
the issues are adequately set forth therein, the Board may, in its 
discretion, require the parties to submit prehearing briefs in any case 
in which a hearing has been elected pursuant to Rule 8. If the Board 
does not require prehearing briefs either party may, in its discretion 
and upon appropriate and sufficient notice to the other party, furnish a 
prehearing brief to the Board. In any case where a prehearing brief is 
submitted, it shall be furnished so as to be received by the Board at 
least 15 days prior to the date set for hearing, and a copy shall 
simultaneously be furnished to the other party as previously arranged.

[[Page 185]]

    10. Prehearing or Presubmission Conference. (a) Whether the case is 
to be submitted pursuant to Rule 11, or heard pursuant to Rules 17 
through 25, the Board may upon its own initiative, or upon the 
application of either party, arrange a telephone conference or call upon 
the parties to appear before an administrative judge or examiner of the 
Board for a conference to consider:
    (1) Simplification, clarification, or severing of the issues;
    (2) The possibility of obtaining stipulations, admissions, 
agreements and rulings on admissibility of docments, understandings on 
matters already of record, or similar agreements that will avoid 
unnecessary proof;
    (3) Agreements and rulings to facilitate discovery;
    (4) Limitation of the number of expert witnesses, or avoidance of 
similar cumulative evidence;
    (5) The possibility of agreement disposing of any or all of the 
issues in dispute; and
    (6) Such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the appeal.
    (b) The administrative judge or examiner of the Board shall make 
such rulings and orders as may be appropriate to aid in the disposition 
of the appeal. The results of pretrial conferences, including any 
rulings and orders, shall be reduced to writing by the administrative 
judge or examiner and this writing shall thereater constitute a part of 
the record.
    11. Submission Without a Hearing. Either party may elect to waive a 
hearing and to submit its case upon the record before the Board, as 
settled pursuant to Rule 13. Submission of a case without hearing does 
not relieve the parties from the necessity of proving the facts 
supporting their allegations or defenses. Affidavits, depositions, 
admissions, answers to interrogatories, and stipulations may be employed 
to supplement other documentary evidence in the Board record. The Board 
may permit such submissions to be supplemented by oral argument 
(transcribed if requested), and by briefs arranged in accordance with 
Rule 23.
    12. Optional SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) and ACCELERATED Procedures. 
These procedures are available solely at the election of the appellant.
    12.1  Elections to Utilize SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) and ACCELERATED 
Procedures. (a) In appeals where the amount in dispute is $10,000 or 
less, the appellant may elect to have the appeal processed under a SMALL 
CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure requiring decision of the appeal, whenever 
possible, within 120 days after the Board receives written notice of the 
appellant's election to utilize this procedure. The details of this 
procedure appear in section 12.2 of this Rule. An appellant may elect 
the ACCELERATED procedure rather than the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) 
procedure for any appeal eligible for the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) 
procedure.
    (b) In appeals where the amount in dispute is $50,000 or less, the 
appellant may elect to have the appeal processed under an ACCELERATED 
procedure requiring decision of the appeal, whenever possible, within 
180 days after the Board receives written notice of the appellant's 
election to utilize this procedure. The details of this procedure appear 
in section 12.3 of this Rule.
    (c) The appellant's election of either the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) 
procedure or the ACCELERATED procedure may be made by written notice 
within 60 days after receipt of notice of docketing, unless such period 
is extended by the Board for good cause. The election may not be 
withdrawn except with permission of the Board and for good cause.
    12.2  The Small Claims (Expedited) Procedure. (a) In cases 
proceeding under the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure, the following 
time periods shall apply:
    (1) Within 10 days from the Government's first receipt from either 
the appellant or the Board of a copy of the appellant's notice of 
election of the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure, the Government shall 
send the Board a copy of the contract, the contracting officer's final 
decision, and the appellant's claim letter or letters, if any; remaining 
documents required under Rule 4 shall be submitted in accordance with 
times specified in that rule unless the Board otherwise directs.
    (2) Within 15 days after the Board has acknowledged receipt of 
appellant's notice of election, the assigned administrative judge shall 
take the following actions, if feasible, in an informal meeting or a 
telephone conference with both parties: (i) Identify and simplify the 
issues; (ii) establish a simplified procedure appropriate to the 
particular appeal involved; (iii) determine whether either party wants a 
hearing, and if so, fix a time and place therefor; (iv) require the 
Government to furnish all the additional documents relevant to the 
appeal; and (v) establish an expedited schedule for resolution of the 
appeal.
    (b) Pleadings, discovery, and other prehearing activity will be 
allowed only as consistent with the requirement to conduct the hearing 
on the date scheduled, or if no hearing is scheduled, to close the 
record on a date that will allow decisions within the 120-day limit. The 
Board, in its discretion, may impose shortened time periods for any 
actions prescribed or allowed under these rules, as necessary to enable 
the Board to decide the appeal within the 120-day limit, allowing 
whatever time, up to 30 days, that the Board considers necessary for the 
preparation of the decision after closing the record and the filing of 
briefs, if any.

[[Page 186]]

    (c) Written decision by the Board in cases processed under the SMALL 
CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure will be short and contain only summary 
findings of fact and conclusions. Decisions will be rendered for the 
Board by a single administrative judge. If there has been a hearing, the 
administrative judge presiding at the hearing may, in the judge's 
discretion, at the conclusion of the hearing and after entertaining such 
oral arguments as deemed appropriate, render on the record oral summary 
findings of fact, conclusions, and a decision of the appeal. Whenever 
such an oral decision is rendered, the Board will subsequently furnish 
the parties a typed copy of such oral decision for record and payment 
purposes and to establish the starting date for the period for filing a 
motion for reconsideration under rule 29.
    (d) A decision against the Government or the contractor shall have 
no value as precedent, and in the absence of fraud shall be final and 
conclusive and may not be appealed or set aside.
    12.3  The Accelerated Procedure. (a) In cases proceeding under the 
Accelerated procedure, the parties are encouraged, to the extent 
possible consistent with adequate presentation of their factual and 
legal positions, to waive pleadings, discovery, and briefs. The Board, 
in its discretion, may shorten time periods prescribed or allowed 
elsewhere in these rules, including rule 4, as necessary to enable the 
Board to decide the appeal within 180 days after the Board has received 
the appellant's notice of election of the ACCELERATED procedure, and may 
reserve 30 days for preparation of the decision.
    (b) Written decision by the Board in cases processed under the 
ACCELERATED procedure will normally be short and contain only summary 
findings of fact and conclusions. Decisions will be rendered for the 
Board by a single administrative judge with the concurrence of a vice 
chairman, or by a majority among these two and the chairman in case of 
disagreement. Alternatively, in cases where the amount in dispute is 
$10,000 or less as to which the ACCELERATED procedure has been elected 
and in which there has been a hearing, the single administrative judge 
presiding at the hearing may, with the concurrence of both parties, at 
the conclusion of the hearing and after entertaining such oral arguments 
as deemed appropriate, render on the record oral summary findings of 
fact, conclusions, and a decision of the appeal. Whenever such an oral 
decision is rendered, the Board will subsequently furnish the parties a 
typed copy of such oral decision for record and payment purposes, and to 
establish the starting date for the period of filing a motion for 
reconsideration under Rule 29.
    12.4  Motions for Reconsideration in Rule 12 Cases. Motions for 
Reconsideration of cases decided under either the SMALL CLAIMS 
(EXPEDITED) procedure or the ACCELERATED procedure need not be decided 
within the original 120-day or 180-day limit, but all such motions shall 
be processed and decided rapidly so as to fulfill the intent of this 
Rule.
    13.  Settling the Record. (a) The record upon which the Board's 
decision will be rendered consists of the documents furnished under 
Rules 4 and 12, to the extent admitted in evidence, and the following 
items, if any: pleadings, prehearing conference memoranda or orders, 
prehearing briefs, depositions or interrogatories received in evidence, 
admissions, stipulations, transcripts of conferences and hearings, 
hearing exhibits, post-hearing briefs, and documents which the Board has 
specifically designated be made a part of the record. The record will, 
at all reasonable times, be available for inspection by the parties at 
the office of the Board.
    (b) Except as the Board may otherwise order in its discretion, no 
proof shall be received in evidence after completion of an oral hearing 
or, in cases submitted on the record, after notification by the Board 
that the case is ready for decision.
    (c) The weight to be attached to any evidence of record will rest 
within the sound discretion of the Board. The Board may in any case 
require either party, with appropriate notice to the other party, to 
submit additional evidence on any matter relevant to the appeal.
    14. Discovery--Depositions--(a) General Policy and Protective 
Orders--The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery 
procedures. In connection with any deposition or other discovery 
procedure, the Board may make any order required to protect a party or 
person from annoyance, embarrassment, or undue burden or expense. Those 
orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time and place for 
discovery, and provisions for protecting the secrecy of confidential 
information or documents.
    (b) When Depositions Permitted--After an appeal has been docketed 
and complaint filed, the parties may mutually agree to, or the Board 
may, upon application of either party, order the taking of testimony of 
any person by deposition upon oral examination or written 
interrogatories before any officer authorized to administer oaths at the 
place of examination, for use as evidence or for purpose of discovery. 
The application for order shall specify whether the purpose of the 
deposition is discovery or for use as evidence.
    (c) Orders on Depositions--The time, place, and manner of taking 
depositions shall be as mutually agreed by the parties, or failing such 
agreement, governed by order of the Board.
    (d) Use as Evidence--No testimony taken by depositions shall be 
considered as part of the evidence in the hearing of an appeal until

[[Page 187]]

such testimony is offered and received in evidence at such hearing. It 
will not ordinarily be received in evidence if the deponent is present 
and can testify at the hearing. In such instances, however, the 
deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the 
deponent given at the hearing. In cases submitted on the record, the 
Board may, in its discretion, receive depositions to supplement the 
record.
    (e) Expenses--Each party shall bear its own expenses associated with 
the taking of any deposition.
    (f) Subpoenas--Where appropriate, a party may request the issuance 
of a subpoena under the provisions of Rule 21.
    15. Interrogatories to Parties, Admission of Facts, and Production 
and Inspection of Documents. After an appeal has been docketed and 
complaint filed with the Board, a party may serve on the other party: 
(a) Written interrogatories to be answered separately in writing, signed 
under oath and answered or objected to within 45 days after service; (b) 
a request for the admission of specified facts and/or the authenticity 
of any documents, to be answered or objected to within 45 days after 
service; the factual statements and the authenticity of the documents to 
be deemed admitted upon failure of a party to respond to the request; 
and (c) a request for the production, inspection and copying of any 
documents or objects not privileged, which reasonably may lead to the 
discovery of admissible evidence, to be answered or objected to within 
45 days after service. The Board may allow a shorter or longer time. Any 
discovery engaged in under this Rule shall be subject to the provisions 
of Rule 14(a) with respect to general policy and protective orders, and 
of Rule 35 with respect to sanctions.
    16. Service of Papers Other Than Subpoenas. Papers shall be served 
personally or by mail, addressed to the party upon whom service is to be 
made. Copies of complaints, answers and briefs shall be filed directly 
with the Board. The party filing any other paper with the Board shall 
send a copy thereof to the opposing party, noting on the paper filed 
with the Board that a copy has been so furnished. Subpoenas shall be 
served as provided in Rule 21.

                                Hearings

    17. Where and When Held. Hearings will be held at such places 
determined by the Board to best serve the interests of the parties and 
the Board. Hearings will be scheduled at the discretion of the Board 
with due consideration to the regular order of appeals, Rule 12 
requirements, and other pertinent factors. On request or motion by 
either party and for good cause, the Board may, in its discretion, 
adjust the date of a hearing.
    18. Notice of Hearings. The parties shall be given at least 15 days 
notice of the time and place set for hearings. In scheduling hearings, 
the Board will consider the desires of the parties and the requirement 
for just and inexpensive determination of appeals without unnecessary 
delay. Notices of hearings shall be promptly acknowledged by the 
parties.
    19. Unexcused Absence of a Party. The unexcused absence of a party 
at the time and place set for hearing will not be occasion for delay. In 
the event of such absence, the hearing will proceed and the case will be 
regarded as submitted by the absent party as provided in Rule 11.
    20. Hearings: Nature, Examination of Witnesses--(a) Nature of 
Hearings--Hearings shall be as informal as may be reasonable and 
appropriate under the circumstances. Appellant and the Government may 
offer such evidence as they deem appropriate and as would be admissible 
under the Federal Rules of Evidence or in the sound discretion of the 
presiding administrative judge or examiner. Stipulations of fact agreed 
upon by the parties may be regarded and used as evidence at the hearing. 
The parties may stipulate the testimony that would be given by a witness 
if the witness were present. The Board may require evidence in addition 
to that offered by the parties.
    (b) Examination of Witnesses--Witnesses before the Board will be 
examined orally under oath or affirmation, unless the presiding 
administrative judge or examiner shall otherwise order. If the testimony 
of a witness is not given under oath, the Board may advise the witness 
that his statements may be subject to the provisions of title 18, United 
States Code, sections 287 and 1001, and any other provision of law 
imposing penalties for knowingly making false representations in 
connection with claims against the United States or in any matter within 
the jurisdiction of any department or agency thereof.
    21. Subpoenas--(a) General--Upon written request of either party 
filed with the recorder, or on his own initiative, the administrative 
judge to whom a case is assigned or who is otherwise designated by the 
chairman may issue a subpoena requiring:
    (i) Testimony at a deposition--the deposing of a witness in the city 
or county where he resides or is employed or transacts his business in 
person, or at another location convenient for him that is specifically 
determined by the Board;
    (ii) Testimony at a hearing--the attendance of a witness for the 
purpose of taking testimony at a hearing; and
    (iii) Production of books and papers--in addition to (i) or (ii), 
the production by the witness at the deposition or hearing of books and 
papers designated in the subpoena.
    (b) Voluntary Cooperation--Each party is expected (i) to cooperate 
and make available witnesses and evidence under its control as

[[Page 188]]

requested by the other party, without issuance of a subpoena, and (ii) 
to secure voluntary attendance of desired third-party witnesses and 
production of desired third-party books, papers, documents, or tangible 
things whenever possible.
    (c) Requests for Subpoenas--(1) A request for subpoena shall 
normally be filed at least:
    (i) 15 days before a scheduled deposition where the attendance of a 
witness at a deposition is sought; or
    (ii) 30 days before a scheduled hearing where the attendance of a 
witness at a hearing is sought.
    In its discretion the Board may honor requests for subpoenas not 
made within these time limitations.
    (2) A request for a subpoena shall state the reasonable scope and 
general relevance to the case of the testimony and of any books and 
papers sought.
    (d) Requests to Quash or Modify--Upon written request by the person 
subpoenaed or by a party, made within 10 days after service but in any 
event not later than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, 
the Board may (i) quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and 
oppressive or for other good cause shown, or (ii) require the person in 
whose behalf the subpoena was issued to advance the reasonable cost of 
producing subpoenaed books and papers. Where circumstances require, the 
Board may act upon such a request at any time after a copy has been 
served upon the opposing party.
    (e) Form; Issuance--(1) Every subpoena shall state the name of the 
Board and the title of the appeal, and shall command each person to whom 
it is directed to attend and give testimony, and if appropriate, to 
produce specified books and papers at a time and place therein 
specified. In issuing a subpoena to a requesting party, the 
administrative judge shall sign the subpoena and may, in his discretion, 
enter the name of the witness and otherwise leave it blank. The party to 
whom the subpoena is issued shall complete the subpoena before service.
    (2) Where the witness is located in a foreign country, a letter 
rogatory or subpoena may be issued and served under the circumstances 
and in the manner provided in 28 U.S.C. 1781-1784.
    (f) Service--(1) The party requesting issuance of a subpoena shall 
arrange for service.
    (2) A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition 
or hearing may be served at any place. A subpoena may be served by a 
United States marshal or deputy marshal, or by any other person who is 
not a party and not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena 
upon a person named therein shall be made by personally delivering a 
copy to that person and tendering the fees for one day's attendance and 
the mileage provided by 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable law; however, 
where the subpoena is issued on behalf of the Government, money payments 
need not be tendered in advance of attendance.
    (3) The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be 
responsible for the payment of fees and mileage of the witness and of 
the officer who serves the subpoena. The failure to make payment of such 
charges on demand may be deemed by the Board as a sufficient ground for 
striking the testimony of the witness and the books or papers the 
witness has produced.
    (g) Contumacy or Refusal to Obey a Subpoena--In case of contumacy or 
refusal to obey a subpoena by a person who resides, is found, or 
transacts business within the jurisdiction of a United States District 
Court, the Board will apply to the Court through the Attorney General of 
the United States for an order requiring the person to appear before the 
Board or a member thereof to give testimony or produce evidence or both. 
Any failure of any such person to obey the order of the Court may be 
punished by the Court as a contempt thereof.
    22. Copies of Papers. When books, records, papers, or documents have 
been received in evidence, a true copy thereof or of such part thereof 
as may be material or relevant may be substituted therefor, during the 
hearing or at the conclusion thereof.
    23. Post-Hearing Briefs. Post-hearing briefs may be submitted upon 
such terms as may be directed by the presiding administrative judge or 
examiner at the conclusion of the hearing.
    24. Transcript of Proceedings. Testimony and argument at hearings 
shall be reported verbatim, unless the Board otherwise orders. Waiver of 
transcript may be especially suitable for hearings under Rule 12.2. 
Transcripts of the proceedings shall be supplied to the parties at such 
rates as may be established by contract between the Board and the 
reporter, provided that ordinary copy of transcript shall be supplied to 
the appellant at an amount no greater than the cost of duplication.
    25. Withdrawal of Exhibits. After a decision has become final the 
Board may, upon request and after notice to the other party, in its 
discretion permit the withdrawal of original exhibits, or any part 
thereof, by the party entitled thereto. The substitition of true copies 
of exhibits or any part thereof may be required by the Board in its 
discretion as a condition of granting permission for such withdrawal.

                             Representation

    26. The Appellant. An individual appellant may appear before the 
Board in person, a corporation by one of its officers; and a partnership 
or joint venture by one of its members; or any of these by an attorney 
at law duly licensed in any state, commonwealth, territory, the District 
of Columbia, or in a

[[Page 189]]

foreign country. An attorney representing an appellant shall file a 
written notice of appearance with the Board.
    27. The Government. Government counsel may, in accordance with their 
authority, represent the interest of the Government before the Board. 
They shall file notices of appearance with the Board, and notice thereof 
will be given appellant or appellant's attorney in the form specified by 
the Board from time to time.

                                Decisions

    28. Decisions. (a) Decisions of the Board will be made in writing 
and authenticated copies of the decision will be forwarded 
simultaneously to both parties. The rules of the Board and all final 
orders and decisions (except those required for good cause to be held 
confidential and not cited as precedents) shall be open for public 
inspection at the offices of the Board. Decisions of the Board will be 
made solely upon the record, as described in Rule 13.
    (b) Any monetary award to a contractor by the Board shall be 
promptly paid in accordance with the procedures provided by section 1302 
of the Act of July 27, 1956 (70 Stat. 694, as amended; 31 U.S.C. 724a). 
To assure prompt payment the Recorder will forward a waiver form to each 
party with the decision. If the parties do not contemplate an appeal or 
motion for reconsideration, they will execute waivers which so state, 
and return them to the Recorder. The Recorder will forward the waivers 
and a certified copy of the award decision to the General Accounting 
Office for certification for payment.

                       Motion for Reconsideration

    29. Motion for Reconsideration. A motion for reconsideration may be 
filed by either party. It shall set forth specifically the grounds 
relied upon to sustain the motion. The motion shall be filed within 30 
days from the date of the receipt of a copy of the decision of the Board 
by the party filing the motion.

              Suspensions, Dismissals and Defaults: Remands

    30. Suspensions; Dismissal Without Prejudice. The Board may suspend 
the proceedings by agreement of counsel for settlement discussions, or 
for good cause shown. In certain cases, appeals docketed before the 
Board are required to be placed in a suspense status and the Board is 
unable to proceed with disposition thereof for reasons not within the 
control of the Board. Where the suspension has continued, or may 
continue, for an inordinate length of time, the Board may, in its 
discretion, dismiss such appeals from its docket without prejudice to 
their restoration when the cause of suspension has been removed. Unless 
either party or the Board acts within three years to reinstate any 
appeal dismissed without prejudice, the dismissal shall be deemed with 
prejudice.
    31. Dismissal or Default for Failure to Prosecute or Defend. 
Whenever a record discloses the failure of either party to file 
documents required by these rules, respond to notices or correspondence 
from the Board, comply with orders of the Board, or otherwise indicates 
an intention not to continue the prosecution or defense of an appeal, 
the Board may, in the case of a default by the appellant, issue an order 
to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed or, in the case of 
a default by the Government, issue an order to show cause why the Board 
should not act thereon pursuant to Rule 35. If good cause is not shown, 
the Board may take appropriate action.
    32. Remand from Court. Whenever any court remands a case to the 
Board for further proceedings, each of the parties shall, within 20 days 
of such remand, submit a report to the Board recommending procedures to 
be followed so as to comply with the court's order. The Board shall 
consider the reports and enter special orders governing the handling of 
the remanded case. To the extent the court's directive and time 
limitations permit, such orders shall conform to these rules.

                    Time, Computation and Extensions

    33. Time, Computation and Extensions. (a) Where possible, procedural 
actions should be taken in less time than the maximum time allowed. 
Where appropriate and justified, however, extensions of time will be 
granted. All requests for extensions of time shall be in writing.
    (b) In computing any period of time, the day of the event from which 
the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included, but 
the last day of the period shall be included unless it is a Saturday, 
Sunday, or a legal holiday, in which event the period shall run to the 
end of the next business day.

                         Ex Parte Communications

    34. Ex parte Communications. No member of the Board or the Board's 
staff shall entertain, nor shall any person directly or indirectly 
involved in an appeal, submit to the Board or the Board's staff, off the 
record, any evidence, explanation, analysis, or advice, whether written 
or oral, regarding any matter at issue in an appeal. This provision does 
not apply to consultation among Board members or to ex parte 
communications concerning the Board's administrative functions or 
procedures.

                                Sanctions

    35. Sanctions. If any party fails or refuses to obey an order issued 
by the Board, the Board may then make such order as it considers

[[Page 190]]

necessary to the just and expeditious conduct of the appeal.

                    Effective Date and Applicability

    36. Effective Date. These rules shall apply (i) mandatorily, to all 
appeals relating to contracts entered into on or after 1 March 1979, and 
(ii) at the contractor's election, to appeals relating to earlier 
contracts, with respect to claims pending before the contracting officer 
on 1 March 1979 or initiated thereafter.
    Pursuant to the Charter of the Armed Services Board of Contract 
Appeals, the attached rules are hereby approved for use and application 
to appeals to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals under the 
Contract Disputes Act of 1978.

    Authority; 41 U.S.C. 421 and FAR Subpart 1.3.
D-100  Scope.
    (a) This appendix provides policy and procedures for breaking out 
components of end items for future acquisitions so that the Government 
can purchase the components directly from the manufacturer or supplier 
and furnish them to the end item manufacturer as Government-furnished 
material.
    (b) This appendix does not apply to--
    (1) The initial decisions on Government-furnished equipment/
contractor-furnished equipment that are made at the inception of an 
acquisition program; or
    (2) Breakout of parts for replenishment (see Appendix E).
D-101  Definition.
    Component, as used in this appendix, includes subsystems, 
assemblies, subassemblies, and other major elements of an end item; it 
does not include elements of relatively small annual acquisition value.
D-102  Policy.
    DoD policy is to breakout components of weapons systems or other 
major end items under certain circumstances.
    (a) When it is anticipated that a prime contract will be awarded 
without adequate price competition, and the prime contractor is expected 
to acquire any component without adequate price competition, breakout 
that component if--
    (1) Substantial net cost savings probably will be achieved; and
    (2) Breakout action will not jeopardize the quality, reliability, 
performance, or timely delivery of the end item.
    (b) Even when either or both the prime contract and the component 
will be acquired with adequate price competition, consider breakout of 
the component if substantial net cost savings will result from--
    (1) Greater quantity acquisitions; or
    (2) Such factors as improved logistics support (through reduction in 
varieties of spare parts) and economies in operations and training 
(through standardization of design).
    (c) Breakout normally is not justified for a component that is not 
expected to exceed $1 million for the current year's requirement.
D-103  Responsibility.
    (a) Agencies are responsible for ensuring that--
    (1) Breakout reviews are performed on components meeting the 
criteria in D-102(a) and (b);
    (2) Components susceptible to breakout are earmarked for 
consideration in future acquisitions;
    (3) Components earmarked for breakout are considered during 
requirements determination and appropriate decisions are made; and
    (4) Components are broken out when required.
    (b) The program manager or other official responsible for the 
material program concerned is responsible for breakout selection, 
review, and decision.
    (c) The contracting officer or buyer and other specialists (e.g., 
small business specialist, engineering, production, logistics, and 
maintenance) support the program manager in implementing the breakout 
program.
D-104  Procedures.
    (a) A breakout review and decision includes--

[[Page 201]]

    (1) An assessment of the potential risks to the end item from 
possibilities such as delayed delivery and reduced reliability of the 
component;
    (2) A calculation of estimated net cost savings (i.e., estimated 
acquisition savings less any offsetting costs); and
    (3) An analysis of the technical, operational, logistics, and 
administrative factors involved.
    (b) The decision must be supported by adequate explanatory 
information, including an assessment by the end item contractor when 
feasible.
    (c) The following questions should be used in the decision process--
    (1) Is the end item contractor likely to do further design or 
engineering effort on the component?
    (2) Is a suitable data package available with rights to use it for 
Government acquisition? (Note that breakout may be warranted even though 
competitive acquisition is not possible.)
    (3) Can any quality control and reliability problems of the 
component be resolved without requiring effort by the end item 
contractor?
    (4) Will the component require further technical support (e.g., 
development of specifications, testing requirements, or quality 
assurance requirements)? If so, does the Government have the resources 
(manpower, technical competence, facilities, etc.) to provide such 
support? Or, can the support be obtained from the end item contractor 
(even though the component is broken out) or other source?
    (5) Will breakout impair logistics support (e.g., by jeopardizing 
standardization of components)?
    (6) Will breakout unduly fragment administration, management, or 
performance of the end item contract (e.g., by complicating production 
scheduling or preventing identification of responsibility for end item 
failure caused by a defective component)?
    (7) Can breakout be accomplished without jeopardizing delivery 
requirements of the end item?
    (8) If a decision is made to breakout a component, can advance 
acquisition funds be made available to provide the new source any 
necessary additional lead time?
    (9) Is there a source other than the present manufacturer capable of 
supplying the component?
    (10) Has the component been (or is it going to be) acquired directly 
by the Government as a support item in the supply system or as 
Government-furnished equipment in other end items?
    (11) Will the financial risks and other responsibilities assumed by 
the Government after breakout be acceptable?
    (12) Will breakout result in substantial net cost savings? Develop 
estimates of probable savings in cost considering all offsetting costs 
such as increases in the cost of requirements determination and control, 
contracting, contract administration, data package purchase, material 
inspection, qualification or preproduction testing, ground support and 
test equipment, transportation, security, storage, distribution, and 
technical support.
    (d) If answers to the questions reveal conditions unfavorable to 
breakout, the program manager should explore whether the unfavorable 
conditions can be eliminated. For example, where adequate technical 
support is not available from Government resources, consider contracting 
for the necessary services from the end item contractor or other 
qualified source.
D-105  Records.
    (a) The contracting activity shall maintain records on components 
reviewed for breakout. Records should evidence whether the components--
    (1) Have no potential for breakout;
    (2) Have been earmarked as potential breakout candidates;
    (3) Have been, or will be, broken out.
    (b) The program manager or other designated official must sign the 
records.
    (c) Records must reflect the facts and conditions of the case, 
including any assessment by the contractor, and the basis for the 
decision. The records must contain the assessments, calculations, and 
analyses discussed in D-104, including the trade-off analysis between 
savings and increased risk to the Government because of responsibility 
for Government-furnished equipment.

                             Part 1--General

E-100  Scope.
    This appendix established the DoD Spare Parts Breakout Program and 
provides uniform policies and procedures for management and conduct of 
the program within and between the departments and agencies.
E-101  Applicability.
    (a) This appendix applies to--
    (1) Any centrally managed replenishment or provisioned part 
(hereinafter referred to as ``part'') for military systems and 
equipment; and
    (2) All DoD personnel involved with design control, acquisition, and 
management of such parts including, but not limited to, project/program/
system managers, technical personnel, contracting officers, legal 
counsel, inventory managers, inspectors, and small business specialists 
and technical advisors.
    (b) This appendix does not apply to--
    (1) Component breakout (see Appendix D);
    (2) Foreign military sale peculiar items;
    (3) Insurance items (e.g., one-time buy);
    (4) Obsolete items;
    (5) Phase out items (e.g., life of type buy);
    (6) Items with annual buy values below the thresholds developed by 
DoD components or field activities;
    (7) Parts being acquired under other specifically defined initial 
support programs; or
    (8) Parts acquired through local purchase.
E-102  General.
    (a) Significant resources are dedicated to the acquisition and 
management of parts for military systems and equipment. The ability to 
competitively buy spares must be considered early in a weapon system 
acquisition. Initially, repairable or consumable parts are identified 
and acquired through a provisioning process; repairable or consumable 
parts acquired thereafter are for replenishment.

[[Page 203]]

    (b) The objective of the DoD Spare Parts Breakout Program is to 
reduce costs through the use of competitive procurement methods, or the 
purchase of parts directly from the actual manufacturer rather than the 
prime contractor, while maintaining the integrity of the systems and 
equipment in which the parts are to be used. The program is based on the 
application of sound management and engineering judgement in--
    (1) Determining the feasibility of acquiring parts by competitive 
procedures or direct purchase from actual manufacturers; and
    (2) Overcoming or removing constraints to breakout identified 
through the screening process (technical review) described in E-302.
    (c) This Appendix sets forth procedures to screen and code parts in 
order to provide contracting officers summary information regarding 
technical data and sources of supply to meet the Government's minimum 
requirements. This information assists the contracting officer in 
selecting the method of contracting, identifying sources of supply, and 
making other decisions in the preaward and award phases, with 
consideration for established parameters of system and equipment 
integrity, readiness, and the opportunities to competitively acquire 
parts (see FAR/DFARS Part 6). The identification of sources for parts, 
for example, requires knowledge of manufacturing sources, additional 
operations performed after manufacture of parts possessing safety or 
other critical characteristics, and the availability of technical data.
    (d) The result of the screening process (technical review is 
indicated by an acquisition method code (AMC) and an acquisition method 
suffix code (AMSC). This program provides procedures for both the 
initial assignment of an AMC and an AMSC to a part, and for the 
recurring review of these codes (see E-202 and E-203(b)(1)).
E-103  Definitions.
E-103.1  Acquisition method code (AMC).
    A single digit numeric code, assigned by a DoD activity, to describe 
to the contracting officer and other Government personnel the results of 
a technical review of a part and its suitability for breakout.
E-103.2  Acquisition method code conference.
    A conference which is generally held at the contractor's facility 
for the purpose of reviewing contractor technical information codes 
(CTICs) and corresponding substantiating data for breakout.
E-103.3  Acquisition method suffix code (AMSC).
    A single digit alpha code, assigned by a DoD activity, which 
provides the contracting officer and other Government personnel with 
engineering, manufacturing, and technical information.
E-103.4  Actual manufacturer.
    An individual, activity, or organization that performs the physical 
fabrication processes that produce the deliverable part or other items 
of supply for the Government. The actual manufacturer must produce the 
part in-house. The actual manufacturer may or may not be the design 
control activity.
E-103.5  Altered item drawing.
    See current version of DoD STD-100, paragraphs 201.4.4 and 703.

    The annual buy quantity of a part multiplied by its unit price.
E-103.8  Bailment.
    The process whereby a part is loaned to a recipient with the 
agreement that the part will be returned at an appointed time. The 
government retains legal title to such material even though the 
borrowing organization has possession during the stated period.
E-103.9  Breakout.
    The improvement of the acquisition status of a part resulting from a 
technical review and a deliberate management decision. Examples are--
    (a) The competitive acquisition of a part previously purchased 
noncompetitively; and
    (b) The direct purchase of a part previously purchased from a prime 
contractor who is not the actual manufacturer of the part.
E-103.10  Competition.
    A contract action where two or more responsible sources, acting 
independently, can be solicited to satisfy the Government's requirement.
E-103.11  Contractor technical information code (CTIC).
    A two digit alpha code assigned to a part by a prime contractor to 
furnish specific information regarding the engineering, manufacturing, 
and technical aspects of that part.

[[Page 204]]

E-103.12  Design control activity.
    A contractor or Government activity having responsibility for the 
design of a given part, and for the preparation and currency of 
engineering drawings and other technical data for that part. The design 
control activity may or may not be the actual manufacturer. The design 
control activity is synonymous with design activity as used by DoD STD-
100.
E-103.13  Direct purchase.
    The acquisition of a part from the actual manufacturer, including a 
prime contractor who is an actual manufacturer of the part.
E-103.14  Engineering drawings.

occur over a part's remaining life cycle.
E-103.20  Limited competition.
    A competitive contract action where the provisions of full and open 
competition do not exist.
E-103.21  Limited screening.
    A parts breakout process covering only selected points of data and 
technical evaluations, and should only be used to support immediate buy 
requirements (see E-301.3).

delivery of a system/equipment such as aircraft, engines, ships, tanks, 
vehicles, guns and missiles, ground communications and electronics 
systems, and test equipment.
E-103.24  Provisioning.
    The process of determining and acquiring the range and quantity 
(depth) of spare and repair parts, and support and test equipment 
required to operate and maintain an end item of materiel for an initial 
period of service.
E-103.25  Qualification.
    Any action (contractual or precontractual) that results in approval 
for a firm to supply items to the Government without further testing 
beyond quality assurance demonstrations incident to acceptance of an 
item. When prequalification is required, the Government must have a 
justification on file--
    (a) Stating the need for qualification and why it must be done prior 
to award;
    (b) Estimating likely cost of qualification; and
    (c) Specifying all qualification requirements.
E-103.26  Replenishment part.
    A part, repairable or consumable, purchased after provisioning of 
that part, for: replacement; replenishment of stock; or use in the 
maintenance, overhaul, and repair of equipment such as aircraft, 
engines, ships, tanks, vehicles, guns and missiles, ground 
communications and electronic systems, ground support, and test 
equipment. As used in this appendix, except when distinction is 
necessary, the term ``part'' includes subassemblies, components, and 
subsystems as defined by the current version of MIL-STD-280.
E-103.27  Reverse engineering.
    A process by which parts are examined and analyzed to determine how 
they were manufactured, for the purpose of developing a complete 
technical data package. The normal, expected result of reverse 
engineering is the creation of a technical data package suitable for 
manufacture of an item by new sources.

[[Page 205]]

E-103.28  Selected item drawing.
    See current version of DoD-STD-100, paragraph 201.4.5.
E-103.29  Source.
    Any commercial or noncommercial organization which can supply a 
specified part. For coding purposes, sources include actual 
manufacturers, prime contractors, vendors, dealers, surplus dealers, 
distributors, and other firms.
E-103.30  Source approval.
    The Government review that must be completed before contract award.
E-103.31  Source control drawing.
    See the current version of DoD-STD-100, paragraph 201.4.3.
E-103.32  Technical data.
    Specifications, plans, drawings, standards, purchase descriptions, 
and such other data to describe the Government's requirements for 
acquisition.
E-104  General policies.
    (a) The identification, selection, and screening of parts for 
breakout shall be made as early as possible to determine the technical 
and economic considerations of the opportunities for breakout to 
competition or direct purchase. Full and open competition is the 
preferred result of breakout screening.
    (b) A part shall be made a candidate for breakout screening based on 
its cost effectiveness for breakout. Resources should be assigned and 
priority given to those parts with the greatest expected return given 
their annual buy value, life cycle buy value, and likelihood of 
successful breakout, given technical characteristics such as design and 
performance stability. Consideration of all such factors is necessary to 
ensure the maximum return on investment in a given breakout program. 
Occasionally, an item will not meet strict economic considerations for 
breakout, but action may be required due to other considerations to 
avoid overpricing situations. Accordingly, there is no minimum DoD 
threshold for breakout screening actions. DoD components and field 
activities will develop annual buy thresholds for breakout screening 
which are consistent with economic considerations and resources. Every 
effort should be made to complete the full screening of parts that are 
expected to be subsequently replenished as they enter the inventory.
    (c) Breakout improvement efforts shall continue through the life 
cycle of a part to improve its breakout status (see E-203) or until such 
time as the part is coded 1G, 2G, 1K, 2K, 1M, 2M, 1N, 2N, 1T, 2T, 1Z, or 
2Z.
    (d) No firm shall be denied the opportunity to demonstrate its 
ability to furnish a part which meets the Government's needs, without 
regard to a part's annual buy value, where a restrictive AMC/AMSC is 
assigned (see FAR 9.202). A firm must clearly demonstrate, normally at 
its own expense, that it can satisfy the Government's requirements. The 
Government shall make a vigorous effort to expedite its evaluation of 
such demonstration and to furnish a decision to the demonstrating firm 
within a reasonable period of time. If a resolution cannot be made 
within 60 days, the offeror must be advised of the status of the request 
and be provided with a good faith estimate of the date the evaluation 
will be completed. Every reasonable effort shall be made to complete the 
review before a subsequent acquisition is made. Also, restrictive codes 
and low annual buy value do not preclude consideration of a surplus 
dealer or other nonmanufacturing source when the part offered was 
manufactured by an approved source (see FAR 10.010). A potential surplus 
dealer or other nonmanufacturing source must provide the Government with 
all the necessary evidence which proves the proposed part meets the 
Government's requirements.
    (e) The experience and knowledge accrued by contractors in the 
development, design, manufacture and test of equipment may enhance the 
breakout decision making process. DoD activities may obtain technical 
information from contractors when it is considered requisite to an 
informed coding decision. The procedure for contracting for this 
information is provided in Part 4 of this appendix. Contractor's 
technical information will be designated by CTICs. Only DoD activities 
shall assign AMCs and AMSCs.
    (f) DoD activities with breakout screening responsibilities shall 
develop, document, and advertise programs which promote the development 
of qualified sources for parts that are currently being purchased sole 
source. These programs should provide fair and reasonable technical 
assistance (engineering or other technical data, parts on bailment, 
etc.) to contractors who prove they have potential for becoming a 
qualified second source for an item. These programs should also provide 
specially tailored incentives to successful firms so as to stimulate 
their investment in becoming qualified, e.g., Government furnished 
equipment (GFE) or Government furnished material (GFM) for reverse 
engineering and technical data package review and assistance.
    (g) Departments and agencies shall identify the engineering support 
activity, design control activity, actual manufacturer, and prime 
contractor for each part such that the information is readily available 
to breakout and acquisition personnel.

[[Page 206]]

E-105  Responsibilities.
    (a) The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Production and Logistics) 
has authority for direction and management of the DoD Spare Parts 
Breakout Program, including the establishment and maintenance of 
implementing regulations.
    (b) Departments and agencies shall perform audits to ensure that 
their respective activities comply with the provisions of this program.
    (c) Commanders of DoD activities with breakout screening 
responsibility shall--
    (1) Implement a breakout program consistent with the requirements of 
this appendix.
    (2) Assist in the identification and acquisition of necessary data 
rights and technical data, and the review of restrictive legends on 
technical data, during system/equipment development and production to 
allow, when feasible, breakout of parts.
    (3) Designate a program manager to serve as the central focal point, 
communicate breakout policy, ensure cost effectiveness of screening 
actions and breakout program, provide assistance in implementing 
breakout screening, monitor ongoing breakout efforts and achievements, 
and provide surveillance over implementation of this appendix. The 
program manager shall report only to the Commander, or deputy, of the 
activity with breakout screening responsibility.
    (4) Ensure that actions to remove impediments to breakout are 
continued so long as it is cost effective, or until no further breakout 
improvements can be made.
    (5) Invite the activity's small business specialist and the resident 
small business administration's procurement center representative (PCR), 
if any, to participate in all acquisition method coding conferences at 
Government and contractor locations.
    (6) Ensure timely engineering and technical support to other 
breakout activities regardless of location.
    (i) In the case of parts where contracting or inventory management 
responsibility has been transferred, support shall include--
    (A) Assignment of an AMC/AMSC prior to the transfer;
    (B) Assignment of an AMC/AMSC when requested by the receiving 
activity to parts transferred without such codes. The requesting 
activity may recommend an AMC/AMSC; and
    (C) Full support of the receiving activities' breakout effort by 
providing timely engineering support in revising existing AMC/AMSCs.
    (ii) In all cases, support shall include, but not be limited to, 
furnishing all necessary technical data and other information (such as 
code suspense date and procurement history) to permit acquisition in 
accordance with the assigned AMC/AMSC (see E-105(d)(6)).
    (7) Ensure that appropriate surveillance is given to first time 
breakout parts.
    (d) Breakout program managers shall be responsible for--
    (1) Initiating the breakout process during the early phases of 
development and continue the process during the life of the part;
    (2) Considering the need for contractor technical information codes 
(CTICs) and, when needed, initiating a contract data requirement;
    (3) Identifying, selecting, and screening in accordance with Part 3 
of this appendix;
    (4) Assigning an AMC/AMSC, using all available data, including 
CTICs;
    (5) Responding promptly to a request for evaluation of additional 
sources or a review of assigned codes. An evaluation not completed prior 
to an immediate buy shall be promptly completed for future buys; and
    (6) Documenting all assignments and changes, to include rationale 
for assigning the chosen code, in a permanent file for each part. As a 
minimum, the file should identify the engineering support activity, 
cognizant design control activity, actual manufacturer, prime 
contractor, known sources of supply, and any other information needed to 
support AMC/AMSC assignments.
    (e) Contracting officers responsible for the acquisition of 
replenishment parts shall--
    (1) Consider the AMC/AMSC when developing the method of contracting, 
the list of sources to be solicited, the type of contract, etc.; and
    (2) Provide information which is inconsistent with the assigned AMC/
AMSC (e.g., availability of technical data or possible sources) to the 
activity responsible for code assignment with a request for timely 
evaluation of the additional information. An urgent immediate buy need 
not be delayed if an evaluation of the additional information cannot be 
completed in time to meet the required delivery date.

                         Part 2--Breakout Coding

E-200  Scope.
    This part provides parts breakout codes and prescribes 
responsibilities for their assignment and management.
E-201  Coding.
    Three types of codes are used in the breakout program.
E-201.1  Acquisition method codes.
    The following codes shall be assigned by DoD activities to describe 
the results of the spare parts breakout screening:
    (a) AMC 0. The part was not assigned AMC 1 through 5 when it entered 
the inventory, nor has it ever completed screening. Use of this code is 
sometimes necessary but discouraged. Maximum effort to determine the

[[Page 207]]

applicability of an alternate AMC is the objective. This code will never 
be used to recode a part that already has AMC 1 through 5 assigned, and 
shall never be assigned as a result of breakout screening. Maximum 
effort to determine the applicability of AMC 1 through 5 is the 
objective.
    (b) AMC 1. Suitable for competitive acquisition for the second or 
subsequent time.
    (c) AMC 2. Suitable for competitive acquisition for the first time.
    (d) AMC 3. Acquire, for the second or subsequent time, directly from 
the actual manufacturer.
    (e) AMC 4. Acquire, for the first time, directly from the actual 
manufacturer.
    (f) AMC 5. Acquire directly from a sole source contractor which is 
not the actual manufacturer.
E-201.2  Acquisition method suffix codes.
    The following codes shall be assigned by DoD activities to further 
describe the acquisition method code. Valid combinations of AMCs/AMSCs 
are indicated in paragraphs (a) through (z) of this subsection and 
summarized in Exhibit I.
    (a) AMSC A. The Government's right to use data in its possession is 
questionable. This code is only applicable to parts under immediate buy 
requirements and for as long thereafter as rights to data are still 
under review for resolution and appropriate coding. This code is 
assigned only at the conclusion of limited screening, and it remains 
assigned until the full screening process resolves the Government's 
rights to use data and results in assignment of a different AMSC. If one 
source is available, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources 
exist, or if the data is adequate for an alternate source to qualify in 
accordance with the design control activity's procedures, AMCs 1 or 2 
are valid.
    (b) AMSC B. This part must be acquired from a manufacturing 
source(s) specified on a source control or selected item drawing as 
defined by the current version of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, 
Government data rights, or manufacturing knowledge are not available to 
permit acquisition from other sources, nor qualification testing of 
another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended 
application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected 
items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review 
discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government 
possession and cannot be economically obtained. If one source is 
available, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources exist, 
AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (c) AMSC C. This part requires engineering source approval by the 
design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. 
Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing 
knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part 
from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, 
manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically 
available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to 
maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in 
accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by 
the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification 
procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity 
having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. If one 
source is approved, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources 
are approved or if data is adequate for an alternate source to qualify 
in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, AMCs 1 or 2 
are valid.
    (d) AMSC D. The data needed to acquire this part competitively is 
not physically available, it cannot be obtained economically, nor is it 
possible to draft adequate specifications or any other adequate, 
economical description of the material for a competitive solicitation. 
AMSC 3, 4, or 5 are valid.
    (e) AMSC E. (Reserved).
    (f) AMSC F. (Reserved).
    (g) AMSC G. The Government has rights to the technical data, the 
data package is complete, and there are no technical data, engineering, 
tooling or manufacturing restrictions. (This is the only AMSC that 
implies that parts are candidates for full and open competition. Other 
AMSCs such as K, M, N, Q, and S may imply limited competition when two 
or more independent sources exist yet the technical data package is 
inadequate for full and open competition.) AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (h) AMSC H. The Government physically does not have in its 
possession sufficient, accurate, or legible data to purchase this part 
from other than the current source(s). This code is applicable only to 
parts under immediate buy requirements and only for as long thereafter 
as the deficiency is under review for resolution and appropriate 
recoding. This code is only assigned at the conclusion of limited 
screening, and it remains assigned until the full screening process 
resolves physical data questions and results in assignment of a 
different AMSC. If one source is available, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. 
If at least two sources exist, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (i) AMSC I. (Not authorized.)
    (j) AMSC J. (Reserved.)
    (k) AMSC K. This part must be produced from class 1 castings and 
similar type forgings as approved (controlled) by procedures contained 
in the current version of MIL-STD-2175. If one source has such castings 
and cannot provide them to other sources, AMCs

[[Page 208]]

3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources have such castings or they 
can be provided to other sources AMCs 1 or 2 or valid.
    (l) AMSC L. The annual buy value of this part falls below the 
screening threshold established by DoD components and field activities. 
However, this part has been screened for additional known sources, 
resulting in either confirmation that the initial source exists or that 
other sources may supply the part. No additional screening was performed 
to identify the competitive or noncompetitive conditions that would 
result in assignment of a different AMSC. This code shall not be used 
when screening parts entering the inventory. This code shall be used 
only to replace AMSC O for parts under the established screening 
threshold. If one source is available, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at 
least two sources exist, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (m) AMSC M. Manufacture of this part requires use of master or 
coordinated tooling. If only one set of tooling exists and cannot be 
made available to another source for manufacture of this part, AMCs 3, 
4, or 5 are valid. When the availability of existent or refurbishable 
tooling is available to two or more sources, then AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (n) AMSC N. Manufacture of this part requires special test and/or 
inspection facilities to determine and maintain ultra-precision quality 
for its function or system integrity. Substantiation and inspection of 
the precision or quality cannot be accomplished without such specialized 
test or inspection facilities. If the test cannot be made available for 
the competitive manufacture of the part, the required test or inspection 
knowledge cannot be documented for reliable replication, or the required 
physical test or inspection facilities and processes cannot be 
economically documented in a TDP, valid AMCs are 3, 4, or 5. If the 
facilities or tests can be made available to two or more competitive 
sources, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (o) AMSC O. The part was not assigned an AMSC when it entered the 
inventory, nor has it ever completed screening. Use of this code in 
conjunction with AMC 0 is sometimes necessary but discouraged. Maximum 
effort to determine the applicability of an alternate AMSC is the 
objective. Only AMC O is valid.
    (p) AMSC P. The rights to use the data needed to purchase this part 
from additional source(s) are not owned by the Government and cannot be 
purchased, developed, or otherwise obtained. It is uneconomical to 
reverse engineer this part. This code is used in situations where the 
Government has the data but does not own the rights to the data. If only 
one source has the rights or data to manufacture this item, AMCs 3, 4, 
or 5 are valid. If two or more sources have the rights or data to 
manufacture this item, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (q) AMSC Q. The Government does not have adequate data, lacks rights 
to data, or both needed to purchase this part from additional sources. 
The Government has been unable to economically buy the data or rights to 
the data, although the part has been undergoing full screening for 12 or 
more months. Breakout to competition has not been achieved, but current, 
continuing actions to obtain necessary rights to data or adequate, 
reprocurement technical data indicate breakout to competition is 
expected to be achieved. This part may be a candidate for reverse 
engineering or other techniques to obtain technical data. All AMSC Q 
items are required to be reviewed within the timeframes cited in E-
203(b). If one source is available, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at 
least two sources exist, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (r) AMSC R. The Government does not own the data or the rights to 
the data needed to purchase this part from additional sources. It has 
been determined to be uneconomical to buy the data or rights to the 
data. It is uneconomical to reverse engineer the part. This code is used 
when the Government did not initially purchase the data and/or rights. 
If only one source has the rights or data to manufacture this item, AMCs 
3, 4, or 5 are valid. If two or more sources have the rights or data to 
manufacture this item, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (s) AMSC S. Acquisition of this item is restricted to Government 
approved source(s) because the production of this item involves 
unclassified but militarily sensitive technology (see FAR 6.3). If one 
source is approved, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources 
are approved, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (t) AMSC T. Acquisition of this part is controlled by qualified 
products list (QPL) procedures. Competition for this part is limited to 
sources which are listed on or are qualified for listing on the QPL at 
the time of award (see FAR Part 9 and DFARS Part 209). AMCs 1 or 2 are 
valid.
    (u) AMSC U. The cost to the Government to breakout this part and 
acquire it competitively has been determined to exceed the projected 
savings over the life span of the part. If one source is available, AMCs 
3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources exist, AMCs 1 or 2 are 
valid.
    (v) AMSC V. This part has been designated a high reliability part 
under a formal reliability program. Probability of failure would be 
unacceptable from the standpoint of safety of personnel and/or 
equipment. The cognizant engineering activity has determined that data 
to define and control reliability limits cannot be obtained nor is it 
possible to draft adequate specifications for this purpose. If one 
source is available, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources 
are available, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (w) AMSC W. (Reserved.)

[[Page 209]]

    (x) AMSC X. (Not authorized.)
    (y) AMSC Y. The design of this part is unstable. Engineering, 
manufacturing, or performance characteristics indicate that the required 
design objectives have not been achieved. Major changes are contemplated 
because the part has a low process yield or has demonstrated marginal 
performance during tests or service use. These changes will render the 
present part obsolete and unusable in its present configuration. Limited 
acquisition from the present source is anticipated pending configuration 
changes. If one source is available, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at 
least two sources exist, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (z) AMSC Z. This part is a commercial/nondevelopmental/off-the-shelf 
item. Commercial item descriptions, commercial vendor catalog or price 
lists or commercial manuals assigned a technical manual number apply. If 
one source is available, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two 
sources are available, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
E-201.3  Contractor technical information codes.
    The following two digit alpha codes shall be used by contractors, 
when contractor's assistance is requested. These codes are assigned in 
accordance with the current version of MIL-STD-789 and shall be 
considered during the initial assignment of an AMC/AMSC. For spare parts 
breakout, requirements for contractor assistance through CTIC submission 
shall be accomplished as stated in Part 4 of this appendix. Each CTIC 
submitted by a contractor must be accompanied by supporting 
documentation which justifies the proposed code. These codes and 
supporting documentation, transmitted by DD Form 1418, Contractor 
Technical Information Record, and DD Form 1418-1, Technical Data 
Identification Checklist, are useful not only for code assignment during 
acquisition coding conferences, but also for personnel conducting both 
full and limited screening of breakout candidates. Personnel conducting 
full and limited screening of breakout candidates should use the 
supporting documentation provided with CTICs as a source of information. 
However, they should not allow this information to substitute for 
careful analysis and further investigation of the possibilities of 
acquiring a part through competition or by direct purchase. The 
definitions for CTICs are--
    (a) CTIC CB. Source(s) are specified on source control, altered 
item, or selected item drawings/documents. (The contractor shall furnish 
a list of the sources with this code.)
    (b) CTIC CC. Requires engineering source approval by the design 
control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. An 
alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control 
activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government 
engineering activity.
    (c) CTIC CG. There are no technical restrictions to competition.
    (d) CTIC CK. Produced from class 1 castings (see the current version 
of MIL-STD-2175) and similar type forgings. The process of developing 
and proving the acceptability of high-integrity castings and forgings 
requires repetitive performance by a controlled source. Each casting or 
forging must be produced along identical lines to those which resulted 
in initial acceptability of the part. (The contractor shall furnish a 
list of known sources for obtaining castings/forgings with this code.)
    (e) CTIC CM. Master or coordinated tooling is required to produce 
this part. This tooling is not owned by the Government or, where owned, 
cannot be made available to other sources. (The contractor shall furnish 
a list of the firms possessing the master or coordinated tooling with 
this code.)
    (f) CTIC CN. Requires special test and/or inspection facilities to 
determine and maintain ultra-precision quality for function or system 
integrity. Substantiation and inspection of the precision or quality 
cannot be accomplished without such specialized test or inspection 
facilities. Other sources in industry do not possess, nor would it be 
economically feasible for them to acquire facilities. (The contractor 
shall furnish a list of the required facilities and their locations with 
this code.)
    (g) CTIC CP. The rights to use the data needed to purchase this part 
from additional sources are not owned by the Government and cannot be 
purchased.
    (h) CTIC CV. A high reliability part under a formal reliability 
program. Probability of failure would be unacceptable from the 
standpoint of safety of personnel and/or equipment. The cognizant 
engineering activity has determined that data to define and control 
reliability limits cannot be obtained nor is it possible to draft 
adequate specifications for this purpose. Continued control by the 
existing source is necessary to ensure acceptable reliability. (The 
contractor shall identify the existing source with this code.)
    (i) CTIC CY. The design of this part is unstable. Engineering, 
manufacturing, or performance characteristics indicate that the required 
design objectives have not been achieved. Major changes are contemplated 
because the part has a low process yield or has demonstrated marginal 
performance during tests or service use. These changes will render the 
present part obsolete and unusable in its present configuration. Limited 
acquisition from the present source is anticipated pending configuration 
changes. (The contractor shall identify the existing source with this 
code.)

E-202  Assignment of codes.
    The purpose of AMC/AMSC assignments is to provide the best possible 
technical assessment of how a part can be acquired. The technical 
assessment should not be based on issues such as: are the known sources 
actual manufacturers, or are there two actual manufacturers in 
existence; but rather on factors such as the availability of adequate 
technical data, the Government's rights to use the data, technical 
restrictions placed on the hardware (criticality, reliability, special 
testing, master tooling, source approval, etc.) and the cost to breakout 
vice projected savings. In cases where there is additional technical 
information which affects the way a part can be acquired, it should be 
made available to the contracting officer, with the AMC/AMSC. Concerning 
the assignment of AMCs and AMSCs, it is DoD policy that--
    (a) The assignment of AMC/AMSCs to parts is the responsibility of 
the DoD component introducing the equipment or system for which the 
parts are needed in the inventory. Subsequent screening is the 
responsibility of the DoD component assigned technical responsibility.
    (b) When two or more AMSCs apply, the most technically restrictive 
code will be assigned.
    (c) Restricted combinations of AMC/AMSCs are reflected in the AMSC 
definitions. The Defense Logistics Service Center will reject invalid 
code combinations, as shown in Exhibit I, submitted for entry into the 
Federal catalog program (see E-204.2).
    (d) One-time acquisition of a part by a method other than indicated 
by the code does not require a change to the AMC (e.g., when only one of 
a number of sources can meet a short delivery date, or when only one 
manufacturing source is known but acceptable surplus parts are available 
from other sources).
    (e) After the first acquisition under AMC 2 or 4, the AMC shall be 
recoded 1 or 3 respectively.
    (f) Both full and limited screening will result in the assignment or 
reassignment of an AMC/AMSC. This assignment shall be based on the best 
technical judgment of breakout personnel and on information gathered 
during the screening process.
    (g) A part need not be coded as noncompetitive based on an initial 
market survey which only uncovers one interested source. If the 
Government has sufficient technical data in its possession to enable 
other sources to manufacture an acceptable part, and there are no 
technical restrictions on the part which would preclude other sources 
from manufacturing it, the part should be coded competitive.
E-203  Improving part status.
    (a) General. An effective breakout program requires that all 
reasonable actions be taken to improve the acquisition status of parts. 
The potential for improvement of the acquisition status will vary with 
individual circumstances. On one end of the spectrum are those parts 
with acquisition method suffix codes of a temporary nature requiring 
vigorous follow-through improvement action (e.g., AMSCs A and H); on the 
other end are those parts with codes suggesting a relative degree of 
permanence (e.g., AMSCP). A code assigned to a part should never be 
considered fixed with respect to either technical circumstance or time; 
today's technical constraint may be overcome by tomorrow's technology 
and a contractor's rights to data, so zealously protected today, often 
become less important with time. The application of breakout improvement 
effort must always consider individual circumstances and overall 
benefits expected to be obtained.
    (b) Code suspense dates. Every part whose breakout status can be 
improved shall be suspensed for rescreening as appropriate. In general, 
the following codes cannot be improved: 1G, 2G, 1K, 2K, 1M, 2M, 1N, 2N, 
1T, 2T, 1Z, or 2Z. The period between suspenses is a period for which an 
assigned AMC/AMSC is considered active, and routine rescreening of parts 
with ``valid'' codes is not required. Suspense dates may vary with the 
circumstance surrounding each part. A code reached as a result of 
limited screening (E-304) shall not be assigned a suspense date 
exceeding 12 months; a code reached as a result of full screening (E-
303) shall not be assigned a suspense date exceeding three years. In 
exceptional cases, where circumstances indicate that no change can be 
expected in a code over an extended period, a suspense date not 
exceeding five years may be assigned in accordance with controls 
established by the breakout activity. Items with a 1G or 2G code do not 
require a suspense date.
E-204  Communication of codes.
E-204.1  Communication media.
    Use the Federal catalog program formats, set forth in DoD Manual 
4100.39-M, Defense Integrated Data System (DIDS) Procedural Manual, 
communication media and operating instructions as augmented by this 
appendix to disseminate AMCs and AMSCs.
E-204.2  Responsibilities.
    (a) The Defense Logistics Service Center (DLSC) shall--
    (1) Receive and disseminate AMCs and AMSCs for each national stock 
number (NSN) to all appropriate Government activities in consonance with 
scheduled Federal catalog program computer cycles;

[[Page 211]]

    (2) Make the AMCs and AMSCs a part of the data bank of NSN item 
intelligence;
    (3) Perpetuate the codes in all subsequent Federal catalog program 
transactions; e.g., entry of new NSNs and Federal supply code (FSC) 
changes; and
    (4) Reject invalid code combinations submitted for entry into the 
Federal catalog program.
    (b) DoD activities responsible for the assignment of AMCs and AMSCs 
shall--
    (1) Transmit assigned codes for each NSN through normal cataloging 
channels to DLSC under existing Federal catalog program procedures; and
    (2) Notify DLSC by normal Federal catalog program maintenance 
procedures when a change in coding is made.

        Part 3--Identification, selection, and screening of parts

E-300  General.
    This part sets forth procedures for the identification, selection, 
and screening of parts.
E-301  Identification and selection procedures.
E-301.1  Parts entering the inventory.
    The breakout process should begin at the earliest possible stage of 
weapon systems acquisition. Generally, a provisioned part will require 
subsequent replenishment. Provisioning or similar lists of new parts 
are, therefore, the appropriate bases for selecting parts for screening. 
This is not to imply that breakout must be done on all items as part of 
the provisioning process. Priorities shall be applied to those parts 
offering the greatest opportunity for breakout and potential savings. 
The major factors in making this determination are--
    (a) The unit price;
    (b) The projected quantity to be purchased over the part's life 
cycle; and
    (c) The potential for screening to result in a part being 
successfully broken out, e.g., item stability, cost, and completeness of 
technical data, etc.
E-301.2  Annual buy forecasts.
    Annually, lists shall be prepared that identify all parts projected 
for purchase during the subsequent 12-month period. Priority should be 
given to those parts with the greatest expected return given their 
annual buy value, life cycle buy value, and likelihood of successful 
breakout, given technical characteristics such as design and performance 
stability and the availability of technical data. Parts with an expired 
suspense date or a suspense date which will expire during the forecast 
period (see E-203(b)), need only be subjected to the necessary steps of 
the full screening procedure (see E-303). Parts with a valid code that 
will not expire during the forecast period need not be screened. Parts 
coded 0O shall be selected for full screening.
E-301.3  Immediate buy requirements.
    An immediate buy requirement will be identified by the user or the 
item manager in consonance with department/agency regulations. When an 
immediate buy requirement meeting the screening criteria (see E-104(b)) 
is generated for a part not assigned a current AMC/AMSC, the part shall 
be promptly screened in accordance with either the full or limited 
screening procedures (see E-303 and E-304).
E-301.4  Suspect AMC/AMSC.
    Whenever an AMC/AMSC is suspected of being inaccurate by anyone, 
including the contracting officer, a rescreening shall be conducted for 
that part. Suspect codes include codes composed of invalid combinations 
of AMCs and AMSCs, those which do not truly reflect how a part is 
actually being acquired, and those suspected of being more restrictive 
than necessary for the next buy.
E-302  Screening.
    (a) Screening procedures include consideration and recording of the 
relevant facts pertaining to breakout decisions. The objective of 
screening is to improve the acquisition status by determining the 
potential for competition, or purchase from an actual manufacturer. 
Consideration of any reasonable approach to establishing competition 
should be an integral part of the breakout process.
    (b) Screening procedures may vary depending on circumstances related 
to the parts. No set rules will provide complete guidance for making 
acquisition method decisions under all conditions encountered in actual 
practice. An informed coding decision can be made without following the 
procedures step by step in every case.
    (c) Activities involved in screening are encouraged to develop 
supplemental procedures which prove effective in meeting this 
regulation's objectives. These procedures should be tailored to the 
particular activity's operating environment and the characteristics of 
the parts for which it is responsible. Nevertheless, care should be 
taken in all cases to assure that--
    (1) Responsible judgment is applied to all elements involved in the 
review of a part;
    (2) The necessary supporting facts are produced, considered, and 
recorded in the breakout screening file. The breakout screening file 
contains technical data and other documents concerning screening of the 
part;

[[Page 212]]

    (3) All cost effective alternatives are considered for establishing 
competition, or purchase from an actual manufacturer (see E-105(d)(6)); 
and
    (4) When possible, the sequence of the review allows for 
accomplishing several screening steps concurrently.
    (d) Contractor participation in the decision making process extends 
only to providing technical information. This technical information is 
provided by supporting documentation (DD Forms 1418, Contractor 
Technical Information Record, and DD Form 1418-1, Technical Data 
Identification Checklist) which includes the CTIC assignment. Government 
personnel shall substantiate the breakout decision by reference to the 
CTIC and by careful review of the supporting documentation. However, the 
CTIC provides guidance only, and it should be used as one of the inputs 
to arrive at an acceptable AMC and AMSC coding.
    (e) Contractor's technical information furnished in accordance with 
MIL-STD-789 may indicate areas requiring additional research by the 
Government before screening can be completed. Seldom will industry's 
contribution to the screening process enable the Government to assign an 
AMC or AMSC without additional review.
    (f) During the screening process, it may be appropriate to 
communicate with industry, particularly potential manufacturers of a 
part, to determine the feasibility of establishing a competitive source 
and to estimate the costs and technical risks involved.
    (g) Coding conferences with industry shall be documented.
    (h) Screening may disclose a part is not suitable for competitive 
acquisition, but it may be possible to breakout the part for direct 
purchase from the actual manufacturer or to establish a second source. 
Parts particularly suited to direct purchase are those where neither the 
design control activity nor the prime contractor contribute additional 
value or whose data belong to the actual manufacturer and will not be 
acquired by the Government, and where that manufacturer exercises total 
responsibility for the part (design and quality control, testing, etc.), 
and where additional operations performed by the prime contractor can be 
performed by the actual manufacturer or by the Government.
    (i) For each part that is screened, a file shall be established to 
document and justify the decisions and results of all screening effort 
(see E-105(d)(6)).
    (j) Full and limited screening procedures are two elements of 
breakout programs. Other spare parts initiatives to enhance breakout are 
reverse engineering, bailment, data rights challenges, and publication 
of intended buy lists. Integration of other initiatives within the 
screening processes developed at each activity is encouraged.
E-303  Full screening procedures.
    (a) Full screening procedures should be developed so that the 
potential is fully evaluated for establishing competition or purchase 
from an actual manufacturer. Also, full screening procedures should 
facilitate accurate and consistent acquisition method code assignment. 
It is expected that each activity will develop its own operational 
screening procedures. A general model, full screening decision process 
is provided below to support the development of activity level 
procedures and to provide guidance regarding the general scope of these 
procedures. The full screening procedures involve 65 steps in the 
decision process, and are divided into the following phases--
    (1) Data collection;
    (2) Data evaluation;
    (3) Data completion;
    (4) Technical evaluation;
    (5) Economic evaluation; and
    (6) Supply feedback.
    (b) The six phases describe different functions that must be 
achieved during screening. The nature of the screening process does not 
permit clear distinction of one phase from another. Further, the order 
of performance of these phases may not correspond to the order listed 
here. In fact, the phases will often overlap and may be performed 
simultaneously. Their purpose is to identify the different functions 
comprising the screening process.
    (c) A summary flow chart of the decision steps is provided as 
Exhibit II to assist in understanding the logical order of the full 
screening steps for various conditions. Use of the flow chart in 
connection with the text that follows is essential to fully understand 
the order of the steps in the process.
E-303.1  Data collection phase (step 1).
    (a) Assemble all available data and establish a file for each part. 
Collect identification data, relevant data obtained from industry, 
contracting and technical history data and current status of the part, 
including--
    (1) Normal identification required for cataloging and 
standardization review;
    (2) All known sources;
    (3) Historical contracting information, including the more recent 
awards, date of awards, and unit price(s) for the quantities prescribed;
    (4) Identification of the actual manufacturer(s), the latest unit 
price and the quantity on which the price is based. (When the actual 
manufacturer is not the design control activity, the design control 
activity may be consulted to ensure the latest version of the item is 
being procured from the actual manufacturer);
    (5) Identification of the activity, Government or industry, having 
design control over

[[Page 213]]

the part and, if industry, the cognizant Government engineering 
activity;
    (6) The expected life in the military supply system;
    (7) Record of any prior review for breakout, with results or 
findings; and
    (8) Annual demand.
    (b) In the case of complex items requiring large numbers of 
drawings, collection of a reasonable technical data sample is sufficient 
for the initial technical data evaluation phase (steps 2-14).
E-303.2  Data evaluation phase (steps 2-14).
    (a) Data evaluation is crucial to the whole review procedure. It 
involves determination of the adequacy of the technical data package and 
the Government's rights to use the data for acquisition purposes.
    (b) The data evaluation process may be divided into two stages--
    (1) A brief but intensive analysis of available data and documents 
regarding both technical matters and data rights, leading to a decision 
whether to proceed with screening; and
    (2) If the decision is to proceed with screening, further work is 
necessary to produce an adequate technical data package, such as 
research of contract provisions, engineering work on data and drawings, 
and requests to contractors for additional data.
    (c) The steps in this phase are--(1) Step 2. Are full Government 
rights established by the available data package? Evidence for an 
affirmative answer would include the identification of Government 
drawings, incorporation by reference of Government specifications or 
process descriptions in the public domain, or reference to contract 
provisions giving the Government rights to data. If the answer is 
negative, proceed to step 3; if positive, proceed to step 6.
    (2) Step 3. Are the contractor's limitations of the Government's 
rights to data established by the available data package?
    (i) The questions in step 2 and 3 are not exclusive. The 
incorporation in a drawing of contract provisions reserving rights to 
the manufacturer, either in the whole design or in certain manufacturing 
processes, would establish a clear affirmative answer to step 3 where 
there is substantiating Government documentation. Parts not in this 
group shall be retained for further processing (see step 20). Data 
rights that cannot be substantiated shall be challenged (see DFARS Part 
227, validation procedures).
    (ii) In the case of clear contractor ownership of rights, proceed 
with steps 4 and 5.
    (3) Step 4. Are there bases for competitive acquisition without 
using data subject to limitations on use? This question requires 
consideration, for example, of the possibility of using performance 
specifications or substitution of military or commercial specifications 
or bulletins for limited elements of the manufacturing process. The use 
of sample copies is another possibility.
    (4) Step 5. Can the Government buy the necessary rights to data? 
This is a preliminary question to the full analysis (in steps 20 and 21 
below) and is designed primarily to eliminate from further consideration 
those items which incorporate established data restrictions and for 
which there are no other bases for competitive acquisition nor is 
purchase of rights possible or feasible.
    (5) Steps 6 and 7. Is the present technical data package adequate 
for competitive acquisition of a reliable part?
    (6) Steps 8 and 9. Specify omissions. The question in steps 6 and 7 
requires a critical engineering evaluation and should deal first with 
the physical completeness of the date--are any essential dimensions, 
tolerances, processes, finishes, material specifications, or other vital 
elements of data lacking from the package? If so, these omissions should 
be specified. A second element deals with adequacy of the existing 
package to produce a part of the required performance, compatibility, 
quality, and reliability. This will, of course, be related to the 
completeness of data. In some cases, qualified engineering judgment may 
decide that in spite of apparently complete data, the high performance 
or other critical characteristics of the item require retention of the 
present source. If such decision is made, the file shall include 
documentation in the form of specific information, such as difficulties 
experienced by the present manufacturer in producing a satisfactory item 
or the existence of unique production skills in the present source.
    (7) Steps 10 and 11. Can the data be developed to make up a reliable 
technical data package? This implies a survey of the specified omissions 
with careful consideration to determine the resources available to 
supply each missing element. Such resources will vary from simple 
referencing of standard engineering publications to more complex 
development of drawings with the alternatives of either obtaining such 
drawings or developing performance specifications. In some cases, 
certain elements of data are missing because they have been properly 
restricted. If, however, there has been no advance substantiation of the 
right to restrict, the part should be further researched. If the answer 
to this question is negative, proceed to step 12; if positive, proceed 
to step 13 or 14.
    (8) Step 12. If the answer to the question in steps 10 and 11 is no, 
which condition is the prime element in this decision, the lack of data 
or the unreliability of the data? Specific documentation is needed to 
support this decision.
    (9) Steps 13 and 14. Estimate the time required to complete the data 
package. In those cases where the data package is found

[[Page 214]]

inadequate and specific additions need to be developed, an estimate of 
the time required for completion must be made in order to determine if 
breakout of the part is feasible during this review cycle and to 
estimate at what point in the remaining life of the part the data 
package could be available.
E-303.3  Data completion phase (steps 15-21).
    (a) The data completion phase involves acquiring or developing the 
missing elements of information to reach a determination on both 
adequacy of the technical data package and the restriction of rights to 
data. It may involve various functional responsibilities, such as 
examination of past contracts, queries directed to industry or to other 
Government agencies, inspection of the part, reverse or other 
engineering work to develop drawings and write specifications, 
arrangements with the present source for licensing or technical 
assistance to new manufacturers, and negotiations for purchase of rights 
to data. Additional research and information requests should be 
expeditiously initiated on those parts where there is a reasonable 
expectation of breakout. Because this phase is time-consuming, it should 
take place concurrently with other phases of the review.
    (b) At the beginning of the data completion phase, the part falls 
into one of the following four steps--
    (1) Step 15. The data package is complete and adequate and the 
Government has sufficient rights for acquisition purposes. Such parts 
require no further data analysis. Proceed to step 22.
    (2) Step 16. The Government has rights to existing data. The data 
package is incomplete but there is a reasonable expectation that the 
missing elements can be supplied. Proceed to step 19.
    (3) Step 17. The data package is complete, but suitable Government 
rights to the data have not been established. Proceed to step 20.
    (4) Step 18. Neither rights nor completeness of data is adequately 
established; therefore, the part requires further research. Proceed to 
step 20.
    (c) Step 19. Obtain or develop the necessary data for a suitable 
data package. Reverse engineering to develop acquisition data may be 
used if there is a clear indication that the costs of reverse 
engineering will be less than the savings anticipated from competitive 
acquisition. If there is a choice between reverse engineering and the 
purchase of data (step 21), the decision shall be made on the basis of 
relative costs, quality, time, and other pertinent factors.
    (d) Step 20. Establish the Government's and contractor's rights to 
the data. Where drawings and data cannot be identified to a contract, 
the following guidelines should be applied--
    (1) Where drawings and data bear legends which warn of copyright or 
patent rights, the effect of such legends shall be resolved according to 
law and policy; however, the existence of patent or copyright 
restrictions does not per se preclude securing competition with respect 
to the parts described (see FAR Subpart 27.3/DFARS Subpart 227.3).
    (2) If the technical data bears legends which limit the Government's 
right to use the data for breakout and it is determined that reasonable 
grounds exist to question the current validity of the restrictive 
markings, the contracting officer will be notified to initiate the 
validation procedures at DFARS Subpart 227.4.
    (3) Where drawings and data are unmarked and, therefore, free of 
limitation on their use, they shall be considered available for use in 
acquisition, unless the acquiring office has clear evidence to the 
contrary (see DFARS Subpart 227.4).
    (4) The decision process in situations described in paragraphs (d) 
(1), (2), and (3) of this subsection requires the exercise of sound 
discretion and judgment and embraces legal considerations. In no case 
shall a decision be made without review and approval of that decision by 
legal counsel.
    (5) If the validation procedures in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
subsection establish the Government's right to use the data for 
breakout, the Government shall attempt to obtain competition pursuant to 
the decisions resulting from concurrent technical and economic 
evaluation.
    (e) Step 21. If restrictions on the use of data are established, 
determine whether the Government can buy rights to the required data. 
Use the procedure in DFARS Subpart 227.4.
E-303.4  Technical evaluation phase (steps 22-37).
    (a) Introduction. (1) The purposes of technical evaluation are to 
determine the development status, design stability, high performance, 
and/or critical characteristics such as safety of personnel and 
equipment; the reliability and effective operation of the system and 
equipment in which the parts are to be used; and to exercise technical 
judgment as to the feasibility of breaking out the parts. No simple and 
universal rules apply to each determination. The application of 
experience and responsible judgment is required. Technical 
considerations arise in several elements of the decision process, e.g., 
in determining adequacy of the data package (steps 6-14).
    (2) Certain manufacturing conditions may reduce the field of 
potential sources. However, these conditions do not justify the 
restriction of competition by the assignment

[[Page 215]]

of restrictive AMCs for the following reasons--
    (i) Parts produced from class 1 castings and similar type forgings. 
The process of developing and providing the acceptability of high-
integrity castings and forgings requires repetitive performance by a 
controlled source for each casting or forging along identical lines to 
those which result in initial acceptability of the item. The particular 
manufacturer's process becomes the controlling factor with regard to the 
acceptability of any such item. However, other firms can produce class 1 
castings and similar type forgings and provide the necessary inspection, 
or the part may be acquired from other sources which use castings or 
forgings from approved (controlled) source(s).
    (ii) Parts produced from master or coordinated tooling, e.g., 
numerically controlled tapes. Such parts have features (contoured 
surfaces, hole locations, etc.) delineated according to unique master 
tooling or tapes and are manufactured to minimum/maximum limits and must 
be replaceable without additional tailoring or fitting. These parts 
cannot be manufactured or configured by a secondary pattern or jigs 
independent of the master tooling and cannot be manufactured to 
requisite tolerances of fit by use of commercial precision machinery. In 
this context, jigs and fixtures used only for ease of production are not 
considered master tooling. However, master tooling may be reproduced.
    (iii) Parts requiring special test and/or inspection facilities to 
determine and maintain ultra-precision quality for the function or 
system integrity. Substantiation and inspection of the precision or 
quality cannot be accomplished without specialized test or inspection 
facilities. Testing is often done by the actual manufacturer under 
actual operating use. However, such special test inspection facilities 
may be available at other firms.
    (b) Design procedures (steps 22-31). (1) Step 22. Will a design 
change occur during anticipated lead time? If affirmative, proceed to 
step 23; if negative, proceed to step 24.
    (2) Step 23. Specify the design change and assign an appropriate 
code.
    (3) Step 24. Is a satisfactory part now being produced? Concurrently 
with the research and completion of data, a technical determination is 
required as to the developmental status of the part. With the frequent 
telescoping of the development/production cycle as well as constant 
product improvement throughout the active life of equipment, parts are 
frequently subject to design changes. The present source, if a prime 
contractor, is usually committed to incorporate the latest changes in 
any deliveries under a production order. In considering the part for 
breakout, an assessment must be made of the stability of design, so that 
in buying from a new source the Government will not be purchasing an 
obsolete or incompatible part. The question of obsolescence or 
noncompatibility is to some extent under Government control. Screening 
for breakout on parts that are anticipated to undergo design change 
should be deferred until design stability is attained.
    (4) Step 25. Can a satisfactory part be produced by a new source? 
Determine whether technical reasons prohibit seeking a new source. The 
fact that the present source has not yet been able to produce a 
satisfactory part (step 24) does not preclude another source from being 
successful. If the answer to step 24 or 25 is affirmative, proceed 
simultaneously to steps 27 and 38. If the answer to step 25 is negative, 
proceed to step 26.
    (5) Step 26. If the present source is producing an unsatisfactory 
part, but technical reasons prohibit seeking a new source, specify the 
reasons.
    (6) Step 27. Does the part require prior qualification or other 
approval testing? If the answer is positive, proceed to step 28; if 
negative, proceed to step 32.
    (8) Step 28. Specify the requirement.
    (9) Step 29. Estimate the time required to qualify a new source.
    (10) Step 30. Is there currently a qualified source?
    (11) Step 31. Who is responsible for qualifications of the 
subcontractor, present prime contractor, the Government, or an 
independent testing agency?
    (i) If a qualified source is currently in existence, the review 
should consider who will be responsible for qualification in the event 
of competitive acquisition. If qualification testing is such that it can 
be performed by the selected source under a preproduction or first 
article clause in the contract, the costs of initial approval should be 
reflected in the offers received. If the part requires initial 
qualification tests by some other agency such as the present prime 
contractor, the Government, an independent testing agent outside the 
Government, or by technical facilities within the departments, out-of-
pocket costs may be incurred if the part is competed. An estimate of 
qualification costs should then be made and recorded in such cases.
    (ii) Where facilities within the Government are not adequate for 
testing or qualification, or outside agencies such as the equipment 
contractor cannot or will not do the job, the economics of qualification 
may be unreasonable, and a narrative statement of these facts should 
replace the cost estimate. Whenever possible, such as in the case of 
engine qualification tests, economy of combined qualification tests 
should be considered.
    (c) Quality assurance procedures (steps 32-33). Quality control and 
inspection is a primary consideration when making a decision to 
breakout. Where the prime contractor performs quality assurance 
functions beyond

[[Page 216]]

those of the part manufacturer or other sources, the Government may--
    (1) Develop the same quality control and inspection capability in 
the manufacturer's plant;
    (2) Assume the responsibility for quality; or
    (3) Undertake to obtain the quality assurance services from another 
source, possibly the prime contractor.
    (4) Step 32. Who is now responsible for quality control and 
inspection of the part?
    (5) Step 33. Can a new source be assigned responsibility for quality 
control? Is the level of the quality assurance requirements specified in 
the system contract necessary for the screened part? The minimum quality 
assurance procedures for each part shall be confirmed.
    (i) A new source shall be considered if--
    (A) Any essential responsibility (e.g., burn-in, reliability, 
maintainability) retained by the prime contractor for the part and its 
relationship to the end item can be eliminated, shifted to the new 
source, or assumed by the Government;
    (B) The prime contractor will provide the needed quality assurance 
services;
    (C) The Government can obtain competent, impartial services to 
perform quality assurance responsibility; or
    (D) The new source can maintain an adequate quality assurance 
program, inspection system, or inspection appropriate for the part.
    (ii) If the prime contractor has responsibility for quality that a 
new source cannot assume or obtain, or that the Government cannot 
undertake or eliminate, consideration of the new source is precluded.
    (d) Tooling procedures (steps 34-37). (1) Step 34. Is tooling or 
other special equipment required?
    (2) Step 35. Specify the type of tooling.
    (3) Step 36. Estimate additional acquisition leadtime for setup and 
for tooling.
    (4) Step 37. Does the Government possess this tooling? If tooling or 
special equipment is required for production of the part, the types and 
quantities should be specified. Investigation can then be made as to 
whether the Government possesses such tooling and can make it available 
to a new source. A requirement for special tooling is not necessarily a 
deterrent to competitive solicitation for parts. The Government may find 
it desirable to purchase the needed tooling and furnish it to the new 
source. In this case, the costs can be determined with reasonable 
accuracy. However, if new sources can provide the tooling or special 
equipment, this will be reflected in competitive prices and should not 
normally require further analysis.
E-303.5  Economic evaluation phase (steps 38-56).
    (a) Economic evaluation concerns identification and estimation of 
breakout savings and direct cost offsets to breakout. The economic 
evaluation phase is composed of the three segments detailed in 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this subsection.
    (b) Development of savings data (steps 38-40). (1) Step 38. Estimate 
remaining program life cycle buy value.
    (2) Step 39. Apply either a savings factor of 25 percent or one 
determined under local conditions and experience.
    (3) Step 40. Multiply the remaining program life cycle buy value by 
the savings factor to obtain the expected future savings, if the part is 
coded for breakout.
    (c) Computation of breakout costs (steps 41-47). Several groups of 
costs must be collected, summarized and compared to estimated savings to 
properly determine the economics of breakout. These costs include--
    (1) Direct costs (steps 41-45). Direct costs of breakout normally 
include all expenditures which are direct and wholly identifiable to a 
specific, successful breakout action, and which are not reflected in the 
part unit price. Examples of direct costs include Government tooling or 
special test equipment, qualification testing, quality control expenses, 
and industry participation costs (such as completion of the Contractor 
Technical Information Data Record) if borne by the Government.
    (i) Step 41. Estimate the cost to the Government for tooling or 
special equipment.
    (ii) Step 42. Estimate the cost, if any, to the Government for 
qualifying the new source.
    (iii) Step 43. Estimate the cost, if any, to the Government for 
assuring quality control, or the cost of contracting for quality 
control.
    (iv) Step 44. Estimate the cost to the Government for purchasing 
rights to data.
    (v) Step 45. Add estimated total direct costs to the Government to 
breakout the item.
    (2) Performance specification costs (steps 46-47). (i) Step 46. Is 
the breakout candidate constructed to a performance specification?
    (ii) Step 47. If the answer is yes in step 46, add performance 
specification breakout cost estimate elements to the result of step 45. 
The addition of an unknown number of nonstocked parts which must be 
stocked by the supply system for repairs is a significant element of 
cost associated with the decision to compete a performance specification 
assembly. (The same situation does not arise with respect to a design 
specification assembly since virtually all spare parts used to repair 
such an assembly are essentially identical to parts already in the 
assembly.) The cost of

[[Page 217]]

introducing these nonstocked parts into the system includes--
    (A) Additional catalog costs. The number of nonstocked parts 
forecasted to be in the competed assembly, multiplied by the variable 
cost of cataloging per line item.
    (B) Additional bin opening costs.
    The number of nonstocked parts forecasted to be in the competed 
assembly, multiplied by the variable cost of a bin opening at each of 
the locations where the part is to be stocked.
    (C) Additional management costs. The number of nonstocked parts 
forecasted to be in the competed assembly, multiplied by the variable 
cost of management per line item.
    (D) Additional technical data costs. The cost of a new set of 
technical data for the competed assembly, including the variable 
expenses of its production, reproduction, and distribution.
    (E) Additional repair tools and test equipment costs. The costs of 
additional special tools and test equipment not otherwise required by 
the existing assembly.
    (F) Additional logistics support costs. The costs associated with 
the new item such as spare and repair parts, technical manuals, and 
training.
    (d) Comparison of savings and costs (steps 48-56). Compare estimated 
breakout costs to forecasted breakout savings. If costs exceed estimated 
savings, it will be uneconomical to compete the part. Performance 
specification parts should be analyzed to ensure that pertinent breakout 
costs have been considered and, if it is not economical to breakout the 
part, whether an appropriate detailed design data package reduces costs 
sufficiently to make breakout economical.
    (1) Step 48. Compare total costs of breakout (step 47) to estimated 
savings (step 40).
    (2) Step 49. Are costs of breakout greater or less than estimated 
savings? If greater, proceed to step 50; if yes, proceed to step 51.
    (3) Step 50. Is the breakout candidate constructed to a performance 
specification? If no, proceed to step 54; if yes, proceed to step 57.
    (4) Step 51. Is it appropriate to obtain a detailed design data 
package? If yes, proceed to step 52; if no, proceed to step 54. The 
decision to change a performance specification part to a detailed design 
part obviously requires a critical engineering examination of the part 
itself, as well as a review of the impact such a change might have on 
the operational effectiveness of the system in which the equipment is to 
be employed. Acquisition of a performance specification part by a 
subsequently acquired design specification subjects the Government to 
the additional hazard of losing the money paid for the development of 
the design specification, should the design be altered during the 
contracting leadtime period. Accordingly, the engineering evaluation 
should closely review design stability over the anticipated contracting 
leadtime in order to avoid acquiring an obsolete or nonstandard part if 
the decision is made to compete it.
    (5) Step 52. Add the estimated cost of obtaining a detailed design 
data package to the results of step 45.
    (6) Step 53. If the results of step 52 are less than the estimated 
savings, initiate action to obtain a detailed design data package. 
Proceed to step 54 to code the part for a period until it can be 
rescreened using the design specification package. The code determined 
in this screening shall be assigned a suspense date commensurate with 
the leadtime required to obtain the detailed design data package (see E-
203(b)).
    (7) Step 54. Is the part manufactured by the prime contractor? If 
yes, code the part AMC 3; if no, proceed to step 55.
    (8) Step 55. Can the part be acquired directly from the actual 
manufacturer? If no, proceed to step 56; if yes, code the part AMC 3 or 
4, as applicable.
    (9) Step 56. Specify the reasons for inability to obtain the part 
from the actual manufacturer. Code the part AMC 5.
E-303.6  Supply feedback phase (steps 57-65).
    (a) The supply feedback phase of the analysis is the final screening 
phase for breakout parts. This phase in completed for all AMC 2 parts to 
determine if sufficient time is available to breakout on the immediate 
buy and to communicate this information to the inventory manager 
responsible for the requirement. First, all additional time factors 
required to breakout the part are added. Total time is subtracted from 
the immediate and future buy date and the result compared to the current 
date. (Note: Not all time factors listed apply to each part screened.) 
If the result is the same or earlier than the required contract date, 
the part is coded competitive and action is begun to qualify additional 
sources as necessary. If the result is later than the required contract 
date, action to compete the immediate buy quantity should be initiated 
if the inventory manager can find some means of accepting later 
delivery. If this is impossible, the appropriate records should be 
annotated for competitive acquisition of the next replenishment buy 
quantity. If late delivery is acceptable, the inventory manager should 
compute requirements for the part and initiate an appropriate purchase 
requisition.
    (b) Procedures. (1) Step 57. Add all additional time factors 
required to breakout the part (steps 13, 14, 29, and 36).
    (2) Step 58. Add the results of step 57 to the date of this review.
    (3) Step 59. Compare the result of step 58 to the date that the 
contract or order must be placed.

[[Page 218]]

    (4) Step 60. Is the result of step 59 earlier than, later than, or 
the same as the contract or order date? (If earlier or the same, proceed 
to step 61; if later, proceed to step 63.)
    (5) Step 61. Can supply accept late delivery? If yes, proceed to 
step 62; if no, proceed to step 63.
    (6) Step 62. Notify the inventory manager to compute requirements 
and initiate a purchase requisition. Proceed to step 64.
    (7) Step 63. Code the part AMC 2. Insufficient time to compete on 
this buy.
    (8) Step 64. Code the part AMC 2.
    (9) Step 65. Begin actions to qualify new sources, if required and 
possible.
E-304  Limited screening procedures.
    (a) Limited screening procedures are only appropriate when the full 
screening process cannot be completed for a part in sufficient time to 
support an immediate buy requirement. If limited screening does not 
result in a competitive AMC and the part is characterized by a high buy 
value and high buy quantity in the annual buy forecast, full screening 
procedures shall be immediately initiated.
    (b) Limited screening procedures cover only the essential points of 
data and technical evaluations more completely described in full 
screening procedures (see E-303). Extensive legal review of rights or 
technical review of data is not required; nor is backup information on 
type and extent of qualification testing, quality control procedures and 
master tooling required. A summary flow chart of the limited screening 
decision steps is provided at Exhibit III.
    (c) The limited screening decision steps are followed sequentially 
if the answer to the question in each step is affirmative. If any step 
is answered in the negative, proceed directly to step 10.
    (1) Step 1. Assemble all available data and establish a file for 
each part. Collect identification data, relevant data obtained from 
industry, contracting and technical history data and current status of 
the part (see E-303.1).
    (2) Step 2. Do the available documents establish Government rights 
to use the data for acquisition purposes? If the Government's rights to 
use data in its possession is questionable, resolution of the rights 
must continue beyond award of the immediate buy.
    (3) Step 3. Is the data package sufficient, accurate, and legible? 
If the Government does not have in its possession sufficient, accurate, 
or legible data, action shall be promptly initiated to resolve the 
deficiency for the next buy.
    (4) Step 4. Is the design of the part stable over the anticipated 
acquisition leadtime?
    (5) Step 5. Is a satisfactory part now being produced?
    (6) Step 6. Can the part be acquired from a new source without prior 
qualification testing or other approval testing?
    (7) Step 7. Can the Government or a new source be responsible for 
quality assurance?
    (8) Step 8. Can the part be manufactured without master or 
coordinated tooling or other special equipment; if no, is there more 
than one source which has the tooling or special equipment?
    (9) Step 9. Assign AMC 2. Proceed to step 11.
    (10) Step 10. Assign AMC 3, 4, or 5, as appropriate.
    (11) Step 11. Establish the date of the next review (see E-104(c) 
and E-203(b)).

                     Part 4--Contractor's Assistance

E-400  General.
    (a) Contractor's assistance in screening shall be requested on 
provisioned and replenishment parts after consideration of the benefit 
expected from the contractor's technical information and the cost to the 
Government of obtaining such assistance.
    (b) Contractor's assistance shall not be requested for parts covered 
by Government/industry specifications, commercially available parts or 
parts for which data is already available.
    (c) Arrangements entered into with contractor to obtain technical 
information shall provide that--
    (1) Contractors will exert their best effort to make impartial 
technical evaluations using applicable technical data and the experience 
of competent personnel; and
    (2) No costs to the Government will be incurred for duplicate 
screening of parts.
E-401  Contractor's technical evaluation procedures.
    (a) Contractor's technical evaluation for the screening process 
shall be required contractually by incorporating MIL-STD-789, which 
delineates the contractor's responsibilities and procedures and 
prescribes use of the contractor DD Form 1418, Technical Information 
Record, and the DD Form 1418-1, Technical Data Identification Checklist, 
a copy of each document listed on DD Form 1418-1, and other substantive 
data that was used in developing the contractor's recommendations.
    (b) When MIL-STD-789 is incorporated in a contract, the DD Form 
1423, Contract Data Requirements List, shall specify the requirement for 
the submission of DD Form 1418, Technical Information Record, and DD 
Form 1418-1, Technical Data Identification Checklist, in accordance with 
MIL-STD-789.

[[Page 219]]

                        Part 5--Reporting System

E-500  General.
    This part prescribes reports regarding the breakout program which 
cannot be obtained from other sources. These reports are used to 
evaluate the effectiveness of breakout programs, establish a baseline 
for all spare part acquisitions, and identify trends in spare parts 
acquisition.
E-501  Reports.
    (a) Spare Parts Breakout Screening Report (RCS DD P&L(Q&SA)714A). 
This is a cumulative semi-annual report reflecting the accomplishments 
of the breakout program. The report describes the results of full and 
limited screening for provisioning and replenishment parts by number of 
different NSNs for each AMC. Departments and agencies shall also 
maintain actual cost data attributable to the Spare Parts Breakout 
Program which shall be forwarded on this report semi-annually.
    (b) Spare Parts Acquisition Report (RCS DD P&L(Q&SA) 714B). This is 
a cumulative semi-annual report for all purchases made of spare parts 
during the current fiscal year. This report describes the number and 
extended dollar value of different NSNs purchased for each AMC. 
Departments and agencies shall also maintain actual savings (or cost 
avoidance) data attributable to the Spare Parts Breakout Program which 
shall be forwarded on this report semi-annually. Because of extraneous 
factors such as contracting leadtimes and changes in spare parts 
requirements, this report will not always reflect the acquisition of the 
parts screened during a reporting period (contained on the Spare Parts 
Breakout Screening Report). Also, it will not show in all instances how 
the part was actually acquired. This report is intended to be an 
indication of the success of the breakout program, and designed to show 
trends in the coding and data available to buyers in the acquisition 
package.
E-502  Reporting procedures.
    (a) Departments and agencies shall maintain and forward semi-annual 
reports. The second semi-annual report in a fiscal year shall reflect 
cumulative totals for the current fiscal year using the formats in 
Exhibits IV and V.
    (b) The reports will be due no later than 45 days after the end of 
each period designated.
    (c) Submissions will be made to the Assistant Secretary of Defense 
(Production and Logistics), ATTN: Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Logistics.
E-503  Reporting instructions.
    (a) Spare parts breakout screening report. Using the format in 
Exhibit IV, provide the following--
    (1) Enter reporting activity name, fiscal year, and period ending.
    (2) For each AMC/AMSC listed, enter the number of different NSNs for 
which screening was completed during the period. Show zeros where 
applicable. This should be done for both full and limited screening.
    (3) Report the total costs of the breakout program incurred for the 
period. Although this will be primarily labor costs, it should also 
include appropriate prorated costs of ADP services, office overhead, 
data retrieval service costs, etc. (see E-303.5).
    (b) Spare parts acquisition report. Using the format in Exhibit V, 
provide the following--
    (1) Enter reporting activity name, fiscal year, and period ending.
    (2) For each AMC/AMSC listed, enter the number of different NSNs 
purchased during the current fiscal year and their extended dollar 
value.
    (3) Report the actual breakout program savings or cost avoidances as 
measured by completed acquisition (not anticipated acquisitions). Price 
differentials should be measured on each acquisition where a breakout 
action has taken place. They should equal the difference between the 
previous contract unit price and the current contract unit price, times 
the number of units purchased.

                          Part 1--Introduction

F-101  General.
    This appendix contains procedures and instructions for the use, 
preparation, and distribution of the material inspection and receiving 
report (MIRR) (DD Form 250 series) and commercial shipping/packing lists 
used to document Government contract quality assurance.
F-102  Applicability.
    (a) The provisions of this appendix apply to supplies or services 
acquired by DoD when the clause at 252.246-7000, Material Inspection and 
Receiving Report, is included in the contract. If the contract contains 
the clause at FAR 52.213-1, Fast Payment Procedure, the contractor may 
elect not to prepare a DD Form 250.
    (b) When DoD provides quality assurance or acceptance services for 
non-DoD activities, prepare a MIRR using the instructions in this 
appendix, unless otherwise specified in the contract.
F-103  Use.
    (a) The DD Form 250 is a multipurpose report used--(1) To provide 
evidence of Government contract quality assurance at origin or 
destination;
    (2) To provide evidence of acceptance at origin or destination;
    (3) For packing lists;
    (4) For receiving;
    (5) For shipping;
    (6) As a contractor invoice; and
    (7) As commercial invoice support.
    (b) Do not use the DD Form 250 for shipments--(1) By subcontractors, 
unless the subcontractor is shipping directly to the Government; or
    (2) Of contract inventory.
    (c) The contractor prepares the MIRR, except for entries that an 
authorized Government representative is required to complete.
    (d) Use the DD Form 250-1--(1) For bulk movements of petroleum 
products by tanker or barge to cover--
    (i) Origin or destination acceptance of cargo; or
    (ii) Shipment or receipt of Government owned products.
    (2) To send quality data to the point of acceptance in the case of 
origin inspection on FOB destination deliveries or preinspection at 
product source. Annotate the forms with the words ``INSPECTED FOR 
QUALITY ONLY.''
F-104  Application.
    (a) DD Form 250. (1) Use the DD Form 250 for delivery of contract 
line, subline, exhibit line, or exhibit subline items. Do not use the DD 
Form 250 for those exhibit line or exhibit subline items on a DD Form 
1423, Contract Data Requirements List, that indicate no DD Form 250 is 
required.
    (2) If the shipped to, marked for, shipped from, mode of shipment, 
contract quality assurance and acceptance data are the same for more 
than one shipment made on the same day under the same contract, 
contractors may prepare one MIRR to cover all such shipments.
    (3) If the volume of the shipment precludes the use of a single car, 
truck, or other vehicle, prepare a separate MIRR for the contents of 
each vehicle.
    (4) When a shipment is consigned to an Air Force activity and the 
shipment includes items of more than one federal supply class (FSC) or 
material management code (MMC), prepare a separate DD Form 250 for items 
of each of the FSCs or MMCs in the shipment. However, the cognizant 
Government representative may authorize a single DD Form 250, listing 
each of the FSCs or MMCs included in the shipment on a separate 
continuation sheet. The MMC appears as a suffix to the national stock 
number applicable to the item.

[[Page 225]]

    (5) Consolidation of Petroleum Shipments on a Single MIRR--(i) 
Continental United States. Contractors may consolidate multiple car or 
truck load shipments of petroleum made on the same day, to the same 
destination, against the same contract line item, on one MIRR. To permit 
verification of motor deliveries, assign each load a load number which 
can be identified to the shipment number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250. 
Include a shipping document (commercial or government) with each 
individual load showing as a minimum--
    (A) The shipper;
    (B) Shipping point;
    (C) Consignee;
    (D) Contract and line item number;
    (E) Product identification;
    (F) Gross gallons (bulk only);
    (G) Loading temperature (bulk only);
    (H) American Petroleum Institute gravity (bulk only);
    (I) Identification of carrier's equipment;
    (J) Serial number of all seals applied; and
    (K) Signature of supplier's representative.
    When acceptance is at destination, the receiving activity retains 
the shipping document(s) to verify the entries on the consignee copy of 
the DD Form 250 forwarded by the contractor (reference F-401, Table 1) 
before signing Block 21B.
    (ii) Overseas. The same criteria as for continental U.S. applies, 
except the consolidation period may be extended, if acceptable to the 
receiving activity, shipping activity, Government finance office, and 
the authorized Government representative having cognizance at the 
contractor's facility. In addition, the contractor may include more than 
one contract line item in each DD Form 250 if the shipped to, marked 
for, shipped from, mode of shipment, contract quality assurance, and 
acceptance data are the same for all line items.
    (6) Consolidation of Coal Shipments on a Single MIRR. Contractors 
may consolidate multiple railcar or truck shipments of coal made on the 
same day, to the same destination, against the same contract line items, 
on one MIRR. To permit verification of truck deliveries, assign each 
load a load number which can be identified to the shipment number in 
Block 2 of the DD Form 250 and the analytical test report. Include a 
commercial shipping document with each individual truck load showing as 
a minimum--
    (i) The shipper;
    (ii) The name or names;
    (iii) Location and shipping point of the mine or mines from which 
the coal originates;
    (iv) The contract number;
    (v) The exact size of the coal shipped; and
    (vi) A certified weighmaster's certification of weight for the 
truckload.
    Include a waybill with each rail shipment showing the identical 
information. To permit verification of rail deliveries, identify each 
railcar number comprising the shipment to the shipment number in Block 2 
of the DD Form 250 and the analytical test report. When acceptance is at 
destination, the receiving activity must retain the shipping document(s) 
to verify the entries on the consignee copy of the DD Form 250.
    (b) DD Form 250-1. (1) Use a separate form for each tanker or barge 
cargo loaded.
    (2) The contractor may report more than one barge in the same tow on 
a single form if on the same contract and consigned to the same 
destination.
    (3) When liftings involve more than one contract, prepare separate 
forms to cover the portion of cargo loaded on each contract.
    (4) Prepare a separate form for each product or grade of product 
loaded.
    (5) Use a separate document for each tanker or barge cargo and each 
grade of product discharged.
    (6) For discharge, the contractor may report more than one barge in 
the same tow on a single form if from the same loading source.
F-105  Forms.
    (a) Contractors may get MIRR forms from the contract administration 
office at no cost.
    (b) Contractors may print forms provided that the format and 
dimensions (DD Forms 250 and 250c: 8 1/2 inches x 11 inches, DD Form 
250-1: 8 1/2 inches x 14 inches) are identical to the MIRR forms printed 
by the Government and that the forms are cast to provide for 78 
characters per printed image horizontally and 62 lines vertically border 
to border for the DD Form 250, and 61 lines vertically border to border 
for the DD Form 250c.

    (2) When this series is completely used, start over with 0001.
    (ii) Reassign the shipment number of the initial shipment where a 
``Replacement Shipment'' is involved (Block 16(d)(6)).
    (iii) The prime contractor shall control deliveries and on the final 
shipment of the contract shall end the shipment number with a ``Z.''

    Authority; 41 U.S.C. 421 and 48 CFR chapter 1.
H-100  Scope.
    This appendix provides uniform debarment and suspension procedures 
to be followed by all debarring and suspending officials.
H-101  Notification.
    Contractors will be notified of the proposed debarment or suspension 
in accordance with FAR 9.406-3 or 9.407-3. A copy of the record which 
formed the basis for the decision by the debarring and suspending 
official will be made available to the contractor. If there is a reason 
to withhold from the contractor any portion of the record, the 
contractor will be informed of what is withheld and the reasons for such 
withholding.
H-102  Nature of proceeding.
    There are two distinct proceedings which may be involved in the 
suspension or debarment process. The first is the presentation of 
matters in opposition to the suspension or proposed debarment by the 
contractor.
    The second is fact-finding which occurs only in cases in which the 
contractor's presentation of matters in opposition raises a genuine 
dispute over one or more material facts. In a suspension action based 
upon an indictment or in a proposed debarment action based upon a 
conviction or civil judgment, there will be no fact-filling proceeding 
concerning the matters alleged in the indictment, or the facts 
underlying the convictions or civil judgment. However, to the extent 
that the proposed action stems from the contractor's affiliation with an 
individual or firm indicted or convicted, or the subject of a civil 
judgment, fact-finding is permitted if a genuine dispute of fact is 
raised as to the question of affiliation as defined in FAR 9.403.
H-103  Presentation of matters in opposition.
    (a) In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), matters in 
opposition may be presented in person, in writing, or through a 
representative. Matters in opposition may be presented through any 
combination of the foregoing methods, but if a contractor desires to 
present matters in person or through a representative, any written 
material should be delivered at least 5 working days in advance of the 
presentation. Usually, all matters in opposition are presented in a 
single proceeding. A contractor who becomes aware of a pending 
indictment or allegations of wrongdoing that the contractor believes may 
lead to suspension or debarment action may contact the debarring and 
suspending official or designee to provide information as to the 
contractor's present responsibility.
    (b) An in-person presentation is an informal meeting, nonadversarial 
in nature. The debarring and suspending official and/or other agency 
representatives may ask questions of the contractor or its 
representative making the presentation. The contractor may select the 
individuals who will attend the meeting on the contractor's behalf; 
individual respondents or principals of a business firm respondent may 
attend and speak for themselves.
    (c) In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), the contractor 
may submit matters in opposition within 30 days from receipt of the 
notice of suspension or proposed debarment.
    (d) The opportunity to present matters in opposition to debarment 
includes the opportunity to present matters concerning the duration of 
the debarment.
H-104  Fact-finding.
    (a) The debarring and suspending official will determine whether the 
contractor's presentation has raised a genuine dispute of material 
fact(s). If the debarring and suspending official has decided against 
debarment or continued suspension, or the provisions of FAR 9.4 preclude 
fact-finding, no fact-finding will be conducted. If the debarring and 
suspending official has determined a genuine dispute of material fact(s) 
exists, a designated fact-finder will conduct the fact-finding 
proceeding. The proceeding before the fact-finder will be limited to a 
finding of the facts in dispute as determined by the debarring and 
suspending official.
    (b) The designated fact-finder will establish the date for a fact-
finding proceeding, normally to be held within 45 working days of the 
contractor's presentation of matters in opposition. An official record 
will be made of the fact-finding proceeding.
    (c) The Government's representative and the contractor will have an 
opportunity to

[[Page 281]]

present evidence relevant to the facts at issues. The contractor may 
appear in person or through a representative in the fact-finding 
proceeding.
    (d) Neither the Federal Rules of Evidence nor the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure govern fact-finding. Hearsay evidence may be presented 
and will be given appropriate weight by the fact-finder.
    (e) Witnesses may testify in person. Witnesses will be reminded of 
the official nature of the proceeding and that any false testimony given 
is subject to criminal prosecution. Witnesses are subject to cross-
examination.
H-105  Timing requirements.
    All timing requirements set forth in these procedures may be 
extended by the debarring and suspending official for good cause.
H-106  Subsequent to fact-finding.
    (a) Written findings of fact will be prepared by the fact-finder as 
mandated by FAR 9.406-3(d)(2)(i) and 9.407-3(d)(2)(i).
    (b) The fact-finder will determine the disputed fact(s) by a 
preponderance of the evidence. A copy of the findings of fact will be 
provided to the debarring and suspending official, the Government's 
representative, and the contractor.
    (c) The debarring and suspending official will determine whether to 
continue the suspension or to debar the contractor based upon the entire 
administrative record, including the findings of fact.
    (d) Prompt written notice of the debarring and suspending official's 
decision will be sent to the contractor and any affiliates involved, in 
compliance with FAR 9.406-3(e) and 9.407-3(d)(4).

    Authority; 41 U.S.C. 421 and 48 CFR chapter 1.
I-100  Purpose.
    (a) Appendix I to 48 CFR chapter 2 implements the Pilot Mentor-
Protege Program (hereinafter referred to as the ``Program'') established 
under section 831 of Pub. L. 101-510, The National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 1991, as amended. The purpose of the Program is to--
    (1) Provide incentives to major DoD contractors, performing under at 
least one active approved subcontracting plan negotiated with DoD or 
other Federal agencies, to assist small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) 
in enhancing their capabilities to satisfy DoD and other contract and 
subcontract requirements;
    (2) Increase the overall participation of SDBs as subcontractors and 
suppliers and DoD contracts, other Federal agency contracts and 
commercial contracts and;
    (3) Foster the establishment of long term business relationships 
between SDBs and such contractors.
    (b) Under the Program, eligible companies approved as mentor firms 
will enter into mentor-protege agreements with eligible SDBs as protege 
firms to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the 
capabilities of SDBs to perform as subcontractors and suppliers. 
According to the law, the DoD may provide the mentor firm with either 
cost reimbursement, credit against SDB subcontracting goals established 
under contracts with DoD or other Federal agencies, or a combination of 
credit and reimbursement.
    (c) DoD will measure the overall success of the Program by the 
extent to which the Program results in--
    (1) An increase in the dollar value of subcontracts awarded to SDBs 
by mentor firms under DoD contracts;
    (2) An increase in the dollar value of contract and subcontract 
awards to protege firms (under DoD contracts, contracts awarded by other 
Federal agencies and under commercial contracts) since the date of their 
entry into the Program;
    (3) An increase in the number and dollar value of subcontracts 
awarded to a protege firm (or former protege firm) by its mentor firm 
(or former mentor firm);
    (4) An improvement in the participation of SDBs in DoD, other 
Federal agencies, and commercial contracting opportunities that can be 
attributed to the development of SDBs as protege firms under the 
Program;

[[Page 282]]

    (5) An increase in subcontracting with SDB concerns in industry 
categories where SDBs have not traditionally participated within the 
mentor firm's vendor base;
    (6) The involvement of emerging SDBs in the Program;
    (7) An expanded relationship between mentor firms and protege firms 
to include non-DoD programs; and
    (8) The development of protege firms that are competitive as 
subcontractors and suppliers to DoD or in other Federal agencies or 
commercial markets.
    (d) This policy sets forth the procedures for participation in the 
Program applicable to companies that are interested in receiving--
    (1) A separate contract, cooperative agreement, or other agreement 
entered into between DoD and the mentor firm--company is interested in 
reimbursement through a separate contract, cooperative agreement or 
other agreement with DoD or, a combination of reimbursement through such 
agreement with DoD and credit against SDB subcontract goals for any 
unreimbursed costs incurred under the Program.
    (2) Program Manager funded reimbursement--company has identified a 
DoD program manager willing to fund the Program and the company is 
interested in reimbursement for technical assistance costs to a protege 
firm(s) through a separately priced cost reimbursement contract line 
item added to a DoD contract, with credit against SDB subcontracting 
goals for any unreimbursed costs.
    (3) Indirect reimbursement and credit--company is interested in 
receiving reimbursement for indirect costs incurred under the Program as 
well as credit against SDB subcontract goals for these indirect costs.
    (4) Credit only--company is interested in receiving credit only 
against SDB subcontracting goals for costs incurred under the Program.
I-101  Definitions.
I-101.1  Emerging SDB concern.
    A small disadvantaged business whose size is no greater than 50 
percent of the numerical size standard applicable to the standard 
industrial code for the supplies or services which the protege firm 
provides or would provide to the mentor firm.
I-101.2  Historically black college or university.
    An institution determined by the Secretary of Education to meet the 
requirements of 34 CFR 608.2. The term also means any nonprofit research 
institution that was an integral part of such a college or university 
before November 14, 1986.
I-101.3  Minority institution of higher education.
    An institution meeting the requirements of Section 1046(3) of the 
Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1135d-5(3). The term also 
includes Hispanic-serving institutions as defined in Section 316(b)(1) 
of such Act (20 U.S.C. 1059c(b)(1)).
I-102  General Procedures.
    (a) At any time between October 1, 1991, and September 30, 1996, 
companies interested in becoming mentor firms that want to take credit 
only for costs incurred for providing developmental assistance to one or 
more protege firms, or receive credit and reimbursement of indirect 
costs incurred under the Program, must apply to the DoD for 
participation in the Program pursuant to the application process set 
forth at I-106(a).
    (b) At any time between October 1, 1991, and September 30, 1996, 
companies interested in becoming mentor firms that are able to identify 
funding from a DoD contract program manager(s) to provide developmental 
assistance to one or more protege firms must apply to the DoD for 
participation in the Program, pursuant to the application process set 
forth at I-106(d).
    (c) Once funding is made available by DoD, companies that are 
interested in becoming mentor firms that want to receive reimbursement 
only or a combination of reimbursement and credit for providing 
developmental assistance to one or more protege firms by either a 
separate contract, cooperative agreement or other agreement awarded for 
that purpose, will be solicited for participation in the Program through 
a program solicitation. The Program solicitation will be issued by DoD 
and will contain, among other things, the statement of work and the 
evaluation factors upon which award will be based. Companies seeking 
reimbursement only, or a combination of reimbursement and credit, must 
respond to the solicitation and will be evaluated on the quality of the 
proposed developmental assistance program for each protege, in 
accordance with the evaluation factors contained in the solicitation. 
Awards will be made by DoD to approved mentor firms, to provide the 
proposed developmental assistance to one or more identified protege 
firms.
I-103  Program duration.
    Activities under the Program may only occur during the following 
periods:
    (a) From October 1, 1991, until September 30, 1996, companies may 
apply for participation in the Program as mentor firms pursuant to I-
102, General Procedures, and once approved, may enter into mentor-
protege agreements, pursuant to I-107, Mentor-Protege Agreements.

[[Page 283]]

    (b) From October 1, 1991, until September 30, 1996, mentor firm's 
costs of providing developmental assistance to its protege firm may be 
reimbursed only if--
    (1) Such costs are incurred after either a separate contact, 
cooperative agreement, or other agreement is entered into between DoD 
and the mentor firm;
    (2) The funding for such costs have been identified by a DoD program 
manager and such costs are incurred pursuant to the execution of a 
separately priced contract line item added to a DoD contract(s); to
    (3) Such costs are included in indirect expense pools.
    (c) From October 1, 1991, until September 30, 1999, mentor firms may 
receive credit toward the attainment of such firm's goals for 
subcontract awards to SDBs for unreimbursed costs incurred in providing 
developmental assistance to its protege firms, only if such costs are 
incurred pursuant to an approved mentor-protege agreement.
I-104  Eligibility requirements for a protege firm.
    (a) An entity may qualify as a protege firm if it is--
    (1) An SDB concern as defined by section 8(d)(3)(C) of the Small 
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(D)(3)(C)) which is--
    (i) Eligible for the award of Federal contracts; and
    (ii) A small business according to the SBA size standard for the 
Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code which represents the 
contemplated supplies or services to be provided by the protege firm to 
the mentor firm;
    (2) A business entity that meets the criteria in (a)(1) of this 
section and is owned and controlled by either an Indian tribe as defined 
by section 8(a)(13) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(13)) or 
a Native Hawaiian Organization as defined by section 8(a)(15) of the 
Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(15)); or
    (3) A qualified organization employing the severely disabled as 
defined in Pub. L. 102-172, section 8064A.
    (b) A protege firm may self-certify to a mentor firm that it meets 
the eligibility requirements in paragraphs I-104(a)(1), (2), or (3). 
Mentor firms may rely in good faith on a written representation that the 
entity meets the requirements of paragraphs I-104(a) (1), (2), or (3).
    (c) A protege firm may have only one active mentor-protege 
agreement.
I-105  Selection of protege firms.
    (a) Mentor firms will be solely responsible for selecting protege 
firms. Mentor firms are encouraged to identify and select protege firms 
that are defined as emerging SDB concerns.
    (b) The selection of protege firms by mentor firms may not be 
protested, except as in I-105(c).
    (c) In the event of a protest regarding the size or disadvantaged 
status of an entity selected to be a protege firm as defined in either 
paragraph I-104(a)(1) or (2), the mentor firm shall refer the protest to 
the Small Business Administration (SBA) to resolve in accordance with 13 
CFR part 121 (with respect to size) or 13 CFR part 124 (with respect to 
disadvantaged status).
    (d) For purposes of the Small Business Act, no determination of 
affiliation or control (either direct or indirect) may be found between 
a protege firm and its mentor firm on the basis that the mentor firm has 
agreed to furnish (or has furnished) to its protege firm pursuant to a 
mentor-protege agreement any form of developmental assistance described 
in paragraph I-107(f).
    (e) If at any time pursuant to paragraph I-105(c), the protege firm 
is determined by the SBA not to be a small disadvantaged business 
concern, assistance furnished such business concern by the mentor firm 
after the date of the determination, may not be considered assistance 
furnished under the program.
I-106  Approval process for companies to participate in the Program as 
mentor firms.
    (a) On or after October 1, 1991, a company that is interested in 
becoming a mentor firm that is seeking credit only against SDB

reimbursement of developmental assistance costs via inclusion of program 
costs in indirect expense pools and credit for such costs, must submit a 
request to the DoD, OUSD(A&T)SADBU to be approved as a mentor firm under

be administered by the mentor firm in accordance with FAR subpart 32.4.
    (5) Loans.

I-108  Reimbursement procedures.
    (a) A mentor firm may be reimbursed only for the cost of 
developmental assistance incurred by the mentor firm and provided to a 
protege firm under I-107(f) (1) and (7), and pursuant to an approved 
mentor-protege agreement. Reimbursement shall be made only through 
either a separate contract, cooperative agreement, or other agreement 
entered into between the DoD and the mentor firm awarded for the purpose 
of providing developmental assistance to one or more protege firms; a 
separately priced contract line item in a DoD contract; or inclusion of 
program costs in indirect expense pools. No other means for the 
reimbursement of the costs of developmental assistance provided under I-
107(f) (1) and (7) are authorized under the Program.
    (b) Costs reimbursed via inclusion in indirect expense pools may be 
reimbursed only to the extent that they are otherwise reasonable, 
allocable, and allowable.
    (c) Assistance provided in the form of progress payments in excess 
of the customary progress payment rate for SDBs, shall be reimbursed 
only if implemented in accordance with FAR 32.504(c).
    (d) Assistance provided in the form of advance payments shall be 
reimbursed only if they have been provided to a protege firm under 
subcontract terms and conditions similar to FAR 52.232-12. Reimbursement 
of any advance payments shall be made pursuant to the inclusion of DFARS 
252.232-7008, Reimbursement of Advance Payments--DoD Pilot Mentor-
Protege Program, in appropriate contracts. In requesting reimbursement, 
the mentor firm agrees that the risk of any financial loss due to the 
failure or inability of a protege firm to repay any unliquidated advance 
payments shall be the sole responsibility of the mentor firm.
    (e) No other forms of developmental assistance are authorized for 
reimbursement under the Program.
I-109  Credit for unreimbursed developmental assistance costs.
    (a) Developmental assistance costs incurred by a mentor firm for 
providing assistance to a protege firm pursuant to an approved mentor 
protege agreement, which have not been reimbursed through either a 
separate contract, cooperative agreement, or other agreement entered 
into between DoD and the mentor firm, or through a separately priced 
contract line item added to a DoD contract, may be credited as if it 
were a subcontract award for determining the performance of such mentor 
firm in attaining an SDB subcontracting goal(s) established under any 
contract containing a subcontracting plan pursuant to FAR 52.219-9.
    (b) For crediting purposes only, costs that have been reimbursed via 
inclusion in indirect expense pools may also be credited as subcontract 
awards for determining the performance of such mentor firm in attaining 
an SDB subcontracting goal(s) established

[[Page 287]]

under any contract containing a subcontracting plan pursuant to FAR 
52.219-9. However, costs that have not been reimbursed because they are 
not reasonable, allocable, or allowable under I-108(b), shall not be 
recognized for crediting purposes.
    (c) Other costs that are not eligible for reimbursement pursuant to 
I-108(a) may be recognized for credit only if requested, identified, and 
incorporated in an approved mentor-protege agreement. Such costs are not 
eligible for reimbursement.
    (d) The amount of credit a mentor firm may receive for any such 
unreimbursed developmental assistance costs shall be equal to--
    (1) Four times the total amount of such costs attributable to 
assistance provided by small business development centers (SBDC), 
historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), minority 
institutions (MI), and procurement technical assistance centers (PTAC).
    (2) Three times the total amount of such costs attributable to 
assistance furnished by the mentor's employees.
    (3) Two times the total amount of other such costs incurred by the 
mentor in carrying out the developmental assistance program.
    (e) A mentor firm may receive credit toward the attainment of an SDB 
subcontracting goal(s) for each subcontract awarded for a product or a 
service by the mentor firm to an entity that qualifies as a protege firm 
pursuant to I-104(a). With respect to a former SDB protege (firm(s), a 
mentor may take credit for awards to such concern(s) that, except for 
its size would be a small business concern owned and controlled by 
socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, but only if--
    (1) The size of such business concern is not more than two times the 
appropriate size standard;
    (2) The business concern formerly had a mentor-protege agreement 
with such mentor firm that was not terminated for cause; and
    (3) The credit is taken not later than October 1, 1999.
    (f) Amounts credited toward the SDB goal(s) for unreimbursed costs 
under the Program shall be separately identified from the amounts 
credited toward the goal resulting from the award of actual subcontracts 
to protege firms. The combination of the two shall equal the mentor 
firm's overall accomplishment toward the SDB goal(s).
    (g) Adjustments may be made to the amount of credit claimed under 
paragraphs I-109(a) and (b) if the DoD Director of Small and 
Disadvantaged Business Utilization determines that--
    (1) A mentor firm's performance in the attainment of its SDB 
subcontracting goals through actual subcontract awards declined from the 
prior fiscal year without justifiable cause.
    (2) Imposition of such a limitation on credit appears to be 
warranted to prevent abuse of this incentive for mentor firm's 
participation in the Program.
    (h) The mentor firm shall be afforded the opportunity to explain the 
decline in SDB participation before imposition of any such limitation on 
credit. In making the final decision to impose a limitation on credit, 
the DoD Director shall consider--
    (1) The mentor firm's overall SDB participation rates (in terms of 
percentages of subcontract awards and dollars awarded) as compared to 
the participation rates existing during the two fiscal years prior to 
the firm's admission to the Program;
    (2) The mentor firm's aggregate prime contract awards during the 
prior two fiscal years and the total amount of subcontract awards under 
such contracts; and
    (3) Such other information the mentor firm may wish to submit.
    (i) The decision of the Director regarding the imposition of a 
limitation on credit shall be final.
    (j) Any prospective limitation on credit imposed by the Director 
shall be expressed as a percentage of otherwise eligible credit and 
shall apply beginning on a specific date in the future and continue 
until a date certain during the current fiscal year.
    (k) Any retroactive limitation on credit imposed by the Director 
shall reflect the actual costs incurred for developmental assistance 
(not exceeding the maximum amount reimbursed).
    (l) For purposes of calculating any incentives to be paid to a 
mentor firm for exceeding an SDB subcontracting goal pursuant to 
252.219-7009, incentives shall be paid only if an SDB subcontracting 
goal has been exceeded as a result of actual subcontract awards to SDBs 
(excluding credit under paragraphs I-109 (a), (b) and (c)).
    (m) Developmental assistance costs that are incurred pursuant to an 
approved mentor-protege agreement, and have been charged to, but not 
reimbursed through a separate contract, cooperative agreement, or other 
agreement entered into between the DoD and the mentor firm, or through a 
separately priced contract line item added to a DoD contract, shall not 
be otherwise reimbursed, either as a direct or indirect cost, under any 
other DoD contract, irrespective of whether the costs have been 
recognized for credit against SDB subcontracting goals.
    (n) Developmental assistance provided under an approved mentor-
protege agreement is distinct from, and shall not duplicate, any effort 
that is the normal and expected product of the award and administration 
of the mentor firm's subcontract. Costs associated with the latter shall 
be accumulated and charged in accordance with the

[[Page 288]]

contractor's approved accounting practices; they are not considered 
developmental assistance costs eligible for either credit or 
reimbursement under the Program.
I-110  Advance agreements on the treatment of developmental assistance 
costs.
    Pursuant to FAR 31.109, approved mentor firms seeking reimbursement, 
credit, or a combination thereof, are strongly encouraged to enter into 
an advance agreement with the contracting officer responsible for 
determining final indirect cost rates under FAR 42.705. The purpose of 
the advance agreement is to establish the accounting treatment of the 
costs of the development assistance pursuant to the mentor-protege 
agreement prior to the incurring of any costs by the mentor firm. An 
advance agreement is an attempt by both the Government and the mentor 
firm to avoid possible subsequent dispute based on questions related to 
reasonableness, allocability, or allowability of the costs of 
developmental assistance under the Program. Absent an advance agreement, 
mentor firms are advised to establish the accounting treatment of such 
costs and address the need for any changes to their cost accounting 
practices that may result from the implementation of a mentor-protege 
agreement, prior to incurring any costs, and irrespective of whether 
costs will be reimbursed, credited or a combination thereof.
I-111  Reporting requirements and program reviews.
    (a) Mentor firms shall report on the progress made under active 
mentor-protege agreements semiannually by attaching to their SF 295--
    (1) A statement which includes--
    (i) The number of active mentor-protege agreements in effect; and
    (ii) The progress in achieving the developmental assistance 
objectives under each mentor-protege agreement, including whether the 
objectives of the Program set forth in I-100(c) were met, any problem 
areas encountered, and any other appropriate information.
    (2) A copy of the SF 294 for each contract where developmental 
assistance was credited, with a statement in Block 18 identifying--
    (i) The amount of dollars credited to the SDB subcontract goal as a 
result of developmental assistance provided to protege firms under the 
Program;
    (ii) An explanation as to the relationship between the developmental 
assistance provided the protege firm(s) under the Program and the 
activities under the contract covered by the SF 294(s); and
    (iii) The number and dollar value of subcontracts awarded to the 
protege firm(s), broken out per protege.
    (b) For commercial companies and companies participating in the DoD 
``Test Program for Negotiation of Comprehensive Small Business 
Subcontracting Plans,'' indicate in Block 16 of the SF 295--
    (1) The total dollars credited to the SDB goal as a result of 
developmental assistance provided to a protege firm(s) under the 
Program.
    (2) The total dollar amount of subcontracts awarded to the protege 
firm(s) broken our per protege.
    (c) The OUSD(A&T)SADBU will conduct periodic performance reviews of 
the progress and accomplishments realized under approved mentor-protege 
agreements.
