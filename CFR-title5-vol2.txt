                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2007), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of textual material 
appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    This section incorporates the statutory requirements for 
establishing and conducting an equal opportunity recruitment program 
consistent with law within the Federal civil service. The policy in 5 
U.S.C. 7201(b) reads as follows: ``It is the policy of the United States 
to insure equal employment opportunities for employees without 
discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national 
origin. The President shall use his existing authority to carry out this

<R04>
         Subpart B_Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program


<R05>
Sec. 720.201  Regulatory requirements.

    This subpart contains the regulations of the Office of Personnel 
Management which implement the above provisions of title 5, United 
States Code, and are prescribed by the Office under authority of 5 
U.S.C. 7201.


<R05>
Sec. 720.202  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this subpart:
    (a) Underrepresentation means a situation in which the number of 
women or members of a minority group within a category of civil service 
employment constitutes a lower percentage of the total number of 
employees within the employment category than the percentage women or 
the minority constitutes within the civilian labor force of the United 
States, in accordance with Sec. 720.205 (c) and (d).
    (b) Category of civil service employment means such groupings of 
Federal jobs by grades and/or occupations as the Office of Personnel 
Management deems appropriate within the General Schedule and the 
prevailing wage systems.
    (c) Minority refers only to those groups classified as ``minority'' 
for the purpose of data collection by the Office of Personnel Management 
and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in furtherance of 
Federal equal employment opportunity policies. The term, ``women,'' 
includes nonminority as well as minority women.
    (d) Civilian labor force (CLF) includes all persons 16 years of age 
and over, except those in the armed forces, who are employed or who are 
unemployed and seeking work. CLF data are defined by the Bureau of the 
Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and are reported in the most 
recent decennial or mid-decade census, or current population survey, 
under title 13 of the United States Code or any other reliable 
statistical study.
    (e) Recruitment means the total process by which the Federal 
Government and the Federal agencies locate, identify and assist in the 
employment of qualified applicants from underrepresented groups for job 
openings in categories of employment where underrepresentation has been 
determined. It includes both innovative internal and external 
recruitment actions. It is also intended to cover processes designed to 
prepare qualifiable applicants (those who have the potential but do not 
presently meet valid qualification requirements) for such job openings 
through

[[Page 7]]

programs of training, work experience or both.
    (f) Applicant pool means all types of listings from which selections 
may be made, including (but not limited to) promotion lists, competitive 
certificates and inventories of eligibles, applicant supply files, and 
lists of eligibles for certain noncompetitive appointments.


<R05>
Sec. 720.203  Responsibilities of the Office of Personnel Management.

    (a) The Office of Personnel Management will provide appropriate data 
to assist Federal agencies in making determinations of 
underrepresentation. The process for making such determinations is 
described in sections II and III (c) of the ``Guidelines for the 
Development of a Federal Recruitment Program to Implement 5 U.S.C. 7201, 
as amended'' (See appendix to this part). The Office will develop and 
publish more specific criteria for statistical measurements to be used 
by individual agencies, and will develop further guidance on--
    (1) Agency employment statistics and civilian labor force statistics 
to be used in making determinations of underrepresentation, on a 
national, regional or other geographic basis as appropriate;
    (2) Groupings of grades and/or other occupational categories to be 
used in implementing agency programs;
    (3) Occupational categories and job series for which expanded 
external recruitment efforts are most appropriate, and those for which 
expanded and innovative internal recruitment is appropriate; and
    (4) Other factors which may be considered by the agency, in 
consultation with Office of Personnel Management, to make determinations 
of underrepresentation and to develop recruitment programs focused on 
specific occupational categories.
    (b) The Office will assist agencies in carrying out their programs 
by--
    (1) Identifying major recruitment sources of women and members of 
minority groups and providing guidance on internal and external 
recruitment activities directed toward the solution of specific 
underrepresentation problem;
    (2) Supplementing agency recruitment efforts, utilizing existing 
networks for dissemination of job information, and involving the 
participation of minority group and women's organizations where 
practicable;
    (3) Examining existing Federal personnel procedures to identify 
those which (i) may serve as impediments to innovative internal and 
external recruitment and (ii) are within the administrative control of 
the Office or the Federal agencies;
    (4) Determining whether applicant pools used in filling jobs in a 
category of employment where underrepresentation exists include 
sufficient candidates from any underrepresentated groups, except where 
the agency controls such pools (see Sec. 720.204(c));
    (5) Providing such other support, as the Office deems appropriate.
    (c) The Office will monitor and, in conjunction with the personnel 
management evaluation program of the Office, evaluate agency programs to 
determine their effectiveness in eliminating underrrepresentation.
    (d) The Office will work with agencies to develop effective 
mechanisms for providing information on Federal job opportunities 
targeted to reach candidates from underrepresented groups.
    (e) The Office will conduct a continuing program of guidance and 
instruction to supplement these regulations.
    (f) The Office will coordinate further activities to implement equal 
opportunity recruitment programs under this subpart with the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission consistent with law, Executive Order 
12067, and Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978.


<R05>
Sec. 720.204  Agency programs.

    (a) Each Executive agency having positions in the pay systems 
covered by this program must conduct a continuing program for the 
recruitment of minorities and women for positions in the agency and its 
components to carry out the policy of the United States to insure equal 
employment opportunities without discrimination because of race, color, 
religion, sex or national origin. The head of each agency must 
specifically assign responsibility for program

[[Page 8]]

implementation to an appropriate agency official. All agency officials 
who have responsibility for the program will be evaluated on their 
effectiveness in carrying it out as part of their periodic performance 
appraisals.
    (b) Programs established under this subpart must be designed to 
cover recruitment for all positions in pay plans covered by this program 
including part-time and temporary positions.
    (c) Where an agency or the Office of Personnel Management has 
determined that an applicant pool does not adequately provide for 
consideration of candidates from any underrepresented group, the agency 
or agency component must take one or more of the following actions:
    (1) Expand or otherwise redirect their recruitment activities in 
ways designed to increase the number of candidates from underrepresented 
groups in that applicant pool;
    (2) Use selection methods involving other applicant pools which 
include sufficient numbers of members of underrepresented groups;
    (3) Notify the office responsible for administering that applicant 
pool, and request its reopening of application receipt in support of 
expanded recruitment activities or certifying from equivalent registers 
existing in other geographic areas; and/or
    (4) Take such other action consistent with law which will contribute 
to the elimination of underrepresentation in the category of employment 
involved.
    (d) Agencies must notify and seek advice and assistance from the 
Office of Personnel Management in cases where their equal opportunity 
recruitment programs are not making measurable progress in eliminating 
identified underrepresentation in the agency work force.


<R05>
Sec. 720.205  Agency plans.

    (a) Each agency must have an up-to-date equal opportunity 
recruitment program plan covering recruitment for positions at various 
organizational levels and geographic locations within the agency. Such 
plans must be available for review in appropriate offices of the agency 
and must be submitted to the Office of Personnel Management on request. 
In accordance with agreement reached between the Office and the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission, such plans must be incorporated in 
the agency's equal employment opportunity plans required under section 
717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, pursuant to regulations 
and instructions of the Commission, provided they are separable parts of 
those plans for purposes of review by and submission to the Office of 
Personnel Management. Agency organizational and geographical components 
which are required to develop and submit Equal Employment Opportunity 
plans, under instructions issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission, must also have up-to-date special recruitment program plans. 
On a determination by the Office of Personnel Management, in 
consultation with EEOC, that additional component plans are needed to 
implement an agency's program effectively, the Office will instruct the 
agency to develop additional plans. Agencies must comply with such 
instructions.
    (b) Agency plans must include annual specific determinations of 
underrepresentation for each group and must be accompanied by 
quantifiable indices by which progress toward eliminating 
underrepresentation can be measured.
    (c) Where an agency or agency component is located in a geographical 
area where the percentage of underrepresented groups in the area 
civilian labor force is higher than their percentage in the national 
labor force, the agency or component must base its plans on the higher 
level of representation in the relevant civilian labor force.
    (d) Where an agency or agency component is located in a geographical 
area where participation of a particular underrepresented group is 
significantly lower than its participation in the national labor force, 
the agency or component may, in consultation with the Office of 
Personnel Management, use the lower percentage in determining 
underrepresentation. An agency may not use a figure lower than the 
relevant regional or nationwide labor force percentage where recruitment 
on a regional or nationwide basis is feasible for particular categories 
of employment. Factors such as size of

[[Page 9]]

the agency or unit, nature of jobs and their wage or pay scale may be 
considered in focusing recruitment for various job categories.
    (e) In addition to the underrepresentation determinations described 
in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section, agency plans must, at a 
minimum, include:
    (1) An assessment of grades or job categories and numbers of jobs in 
such categories expected to be filled in the current year, and on a 
longer term basis (based on anticipated turnover, expansion, hiring 
limits and other relevant factors) identification of those occupational 
categories and positions suitable for external recruitment, and 
description of special targeted recruitment programs for such jobs and 
positions;
    (2) A similar assessment for job categories and positions likely to 
be filled by recruitment from within the agency and/or the Federal civil 
service system and a description of recruitment programs developed to 
increase minority and female candidates from internal sources for such 
positions;
    (3) A further assessment of internal availability of candidates from 
underrepresentated groups for higher job progressions by identifying 
job-related skills, knowledges and abilities which may be obtained at 
lower levels in the same or similar occupational series, or through 
other experience;
    (4) A description of methods the agency intends to use to locate and 
develop minority and female candidates for each category of 
underrepresentation and an indication of how such methods differ from 
and expand upon the recruitment activities of the agency prior to 
establishment of the special recruitment program or the last revision to 
the agency's plans;
    (5) A description of specific, special efforts planned by the agency 
(or agency component) to recruit in communities, educational 
institutions, and other likely sources of qualified minority and female 
candidates;
    (6) A description of efforts which will be undertaken by the agency 
to identify jobs which can be redesigned so as to improve opportunities 
for minorities and women, including jobs requiring bilingual or 
bicultural capabilities or not requiring English fluency.
    (7) A list of priorities for special recruitment program activities 
based on agency identification of:
    (i) Immediate and longer range job openings for each occupational/
grade-level grouping for which underrepresentation has been determined;
    (ii) Hiring authorities which may be used to fill such jobs;
    (iii) The possible impact of its actions on underrepresentation.
    (8) Identification of training and job development programs the 
agency will use to provide skills, knowledge and abilities to qualify 
increased numbers of minorities and women for occupational series and 
grade levels where they are significantly underrepresented.
    (9) Identification of problems for which the assistance of the 
Office of Personnel Management is needed and will be requested.
    (f) Equal opportunity recruitment program plans must be consistent 
with agency Upward Mobility program plans and should be developed with 
full consideration of the agency's overall recruiting and staffing 
planning objectives.
    (g) All plans required under this subpart must be developed not 
later than October 1, 1979.

<R05>
Sec. 720.206  Selection guidelines.

    This subpart sets forth requirements for a recruitment program, not 
a selection program. Nevertheless, agencies are advised that all 
selection processes including job qualifications, personnel procedures 
and criteria must be consistent with the Uniform Guidelines on Employee 
Selection Procedures (43 FR 38290; August 25, 1978).


<R05>
Sec. 720.207  Reports.

    (a) Not later than November 1 of each year, agencies must submit an 
annual report on their equal opportunity recruitment program to the 
Office of Personnel Management, in a form prescribed by the Office. The 
Office may require submission of any additional

[[Page 10]]

reports it considers necessary in carrying out its responsibilities 
under this subpart.
    (b) The Office will report to Congress on the implementation and 
operation of the program on a Governmentwide basis not later than 
January 31 of each year, as required by law. Such reports will include 
assessments of agencies progress, or lack of progress, in meeting the 
objectives of the program.

to the program.
    (c) Problem Analysis. (1) Annually, OPM will provide appropriate 
data on the employment of disabled veterans to each agency participating 
in the Central Personnel Data File (CPDF). These data will be taken from 
CPDF. For DVAAP purposes, CPDF data are considered to be the official 
record of the status of disabled veteran employment within each 
participating agency. Each participating agency is responsible for 
assuring that such records are timely, accurate, and complete.
    (2) CPDF data must be analyzed by participating agencies to identify 
problem areas and deficiencies in the employment and advancement of 
disabled veterans. (OPM will establish with each agency not 
participating in CPDF, the nature and extent of data to be used in 
identifying problems and deficiencies.) Based on this analysis, agencies 
shall develop methods to improve the recruitment, hiring, placement, and 
advancement of disabled veterans, or revise or redirect existing 
methods, as necessary. These methods must then be translated into action 
items.


<R05>
Sec. 720.304  Agency plan.

   Appendix to Part 720--Guidelines for the Development of a Federal 
 Recruitment Program To Implement 5 U.S.C. Section 7201, as Amended \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ This section originally was section 701(b) (2nd Proviso) of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub. L. 88-352, July 2, 1964), codified as 5 
U.S.C. 7151. Section 7151 was further amended by section 310 of the 
Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. This Act also redesignated section 
7151 as section 7201, effective January 11, 1979. (Sec. 703(a)(1) of the 
Act.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I. Background Information. A. In 1964 the Congress adopted a basic 
anti-discrimination policy for Federal employment, stating:

    It is the policy of the United States to insure equal employment 
opportunities for employees without discrimination because of race, 
color, religion, sex or national origin. [5 U.S.C. 7151] \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Ibid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In 1978, Congress reaffirmed and amended this policy as part of the 
Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 [Sec. 310 of Pub. L. 95-454], requiring 
immediate development of a recruitment program designed to eliminate 
underrepresentation of minority groups in specific Federal job 
categories. Section 310 directs the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission:
    1. To establish Guidelines proposed to be used for a program 
designed to eliminate such underrepresentation;
    2. To make, in consultation with OPM, initial determinations of 
underrepresentation which are proposed to be used in this program; and
    3. To transmit the determinations made under (2) above to the 
Executive Agencies, the Office of Personnel Management and the Congress, 
within 60 days of enactment.
    The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \3\ is directed by this 
amendment:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ This Office was created by Reorganization Plan No. 2, issued 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 901 et seq. It will assume personnel management 
functions of the present Office of Personnel Management on January 1, 
1979.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. To issue regulations to implement a program under EEOC Guidelines 
within 180 days after enactment, which shall provide that Executive 
agencies conduct continuing recruitment programs to carry out the anti-
discrimination policy in a manner designed

[[Page 13]]

to eliminate underrepresentation in identified categories of civil 
service;
    2. To provide continuing assistance to Federal agencies in carrying 
out such programs;
    3. To conduct a continuing program of evaluation and oversight to 
determine the effectiveness of such programs;
    4. To establish occupational, professional and other groupings 
within which appropriate recruitment will occur, based upon the 
determinations of underrepresentation pursuant to these Guidelines; and
    5. To report annually to the Congress on this program, not later 
than January 31 of each year.
    Congress further directed that the recruitment program must be 
administered consistent with provisions of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 
1978.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Conference Report on Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, No. 95-
1272, p. 145.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    B. In framing these Guidelines and making its initial determinations 
of underrepresentation, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
(Commission) is acting pursuant to its obligations and authority under 5 
U.S.C. 7201, as amended; Section 717 of title VII of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964, as amended; Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978 (issued 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 901 et seq.) and Executive Order 12067, issued 
under this Plan (43 FR 28967, June 30, 1978). This Commission must 
develop and/or ensure the development of uniform, coherent and effective 
standards for administration and enforcement of all Federal anti-
discrimination and equal employment opportunity laws, policies and 
programs, and to ensure the elimination of duplication and inconsistency 
in such programs.
    C. A review of the legislative history of Federal equal employment 
opportunity policy provides further guidance on the scope and nature of 
determinations and guidelines to be issued for this program.
    The basic policy statement on Federal equal employment policy 
enacted by the Congress in 1964 (5 U.S.C. 7151, redesignated as section 
7201) gave the President authority for implementation. Executive Order 
11246 (1966), expanded and superseded by Executive Order 11478 (1969) 
with respect to Federal employment, required Federal agencies to develop 
affirmative action programs designed to eliminate discrimination and 
assure equal employment opportunity.
    In 1972, Congress found that serious discrimination persisted in 
Federal employment. It found that minorities and women were 
significantly absent at higher levels in Federal employment, and 
severely underrepresented in some Federal agencies and in some 
geographic areas where they constituted significant proportions of the 
population. After a detailed review of Federal employment practices and 
statistics, the Congress concluded that:
    The disproportionate distribution of minorities and women throughout 
the Federal bureaucracy and their exclusion from higher level policy-
making and supervisory positions indicates the government's failure to 
pursue its policy of equal employment opportunity.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Legislative History of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 
1972, p. 83. See pp. 82-86 and 421-425 for Congressional Findings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Congress found that this exclusion resulted from overt and 
``systemic'' discriminatory practices.
    These findings, among others, led Congress to extend title VII 
coverage to Federal employment in Section 717 of the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Act of 1972.
    The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 clearly states, for the first 
time, that ``it is the policy of the United States * * * to provide * * 
* a Federal workforce reflective of the Nation's diversity * * *'' \6\ 
The Act establishes in law as the first merit principle that recruitment 
should be designed to achieve a Federal workforce from ``all segments of 
society.'' Among the personnel practices prohibited by the Act is 
discrimination prohibited under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, as amended.\7\ Therefore, the Civil Service Reform Act and its 
directive for a special recruitment program clearly unite requirements 
for basic Federal personnel policy with requirements for Federal equal 
employment policy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It is clear from the legislative history of Federal equal employment 
policy that the legal standards of title VII must be applied to Federal 
employment. Thus, guidelines for a recruitment program designed to 
eliminate underrepresentation in Federal agency employment must be 
developed consistent with the framework of affirmative action programs.
    D. Guided by the review of the legislative history, and the 
responsibilities and authorities cited in I(B) of this appendix, the 
Commission is issuing these Guidelines to provide a framework for 
development of recruitment program regulations by OPM. The Commission 
may later provide more detailed guidance, through consultation with OPM, 
designed to achieve an overall Federal equal employment program which is 
consistent with, and which effectively implements title VII 
requirements.
    II. Initial Determinations of Underrepresentation. A. Pursuant to 
Section 7201, underrepresentation exists when the percentages of 
minority and female Federal employees in

[[Page 14]]

specific grades are less than their percentages in the civilian labor 
force. ``Minority'' refers only to those groups classified as 
``minority'' for the purpose of data collection by the Commission and 
OPM in furtherance of Federal equal employment opportunity policies. The 
civilian labor force includes all persons 16 years of age and over 
except the armed forces, who are employed or seeking employment. Such a 
determination of underrepresentation is designated in these Guidelines 
as ``below the Section 7201 level''.
    B. The Commission has examined existing data on Federal employment 
and the civilian labor force and has made initial determinations of 
underrepresentation of groups by race, national origin and sex in 
specific grades of the major Federal pay systems, under the legal 
authorities cited in I(B), of this appendix.
    C. The Table which follows shows the grades at which the percentage 
of each group in the Federal workforce falls below its percentage in the 
civilian labor force. The table covers four major Federal pay systems 
which account for more than 95 percent of Federal employees, excluding 
the Postal Service.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ The initial determinations are based on data for only those 
agencies covered by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. The Commission 
will make subsequent determinations on other agencies covered by title 
VII, e.g. the U.S. Postal Service, TVA, Central Intelligence Agency, 
Federal Reserve Board.

Sources: Civilian Labor Force information based on data from the Current Population Survey, Bureau of Labor
  Statistics, Employment and Earnings, Vol. 25, No. 1, January 1978.
Information on grades below 7201 level based on Office of Personnel Management data from Equal Employment
  Opportunity Statistics, November 20, 1977 (publication in process).

    D. The initial determinations of underrepresentation were based upon 
average 1977 labor force data from the Current Population Survey 
published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Employment and Earnings, 
January 1978), and 1977 Federal workforce statistics from Equal 
Employment Opportunity Statistics (publication in process).
    The labor force figures are published annually; the Federal 
employment statistics semiannually. These measures, and any 
modifications agreed upon by the Commission and OPM, will be updated 
annually.
    Regional and area Federal employment statistics are available from 
the Office of Personnel Management. The latest reliable local labor 
force data by race, national origin, and sex is from the 1970 Census. 
The Commission and OPM will consult on appropriate labor force measures 
to be used for local analyses.
    E. These initial determinations are based upon a preliminary 
analysis of the data, and may be further refined by the Commission, in 
consultation with OPM, to include geographic and occupational 
underrepresentation. It is further recognized that for the purpose of 
developing regulations, the OPM, in consultation with the Commission, 
will undertake more specific analyses of data use and applicability 
necessary to develop programs for the Federal agencies pursuant to 
Section 7201(a)(2)(C). The OPM may establish criteria for grouping 
agencies, for treating

[[Page 15]]

agency components separately and for grouping grades and pay systems. In 
addition, OPM may study other available data sources and use other 
techniques to assure statistically significant findings of 
underrepresentation. Based upon these studies, OPM may make 
recommendations to the Commission for future determinations of 
underrepresentation.
    III. Procedures for Developing Recruitment Programs. A. The program 
developed and implemented by OPM under Section 7201 should be designed 
to result in applicant pools with sufficient qualified members of 
underrepresented groups. Where the supply of such groups initially 
appears to be low for specific occupational, professional and other 
groupings, the program should be designed so that recruitment efforts 
stimulate interest of underrepresented groups in those occupations where 
there are realistic projections of Federal employment opportunities.
    B. In establishing groupings for determining underrepresentation, 
OPM should utilize broad occupational categories to the extent possible.
    C. The Commission recognizes that OPM's regulations should allow 
flexibility in development and design of each Federal agency's 
recruitment program. However, all statistical comparisons must be 
computed in a manner consistent with the method utilized in II C of this 
appendix.
    The Commission recommends that each agency program meet several 
minimum requirements. The program should be based on a determination of 
underrepresentation in the agency's total workforce, in appropriate 
geographic components; by grade; by broad occupational, professional and 
other groupings in comparison to the national civilian labor force, 
according to the criteria developed by OPM under these guidelines.
    Where an agency or major component thereof (such as Headquarters and 
Regional Offices) is located in a geographic area where the percentage 
of underrepresented groups in the area civilian labor force is higher 
than their percentage in the national labor force, the agency or 
appropriate component should conduct its recruitment program for that 
component on the basis of the higher level of representation in the 
relevant civilian labor force.
    Where an agency or major component thereof is located in a 
geographic area where participation of a particular underrepresented 
group in the area labor force is significantly lower than their 
participation in the national labor force, such agency or component may, 
in consultation with OPM, utilize the lower applicable civilian labor 
force percentage in determining underrepresentation for the component. 
In no event, however, may the agency utilize a figure lower than the 
regional or nationwide Section 7201 level for positions where 
recruitment on a regional or nationwide basis is feasible. Factors such 
as size of the agency or unit, nature of jobs and their wage or pay 
scale may be considered to set goals and to justify a recruitment 
program focused on various job categories.
    IV. Scope of Actions Covered by This Program. A. ``Recruitment'' 
under this program is defined as the total process by which the Federal 
Government and the Federal agencies locate, identify and assist in the 
employment of qualified or qualifiable applicants from underrepresented 
groups for job openings in grades and in occupational categories where 
underrepresentation has been determined. This process should include 
innovative internal, as well as targeted external, recruitment actions.
    B. Prior to developing regulations, the Office should review data on 
personnel actions and other information, to identify those job 
categories for which internal recruitment and external recruitment is 
most appropriate and feasible, and to provide guidance to the Federal 
agencies for targeting their recruitment programs, based on this 
information. OPM should advise all agencies that all job qualifications, 
personnel procedures and criteria must be consistent with the Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (43 FR 38290 August 25, 
1978) OPM should consider the following in providing guidance to 
agencies:
    1. External Recruitment Programs. a. Such programs should focus on 
grade levels and/or job categories where underrepresentation has been 
identified and where external recruitment realistically will result in 
hiring opportunities.
    Recruitment programs also should include a review of job functions 
to determine those jobs that may be better performed by persons who are 
bicultural and who have bilingual capabilities, and those jobs that can 
be performed by persons not fluent in English.
    b. Where eligibility lists are used for filling jobs, it is 
recommended that the regulations require, an analysis by race, national 
origin and sex, to determine whether the list contains sufficient 
candidates from groups underrepresented in those jobs. OPM should 
require that where the list does not have such representation, expanded 
recruitment procedures be designed to assure that members of 
underrepresented groups qualified to perform the job(s) are included in 
the pool of applicants from which the selecting official makes the 
selection. Such expanded recruitment procedures may include additional 
external recruitment or various actions (such as described in 2. below) 
to reach members of these groups within the Federal workforce who are 
qualified or qualifiable for these jobs.
    2. Internal Recruitment Programs. a. Internal recruitment programs 
should be designed by agencies to identify currently qualified or

[[Page 16]]

qualifiable persons for job categories and series where 
underrepresentation prevails, according to the national determinations 
and the determinations made by each agency under these guidelines.
    b. Further, OPM should work with Federal agencies to develop 
effective mechanisms for providing information on Federal job 
opportunities, targeted to reach Federal employees from underrepresented 
groups in all agencies in order to broaden the applicant pool.
    V. Consistency with Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978. A. The Office 
shall develop regulations and implement this program in consultation 
with the Commission and with other affected agencies in such manner that 
their recruitment programs may be incorporated as a consistent and 
effective element of the agencies' national and regional equal 
employment opportunity plans. Each agency is required to implement such 
plans under the direction and guidance of the Commission in accordance 
with Section 717 of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as 
amended, and Executive Order 12067.
    B. Procedures shall be established by OPM and the Commission to 
assure appropriate consultation in development of the regulations.
    C. Pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 1 and to Executive Order 
12067 issued thereunder, the Commission will establish procedures to 
provide appropriate consultation and review of the program on a 
continuing basis, to maximize its effectiveness and eliminate any 
duplication, conflict or inconsistency in requirements for equal 
opportunity programs in the Federal agencies.
    D. In preparing its annual report to the Congress pursuant to the 
Act, OPM should do so in consultation with the Commission.

Sec. 723.130  General prohibitions against discrimination.

    (a) No qualified individual with handicaps shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, 
or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or 
activity conducted by the agency.
    (b)(1) The agency, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may 
not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, 
on the basis of handicap--
    (i) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;
    (ii) Afford a qualified individual with handicaps an opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not 
equal to that afforded others;
    (iii) Provide a qualified individual with handicaps with an aid, 
benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal 
opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to 
reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;
    (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to 
individuals with handicaps or to any class of individuals with handicaps 
than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide 
qualified individuals with handicaps with aid, benefits, or services 
that are as effective as those provided to others;
    (v) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to 
participate as a member of planning or advisory boards;

[[Page 19]]

    (vi) Otherwise limit a qualified individual with handicaps in the 
enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by 
others receiving the aid, benefit, or service.
    (2) The agency may not deny a qualified individual with handicaps 
the opportunity to participate in programs or activities that are not 
separate or different, despite the existence of permissibly separate or 
different programs or activities.
    (3) The agency may not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose 
or effect of which would--
    (i) Subject qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination

    (6) The agency may not administer a licensing or certification 
program in a manner that subjects qualified individuals with handicaps 
to discrimination on the basis of handicap, nor may the agency establish 
requirements for the programs or activities of licensees or certified 
entities that subject qualified individuals with handicaps to 
discrimination on the basis of handicap. However, the programs or 
activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the agency are 
not, themselves, covered by this regulation.
    (c) The exclusion of nonhandicapped persons from the benefits of a 
program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to individuals 
with handicaps or the exclusion of a specific class of individuals with 
handicaps from a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order 
to a different class of individuals with handicaps is not prohibited by 
this regulation.
    (d) The agency shall administer programs and activities in the most 
integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals 
with handicaps.

Sec. Sec. 723.131-723.139  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 723.140  Employment.

    No qualified individual with handicaps shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be subject to discrimination in employment under any program 
or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and 
procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 
791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 
29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 723.141-723.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 723.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 723.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 723.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant

[[Page 20]]

historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 723.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 723.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals 
with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic 
property is not required because of Sec. 723.150(a) (2) or (3), 
alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;

[[Page 21]]

    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 723.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 723.152-723.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 723.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 723.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and 
services of the program or activity.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 723.161-723.169  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 723.170  Compliance procedures.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this 
section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of 
handicap in programs and activities conducted by the agency.
    (b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations of 
section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity

[[Page 22]]

Commission in 29 CFR part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791).
    (c) The Assistant Director for Personnel and EEO shall be 
responsible for coordinating implementation of this section. Complaints 
may be sent to the Assistant Director for Personnel and EEO, Office of 
Personnel Management, Room 1479, 1900 E St., NW., Washington, DC 20415.
    (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints 
for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed 
within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may 
extend this time period for good cause.
    (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have 
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to 
and usable by individuals with handicaps.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which 
it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the investigation in a letter containing--
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and
    (3) A notice of the right to appeal.
    (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or 
remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from 
the agency of the letter required by Sec. 723.170(g). The agency may 
extend this time for good cause.
    (i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the head of 
the agency.
    (j) The head of the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If 
the head of the agency determines that additional information is needed 
from the complainant, he or she shall have 60 days from the date of 
receipt of the additional information to make his or her determination 
on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
    (l) The agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint 
investigations to other Federal agencies, except that the authority for 
making the final determination may not be delegated to another agency.

2302(d).


<R05>
Sec. 724.202  Notice obligations.

                            Model Paragraphs

                           No Fear Act Notice

    On May 15, 2002, Congress enacted the ``Notification and Federal 
Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002,'' which is now 
known as the No FEAR Act.

[[Page 25]]

One purpose of the Act is to ``require that Federal agencies be 
accountable for violations of antidiscrimination and whistleblower 
protection laws.'' Public Law 107-174, Summary. In support of this 
purpose, Congress found that ``agencies cannot be run effectively if 
those agencies practice or tolerate discrimination.'' Public Law 107-
174, Title I, General Provisions, section 101(1).
    The Act also requires this agency to provide this notice to Federal 
employees, former Federal employees and applicants for Federal 
employment to inform you of the rights and protections available to you 
under Federal antidiscrimination and whistleblower protection laws.

                         Antidiscrimination Laws

    A Federal agency cannot discriminate against an employee or 
applicant with respect to the terms, conditions or privileges of 
employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, 
age, disability, marital status or political affiliation. Discrimination 
on these bases is prohibited by one or more of the following statutes: 5 
U.S.C. 2302(b)(1), 29 U.S.C. 206(d), 29 U.S.C. 631, 29 U.S.C. 633a, 29 
U.S.C. 791 and 42 U.S.C. 2000e-16.
    If you believe that you have been the victim of unlawful 
discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national 
origin or disability, you must contact an Equal Employment Opportunity 
(EEO) counselor within 45 calendar days of the alleged discriminatory 
action, or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 calendar days 
of the effective date of the action, before you can file a formal 
complaint of discrimination with your agency. See, e.g. 29 CFR 1614. If 
you believe that you have been the victim of unlawful discrimination on 
the basis of age, you must either contact an EEO counselor as noted 
above or give notice of intent to sue to the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within 180 calendar days of the alleged 
discriminatory action. If you are alleging discrimination based on 
marital status or political affiliation, you may file a written 
complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) (see contact 
information below). In the alternative (or in some cases, in addition), 
you may pursue a discrimination complaint by filing a grievance through 
your agency's administrative or negotiated grievance procedures, if such 
procedures apply and are available.

                      Whistleblower Protection Laws

    A Federal employee with authority to take, direct others to take, 
recommend or approve any personnel action must not use that authority to 
take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel 
action against an employee or applicant because of disclosure of 
information by that individual that is reasonably believed to evidence 
violations of law, rule or regulation; gross mismanagement; gross waste 
of funds; an abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific danger to 
public health or safety, unless disclosure of such information is 
specifically prohibited by law and such information is specifically 
required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of 
national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.
    Retaliation against an employee or applicant for making a protected 
disclosure is prohibited by 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8). If you believe that you 
have been the victim of whistleblower retaliation, you may file a 
written complaint (Form OSC-11) with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel 
at 1730 M Street NW., Suite 218, Washington, DC 20036-4505 or online 
through the OSC Web site--http://www.osc.gov.

             Retaliation for Engaging in Protected Activity

    A Federal agency cannot retaliate against an employee or applicant 
because that individual exercises his or her rights under any of the 
Federal antidiscrimination or whistleblower protection laws listed 
above. If you believe that you are the victim of retaliation for 
engaging in protected activity, you must follow, as appropriate, the 
procedures described in the Antidiscrimination Laws and Whistleblower 
Protection Laws sections or, if applicable, the administrative or 
negotiated grievance procedures in order to pursue any legal remedy.

                          Disciplinary Actions

    Under the existing laws, each agency retains the right, where 
appropriate, to discipline a Federal employee for conduct that is 
inconsistent with Federal Antidiscrimination and Whistleblower 
Protection Laws up to and including removal. If OSC has initiated an 
investigation under 5 U.S.C. 1214, however, according to 5 U.S.C. 
1214(f), agencies must seek approval from the Special Counsel to 
discipline employees for, among other activities, engaging in prohibited 
retaliation. Nothing in the No FEAR Act alters existing laws or permits 
an agency to take unfounded disciplinary action against a Federal 
employee or to violate the procedural rights of a Federal employee who 
has been accused of discrimination

                         Additional Information

    For further information regarding the No FEAR Act regulations, refer 
to 5 CFR part 724, as well as the appropriate offices within your agency 
(e.g., EEO/civil rights office, human resources office or legal office). 
Additional information regarding Federal antidiscrimination, 
whistleblower protection and retaliation laws can be found at the EEOC

[[Page 26]]

Web site--http://www.eeoc.gov and the OSC Web site--http://www.osc.gov.

                        Existing Rights Unchanged

    Pursuant to section 205 of the No FEAR Act, neither the Act nor this 
notice creates, expands or reduces any rights otherwise available to any 
employee, former employee or applicant under the laws of the United 
States, including the provisions of law specified in 5 U.S.C. 2302(d).

employees (including supervisors and managers) about the rights and 
remedies available under the Antidiscrimination Laws and Whistleblower 
Protection Laws applicable to them.
    (b) Each agency shall have the discretion to develop the 
instructional materials and method of its training plan. Each agency 
training plan shall describe:
    (1) The instructional materials and method of the training,
    (2) The training schedule, and
    (3) The means of documenting completion of training.
    (c) Each agency may contact EEOC and/or OSC for information and/or 
assistance regarding the agency's training program. Neither agency,

new employees as part of its agency orientation program or other 
training program. Any agency that does not use a new employee 
orientation program for this purpose must train new employees within 90 
calendar days of the new employees' appointment.

<R04>
                             Subpart A_Scope


<R05>
Sec. 731.101  Purpose.

    (a) The purpose of this part is to establish criteria and procedures 
for making determinations of suitability for employment in positions in 
the competitive service and for career appointment in the Senior 
Executive Service (hereinafter in this part, ``competitive service'') 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3301 and Executive Order 10577 (3 CFR, 1954-1958 
Comp., p. 218). Section 3301 of title 5, United States Code, directs 
consideration of ``age, health, character, knowledge, and ability for 
the employment sought.'' Executive Order 10577 directs OPM to examine 
``suitability'' for competitive Federal employment. This part concerns 
only determinations of ``suitability'' based on an individual's 
character or conduct

[[Page 30]]

that may have an impact on the integrity or efficiency of the service. 
Determinations made under this part are distinct from determinations of 
eligibility for assignment to, or retention in, sensitive national 
security positions made under Executive Order 10450 (3 CFR, 1949-1953 
Comp., p. 936), Executive Order 12968, or similar authorities.
    (b) Definitions. In this part:
    Applicant. A person being considered for employment.
    Appointee. A person who has entered on duty and is in the first year 
of a subject to investigation appointment (as defined in Sec. 731.104).
    Employee. A person who has completed the first year of a subject to 
investigation appointment.
    Material. A ``material'' statement is one that is capable of 
influencing, or has a natural tendency to affect, an official decision.


<R05>
Sec. 731.102  Implementation.

    (a) An investigation conducted for the purpose of determining 
suitability under this part may not be used for any other purpose except 
as provided in a Privacy Act system of records notice published by the 
agency conducting the investigation.
    (b) Under OMB Circular No. A-130 Revised, issued February 8, 1996, 
the Director of OPM is to establish policies for Federal personnel 
associated with the design, operation, or use of Federal automated 
information systems. Agencies are to implement and maintain a program to 
ensure that adequate protection is provided for all automated 
information systems. Agency programs should be consistent with 
government-wide policies and procedures issued by OPM. The Computer 
Security Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-235) provides additional 
requirements for Federal automated information systems.
    (c) Policies, procedures, criteria, and guidance for the 
implementation of this part shall be set forth in OPM issuances. OPM may 
revoke an agency's delegation to adjudicate suitability under this part 
if an agency fails to conform to OPM issuances.


<R05>
Sec. 731.103  Delegation to agencies.

    (a) OPM delegates to the heads of agencies limited authority for 
adjudicating suitability in cases involving applicants for and 
appointees to competitive service positions in the agency (including 
limited, agency-specific debarment authority under Sec. 731.205). OPM 
retains jurisdiction in all competitive service cases involving evidence 
of material, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in 
examination or appointment. Agencies must refer these cases to OPM for 
adjudication, or contact OPM for prior approval if the agency wants to 
take action under its own authority (5 CFR part 315 or 5 CFR part 752). 
Also, this delegation does not include cases involving refusal to 
furnish testimony as required by Sec. 5.4 of this chapter, title, or 
pass over requests involving preference eligibles who are 30 percent or 
more compensably disabled which must be referred to OPM for 
adjudication, as provided under Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Public 
Law 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 et seq. (Codified as amended in scattered 
sections of 5 U.S.C.)
    (b) Any adjudication by an agency acting under delegated authority 
from OPM which indicates that an extended general, across agency lines, 
debarment by OPM under Sec. 731.204(a) may be an appropriate action 
should be referred to OPM for debarment consideration if not favorably 
adjudicated by the agency. Referral should be made prior to any proposed 
action, but after sufficient resolution of the suitability issue(s) 
through subject contact or investigation to determine if an extended 
general debarment period appears warranted.
    (c) Agencies exercising authority under this part by delegation from 
OPM must show by policies and records that reasonable methods are used 
to ensure adherence to regulations, standards, and quality control 
procedures established by OPM.
    (d) Before making any applicant suitability determination, the 
agency should first ensure the applicant is eligible for the position, 
among the best qualified, and/or within reach of selection. Because 
suitability issues may not be disclosed until late in the application/ 
appointment process, only the best qualified should require a 
suitability determination, with appropriate procedures followed and 
appeal

[[Page 31]]

rights provided, if suitability issues would form the only basis for 
elimination from further consideration.
    (e) When an agency, exercising authority under this part by 
delegation from OPM, makes an adjudicative decision under this part, or 
changes a tentative favorable placement decision to an unfavorable 
decision, based on an OPM report of investigation or upon an 
investigation conducted pursuant to OPM-delegated authority, the agency 
should:
    (1) Ensure that the records used in making the decision are 
accurate, relevant, timely, and complete to the extent reasonably 
necessary to ensure fairness to the individual in any determination;
    (2) Ensure that all applicable administrative procedural 
requirements provided by law, the regulations in this part, and OPM 
policy guidance have been observed;
    (3) Consider all available information in reaching its final 
decision, except information furnished by a non-corroborated 
confidential source. Information furnished by a non-corroborated 
confidential source can only be used for limited purposes, such as lead 
information or in interrogatories to a subject if the identity of the 
source is not compromised in any way; and
    (4) Keep any record of the agency action as required by OPM in its 
supplemental guidance.
    (f) Paragraph (a) of this section notwithstanding, OPM may exercise 
its jurisdiction under this part in any case when it, in its discretion, 
deems necessary.
    (g) Any applicant or appointee who is found unsuitable by any agency 
acting under delegated authority from OPM under this part may appeal the 
adverse suitability decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board under 
the Board's regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 731.104  Appointments subject to investigation.

    (a) To establish a person's suitability for employment, appointments 
to positions in the competitive service require the person to undergo an 
investigation by OPM or by an agency with delegated authority from OPM 
to conduct investigations. Certain appointments do not require 
investigation. Except when required because of risk level changes, a 
person in the competitive service who has undergone a suitability 
investigation need not undergo another one simply because the person has 
been:
    (1) Promoted;
    (2) Demoted;
    (3) Reassigned;
    (4) Converted from career-conditional to career tenure;
    (5) Appointed or converted to an appointment if the person has been 
serving continuously with the agency for at least 1 year in one or more 
positions under an appointment subject to investigation; and
    (6) Transferred, provided the individual has served continuously for 
at least 1 year in a position subject to investigation.
    (b)(1) OPM or an agency with delegated suitability authority may 
investigate and take a suitability action against an applicant, 
appointee, or employee in accordance with Sec. 731.105. There is no 
time limit on the authority of OPM or an agency with delegated 
suitability authority to conduct an investigation of an applicant who 
has been appointed to a position.
    (2) An employee does not have to serve a new probationary or trial 
period merely because his or her appointment is subject to investigation 
under this section. An employee's probationary or trial period is not 
extended because his or her appointment is subject to investigation 
under this section.
    (3) The subject to investigation condition also does not eliminate 
the need to conduct investigations required under Sec. 731.106 for 
public trust positions.


<R05>
Sec. 731.105  Authority to take suitability actions.

    (a) OPM may take a suitability action under this part against an 
applicant or appointee based on any of the criteria of Sec. 731.202;
    (b) An agency, exercising delegated authority, may take a 
suitability action under this part against an applicant or appointee 
based on the criteria of Sec. 731.202 subject to the agency limitations 
prescribed in Sec. 731.103;

[[Page 32]]

    (c) OPM may take a suitability action under this part against an 
employee only in cases involving material, intentional false statement 
or deception or fraud in examination or appointment, or refusal to 
furnish testimony as required by Sec. 5.4 of this title, or statutory 
or regulatory bar. A statement may be a material statement even if an 
agency does not rely upon it.
    (d) An agency may not take a suitability action against an employee 
under this part. Nothing in this part precludes, or is intended to 
preclude, an agency from taking an adverse action against an employee 
under the procedures and standards of part 752 of this title or 
terminating a probationary employee under the procedures of part 315 of 
this title.


<R05>
Sec. 731.106  Designation of public trust positions and investigative requirements.

    (a) Risk designation. Agency heads shall designate every competitive 
service position within the agency at a high, moderate, or low risk 
level as determined by the position's potential for adverse impact to 
the efficiency and integrity of the service. OPM will provide an example 
of a risk designation system for agency use in supplemental guidance.
    (b) Public Trust positions. Positions at the high or moderate risk 
levels would normally be designated as ``Public Trust'' positions. Such 
positions may involve policy making, major program responsibility, 
public safety and health, law enforcement duties, fiduciary 
responsibilities, or other duties demanding a significant degree of 
public trust; and positions involving access to or operation or control 
of financial records, with a significant risk for causing damage or 
realizing personal gain.
    (c) Investigative requirements. Persons receiving an appointment 
made subject to investigation under this part must undergo a background 
investigation. Minimum investigative requirements correlating to risk 
levels will be established in supplemental guidance provided by OPM. 
Investigations should be initiated before appointment or, at most, 
within 14 calendar days of placement in the position.
    (d) Suitability reinvestigations. Agencies, relying on authorities 
such as the Computer Security Act of 1987 and OMB Circular No. A-130 
Revised (issued February 8, 1996), may require incumbents of certain 
public trust positions to undergo periodic reinvestigations. The 
appropriate level of any reinvestigation will be determined by the 
agency, but may be based on supplemental guidance provided by OPM.
    (e) Risk level changes. If an individual experiences a change in 
position risk level (moves to a higher risk level position, or the risk 
level of the position itself is changed) the individual may encumber or 
remain in the position. Any upgrade investigation required for the new 
risk level should be initiated within 14 calendar days after the move or 
the new designation is final.
    (f) Any suitability investigation completed by an agency under 
provisions of paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section must be adjudicated 
by the employing agency. The subject's employment status will determine 
the applicable agency authority and procedures to be followed in any 
action taken.


<R04>
                  Subpart B_Suitability Determinations


<R05>
Sec. 731.201  Standard.

    Subject to subpart A of this part, an applicant, appointee, or 
employee may be denied Federal employment or removed from a position 
only when the action will protect the integrity or promote the 
efficiency of the service.


<R05>
Sec. 731.202  Criteria.

    (a) General. In determining whether its action will protect the 
integrity or promote the efficiency of the service, OPM, or an agency to 
which OPM has delegated authority, shall make its determination on the 
basis of the specific factors in paragraph (b) of this section, with

    (2) Accept and receive political contributions in a partisan 
election described in 5 CFR part 733;
    (3) Solicit, accept, or receive uncompensated volunteer services

    (4) Solicit, accept, or receive political contributions, as long as:
    (i) The person who is solicited for a political contribution belongs

contribution;
    (ii) The person who is solicited for a political contribution is not

    (d) An employee who is covered under this subpart and is a payroll 
official in an agency where employees are permitted to make allotments 
to political action committees may process the completed direct deposit 
forms for voluntary allotments which have been made to such committees 
under section 550.311(b) of this title.

    Example 1: An GS-12 employee of the Department of Treasury who 
belongs to the same Federal employee organization as a GS-5 employee of 
the Department of Treasury may solicit a contribution for the 
multicandidate political committee when she is not on duty as long as 
the GS-5 employee is not under the supervisory authority of the GS-12 
employee.
    Example 2: An employee of the National Park Service may give a 
speech or keynote address at a political fundraiser when he is not on 
duty, as long as the employee does not solicit political contributions, 
as prohibited in Sec. 734.303(b) of this part.
    Example 3: An employee's name may appear on an invitation to a 
political fundraiser as a guest speaker as long as the reference in no 
way suggests that the employee solicits or encourages contributions, as 
prohibited in Sec. 734.303 of this part and described in example 2 
thereunder. However, the employee's official title may not appear on 
invitations to any political fundraiser, except that an employee who is 
ordinarily addressed using a general term of address, such as ``The 
Honorable,'' may use or permit the use of that term of address for such 
purposes.
    Example 4: When an employee of the Department of Transportation is 
not on duty, he or she may engage in activities which do not require 
personal solicitations of contributions, such as organizing mail or 
phone solicitations for political contributions. Activities such as 
stuffing envelopes with requests for political contributions also are 
permitted. However, he or she may not sign the solicitation letter 
unless the solicitation is for the contribution of uncompensated 
volunteer services of individuals who are not subordinate employees. An 
employee may not knowingly send to his or her subordinate employees a 
letter soliciting the contribution of their uncompensated services. 
However, he or she may sign a letter that solicits contributions of 
uncompensated volunteer services as part of a general mass mailing that 
might reach a subordinate employee, as long as the mass mailing is not 
specifically

[[Page 49]]

targeted to his or her subordinate employees.
    Example 5: An employee who is not on duty may participate in a phone 
bank soliciting the uncompensated services of individuals. However, an 
employee may not make phone solicitations for political contributions 
even anonymously.
    Example 6: An employee of the Department of Agriculture who is on 
official travel and is not in a pay status nor officially representing 
the Department may write invitations in his hotel room to a meet-the-
candidate reception which he plans to hold in his home.
    Example 7: An employee may serve as an officer or chairperson of a 
political fundraising organization or committee as long as he or she 
does not personally solicit, accept, or receive political contributions. 
For example, the employee may organize or manage fundraising activities 
as long as he or she does not violate the above prohibition.
    Example 8: The head of a cabinet-level department may contribute one 
of her worn-out cowboy boots to the campaign committee of a Senatorial 
candidate to be auctioned off in a fundraising raffle for the benefit of 
the candidate's campaign.
    Example 9: An employee may help organize a fundraiser including 
supplying names for the invitation list as long as he or she does not 
personally solicit, accept, or receive contributions.
    Example 10: An employee on travel may engage in political activity 
when he or she is not on duty without taking annual leave.
    Example 11: A Federal employee may solicit, accept, or receive the 
uncompensated volunteer services of any individual, except a subordinate 
employee, to work on behalf of a partisan political candidate or 
organization. However, such solicitation, acceptance, or receipt must 
comply with part 2635 of this title as well as any other directives that 
may apply, e.g., the Federal Property Management Regulations in 41 CFR 
chapter 101. Further, Federal employees are subject to criminal anti-
coercion provisions found at 18 U.S.C. 610.
    Example 12: An employee who desires to make a financial contribution 
to a political action committee through a voluntary allotment personally 
may obtain blank direct deposit forms from his or her payroll office. 
However, he or she may not complete the form while he or she is on duty, 
on Federal property, or in a Federally owned or leased vehicle. 
Moreover, he or she may not personally deliver his or her completed 
form, or the completed form of another employee, to the payroll office. 
However, the employee may mail his or her direct deposit form to his or 
her agency payroll office.
    Example 13: Employees who are permitted to solicit, accept, or 
receive political contributions under the circumstances described in 
Sec. 734.208(b)(4) may not solicit, accept, or receive such 
contributions either while they are on duty, or while they are on 
Federal premises, or both.

  Subpart E_Special Provisions for Certain Presidential Appointees and 
 Employees Paid from the Appropriation for the Executive Office of the

<R05>
Sec. 734.501  Permitted and prohibited activities.

    Except as otherwise specified in this part 734, employees who are 
appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the 
Senate are subject to the provisions of subparts B and C of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 734.502  Participation in political activity while on duty, in uniform,
in any room or building occupied in the discharge of official duties, or using a 

          Federal vehicle.

    (a) This section applies to an employee:

[[Page 56]]

    (1) The duties and responsibilities of whose position continue 
outside normal duty hours and while away from the normal duty post; and
    (2) Who is--
    (i) An employee paid from an appropriation for the Executive Office 
of President; or
    (ii) An employee appointed by the President by and with the advice 
and consent of the Senate whose position is located within the United 
States, who determines policies to be pursued by the United States in 
relations with foreign powers or in the nationwide administration of 
Federal laws;
    (b) For the purposes of this subpart, normal duty hours and normal 
duty post will be determined by the head of each agency or 
instrumentality of the United States or District of Columbia Government.
    (c) An employee described in paragraph (a) of this section may 
participate, subject to any restrictions that may be imposed in 
accordance with Sec. 734.104, in political activities:
    (1) While he or she is on duty;
    (2) While he or she is wearing a uniform, badge, or insignia that 
identifies the agency or instrumentality of the United States Government 
or the position of the employee;
    (3) While he or she is in any room or building occupied in the 
discharge of official duties by an individual employed or holding office 
in the Government of the United States or any agency or instrumentality 
thereof; or
    (4) While using a Government-owned or leased vehicle or while using 
a privately-owned vehicle in the discharge of official duties.
    (d) An employee, to whom subpart E of this part does not apply, who 
is not on duty may participate in political activities in rooms of the 
White House or the Residence of the Vice President which are part of the 
Residence area or which are not regularly used solely in the discharge 
of official duties.

    Example 1: An Inspector General is appointed under the Inspector 
General Act of 1978, as amended. According to section 3(c) of that Act, 
he or she does not qualify as an employee who determines policies to be 
pursued by the United States in the nationwide administration of Federal 
laws. therefore, he or she may not participate in political activities 
while on duty, while wearing a uniform, badge, or insignia that 
identifies his or her office or position, while in any room or building 
occupied in the discharge of official duties, or while using a 
Government-owned or leased vehicle or while using a privately-owned 
vehicle in the discharge of official duties.
    Example 2: An employee who is covered by this subpart and wears a 
uniform as an incident of her office may wear the uniform while she is 
giving a speech at a political fundraiser.
    Example 3: The head of an executive department may hold a partisan 
political meeting or host a reception which is not a fundraiser in his 
conference room during normal business hours.
    Example 4: An employee accompanies the Secretary of Transportation 
to a political party convention as part of the Secretary's security or 
administrative detail. The employee is considered to be on duty while 
protecting or performing official duties for the Secretary regardless of 
the nature of the function that the Secretary is attending.
    Example 5: An American Ambassador overseas obtains authorization 
from the Department of State to depart post in order to take a vacation 
away from post. During the period she is authorized to be on vacation 
away from post, she is not considered to be on duty for the purpose of 
the Hatch Act Reform Amendments and may engage in any political activity 
permitted under the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993.

<R05>
Sec. 734.503  Allocation and reimbursement of costs associated with
political activities.

    (a) The costs associated with the political activities described in 
Sec. 733.502(c) of this chapter may not be paid for by money derived 
from the Treasury of the United States. Costs associated with a 
political activity are deemed not to be paid for by money derived from 
the Treasury of the United States if the Treasury is reimbursed for the 
costs within a reasonable period of time.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, costs associated with a 
political activity do not include any costs that the Government would 
have or have incurred regardless of whether the activity was political. 
Examples of such costs are:
    (1) The compensation of the employee described in Sec. 734.502(a);

[[Page 57]]

    (2) The value of any office or other real property owned or leased 
by the Government;
    (3) The compensation and expenses of any Government employee that is 
required in the performance of his or her duties to accompany or assist 
the person engaging in the political activity; and
    (4) The cost of special security arrangements for the person 
engaging in the political activity, including special transportation 
vehicles or methods.
    (c)(1) An employee covered under this subpart must apportion the 
costs of mixed travel based on the time spent on political activities 
and the time spent performing official duties. Prorating the cost of 
travel involves determining the ``total activity time'' which is the 
amount of time actually spent by the employee in meetings, receptions, 
rallies, and similar activities. Time spent in actual travel, private 
study, or rest and recreation is not included in the computation of the 
``total activity time''. The proration of the cost then is determined 
based on how the ``total activity time'' was spent. The formula is as 
follows:

Time spent in official meetings, receptions, etc. + Time spent in 
    political meetings, receptions, rallies = Total activity time

Time spent in official activity / Total activity time = Percentage of 
    trip that is official
Time spent in political activity / Total activity time = Percentage of 
    trip that is political

The percentage figure that represents the political portion of the trip 
is then multiplied by the amount that would be reimbursed to the 
Government if all of the travel was political. The product of that 
calculation represents the amount to be paid by the political entity or 
organization.

    (2) The allocation method must be applied to all of the relevant 
costs of mixed travel.
    (3) Expenses that are associated specifically with a political 
activity and not with any official activity must be treated as 
political, and expenses associated specifically with an official 
activity and not with any political activity must be treated as 
official.
    (4) In allocating the costs of travel other than air travel, the 
allocation formula should be applied to any Government maximum for that 
type of expenditure.
    (5) The determination of the proper amount of allocation must be 
based on the facts and circumstances involved.
    (6) In the event that a minor, clearly incidental percentage of the 
activity of a mixed trip is devoted to either official or political 
activity, e.g. less than 3%, the entire trip should be treated as if it 
was wholly of the type represented by the substantial figure. The 
balance should be treated as de minimis and need not be reimbursed as 
political or charged as official.
    (d) For any cost of a political activity of an employee that is 
required to be reported to the Federal Election Commission under the 
Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) or the Presidential Election 
Campaign Fund Act (PECFA), the employee shall use the same method of 
allocation as used under the FECA or PECFA and regulations thereunder in 
lieu of the allocation method in paragraph (c) of this section.

    Example 1: The Secretary, an employee described by section 
7324(b)(2) of title 5 of the United States Code, holds a catered 
political activity (other than a fundraiser) in her office. Her security 
detail attends the reception as part of their duty to provide security 
for her. The Secretary will not be in violation of the Hatch Act Reform 
Amendments if the costs of her office, her compensation, and her 
security detail are not reimbursed to the Treasury. A violation of the 
Hatch Act Amendments occurs if Government funds, including reception or 
discretionary funds, are used to cater the political activity, unless 
the Treasury is reimbursed for the cost of the catering within a 
reasonable time.
    Example 2: There should be no allocation between official and 
political funds for a sound system rented for a single event.
    Example 3: If on a mixed trip a Government employee is only entitled 
to $26 per diem for food on a wholly official trip and the trip is 50% 
political and 50% official, the Government share would be 50% of $26, 
not 50% of the actual amount spent.
    Example 4: The President is transported by special motorcade to and 
from the site of the political event. The expense of the motorcade is 
for special security arrangements. Thus, it would not be a violation of 
the Hatch Act Reform Amendments if the costs of the security 
arrangements, including the

[[Page 58]]

cost of the motorcade, are not reimbursed to the Treasury.


<R05>
Sec. 734.504  Contributions to political action committees through voluntary
payroll allotments prohibited.

    An employee described in Sec. 734.502(a) may not financially 
contribute to a political action committee through a voluntary allotment 
made under Sec. 550.311(b) of this title.

Sec. 734.601  Employees who work on an irregular or occasional basis.

    An employee who works on an irregular or occasional basis or is a 
special Government employee as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202(a) is subject to 
the provisions of the applicable subpart of this part when he or she is 
on duty.

    Example: An employee appointed to a special commission or task force 
who does not have a regular tour of duty may run as a partisan political 
candidate, but may actively campaign only when he or she is not on duty.

[45 FR 46778, July 11, 1980, as amended at 53 FR 21623, June 9, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 752.404  Procedures.

    (a) Statutory entitlements. An employee against whom action is 
proposed under this subpart is entitled to the procedures provided in 5 
U.S.C. 7513(b).
    (b) Notice of proposed action. (1) The notice of proposal shall 
inform the employee of his or her right to review the material which is 
relied on to support the reasons for action given in the notice. The 
agency may not use material that cannot be disclosed to the employee of 
his or her representative or designated physician under Sec. 297.204(c) 
of this chapter to support the reasons in the notice.
    (2) When some but not all employees in a given competitive level are 
being furloughed, the notice of proposal shall state the basis for 
selecting a particular employee for furlough, as well as the reasons for 
the furlough.
    (3) Under ordinary circumstances, an employee whose removal or 
suspension, including indefinite suspension, has been proposed shall 
remain in a duty status in his or her regular position during the 
advance notice period. In those rare circumstances where the agency 
determines that the employee's continued presence in the workplace 
during the notice period may pose a threat to the employee or others, 
result in loss of or damage to Government property, or otherwise 
jeopardize legitimate Government interests, the agency may elect one or 
a combination of the following alternatives:
    (i) Assigning the employee to duties where he or she is no longer a 
threat to safety, the agency mission, or to Government property;
    (ii) Allowing the employee to take leave, or carrying him or her in 
an appropriate leave status (annual, sick, leave without pay, or absence 
without leave) if the employee has absented himself or herself from the 
worksite without requesting leave;
    (iii) Curtailing the notice period when the agency can invoke the 
provisions of Sec. 752.404(d)(1) of this part, the ``crime provision.'' 
This provision may be invoked even in the absence of judicial action if 
the agency has reasonable cause to believe that the employee has 
committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed; 
or
    (iv) Placing the employee in a paid, nonduty status for such time as 
is necessary to effect the action.
    (c) Employee's answer. (1) The agency shall give the employee a 
reasonable amount of official time to review the material relied on to 
support its proposal and to prepare an answer and to secure affidavits, 
if he or she is otherwise in an active duty status.
    (2) The agency shall designate an official to hear the employee's 
oral answer who has authority either to make or recommend a final 
decision on the proposed adverse action. The right to answer orally in 
person does not include the right to a formal hearing with examination 
of witnesses unless the agency provides one in its regulations in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (3) If the employee wishes the agency to consider any medical 
condition which may contribute to a conduct, performance, or leave 
problem, the employee shall be given a reasonable time to furnish 
medical documentation (as defined in Sec. 339.102 of this chapter) of 
the condition. Whenever possible, the employee shall supply such 
documentation within the time limits allowed for an answer. After its 
review of the medical documentation supplied by the employee, the agency 
may, if authorized, require a medical examination under the criteria of 
Sec. 339.301(a)(3) and the procedures of Sec. 339.302 of this chapter, 
or otherwise, at its option, offer a medical examination in accordance 
with the criteria of Sec. 339.301(d) and procedures of Sec. 339.302 of 
this chapter. If the employee has the requisite years of service under 
the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement 
System, the agency shall provide information concerning disability 
retirement. The agency shall be aware of the affirmative obligations of 
the provisions of 29 CFR 1613.704, which

[[Page 69]]

require reasonable accommodation of a qualified employee who is 
handicapped.
    (d) Exceptions. (1) Section 7513(b) of title 5 of the United States 
Code authorizes an exception to the 30 days' advance written notice when 
the agency has reasonable cause to believe that the employee has 
committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed 
and is proposing a removal or suspension (including indefinite 
suspension). The agency may require the employee to furnish any answer 
to the proposed action, and affidavits and other documentary evidence in 
support of the answer, within such time as would be reasonable, but not 
less than 7 days. When the circumstances require that the employee be 
kept away from the worksite, the agency may place him or her in a 
nonduty status with pay for such time as is necessary to effect the 
action.
    (2) The advance written notice and opportunity to answer are not 
necessary for furlough without pay due to unforeseeable circumstances, 
such as sudden breakdowns in equipment, acts of God, or sudden 
emergencies requiring immediate curtailment of activities.
    (e) Representation. Section 7513(b)(3) of title 5 of the United 
States Code provides that an employee covered by this part is entitled 
to be represented by an attorney or other representative. An agency may 
disallow as an employee's representative an individual whose activities 
as representative would cause a conflict of interest or position, or an 
employee of the agency whose release from his or official position would 
give rise to unreasonable costs or whose priority work assignments 
preclude his or her release.
    (f) Agency decision. In arriving at its decision, the agency shall 
not consider any reasons for action other than those specified in the 
notice of proposed action. It shall consider any answer of the employee 
and/or his or her representative made to a designated official and any 
medical documentation furnished under paragraph (c) of this section. The 
agency shall deliver the notice of decision to the employee at or before 
the time the action will be effective, and advise the employee of appeal 
rights.
    (g) Hearing. Under 5 U.S.C. 7513(c), the agency may in its 
regulations provide a hearing in place of or in addition to the 
opportunity for written and oral answer.
    (h) Applications for disability retirement. Section 831.501(d) of 
this chapter provides that an employee's application for disability 
retirement shall not preclude or delay any other appropriate personnel 
action. Section 831.1203 of this chapter sets forth the basis under 
which an agency shall file an application for disability retirement on 
behalf of an employee.

employee against whom an action is taken under this subpart is entitled 
to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board.
    (b) Grievance rights. As provided at 5 U.S.C. 7121(e)(1), if a 
matter covered by this subpart falls within the coverage of an 
applicable negotiated grievance procedure, and employee may elect to 
file a grievance under that procedure or appeal to the Merit Systems 
Protection Board under 5 U.S.C. 7701, but not both. 5 U.S.C. 7114(a)(5) 
and 7121(b)(3), and the terms of an applicable collective bargaining 
agreement, govern representation for employees in an exclusive 
bargaining unit who grieve a matter under this subpart through the 
negotiated grievance procedure.

the basis of any reason prohibited by 5 U.S.C. 2302.


<R05>
Sec. 752.604  Procedures.

    (a) Applicability. The procedures provided in 5 U.S.C. 7543(b) apply 
to any appointee covered by this subpart.
    (b) Notice of proposed action. (1) The notice of proposed action 
shall inform the appointee of his or her right to review the material 
that is relied on to support the reasons for action given in the notice.
    (2) The agency may not use material that cannot be disclosed to the 
appointee or to the appointee's representative or designated physician 
under Sec. 297.204(c) of this chapter to support the reasons in the 
notice.
    (3) Under ordinary circumstances, an appointee whose removal has 
been proposed shall remain in a duty status in his or her regular 
position during the advance notice period. In those rare circumstances 
when the agency determines that the appointee's continued presence in 
the work place during the notice period may pose a threat to the 
appointee or others, result in loss of or damage to Government property, 
or otherwise jeopardize legitimate Government interests, the agency 
shall consider whether any of the following alternatives is feasible:
    (i) Assigning the appointee to duties where he or she is no longer a 
threat to safety, the agency mission, or Government property;
    (ii) Placing the appointee on leave with his or her consent;
    (iii) Carrying the appointee on appropriate leave (annual or sick 
leave, leave without pay, or absence without leave) if he or she is 
voluntarily absent for reasons not originating with the agency; or
    (iv) Curtailing the notice period when the agency can invoke the 
provisions of paragraph (d) of this section (the ``crime provision'').
    (4) If none of the alternatives in paragraph (b)(3) of this section,

nonduty status during all or part of the advance notice period.
    (c) Appointee's answer. (1) The agency shall give the appointee a 
reasonable amount of official time to review the material relied on to 
support its proposed action, to prepare an answer orally and in writing, 
and to secure affidavits, if the appointee is in an active duty status.
    (2) The agency shall designate an official to hear the appointee's 
oral answer who has authority either to make or to recommend a final 
decision on the proposed adverse action.
    (3) The right to answer orally in person does not include the right 
to a formal hearing with examination of witnesses unless the agency 
provides for a formal hearing in its regulations in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (4) If the appointee wishes the agency to consider any medical 
condition that may have affected the basis for the adverse action, the

Code authorizes an exception to the 30 days' advance written notice when 
the crime provision is invoked. This provision may be invoked even in 
the absence of judicial action if the agency has reasonable cause to 
believe that the appointee has committed a crime for which a sentence of 
imprisonment may be imposed. The agency may require the appointee to 
furnish any answer to the proposed action, and affidavits and other 
documentary evidence to support the answer, within such time as under 
the circumstances would be reasonable, but not less than 7 days. When 
the circumstances require immediate action, the agency may place the

conflict of interest or position;
    (ii) An employee of the agency whose release from his or her 
official position would give rise to unreasonable costs; or
    (iii) An employee of the agency whose priority work assignments 
preclude the employee's release.
    (f) Agency decision. In arriving at its written decision, the agency 
may consider only the reasons specified in the notice of proposed 
action. The agency shall consider any reply of the appointee or the 
appointee's representative made to a designated official and any medical 
documentation furnished under paragraph (c) of this section. The agency

decision issued by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) as required 
by the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. 101-12 (codified at 
5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A)). The interim relief provisions of the law are 
applicable whether or not alleged reprisal for whistleblowing is at 
issue in an appeal to MSPB.


<R05>
Sec. 772.102  Interim personnel actions.

    When an employee or applicant for employment appeals an action to 
MSPB and the appeal results in an initial decision by an MSPB 
administrative judge granting interim relief under 5 U.S.C. 
7701(b)(2)(A) and a petition for review of the initial decision is filed 
(or will be filed) with the full Board under 5 U.S.C. 7701(e)(1)(A), the 
agency shall provide the relief ordered in the initial decision by 
taking an interim personnel action subject to the following terms:
    (a) Interim personnel actions shall be made effective upon the date 
of issuance of the initial decision and must be initiated on or before 
the date of a petition for review by the agency or within a reasonable 
period after the date it becomes aware of a petition for review by the 
appellant;
    (b) The relief provided by interim personnel actions shall end:
    (1) When the full Board issues a final decision on a petition for 
review filed by an applicant for employment, employee, and/or agency 
under 5 U.S.C. 7701(e)(1)(A),
    (2) When the initial decision becomes final pursuant to an action of 
the full Board or pursuant to a decision by an applicant for employment, 
employee, and/or agency to withdraw (or change intentions to file) any 
petition for review filed under 5 U.S.C. 7701(e)(1)(A), or
    (3) When the applicant for employment or employee requests or 
reaches agreement with the agency that the interim relief ordered in the 
initial decision be cancelled;
    (c) Interim relief shall entitle the applicant for employment or 
employee to the same compensation and benefits he or she would receive 
if the relief effected had not been on an interim basis except as 
provided in paragraph (f) of this section;
    (d) An interim personnel action shall not be taken if the MSPB 
administrative judge, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A)(i), determines 
that granting interim relief is not appropriate;
    (e) An interim personnel action under this part shall not entitle 
the applicant for employment or employee to an award of back pay or 
attorney fees.

    The provider, whether center-based or family child care, must be 
licensed and/or regulated by the State and, where applicable, by local 
authorities where the child care service is delivered. Outside of the 
United States, agencies may adopt or create criteria to ensure a child 
care center or family child care home is safe. Agencies must not 
restrict the use of funds to apply to accredited child care providers 
only.


<R05>
Sec. 792.221  Is there a statutory cap on the amount or the percentage of child care costs that will be subsidized?

    The law does not specify a cap on the amount or percentage of child 
care subsidy that may be subsidized.


<R05>
Sec. 792.222  What is the definition of a lower income Federal employee and how is the amount of the child care subsidy determined?

    Each agency decides who qualifies as a lower income Federal employee 
within

[[Page 78]]

that agency. OPM has provided guidance for determining eligibility in 
the ``Guide for Implementing Child Care Legislation--Public Law 107-67, 
Sec. 630.'' This publication is available on OPM's Web site, http://
www.opm.gov/wrkfam.


<R05>
Sec. 792.223  Who determines if a Federal employee qualifies as a lower income employee and how is the program administered?

    The agency or another appropriately identified organization 
determines eligibility using certain income and/or subsidy program 
criteria chosen by the agency. If the agency itself does not administer 
the program, it must select another organization to do so, using 
procedures that are in accordance with the Federal Acquisition 
Regulations. Regardless of what organization administers the program, 
the model for determining both the subsidy program eligibility and the 
amount of the subsidy is always determined by the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 792.224  Are child care subsidies paid to the Federal employee using the child care?

    Agencies must pay the child care provider directly, unless one of 
the following exceptions applies:
    (a) If an agency chooses to have an organization administer its 
program (see Sec. 792.223), the organization pays the child care 
provider;
    (b) For overseas locations, the agency may choose to pay the 
employee if the provider deals only in foreign currency; or
    (c) In unique circumstances, an agency may obtain written permission 
from OPM to do so.


<R05>
Sec. 792.225  May an agency disburse funds to an organization that administers the child care subsidy program prior to the time the employee receives the child 
          care services?

    The agency may disburse funds to an organization that administers 
the child care subsidy program in one lump sum. The organization will be 
responsible for tracking the funds and providing the agency with regular 
reports. An agency contract should specify that any unexpended funds 
shall be returned to the agency after the contract is completed.


<R05>
Sec. 792.226  How may an agency disburse funds to a Federally sponsored child care center in a multi-tenant building?

    In a multi-tenant building, funds from the agencies may be pooled 
together for the benefit of the employees qualified for the child care 
subsidy program.


<R05>
Sec. 792.227  How long will the child care subsidy program be in effect
for a Federal employee?

    The child care subsidy program, in the form of a reduced child care 
cost rate, shall be in effect from the time the agency makes a decision 
for a particular Federal employee and the child is enrolled in the 
program until one of the following occurs:
    (a) The child is no longer enrolled in the program;
    (b) The employee no longer qualifies as a ``lower income employee'; 
or
    (c) The agency no longer has a child care subsidy program.


<R05>
Sec. 792.228  May these funds be used for children of Federal employees 
who are already enrolled in child care?

    The funds may be used for children currently enrolled in child care 
as long as their families meet the child care subsidy program 
eligibility requirements established by the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 792.229  May an agency place restrictions or requirements on the use 
of these funds, and may the agency restrict the disbursement of such funds to only 
          one type of child care or to one location?

    (a) Depending on the agency's staffing needs and the employees' own 
needs, including the local availability of child care, the agency may 
choose to place restrictions on the use of its funds for the child care 
subsidy program. For example, an agency may decide to restrict use to 
the following:
    (1) Federal employees who are full-time permanent employees;
    (2) Federal employees using an agency on-site child care center;
    (3) Federal employees using full-time child care; or

[[Page 79]]

    (4) Federal employees using child care in specific locations.
    (a) With the exception of Sec. 792.229(c) an agency may determine 
whether and what restrictions to impose on the use of appropriated funds 
for the child care subsidy program.
    (b) Agencies must not restrict the use of funds to apply to 
accredited child care providers only.


<R05>

[48 FR 38783, Aug. 26, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 831.105  Computation of interest.

    (a) The computation of interest is on the basis of 30 days to the 
month. Interest is computed for the actual calendar time involved in 
each case, but whenever applicable the rule of average applies.
    (b) Interest is allowed on current deductions and deposits at the 
rate of 4 percent per year to December 31, 1947, and 3 percent per year 
thereafter, compounded annually, to December 31, 1956. After December 
31, 1956, except as provided below, interest is allowed at the rate of 3 
percent per year, compounded annually, to date of final separation or 
transfer to a position that is not covered by the retirement system. 
After December 31, 1956, interest is not allowed:
    (1) When an employee has one year or less of covered service,
    (2) For any fractional part of a month in the total service, or
    (3) For more than five years' civilian service.
    (c) Interest at the rate of 3 percent per year through December 31, 
1984, and, thereafter, at the yearly rate determined by the Secretary of 
Treasury, compounded annually, is allowed on voluntary contributions 
during periods of employment and, after the employee or Member has 
completed at least 5 years' civilian service, during periods of 
separation until the beginning date of annuity or death, whichever is 
earlier. For refund purposes, however, interest on voluntary 
contributions terminates on the date of the employee's or Member's final 
separation or on the date of the employee's or Member's last transfer to 
a position in which he or she is not subject to subchapter III of 
chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code
    (d) For noncontributory service performed before October 1, 1982, 
and for redeposits of refunds paid on an application received by either 
the individual's employing agency or OPM before October 1, 1982, 
interest at the rate of 4 percent per year to December 31, 1947, and at 
the rate of 3 percent per year thereafter, compounded annually, is 
charged. Interest is charged on the outstanding balance of a deposit 
from the midpoint of each service period for which deposit is involved; 
interest is charged on the outstanding balance of a refund from the date 
the refund was paid. Interest is charged to the date of deposit or 
commencing date of annuity, whichever is earlier, except that interest 
is not charged for any period of separation from the service which began 
before October 1, 1956.
    (e) For noncontributory service performed on or after October 1, 
1982, and for redeposits of refunds paid on an application received by 
the individual's employing agency or OPM on or after October 1, 1982, 
interest is charged at the rate of 3 percent per year through December 
31, 1984, and, thereafter, at the yearly rate determined by the 
Secretary of Treasury, compounded annually. Interest is charged on the 
outstanding balance of a deposit from the midpoint of each service 
period for which deposit is involved; interest is charged on the 
outstanding balance of a refund from the date the refund was paid. 
Interest is charged to the date of deposit.
    (f) No interest is charged on a deposit for military service if that 
deposit is made before October 1, 1984, or within 2 years of the date 
that an individual first becomes an employee or Member under the civil 
service retirement system, whichever is later. When interest

[[Page 84]]

is charged on a deposit for military service, it is charged on the 
outstanding balance at the rate of 3 percent per year, compounded 
annually, from October 1, 1984, or 2 years from the date the individual 
first becomes an employee or Member, whichever is later, through 
December 31, 1984, and thereafter at the yearly rate determined by the 
Secretary of the Treasury.
    (g) For calendar year 1985 and for each subsequent calendar year, 
OPM will publish a notice in the Federal Register to notify the public 
of the interest rate that will be in effect during that calendar year.
    (h) Interest under Sec. Sec. 831.631, 831.632, 831.682, and 831.684 
is compounded annually and accrued monthly.
    (1) The initial interest on each monthly difference between the 
reduced annuity rate and the annuity rate actually paid equals the 
amount of the monthly difference times the difference between (i) 1.06 
raised to the power whose numerator is the number of months between the 
date when the monthly difference in annuity rates occurred and the date 
when the initial interest is computed and whose denominator is 12; and 
(ii) 1.
    (2) The total initial interest due is the sum of all of the initial 
interest on each monthly difference computed in accordance with 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (3) Additional interest on any uncollected balance will be 
compounded annually and accrued monthly. The additional interest due 
each month equals the remaining balance due times the difference between 
(i) 1.06 raised to the 1/12th power; and (ii) 1.
    (i)(1) When an individual's civilian service involves several 
deposit and/or redeposit periods, OPM will normally use the following 
order of precedence in applying each installment payment against the 
full amount due:
    (i) Redeposits of refunds paid on applications received by the 
individual's employing agency or OPM on or after October 1, 1982;
    (ii) Redeposits of refunds paid on applications received by the 
individual's employing agency or OPM before October 1, 1982;
    (iii) Deposits for noncontributory civilian service performed on or 
after October 1, 1982; and
    (iv) Deposits for noncontributory service performed before October 
1, 1982.
    (2) If an individual specifically requests a different order of 
precedence, that request will be honored.
    (j) Interest under Sec. 831.662 is compounded annually and accrued 
monthly.
    (1) The initial interest on each monthly difference between the 
reduced annuity rate and the annuity rate actually paid equals the 
amount of the monthly difference times the difference between--
    (i) The sum of one plus the interest rate set under Sec. 831.105(g) 
raised to the power whose numerator is the number of months between the 
date when the monthly difference in annuity rates occurred and the date 
when the initial interest is computed and whose denominator is 12; and
    (ii) 1.
    (2) The total initial interest due is the sum of all of the initial 
interest on each monthly difference computed in accordance with 
paragraph (j)(1) of this section.

reconsideration must be received by OPM within 30 calendar days from the 
date of the original decision.
    (2) The representative of the Associate Director for Compensation 
responsible for reconsiderations may extend the time limit for filing

and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he/she was prevented by 
circumstances beyond his/her control from making the request within the 
time limit.
    (f) Final decision. (1) After reconsideration, the Associate

Sec. 831.111  Employee deductions and agency contributions.

    (a) Agency share. When an agency fails to withhold some or all of an 
employee deduction under 5 U.S.C. 8334(a) for any pay period, the agency 
is still responsible for submitting the correct agency contribution to 
OPM. The agency must submit as the agency share, a payment equal to the 
amount that would have been submitted if the error had not been made (or 
a payment equal to the difference between the amount already submitted 
as the agency share and the amount that should have been submitted). The 
payment should be submitted to OPM in the manner currently prescribed 
for the transmission of withholdings and contributions as soon as 
possible, but not later than provided by standards established by OPM.
    (b) Employee share. (1) If, through administrative error, an agency 
did not withhold any of the employee deductions required by 5 U.S.C. 
8334(a) for any pay period, the employee may, at his or her option--
    (i) Request the agency that employed him or her when the error was 
made to correct his or her records and arrange to pay any resulting 
overpayment of pay to the agency (unless it is waived by the agency); or
    (ii) Pay the deposit plus any applicable interest (under certain 
conditions,

[[Page 87]]

the deposit may be made at any time until the final adjudication of his 
or her application for retirement) directly to OPM by submitting SF 
2803; or
    (iii) Have the period of service treated like the nondeduction 
service described in Sec. 831.303.
    (2) When the agency withholds part of the required employee 
deductions for any pay period, the balance must be submitted to OPM in 
the manner currently prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and 
contributions as soon as possible, but not later than provided by 
standards established by OPM. The agency must correct its error. The 
employee does not have the option to pay a deposit directly to OPM when 
partial deductions have been withheld.
    (3) If the agency waives the employee's repayment of the salary 
overpayment that resulted from the administrative error, the agency must 
also submit (in addition to the agency contribution) the employee's 
share of the unpaid contributions to OPM in the manner currently 
prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and contributions.

<R05>
Sec. 831.112  Definitions of employee.

    (a) Determinations involving an employee's ability to make a deposit 
or redeposit. A person may make a deposit or redeposit under section 
8334 of title 5, United States Code, if he or she is an ``employee.'' 
For purposes of this paragraph, an employee is--
    (1) A person currently employed in a position subject to the civil 
service retirement law; or
    (2) A former employee (whose annuity has not been finally 
adjudicated) who retains civil service retirement annuity rights based 
on a separation from a position in which retirement deductions were 
properly withheld and remain (or have been redeposited in whole or in 
part) in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.
    (b) Determinations involving the payment of survivor benefits at an 
employee's or former employee's death. To determine entitlement to 
survivor benefits, OPM establishes whether the deceased individual was 
an ``employee'' or a ``retiree'' on the date of death. If the decedent 
was an ``employee'' on the date of death, survivor benefits are paid as 
though the individual died in service. If the decedent was a ``retiree'' 
on the date of death, survivor benefits are only paid as provided in the 
individual's election, provided it was properly made. However, if a 
former employee was eligible only for a deferred annuity at age 62, 
survivor benefits are only paid if the individual was a ``retiree'' on 
the date of death. For purposes of this paragraph--
    (1) Employee is a person--
    (i) Who had not been separated from service prior to his or her 
death, even if he or she had applied for retirement (for example, an 
applicant for disability annuity) and the application had been approved; 
or
    (ii) Whose death occurs before the commencing date of annuity, even 
though separation has occurred.
    (2) Retiree or annuitant is a person--
    (i) Who has been separated from service and met all the requirements 
to receive an annuity including having filed an application for the 
annuity prior to his or her death; and
    (ii) Whose death occurs on or after the commencing date of annuity.
    (c) Determinations involving the requirement of spousal consent for 
elections of alternative annuity and survivor annuity benefits. Spousal 
consent is required as specified in Sec. Sec. 831.614 and 831.2203(c), 
if the employee/annuitant is married on the commencing date of annuity, 
regardless of whether that date is before or after the date of 
separation from service.

Sec. 831.114  Voluntary early retirement-substantial delayering, reorganization,
reduction in force, transfer of function, or other workforce restructuring.

    (a) A specific designee is defined as a senior official within an 
agency who has been specifically designated to sign requests for 
voluntary early retirement authority under a designation from the head 
of the agency. Examples include a Chief Human Capital Officer, an 
Assistant Secretary for Administration, a Director of Human Resources 
Management, or other official.
    (b) An agency's request for voluntary early retirement authority 
must be signed by the head of the agency or by a specific designee.
    (c) The request must contain the following information:
    (1) Identification of the agency or specified component(s) for which 
the authority is being requested;
    (2) Reasons why the agency needs voluntary early retirement 
authority. This must include a detailed summary of the agency's 
personnel and/or budgetary situation that will result in an excess of 
personnel because of a substantial delayering, reorganization, reduction 
in force, transfer of function, or other workforce restructuring or 
reshaping, consistent with agency human capital goals;
    (3) The date on which the agency expects to effect the substantial 
delayering, reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of function, or 
other workforce restructuring or reshaping;
    (4) The time period during which the agency plans to offer voluntary 
early retirement;
    (5) The total number of non-temporary employees in the agency (or 
specified component(s));
    (6) The total number of non-temporary employees in the agency (or 
specified component(s)) who may be involuntarily separated, downgraded, 
transferred, or reassigned as a result of the substantial delayering, 
reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of function, or other 
workforce restructuring or reshaping;
    (7) The total number of employees in the agency (or specified 
component(s)) who are eligible for voluntary early retirement;
    (8) An estimate of the total number of employees in the agency (or 
specified component(s)) who are expected to retire early during the 
period covered by the request for voluntary early retirement authority; 
and
    (9) A description of the types of personnel actions anticipated as a 
result of the agency's need for voluntary early retirement authority. 
Examples include separations, transfers, reassignments, and 
downgradings.
    (d) OPM will evaluate a request for voluntary early retirement based 
on:
    (1) A specific request to OPM from the agency for voluntary early 
retirement authority;
    (2) A voluntary separation incentive payment implementation plan, as 
discussed in part 576, subpart A, of this chapter, which must outline 
the intended use of the incentive payments and voluntary early 
retirement; or
    (3) The agency's human capital plan, which must outline its intended 
use of voluntary separation incentive payments and voluntary early 
retirement authority, and the changes in organizational structure it 
expects to make as the result of projected separations and early 
retirements.
    (e) Regardless of the method used, the request must include all of 
the information required by paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) OPM may approve an agency's request for voluntary early 
retirement authority to cover the entire period of the substantial 
delayering, reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of function, or 
other workforce restructuring or reshaping described by the agency, or 
the initial portion of that period with a requirement for subsequent 
information and justification if the period covers multiple years.
    (g) After OPM approves an agency's request, the agency must 
immediately notify OPM of any subsequent changes in the conditions that 
served as the basis for the approval of the voluntary early retirement 
authority. Depending upon the circumstances involved, OPM will modify 
the authority as necessary to better suit the agency's needs.
    (h) The agency may further limit voluntary early retirement offers 
based on:

[[Page 89]]

    (1) An established opening and closing date for the acceptance of 
applications that is announced to employees at the time of the offer; or
    (2) The acceptance of a specified number of applications for 
voluntary early retirement, provided that, at the time of the offer, the 
agency notified employees that it retained the right to limit the number 
of voluntary early retirements.
    (i) Within the timeframe specified for its approved voluntary early 
retirement authority, the agency may subsequently establish a new or 
revised closing date, or reduce or increase the number of early 
retirement applications it will accept, if management's downsizing and/
or reshaping needs change. If the agency issues a revised closing date, 
or a revised number of applications to be accepted, the new date or 
number of applications must be announced to the same group of employees 
included in the original announcement. If the agency issues a new window 
period with a new closing date, or a new instance of a specific number 
of applications to be accepted, the new window period or number of 
applications to be accepted may be announced to a different group of 
employees as long as they are covered by the approved voluntary early 
retirement authority.
    (j) Chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, requires that 
agencies treat employees on military duty, for all practical purposes, 
as though they were still on the job. Further, employees are not to be 
disadvantaged because of their military service. In accordance with 
these provisions, employees on military duty who would otherwise be 
eligible for an offer of voluntary early retirement will have 30 days 
following their return to duty to either accept or reject an offer of 
voluntary early retirement. This will be true even if the voluntary 
early retirement authority provided by OPM has expired.
    (k) An employee who separates from the service voluntarily after 
completing 25 years of service, or becoming age 50 and completing 20 
years of service, is entitled to an annuity if, on the date of 
separation, the employee:
    (1) Is serving in a position covered by a voluntary early retirement 
offer; and
    (2) Meets the following conditions which are covered in 5 U.S.C. 
8336(d)(2):
    (i) Has been employed continuously, by the agency in which the 
employee is serving, for at least the 31-day period ending on the date 
on which such agency requests the determination referred to in section 
831.114(b);
    (ii) Is serving under an appointment that is not time limited;
    (iii) Has not been duly notified that such employee is to be 
involuntarily separated for misconduct or unacceptable performance;
    (iv) Is separated from the service voluntarily during a period in 
which, as determined by the Office of Personnel Management (upon request 
of the agency) under regulations prescribed by the Office:
    (A) Such agency (or, if applicable, the component in which the 
employee is serving) is undergoing substantial delayering, substantial 
reorganization, substantial reductions in force, substantial transfer of 
function, or other substantial workforce restructuring (or shaping);
    (B) A significant percentage of employees serving in such agency (or 
component) are likely to be separated or subject to an immediate 
reduction in the rate of basic pay (without regard to subchapter VI of 
chapter 53, or comparable provisions); or
    (C) Identified as being in positions which are becoming surplus or 
excess to the agency's future ability to carry out its mission 
effectively; and
    (v) As determined by the agency under regulations prescribed by the 
Office, is within the scope of the offer of voluntary early retirement, 
which may be made based on the following criteria:
    (A) 1 or more organizational units;
    (B) 1 or more occupational series or levels;
    (C) 1 or more geographical locations;
    (D) Specific periods;
    (E) Skills, knowledge, or other factors related to a position; or
    (F) Any appropriate combination of such factors.
    (l) Agencies are responsible for ensuring that employees are not 
coerced into voluntary early retirement. If an agency finds any 
instances of coercion,

[[Page 90]]

it must take appropriate corrective action.
    (m) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, an agency 
may not offer or process voluntary early retirements beyond the stated 
expiration date of a voluntary early retirement authority or offer early 
retirements to employees who are not within the scope of the voluntary 
early retirement authority approved by OPM.
    (n) OPM may terminate a voluntary early retirement authority if it 
determines that the condition(s) that formed the basis for the approval 
of the authority no longer exist.
    (o) OPM may amend, limit, or terminate a voluntary early retirement 
authority to ensure that the requirements of this subpart are properly 
being followed.
    (p) Agencies must provide OPM with interim and final reports for 
each voluntary early retirement authority, as covered in OPM's approval 
letter to the agency. OPM may suspend or cancel a voluntary early 
retirement authority if the agency is not in compliance with the 
reporting requirements or reporting schedule specified in OPM's 
voluntary early retirement authority approval letter.

    (a) Congressional employees who provide food service operations for 
the House of Representatives can elect to continue their retirement 
coverage under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States 
Code, when such food service operations are transferred to a private 
contractor. These regulations also apply to any successor contractors.
    (b) Eligibility requirements. To be eligible for continuation of 
retirement coverage, an employee must:
    (1) Be a Congressional employee (as defined in section 2107 of title 
5, United States Code), other than an employee of the Architect of the 
Capitol, engaged in providing food service operations for the House of 
Representatives under the administrative control of the Architect of the 
Capitol;
    (2) Be subject to subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United 
States Code;
    (3) Elect to remain covered under civil service retirement 
provisions no later than the day before the date on which the food 
service operations transfer from the House of Representatives to a 
private contractor; and
    (4) Become employed to provide food services under contract without 
a break in service. A ``break in service'' means a separation from 
employment of at least three calendar days.
    (c) Employee deductions. An employee who elects to continue coverage 
under title 5 retirement provisions is deemed to consent to deductions 
from his or her basic pay for the Civil Service Retirement and 
Disability Fund in the amount determined in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 
8334(k). The employer providing the food services under contract must, 
in accordance with procedures established by OPM, pay into the Civil 
Service Retirement and Disability Fund the amounts deducted from an 
employee's pay.
    (d) Employer contributions. The employer providing food services 
under contract must, in accordance with procedures established by OPM, 
pay into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund amounts equal 
to any agency contributions that would be required if the individual 
were a Congressional employee covered by the Civil Service Retirement 
System.

continually employed by the Airports Authority without a break in 
service. A ``break in service'' means a separation from employment of at 
least 3 calendar days.
    (c) Employee deductions. Employees of the Airports Authority who 
have continuing coverage under title 5 retirement provisions are deemed 
to consent to deductions from their basic pay for the Civil Service 
Retirement and Disability Fund. The amounts deducted will be the same as 
if the employees were still employed by the Federal Government. The 
Airports Authority must, in accordance with procedures established by 
OPM, pay into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund the 
amounts deducted from an employee's pay.
    (d) Employer contributions. The Airports Authority must, in 
accordance with procedures established by OPM, pay into the Civil 
Service Retirement and Disability Fund amounts equal to any agency 
contributions that would be required for employees covered by the Civil 
Service Retirement System.

[[Page 94]]

    (e) Sick leave. An employee who retires, or dies leaving a survivor 
entitled to an annuity, from the Airports Authority within the 5 year 
period beginning on the date the lease takes effect will be permitted to

year period, use of unused sick leave in the annuity computation will be 
permitted if the employee is under a formal leave system as defined in 
Sec. 831.302.

<R05>
Sec. 831.301  Military service.

    (a) Service of an individual who first became an employee or Member 
under the civil service retirement system before October 1, 1982. A 
period of honorable active service after December 31, 1956, in the Army, 
Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast Guard of the United States, or, 
after June 30, 1960, in the Regular Corps or Reserve Corps of the Public 
Health Service, or, after June 30, 1961, as a commissioned officer of 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (formerly Coast and 
Geodetic Survey and Environmental Science Services Administration), 
performed before the date of separation on which civil service annuity 
entitlement is based shall be included in the computation of the annuity 
provided--
    (1) The employee or Member has completed 5 years' (18 months' for 
survivors of employees or Members who die in service) civilian service;
    (2) The employee or Member is not receiving military retired pay 
awarded for reasons other than (i) service-connected disability incurred 
in combat with an enemy of the United States, (ii) service-connected 
disability caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in line of 
duty during a period of war (as that term is used in chapter 11 of title 
38, United States Code), or (iii) under chapter 67 of title 10, United 
States Code; and
    (3)(i) The employee, Member, or survivor is not entitled, or upon 
application would not be entitled, to monthly old-age or survivors 
benefits under Sec. 202 of the Social Security Act (41 U.S.C. 402) 
based on the individual's wages or self-employment income, or
    (ii) For an employee, Member, or survivor who is entitled, or upon 
application would be entitled, to monthly old-age or survivors benefits 
under section 202 of the Social Security Act (41 U.S.C. 402) based on 
the individual's wages or self-employment income, the employee, Member, 
or survivor has completed a deposit in accordance with subpart U of this 
part, or the annuity has been reduced under Sec. 831.303(d), for each 
full period of such military service performed after December 1956. If a 
deposit has not been completed or the annuity has not been reduced under 
Sec. 831.303(d), periods of military service performed after December 
31, 1956 (other than periods of military service covered by military 
leave with pay from a civilian position), are excluded from credit from 
and after the first day of the month in which the individual (or 
survivor) becomes entitled, or upon proper application would be 
entitled, to Social Security benefits under section 202. Military 
service performed prior to January 1957 is included in the computation 
of the annuity regardless of whether a deposit is made for service after 
December 31, 1956.
    (ii) For an employee, Member, or survivor who is entitled, or upon 
application would be entitled, to monthly old-age or survivors benefits 
under Sec. 202 of the Social Security Act (41 U.S.C. 402) based on the 
individual's wages or self-employment income, the employee, Member, or 
survivor has completed a deposit in accordance with subpart U of this 
part, for each full period of such military service performed after 
December 1956.

If a deposit has not been completed, periods of military service 
performed after December 31, 1956 (other than periods of military 
service covered by military leave with pay from a civilian position), 
are excluded from credit from and after the first day of the month in 
which the individual (or survivor) becomes entitled, or upon proper 
application would be entitled, to Social Security benefits under Sec. 
202. Military service performed prior to January 1957 is included in the 
computation of the annuity regardless of whether a deposit is made for 
service after December 31, 1956.
    (b) Service of an individual who first becomes an employee or Member 
under the civil service retirement system on or after

[[Page 96]]

October 1, 1982. A period of honorable active service after December 31, 
1956, in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast Guard of the 
United States, or, after June 30, 1960, in the Regular Corps or Reserve 
Corps of the Public Health Service, or, after June 30, 1961, as a 
commissioned officer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (formerly Coast and Geodetic Survey and Environmental 
Science Services Administration), performed before the date of 
separation on which civil service annuity entitlement is based shall be 
included in the computation of the annuity provided--
    (1) The employee or Member has completed 5 years' (18 months' for 
survivors of employees or Members who die in service) civilian service;
    (2) The employee or Member is not receiving military retired pay 
awarded for reasons other than (i) service-connected disability incurred 
in combat with an enemy of the United States, (ii) service-connected 
disability caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in line of 
duty during a period of war (as that term is used in chapter 11 of title 
38, United States Code), or (iii) under chapter 67 of title 10, United 
States Code; and
    (3) The employee, Member, or survivor has completed a deposit in an 
amount equal to 7 percent of his or her basic pay under section 204 of 
title 37, United States Code, (plus interest, if any) or the annuity has 
been reduced under Sec. 831.303(d), for each full period of such 
military service performed after December 1956. Military service 
performed prior to January 1957 is included in the computation of the 
annuity regardless of whether a deposit is made for service after 
December 31. 1956.
    (c) Military retirees and recipients of Veterans Administration 
benefits. An employee or Member applying for annuity, who otherwise 
meets all conditions for receiving credit for military service, but who 
is in receipt of retired or retainer pay which bars credit for military 
service, may elect to waive the retired or retainer pay and have the 
military service added to civilian service for annuity computation 
purposes. An applicant for disability retirement, who is receiving a 
Veterans Administration pension or compensation in lieu of military 
retired or retainer pay, may elect to waive the retired or retainer pay 
and renounce the Veterans Administration pension or compensation and 
have the military service added to civilian service for annuity 
computation purposes.
    (d) Widow(er)s and former spouses entitled to annuity based on the 
service of employees or Members who die in service--(1) Military service 
is included unless the widow(er) or former spouse elects otherwise. 
Effective April 25, 1987, unless a widow(er) or former spouse of an 
employee or Member who dies--on or after that date--before being 
separated from service files a written election to the contrary, his or 
her annuity will include credit for periods of military service (subject 
to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section) that would 
ordinarily be excluded from the computation of the employee's or 
Member's annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8332(c)(2).
    (2) Reduction by the amount of survivor benefits payable based on 
the military service. (i) In paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, 
``survivor benefits under a retirement system for members of the 
uniformed services'' means survivor benefits before any offsets for 
benefits payable from another Federal benefit system except for those 
payable under title II of the Social Security Act. The amount of the 
survivor benefit to be deducted will be the amount payable to the 
current or former spouse and attributable to the decedent's retired or 
retainer pay for the period of military service to be included in the 
CSRS survivor annuity. However, the survivor benefit will never be 
reduced below the amount payable based on the civilian service alone.
    (ii) OPM will obtain information on the amount of any monthly 
survivor benefits payable to each applicant for CSRS current or former 
spouse annuity. OPM will reduce the CSRS survivor annuity by the monthly 
military survivor benefit on its commencing date. OPM will not make a 
subsequent adjustment unless it is necessary to increase or decrease the 
CSRS survivor benefit because of a change in the amount of military 
survivor benefits attributable to the period of service or

[[Page 97]]

a change in the period of military service to be included in the CSRS 
annuity when the survivor annuitant becomes eligible for benefits under 
title II of the Social Security Act.
    (3) Widow(er)s or former spouses of employees or Members who die on 
or after April 25, 1987--election not to be included. OPM will accept a 
written election from a widow(er) or former spouse who does not wish to 
be covered by Sec. 831.301(d) provided it is postmarked within the 
period ending 30 calendar days after the date of the first regular 
monthly annuity payment.
    (4) Widow(er)s or former spouses of employees or Members who die 
before April 25, 1987--application to OPM for credit. Widow(er)s or 
former spouses of employees or Members who died before April 25, 1987, 
must apply to OPM in writing to have credit for military service 
included in the survivor annuity computation. If the survivor annuity is 
increased by including credit for the military service, the increase 
will be effective on the first of the month following the 60th calendar 
day after the date the written application for inclusion of the military 
service is received in OPM.

Sec. 831.302  Unused sick leave.

    (a) For annuity computation purposes, the service of an employee who 
retires on immediate annuity or dies leaving a survivor entitled to 
annuity is increased by the days of unused sick leave to his credit 
under a formal leave system.
    (b) An immediate annuity is one which begins to accrue not later 
than 1 month after the employee is separated.
    (c) A formal leave system is one which is provided by law or 
regulation or operates under written rules specifying a group or class 
of employees to which it applies and the rate at which sick leave is 
earned.
    (d) In general, 8 hours of unused sick leave increases total 
services by 1 day. In cases where more or less than 8 hours of sick 
leave would be charged for a day's absence, total service is increased 
by the number of days in the period between the date of separation and 
the date that the unused sick leave would have expired had the employee 
used it (except that holidays falling within the period are treated as 
work days, and no additional leave credit is earned for that period).
    (e) If an employee's tour of duty changes from part time to full 
time or full time to part time within 180 days before retirement, the 
credit for unused sick leave is computed as though no change had 
occurred.

Sec. 831.303  Civilian service.

    (a) Periods of civilian service performed before October 1, 1982, 
for which retirement deductions have not been taken. Periods of 
creditable civilian service performed by an employee or Member after 
July 31, 1920, but before October 1, 1982, for which retirement 
deductions have not been taken shall be included in determining length 
of service to compute annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of 
title 5, United States Code; however, if the employee, Member, or 
survivor does not elect either to complete the deposit describes by 
section 8334(c) of title 5, United States Code, or to eliminate the 
service from annuity computation, his or her annuity is reduced by 10 
percent of the amount which should have been deposited (plus interest) 
for the period of noncontributory service.
    (b) Periods of service for which refunded deductions have not been 
redeposited, and periods of civilian service performed on or after 
October 1, 1982, for which retirement deductions have not been taken. 
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a period of service 
for which refunded deductions have not been redeposited, and a period of 
creditable civilian service performed by an employee or Member on or 
after October 1, 1982, for which retirement deductions have not been 
taken, shall be included in determining length of service to compute the 
annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States 
Code, only if--
    (1) The employee or Member subsequently becomes eligible for an 
annuity payable under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United 
States Code; and

[[Page 98]]

    (2) The employee, Member, or survivor makes a deposit (or redeposit) 
for the full period of service. If more than one distinct period of 
service is covered by a single refund, the periods of service covered by 
that refund are considered to be single full periods of service. 
However, in all other instances, a distinct period of nondeduction 
civilian service (i.e., a period of nondeduction service that is not 
interrupted by a break in service of more than three days) and a 
distinct period of redeposit civilian service (i.e., a period of 
redeposit service that is not interrupted by a break in service of more 
than three days) are considered as separate full periods of service, 
even when they are immediately consecutive. A period of nondeduction 
service which begins before October 1, 1982, and ends on or after that 
date is also considered two full periods of service: one ending on 
September 30, 1982, and the other beginning on October 1, 1982.
    (c)(1) An employee or Member who has not completed payment of a 
redeposit for refunded deductions based on a period of service that 
ended before October 1, 1990, will receive credit for that service in 
computing the nondisability annuity for which the individual is eligible 
under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, 
provided the nondisability annuity commences after December 1, 1990.
    (2) The beginning monthly rate of annuity payable to a retiree whose 
annuity includes service credited in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section will be reduced by an amount equal to the redeposit owed, 
or unpaid balance thereof, divided by the present value factor for the 
retiree's attained age (in full years) at the time of retirement. The 
reduced monthly rate will then be rounded down to the next lower dollar 
amount and becomes the rate of annuity payable.
    (3) For the purpose of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the terms 
``present value factor'' and ``time of retirement'' have the same 
meaning as in Sec. 831.2202.
    (d)(1) Civilian and military service of an individual affected by an 
erroneous retirement coverage determination. An employee or survivor who 
owed a deposit under section 8411(c)(1)(B) or 8411(f) of title 5, United 
States Code (FERS rules) for:
    (i) Civilian service that was not subject to retirement deductions, 
or
    (ii) Military service performed after December 31, 1956, will 
receive credit for the service without payment of the deposit if, 
because of an erroneous retirement coverage determination, the service 
is subsequently credited under chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code 
(CSRS rules).
    (2)(i) The beginning monthly rate of annuity payable to a retiree 
whose annuity includes service credited under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section and service creditable under CSRS rules that would not be 
creditable under FERS rules is reduced by an amount equal to the CSRS 
deposit owed, or unpaid balance thereof, divided by the present value 
factor for the retiree's age (in full years) at the time of retirement. 
The result is rounded to the next highest dollar amount, and is the 
monthly actuarial reduction amount.
    (ii)(A) The beginning monthly rate of annuity payable to a survivor 
whose annuity includes service credited under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section is reduced by an amount equal to the CSRS deposit owed, or 
unpaid balance thereof, divided by the present value factor for the 
survivor's age (in full years) at the time of death. The result is 
rounded to the next highest dollar amount, and is the monthly actuarial 
reduction amount.
    (B) The survivor annuity is not reduced if the employee annuity was 
reduced under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3) For the purpose of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the terms 
``present value factor'' and ``time of retirement'' have the same 
meaning as in Sec. 831.2202 of this chapter.

Sec. 831.304  Service with the Cadet Nurse Corps during World War II.

    (a) Definitions and special usages. In this section--
    (1) Basic pay is computed at the rate of $15 per month for the first 
9 months of study; $20 per month for the 10th through the 21st month of 
study; and

[[Page 99]]

$30 per month for any month in excess of 21.
    (2) Cadet Nurse Corps service means any student or graduate nurse 
training, in a non-Federal institution, as a participant in a plan 
approved under section 2 of the Act of June 15, 1943 (57 Stat. 153).
    (3) CSRS means the Civil Service Retirement System.
    (b) Conditions for creditability. As provided by Pub. L. 99-638, an 
individual who performed service with the Cadet Nurse Corps is entitled 
to credit under CSRS if--
    (1) The service as a participant in the Corps totaled 2 years or 
more;
    (2) The individual submits an application for service credit to OPM 
no later than January 10, 1988;
    (3) The individual is employed by the Federal Government in a 
position subject to CSRS at the time he or she applies to OPM for 
service credit; and
    (4) The individual makes a deposit for the service before separating 
from the Federal Government for retirement purposes. Contrary to the 
policy ``deeming'' the deposit to be made for alternative annuity 
computation purposes, these deposits must be physically in the 
possession of the individual's employing agency before his or her 
separation for retirement purposes.
    (c) Processing the application for service credit. Upon receiving an 
application requesting credit for service with the Cadet Nurse Corps, 
OPM will determine whether all conditions for creditability have been 
met, compute the deposit (including any interest) as specified by 
sections 8334(e) (2) and (3) of title 5, United States Code, based upon 
the appropriate percentage of basic pay that would have been deducted 
from the individual's pay at the time the service was performed, and 
advise the agency and the employee of the total amount of the deposit 
due.
    (d) Agency collection and submission of deposit. (1) The 
individual's employing agency must establish a deposit account showing 
the total amount due and a payment schedule (unless deposit is made in 
one lump sum), and record the date and amount of each payment.
    (2) lf the individual cannot make payment in one lump sum, the 
employing agency must accept installment payments (by allotments or 
otherwise). However, the employing agency is not required to accept 
individual checks in amounts less than $50.
    (3) If the employee dies before completing the deposit, the 
surviving spouse may elect to complete the payment to the employing 
agency in one lump sum; however, the surviving spouse will not be able 
to initiate an application for such service credit.
    (4) Payments received by the employing agency must be remitted to 
OPM immediately for deposit to the Civil Service Retirement and 
Disability Fund.
    (5) Once the employee's deposit has been paid in full or closed out, 
the employing agency must submit the documentation pertaining to the 
deposit to OPM in accordance with published instructions.

Sec. 831.305  Service with a nonappropriated fund instrumentality after
June 18, 1952, but before January 1, 1966.

    (a) Definitions and special usages. In this section--
    (1) Service in a nonappropriated fund instrumentality is any service 
performed by an employee that involved conducting arts and crafts, 
drama, music, library, service (i.e., recreation) club, youth 
activities, sports or recreation programs (including any outdoor 
recreation programs) for personnel of the armed forces. Service is not 
creditable if it was performed in programs other than those specifically 
named in this subsection.
    (2) Certification by the head of a nonappropriated fund 
instrumentality can also be certification by the National Personnel 
Records Center or by an official of another Federal agency having 
possession of records that will verify an individual's service.
    (3) CSRS means the Civil Service Retirement System.
    (b) Conditions for creditability. Pursuant to Pub. L. 99-638 and 
provided the same period of service has not been used to obtain annuity 
payable from a nonappropriated fund retirement plan, an individual who 
performed service in

[[Page 100]]

a nonappropriated fund instrumentality is entitled to credit under CSRS 
if--
    (1) The service was performed after June 18, 1952, but before 
January 1, 1966; and
    (2) The individual was employed in a position subject to CSRS on 
November 9, 1986.
    (c) Deposit for service is not necessary. It is not necessary for an 
individual to make a deposit for service performed with a 
nonappropriated fund instrumentality to receive credit for such service. 
However, if the individual does not elect to make a deposit, his or her 
annuity is reduced by 10 percent of the amount that should have been 
deposited for the period of service (including any interest) as 
specified by sections 8334(e) (2) and (3) of title 5, United States 
Code. When an employee elects an alternative annuity and also elects to 
make the deposit, OPM will deem the deposit to be made for purposes of 
computing the alternative annuity.
    (d) Crediting other service in a nonappropriated fund 
instrumentality. Service not creditable under this section may become 
creditable for retirement eligibility purposes under the provisions 
outlined in 5 CFR part 847, subpart H.

States Code (or under a prior corresponding provision of law) before 
January 1, 1969.
    (2) CSRS means the Civil Service Retirement System.
    (b) Conditions for crediting service to CSRS employees after 
November 5, 1990. An employee subject to CSRS retirement deductions 
whose only service as a National Guard technician was performed prior to 
January 1, 1969, is entitled to credit under CSRS if--
    (1) The individual submits to OPM an application for service credit 
in a form prescribed by OPM;
    (2) The individual is employed by the Federal Government in a 
position subject to CSRS retirement deductions after November 5, 1990; 
and
    (3) The individual completes the deposit for the service through 
normal service credit channels before final adjudication of his or her 
application for retirement or has the deposit deemed made when he or she 
elects the alternative form of annuity.
    (c) Processing the CSRS employee's application for service credit. 
(1) If an employee described in paragraph (b) of this section makes an 
application for service credit, OPM will determine whether all 
conditions for creditability have been met, compute the deposit and send 
the employee notice of the payment required and the procedures for 
submitting the payments to OPM.
    (2) The deposit will be computed based on--
    (i) The appropriate percentage of basic pay that would have been 
deducted from the individual's pay at the time the service was 
performed; and
    (ii) Interest at the rate of 3 percent per year computed as 
specified by section 8334(e)(2) of title 5, United States Code, until 
the date the deposit is paid.
    (d) Conditions for crediting service to CSRS annuitants and former 
Federal employees who separated after December 31, 1968, and before 
November 6, 1990--(1) Former Federal employees. Former Federal employees 
who were subject to CSRS retirement deductions and separated after 
December 31, 1968, but before November 6, 1990, with title to a deferred 
annuity, may make a deposit for pre-1969 National Guard technician 
service provided they--
    (i) Submit a written service credit application for the pre-1969 
National Guard technician service to OPM before November 6, 1991; and
    (ii) Complete a deposit for the additional service in a lump sum or 
in installment payments of $50 or more. Payments must be completed 
before their retirement claim is finally adjudicated, unless the deposit 
is deemed made when they elect an alternative form of annuity.
    (2) Annuitants and survivors. Individuals who were entitled to 
receive an immediate annuity (or survivor annuity benefits) as of 
November 6, 1990,

[[Page 101]]

may make a deposit for pre-1969 National Guard technician service 
provided they--
    (i) Submit a written application for service credit to OPM before 
November 6, 1991; and
    (ii) Complete a deposit for the additional service in a lump sum or 
in equal monthly annuity installments to be completed within 24 months 
of the date of the complete written application.
    (3) To determine the commencing date of the deposit installment 
payment period for annuitants and survivors, the ``date of application'' 
will be considered to be the first day of the second month beginning 
after OPM receives a complete written application from the individual.
    (4) To be a complete application, the individual's written request 
for pre-1969 National Guard technician service credit must also include 
a certification of the dates of employment and the rates of pay received 
by the individual during the employment period. The individual may 
obtain certification of his or her service from the Adjutant General of 
the State in which the service was performed.
    (e) Processing annuitants', survivors' or former employees' 
applications for service credit--(1) OPM determines creditable service. 
OPM will determine whether all conditions for crediting the additional 
service have been met, compute the amount of the deposit, and notify the 
individual.
    (2) Computing the deposit. The deposit will be computed based on--
    (i) The appropriate percentage of basic pay that would have been 
deducted from the individual's pay at the time the service was 
performed; and
    (ii) Interest at the rate of 3 percent per year as specified by 
section 8334(e)(2) of title 5, United States Code, to--
    (A) The midpoint of the 24-month installment period or if paid in a 
lump sum, the date payment is made if the individual is an annuitant or 
survivor; or
    (B) The date the deposit is paid or the commencing date of annuity, 
whichever comes first, if the individual is a former employee.
    (3) Individuals who are annuitants or survivors as of November 6, 
1990. (i) OPM will notify annuitants and survivors of the amount of the 
deposit and give them a proposed installment schedule for paying the 
deposit from monthly annuity payments. The proposed installment payments 
will consist of equal monthly payments that will not exceed a period 24 
months from the date a complete written application is received by OPM.
    (ii) The annuitant or survivor may allow the installments to be 
deducted from his or her annuity as proposed or make payment in a lump 
sum within 30 days from the date of the notice.
    (iii) Increased annuity payments will begin to accrue the first day 
of the month after OPM receives a complete written application.
    (iv) If an annuitant dies before completing the deposit installment 
payments, the remaining installments will be deducted as established for 
the annuitant, from benefits payable to the survivor annuitant (but not 
if the only survivor benefit is payable to a child or children of the 
deceased), if any. If no survivor annuity is payable, OPM may collect 
the balance of the deposit from any lump-sum benefits payable or the 
decedent's estate, if any.
    (4) Former employees who separated after December 31, 1968, but 
before November 6, 1990. A former employee with title to a deferred 
annuity that commences after November 6, 1990, will be billed for the 
amount of the deposit due and informed of the procedures for sending 
payments to OPM. If payment is to be made in installments, each payment 
must be at least $50 and the total deposit due must be completed before 
final adjudication of the retirement claim, unless the deposit is deemed 
made when he or she elects an alternative form of annuity.

Sec. 831.404  Procedure for making voluntary contributions.

    (a) To make voluntary contributions to the Civil Service Retirement 
and Disability Fund, an eligible individual must first apply on a form 
prescribed by OPM. OPM will establish a voluntary contribution account 
for each eligible individual who elects to make voluntary contributions 
and notify the individual that a voluntary contribution account has been 
established. An eligible individual may not make voluntary contributions 
until notified by OPM that an account has been so established.
    (b) After receiving notice from OPM under paragraph (a) of this 
section, an eligible individual may forward voluntary contributions to 
the Office of Personnel Management, at the address designated for that 
purpose. Voluntary contributions must be in the amount of

[[Page 103]]

$25 or multiples thereof, by money order, draft, or check payable to 
OPM.
    (c) The total voluntary contributions made by an employee or Member 
may not exceed, as of the date any contribution is received, 10 percent 
of the aggregate basic pay received by the eligible individual.
    (1) Employees are responsible for not exceeding the 10 percent 
limit.
    (2) When the employee retires or withdraws the voluntary 
contributions, OPM will check to determine whether the 10 percent limit 
has been exceeded.
    (3) If the total of voluntary contributions received from the 
employee exceeds the 10 percent limit, OPM will refund without interest 
any amount that exceeds the 10 percent limit.


<R05>

    (a) Interest on voluntary contributions is computed under Sec. 
831.105.

deposited by OPM.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, voluntary 
contributions stop earning interest on the earliest of--
    (1) The date when OPM authorizes payment to the individual of the 
balance as a withdrawal (831.406);
    (2) The date when the employee or Member separates or transfers to a 
position not subject to CSRS or FERS; or
    (3) The date when the employee transfers to a retirement system 
other than CSRS or FERS.
    (d) If an employee separates with entitlement to a deferred annuity 
and either dies without withdrawing his or her voluntary contributions 
or uses his or her voluntary contributions to purchase additional 
annuity, voluntary contributions stop earning interest on the earlier 
of--
    (1) The date the former employee or Member dies; or
    (2) The commencing date of the former employee's or Member's 
deferred annuity.

separation.
    (b) A person entitled to payment of lump-sum benefits under the CSRS 
order for precedence set forth in section 8342(c) of title 5, United 
States Code, is entitled to payment of the balance, if any, on the death 
of--
    (1) An employee or Member;
    (2) A separated employee or Member who has not retired;
    (3) A retiree, unless a survivor benefit is payable based on an 
election under Sec. 831.407; or
    (4) A person receiving a survivor annuity based on voluntary 
contributions.


<R05>
Sec. 831.407  Purchase of additional annuity.

    (a) At the time of retirement CSRS (or under FERS, if transferred 
from CSRS), a person may use the balance of a voluntary contribution 
account to purchase one of the following types of additional annuity:
    (1) Annuity without survivor benefit; or
    (2) Reduced annuity payable during the life of the employee or 
Member with one-half of the reduced annuity to be payable after his or 
her death to a person, named at time of retirement, during the life of 
the named person.
    (b) Any natural person may be designated as survivor under paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section.
    (c) If the applicant for retirement elects an annuity without 
survivor benefit, each $100 credited to his or her voluntary 
contribution account, including interest, purchases an additional 
annuity at the rate of $7 per year, plus 20 cents for each full year, if 
any, he or she is over age 55 at date of retirement.
    (d) If the applicant for retirement elects an annuity with survivor 
benefit, each $100 credited to his or her voluntary contribution 
account, including interest, purchases an additional annuity at the rate 
of $7 per year, plus 20 cents for each full year, if any, he or she is 
over age 55 at date of retirement, multiplied by the following 
percentage:
    (1) Ninety percent of such amount if the named person is the same 
age or

older than the applicant for retirement, or is less than 5 years younger 
than the applicant for retirement;

Sec. 831.502  Automatic separation; exemption.

    (a) When an employee meets the requirements for age retirement on 
any day within a month, he is subject to automatic separation at the end 
of that month. The department or agency shall notify the employee of the 
automatic separation at least 60 days in advance of the separation. If 
the department or agency fails through error to give timely notice, the 
employee may not be separated without his consent until the end of the 
month in which the notice expires.
    (b)(1) The head of the agency, when in his or her judgment the 
public interest so requires, may exempt a law enforcement officer, 
firefighter or nuclear materials courier from automatic separation until 
that employee becomes 60 years of age.
    ((b)(2) The Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of 
Defense, under such regulations as each may prescribe, may exempt an air 
traffic controller having exceptional skills and experience as a 
controller from automatic separation until that controller becomes 61 
years of age.
    (c) When a department or agency lacks authority and wishes to secure 
an exemption from automatic separation for one of its employees other 
than a Presidential appointee, beyond the age(s) provided by statute, 
i.e., age 60 for a law enforcement officer, firefighter or nuclear 
materials courier, age 61 for an air traffic controller, and age 62 for 
an employee of the Alaska Railroad in Alaska or an employee who is a 
citizen of the United States employed on the Isthmus of Panama by the 
Panama Canal Commission, the department or agency head shall submit a 
recommendation to that effect to OPM.
    (1) The recommendation shall contain:
    (i) A statement that the employee is willing to remain in service;
    (ii) A statement of facts tending to establish that his/her 
retention would be in the public interest;
    (iii) The period for which the exemption is desired, which period 
may not exceed 1 year; and,
    (iv) The reasons why the simpler method of retiring the employee and 
immediately reemploying him or her is not being used.
    (2) The recommendation shall be accompanied by a medical certificate 
showing the physical fitness of the employee to perform his or her work.
    (d) OPM may approve an exemption only before the automatic 
separation date applicable to the employee. For this reason, the 
department or agency shall forward the recommendation to OPM at least 30 
days before this separation date.

    (a) General. An employee who would otherwise be eligible for 
retirement based on involuntary separation from the service is not 
entitled to an annuity under section 8336(d)(1) of title 5, United 
States Code, if the employee has declined a reasonable offer of another 
position.
    (b) Criteria for reasonable offer. For the purposes of determining 
entitlement to annuity based on such involuntary separation, the offer 
of a position must meet all of the following conditions to be considered 
a reasonable offer:
    (1) The offer must be made in writing;
    (2) The employee must meet established qualification requirements; 
and
    (3) The offered position must be--
    (i) In the employee's agency, including an agency to which the 
employee with his or her function is transferred in a transfer of 
functions between agencies;
    (ii) Within the employee's commuting area as defined in Sec. 
831.1202 of this part, unless geographic mobility is a condition of the 
employee's employment;
    (iii) Of the same tenure and work schedule; and
    (iv) Not lower than the equivalent of two grades or pay levels below 
the employee's current grade or pay level, without consideration of the 
employee's eligibility to retain his or her current grade or pay under 
part 536 of this chapter or other authority. In movements between pay 
schedules or pay systems, the representative rate of the grade or pay 
level that is two grades below that of the current position shall be 
compared with the representative rate of the grade or pay level of the 
offered position. For this purpose, ``representative rate'' has the 
meaning given that term in Sec. 536.103 of this chapter.

FR 43493, Aug. 17, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 831.603  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    CSRS means subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States 
Code.
    Current spouse means a living person who is married to the employee, 
Member, or retiree at the time of the employee's, Member's, or retiree's 
death.
    Current spouse annuity means a recurring benefit under CSRS that is 
payable (after the employee's, Member's, or retiree's death) to a 
current spouse who meets the requirements of Sec. 831.642.
    Deposit means a deposit required by the Civil Service Retirement 
Spouse Equity Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-615, 98 Stat. 3195. Deposit, as 
used in this subpart does not include a service credit deposit or 
redeposit under sections 8334(c) or (d) of title 5, United States Code.
    First regular monthly payment means the first annuity check payable 
on a recurring basis (other than an estimated payment or an adjustment 
check) after OPM has initially adjudicated the regular rate of annuity 
payable under CSRS and has paid the annuity accrued since the time of 
retirement. The ``first regular monthly payment'' is generally preceded 
by estimated payments before the claim can be adjudicated and by an 
adjustment check (including the difference between the estimated rate 
and the initially adjudicated rate).
    Former spouse means a living person who was married for at least 9 
months to an employee, Member, or retiree who performed at least 18 
months of creditable service in a position covered by CSRS and whose 
marriage to the employee was terminated prior to the death of the 
employee, Member, or retiree. Except in Sec. Sec. 831.682 and 831.683, 
former spouse includes only persons who were married to an employee or 
Member on or after May 7, 1985, or who were the spouse of a retiree who 
retired on or after May 7, 1985, regardless of the date of termination 
of the marriage.
    Former spouse annuity means a recurring benefit under CSRS that is 
payable to a former spouse after the employee's, Member's, or retiree's 
death.
    Fully reduced annuity means the recurring payments under CSRS 
received by a retiree who has elected the maximum allowable reduction in 
annuity to provide a current spouse annuity and/or a former spouse 
annuity or annuities.
    Insurable interest annuity means the recurring payments under CSRS 
to a retiree who has elected a reduction in annuity to provide a 
survivor annuity to a person with an insurable interest in the retiree.
    Marriage means a marriage recognized in law or equity under the 
whole law of the jurisdiction with the most significant interest in the 
marital status of the employee, Member, or retiree unless the law of 
that jurisdiction is contrary to the public policy of the United States. 
If a jurisdiction would recognize more than one marriage in law or 
equity, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will recognize only one 
marriage, but will defer to the local courts to determine which marriage 
should be recognized.
    Member means a Member of Congress.
    Net annuity means the net annuity as defined in Sec. 838.103 of 
this chapter.
    Partially reduced annuity means the recurring payments under CSRS to 
a retiree who has elected less than the maximum allowable reduction in 
annuity to provide a current spouse annuity or a former spouse annuity.
    Present value factor means the amount of money (earning interest at 
an assumed rate) required at the time of retirement to fund an annuity 
that starts out at the rate of $1 a month and is payable in monthly 
installments for the annuitant's lifetime based on mortality rates for 
non-disability annuitants under the Civil Service Retirement System; and 
increases each year at an assumed rate of inflation. Interest, 
mortality, and inflation rates used in computing the present value are 
those used by the Board of Actuaries of the Civil Service Retirement 
System for valuation of the System, based on dynamic assumptions. The 
present value factors are unisex factors obtained by averaging six 
distinct present value factors, weighted by the

[[Page 107]]

total dollar value of annuities typically paid to new retirees at each 
age.
    Qualifying court order means a court order that awards a former 
spouse annuity and that satisfies the requirements of section 8341(h) of 
title 5, United States Code, for awarding a former spouse annuity.
    Retiree means a former employee or Member who is receiving recurring 
payments under CSRS based on service by the employee or Member. 
``Retiree,'' as used in this subpart, does not include a current spouse, 
former spouse, child, or person with an insurable interest receiving a 
survivor annuity.
    Self-only annuity means the recurring unreduced payments under CSRS 
to a retiree with no survivor annuity to anyone.
    Time of retirement means the effective commencing date for a retired 
employee's or Member's annuity.

fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former 
spouse annuity or annuities.
    (b) A married employee or Member retiring under CSRS may elect a

death or remarriage, to continue the reduction to provide or increase a 
former spouse annuity for another former spouse, or to provide or 
increase a current spouse annuity; or
    (2) A qualifying court order requires the retiree to provide another

<R05>
Sec. 831.613  Election of insurable interest annuity.

    (a) At the time of retirement, an employee or Member in good health, 
who is applying for a non-disability annuity, may elect an insurable 
interest annuity. Spousal consent is not required, but an election under 
this section does not exempt a married employee or Member from the 
provisions of Sec. 831.611(a).
    (b) An insurable interest annuity may be elected by an employee or 
Member electing a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity 
to provide a current spouse annuity or a former spouse annuity or 
annuities.
    (c)(1) In the case of a married employee or Member, an election 
under this section may not be made on behalf of a current spouse unless 
that current spouse has consented to an election not to provide a 
current spouse annuity in accordance with Sec. 831.611(a)(1).
    (2) A consent (to an election not to provide a current spouse 
annuity in accordance with Sec. 831.611(a)(1)) required by paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section to be eligible to be the beneficiary of an 
insurable interest annuity is cancelled if--
    (i) The retiree fails to qualify to receive the insurable interest 
annuity; or
    (ii) The retiree changes his or her election to receive an insurable 
interest annuity under Sec. 831.621; or
    (iii) The retiree elects a fully or partially reduced annuity to 
provide a current spouse annuity under Sec. 831.685.

[[Page 109]]

    (3) An election of a partially reduced annuity under Sec. 
831.622(b) or Sec. 831.685 to provide a current spouse annuity for a 
current spouse who is the beneficiary of an insurable interest annuity 
is void unless the spouse consents to the election.
    (4) If a retiree who had elected an insurable interest annuity to 
benefit a current spouse elects a fully reduced annuity to provide a 
current spouse annuity (or, with the consent of the current spouse, a 
partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity) under 
Sec. 831.622(b) or Sec. 831.685, the election of the insurable 
interest annuity is cancelled.
    (5)(i) A retiring employee or Member may not elect a fully reduced 
annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse 
annuity and an insurable interest annuity to benefit the same former 
spouse.
    (ii) If a retiring employee or Member who is required by court order 
to provide a former spouse annuity elects an insurable interest annuity 
to benefit the former spouse with the court-ordered entitlement--
    (A) If the benefit based on the election is greater than or equal to 
the benefit based on the court order, the election of the insurable 
interest annuity will satisfy the requirements of the court order as 
long as the insurable interest annuity continues.
    (B) If the benefit based on the election is less than the benefit 
based on the court order, the election of the insurable interest annuity 
is void.
    (iii) An election under Sec. 831.632 of a fully reduced annuity or 
a partially reduced annuity to benefit a former spouse by a retiree who 
elected and continues to receive an insurable interest annuity to 
benefit that former spouse is void.
    (d) To elect an insurable interest annuity, an employee or Member 
must indicate the intention to make the election on the application for 
retirement; submit evidence to demonstrate that he or she is in good 
health; and arrange and pay for the medical examination that shows that 
he or she is in good health. A report of the medical examination, signed 
and dated by a licensed physician, must be furnished to OPM on such 
forms and at such time and place as OPM may prescribe.
    (e) An insurable interest annuity may be elected to provide a 
survivor benefit only for a person who has an insurable interest in the 
retiring employee or Member.
    (1) An insurable interest is presumed to exist with--
    (i) The current spouse;
    (ii) A blood or adopted relative closer than first cousins;
    (iii) A former spouse;
    (iv) A person to whom the employee or Member is engaged to be 
married;
    (v) A person with whom the employee or Member is living in a 
relationship which would constitute a common-law marriage in 
jurisdictions recognizing common-law marriages.
    (2) When an insurable interest in not presumed, the employee or 
Member must submit affidavits from one or more persons with personal 
knowledge of the named beneficiary's insurable interest in the employee 
or Member. The affidavits must set forth the relationship, if any, 
between the named beneficiary and the employee or Member, the extent to 
which the named beneficiary is dependent on the employee or Member, and 
the reasons why the named beneficiary might reasonably expect to derive 
financial benefit from the continued life of the employee or Member.
    (3) The employee or Member may be required to submit documentary 
evidence to establish the named beneficiary's date of birth.
    (f) After receipt of all required evidence to support an election of 
an insurable interest annuity, OPM will notify the employee or Member of 
initial monthly annuity rates with and without the election of an 
insurable interest annuity and the initial rate payable to the named 
beneficiary. No election of an insurable interest annuity is effective 
unless the employee or Member confirms the election in writing, dies, or 
becomes incompetent no later than 60 days after the date of the notice 
described in this paragraph.
    (g) (1) When an employee or Member elects both an insurable interest 
annuity and a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to 
provide a current spouse annuity and/or a former

[[Page 110]]

spouse annuity or annuities, each reduction is computed based on the 
self-only annuity computation. The combined reduction may exceed the 
maximum 40 percent reduction in the retired employee's or Member's 
annuity permitted under section 8339(k)(1) of title 5, United States 
Code, applicable to insurable interest annuities.
    (2) The rate of annuity paid to the beneficiary of an insurable 
interest election, when the employee or Member also elected a fully 
reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity, equals 55 (or 50 percent 
if based on a separation before October 11, 1962) percent of the rate of 
annuity after the insurable interest reduction. The additional reduction 
to provide a current spouse annuity or a former spouse annuity is not 
considered in determining the rate of annuity paid to the beneficiary of 
the insurable interest election.
    (h)(1) Except as provided in Sec. 831.612(d), if a retiree who is 
receiving a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to 
provide a former spouse annuity has also elected an insurable interest 
annuity to benefit a current spouse and if the eligible former spouse 
remarries before age 55, dies, or loses eligibility under the terms of 
the court order, and no other former spouse is entitled to a survivor 
annuity based on an election made in accordance with Sec. 831.632 or a 
qualifying court order, the retiree may elect, within 2 years after the 
former spouse's remarriage, death, or loss of eligibility under the 
terms of the court order, to convert the insurable interest annuity to a 
fully reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, effective on 
the first day of the month following the event causing the former spouse 
to lose eligibility.
    (2) An election under paragraph (h)(1) of this section cancels any 
consent not to receive a current spouse annuity required by paragraph 
(c) of this section for the current spouse to be eligible for an annuity 
under this section.
    (3) When a former spouse receiving an annuity under section 8341(h) 
of title 5, United States Code, loses eligibility to that annuity, a 
beneficiary of an insurable interest annuity who was the current spouse 
at both the time of the retiree's retirement and death may, within 2 
years after the former spouse's death, remarriage, or loss of 
eligibility under the terms of the court order, elect to receive a 
current spouse annuity instead of the annuity he or she had been 
receiving. The election is effective on the first day of the month 
following the event causing the former spouse to lose eligibility.
    (i) Upon the death of the current spouse, a retiree whose annuity is 
reduced to provide both a current spouse annuity and an insurable 
interest benefit for a former spouse is not permitted to convert the 
insurable interest annuity to a reduced annuity to provide a former 
spouse annuity.
    (j) An employee or Member may name only one natural person as the 
named beneficiary of an insurable interest annuity. OPM will not accept 
the designation of contingent beneficiaries and such a designation is 
void.
    (k)(1) An election under this section is prospectively voided by an 
election of a reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity under 
Sec. 831.631 that would benefit the same person.
    (2)(i) If the spouse is not the beneficiary of the election under 
this section, a retiree may prospectively void an election under this 
section at the time the retiree elects a reduced annuity to provide a 
current spouse annuity under Sec. 831.631.
    (ii) A retiree's election to void an election under paragraph 
(k)(2)(i) of this section must be filed at the same time as the election 
under Sec. 831.631.
    (3) An annuity reduction under this section terminates on the first 
day of the month after the beneficiary of the insurable interest annuity 
dies.

    (1) A judicial determination that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be 
determined; or
    (2) (i) Affidavits by the employee or Member and two other persons, 
at least one of whom is not related to the employee or Member, attesting 
to the inability to locate the current spouse and stating the efforts 
made to locate the spouse; and
    (ii) Documentary corroboration such as tax returns filed separately 
or newspaper stories about the spouse's disappearance.
    (b) The spousal consent requirement will be waived based on 
exceptional circumstances if the employee or Member presents a judicial 
determination finding that--
    (1) The case before the court involves a Federal employee who is in 
the process of retiring from Federal employment and the spouse of that 
employee;
    (2) The nonemployee spouse has been given notice and an opportunity 
to be heard concerning this order;
    (3) The court has considered sections 8339(j)(1) of title 5, United 
States Code, and this section as they relate to waiver of the spousal 
consent requirement for a married Federal employee to elect an annuity 
without a reduction to provide a survivor benefit to a spouse at 
retirement; and
    (4) The court finds that exceptional circumstances exist justifying 
waiver of the nonemployee spouse's consent.

    (a) Except as provided in section 8339 (j) or (k) of title 5, United 
States Code, or Sec. Sec. 831.682, 831.684, 831.685, or paragraph (b) 
of this section, an employee or Member may not revoke or change the 
election or name another survivor later than 30 days after the date of 
the first regular monthly payment.
    (b)(1) Except as provided in Sec. 831.613 and paragraphs (b)(2) and 
(b)(3) of this section, a retiree who was married at the time of 
retirement and has elected a self-only annuity, or a partially reduced 
annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, or a fully reduced annuity 
or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity, or an 
insurable interest annuity may elect, no later than 18 months after the 
time of retirement, an annuity reduction or an increased annuity 
reduction to provide a current spouse annuity.
    (2) A current spouse annuity based on an election under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section cannot be paid if it will, when combined with any 
former spouse annuity or annuities that are required by court order, 
exceed the maximum survivor annuity permitted under Sec. 831.641.
    (3) To make an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the 
retiree must pay, in full, a deposit determined under Sec. 831.662, 
plus interest, at the rate provided under Sec. 831.105(g), no later 
than 18 months after the time of retirement.
    (4) If a retiree makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section and is prevented from paying the deposit within the 18-month 
time limit because OPM did not send him or her a notice of the amount of 
the deposit at least 30 days before the time limit expires, the time 
limit for making the deposit will be extended to 30 days after OPM sends 
the notice of the amount of the deposit.
    (5) An election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, cancels any 
spousal consent under Sec. 831.611 to the extent of the election.
    (6) An election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is void 
unless it is filed with OPM before the retiree dies.
    (7) If a retiree who had elected a fully reduced annuity or a 
partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity or former 
spouse annuities makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section which would cause the combined current spouse annuity and former 
spouse annuity (or annuities) to exceed the maximum allowed under Sec. 
831.641, the former spouse annuity (or annuities) must be reduced to not 
exceed the maximum allowable under Sec. 831.641.

within 2 years after a post-retirement marriage--
    (i) A fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to

section had been in effect continuously since the time of retirement, 
plus 6 percent annual interest, computed under Sec. 831.105, from the

section does not become effective, no deposit under paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section is required.
    (iv) If payment of the deposit under paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section is not required because the election never became effective and 
if some or all of the deposit has been paid, the amount paid will be 
returned to the retiree, or, if the retiree has died, to the person who 
would be entitled to any lump-sum benefits under the order of precedence 
in section 8342 of title 5, United States Code.
    (5) Any reduction in an annuity to provide a current spouse annuity 
will terminate effective on the first day of the month after the

current and former spouse annuities provided by a qualifying court order 
or elected under

[[Page 114]]

Sec. 831.612, Sec. 831.632, or this section to exceed the maximum

Sec. 831.632  Post-retirement election of fully reduced annuity or partially
reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity.

    (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
when the marriage of a retiree who retired on or after May 7, 1985, 
terminates after retirement, he or she may elect in writing a fully 
reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former 
spouse annuity. Such an election must be filed with OPM within 2 years 
after the retiree's marriage to the former spouse terminates.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a 
retiree who retired before May 7, 1985, and whose marriage was 
terminated on or after May 7, 1985, may elect in writing a fully reduced 
annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse 
annuity if the retiree while married to the former spouse had elected, 
prior to May 7, 1985, a reduced annuity to provide a current spouse 
annuity for that spouse. Such an election must be filed with OPM within 
2 years after the retiree's marriage to the former spouse terminates.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a 
retiree who retired on or after May 7, 1985, and before February 27, 
1986, and whose marriage terminated before May 7, 1985, may elect in 
writing a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to 
provide a former spouse annuity. Such an election must be made no later 
than February 27, 1988.
    (b)(1) Qualifying court orders prevent payment of former spouse 
annuities to the extent necessary to comply with the court order and 
Sec. 831.641.
    (2) A retiree who elects a fully or partially reduced annuity to 
provide a former spouse annuity may not elect to provide a former spouse 
annuity in an amount that either--
    (i) Is smaller than the amount required by a qualifying court order; 
or
    (ii) Would cause the sum of all current and former spouse annuities 
based on a retiree's elections under Sec. Sec. 831.611, 831.612, 
831.631 and this section to exceed 55 percent of the rate of the 
retiree's self-only annuity if the retiree's retirement was based on a 
separation from a position under CSRS on or after October 11, 1962, or 
50 percent of the rate of the retiree's self-only annuity if the 
retiree's retirement was based on a separation from a position under 
CSRS before October 11, 1962.

    (i) In the case of a married retiree, if the current spouse does not 
consent to the election on a form as described in Sec. 831.614(c) and 
spousal consent is not waived by OPM in accordance with Sec. 831.618; 
or
    (ii) To the extent that it provides a former spouse annuity for the 
spouse who was married to the retiree at the time of retirement in an 
amount that is inconsistent with any joint designation or waiver made at 
the time of retirement under Sec. 831.611 (a)(1) or (a)(2); or
    (iii) In the case of an election under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, to the extent that it provides a former spouse annuity that 
exceeds the proportion of the retiree's annuity to which the former 
spouse would have been entitled as a current spouse annuity as of May 7, 
1985.
    (c) An election under this section is not permitted unless the 
retiree agrees to deposit the amount equal to the difference between the 
amount of annuity actually paid to the retiree and the amount of annuity 
that would have been paid if the reduction elected under paragraph (a) 
of this section had been in effect continuously since the time of 
retirement, plus 6 percent annual interest, computed under Sec. 
831.105,

[[Page 115]]

from the date when each difference occurred.
    (d) Any reduction in an annuity to provide a former spouse annuity 
will terminate on the first day of the month after the former spouse 
remarries before age 55 or dies, or the former spouse's eligibility for 
a former spouse annuity terminates under the terms of a qualifying court 
order, unless--
    (1) The retiree elects, within 2 years after the event causing the 
former spouse to lose eligibility, to continue the reduction to provide 
or increase a former spouse annuity for another former spouse, or to 
provide or increase a current spouse annuity; or
    (2) A qualifying court order requires the retiree to provide another 
former spouse annuity.
    (e)(1) The amount of the reduction to provide one or more former 
spouse annuities or a combination of a current spouse annuity and one or 
more former spouse annuities under this section equals 2\1/2\ percent of 
the first $3600 of the total designated survivor base plus 10 percent of 
the portion of the total designated survivor base which exceeds $3600, 
if--
    (i) The employee's or Member's separation on which the retirement is 
based was on or after October 11, 1962; or
    (ii) The reduction is to provide a former spouse annuity (under 
Sec. 831.632) for a former spouse whom the employee or Member married 
after retirement.
    (2) The amount of the reduction to provide one or more former spouse 
annuities or a combination of a current spouse annuity and one or more 
former spouse annuities under this section for employees or Members 
whose retirement is based on separations before October 11, 1962, equals 
2\1/2\ percent of the first $2400 of the total designated survivor base 
plus 10 percent of the portion of the total designated survivor base 
which exceeds $2400.

spouse annuities, former spouse annuities, children's survivor 
annuities, and survivor annuities for beneficiaries of insurable 
interest annuities under CSRS begin to accrue on the day after death of 
the employee, Member, or retiree.

[[Page 118]]

    (b)(1) A current spouse annuity begins to accrue--
    (i) Upon attainment of age 50 when, under section 12 of the Civil 
Service Retirement Act Amendments of February 29, 1948, the annuity is 
deferred until age 50; or
    (ii) Upon OPM's receipt of a claim for an annuity authorized for 
unremarried widows and widowers by section 2 of the Civil Service 
Retirement Act Amendments of June 25, 1958, 72 Stat. 218.
    (2) A former spouse annuity begins to accrue--
    (i) For annuities under Sec. 831.683, on the later of the day after 
date of death of the retiree or the first day of the second month after 
the date the application for annuity is received in OPM; or
    (ii) For annuities when a former spouse annuity is authorized by 
court order under section 8341(h) of title 5, United States Code, on the 
later of the day after the date of death of the employee, Member, or 
retiree or the first day of the second month after the court order 
awarding the former spouse annuity and the supporting documentation 
required by Sec. 838.721 or Sec. 838.1005 of this chapter are received 
in OPM.
    (c) A survivor annuity terminates at the end of the month preceding 
death or any other terminating event.
    (d) A current spouse annuity terminated for reasons other than death 
may be restored under conditions defined in sections 8341(e)(2) and 
8341(g) of title 5, United States Code.
    (e) A survivor annuity accrues on a daily basis, one-thirtieth of 
the monthly rate constituting the daily rate. An annuity does not accrue 
for the 31st day of any month, except in the initial month if the 
survivor's (of a deceased employee) annuity commences on the 31st day. 
For accrual purposes, the last day of a 28-day month constitutes 3 days 
and the last day of a 29-day month constitutes 2 days.
    (f) Initial cost-of-living increases on current and former spouse 
annuities, and annuities to beneficiaries of insurable interest 
annuities are prorated under section 8340(c) of title 5, United States 
Code.

under this section is equal to the lesser of--
    (1) The amount of the deposit under Sec. 831.631 or Sec. 831.632 
divided by the present value factor for the retiree's age on the

                          Children's Annuities


<R05>
Sec. 831.671  Proof of eligibility for a child's annuity.

    (a) Proof of paternity. (1) A judicial determination of parentage 
conclusively establishes the paternity of a child.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a child 
born to the wife of a married person is presumed to be the child of the 
wife's husband. This presumption may be rebutted only by clear and 
convincing evidence that the husband is not the father of the child.
    (3) When paternity is not established under paragraph (a)(1) or 
(a)(2) of this section, paternity is determined by a preponderance of 
the credible evidence as defined in Sec. 1201.56(c)(2) of this title.
    (b) Proof of adoption. (1) An adopted child is--
    (i) A child adopted by the employee or retiree before the death of 
the employee or retiree; or
    (ii) A child who lived with the employee or retiree and for whom a 
petition for adoption was filed by the employee or retiree and who is 
adopted by the current spouse of the employee or retiree after the death 
of the employee or retiree.
    (2) The only acceptable evidence to prove status as an adopted child 
under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is a copy of the judicial 
decree of adoption.
    (3) The only acceptable evidence to prove status as an adopted child 
under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section is copies of--
    (i) The petition for adoption filed by the employee or retiree 
(clearly showing the date filed); and
    (ii) The judicial decree of adoption.
    (c) Dependency. To be eligible for survivor annuity benefits, a 
child must have been dependent on the employee or retiree at the time of 
the employee's or retiree's death.
    (d) Proof of dependency. (1) A child is presumed to have been 
dependent on the deceased employee or retiree if he or she is--
    (i) A legitimate child; or
    (ii) An adopted child; or
    (iii) A stepchild or recognized natural child who lived with the 
employee or retiree in a regular parent-child relationship at the time 
of the employee's or retiree's death; or
    (iv) A recognized natural child for whom a judicial determination of 
support was obtained; or
    (v) A recognized natural child to whose support the employee or 
retiree made regular and substantial contributions.
    (2) The following are examples of proofs of regular and substantial 
support. More than one of the following proofs may be required to show 
support of a child who did not live with the employee or retiree in a 
regular parent-child relationship and for whom a judicial determination 
of support was not obtained.
    (i) Evidence of eligibility as a dependent child for benefits under 
other State or Federal programs;
    (ii) Proof of inclusion of the child as a dependent on the 
decedent's income tax returns for the years immediately before the 
employee's or retiree's death;
    (iii) Cancelled checks, money orders, or receipts for periodic 
payments received from the employee or retiree for or on behalf of the 
child;
    (iv) Evidence of goods or services that shows regular contributions 
of considerable value;
    (v) Proof of coverage of the child as a family member under the 
employee's or retiree's Federal Employees Health Benefits enrollment; 
and
    (vi) Other proof of a similar nature that OPM may find to be 
sufficient to demonstrate support or parentage.
    (3) Survivor benefits may be denied--
    (i) If evidence shows that the deceased employee or retiree did not 
recognize the claimant as his or her own despite a willingness to 
support the child; or
    (ii) If evidence casts doubt upon the parentage of the claimant, 
despite the

[[Page 121]]

deceased employee's or retiree's recognition and support of the child.

<R05>
Sec. 831.672  Annuity for a child age 18 to 22 during full-time school attendance.

    (a) General requirements for an annuity. (1) For a child age 18 to 
22 to be eligible to receive an annuity as a full-time student, the 
child must also meet all other requirements applicable to qualify for an 
annuity by a child who has not attained age 18.
    (2) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, OPM must receive certification, in a form prescribed by OPM, 
that the child is regularly pursuing a full-time course of study in an 
accredited institution.
    (b) Full-time course of study. (1) Generally, a full-time course of 
study is a noncorrespondence course which, if successfully completed, 
will lead to completion of the education within the period generally 
accepted as minimum for completion, by a full-time day student, of the 
academic or training program concerned.
    (2) A certification by an accredited institution that the student's 
workload is sufficient to constitute a full-time course of study for the 
program in which the student is enrolled is prima facie evidence that 
the student is pursuing a full-time course of study.
    (c) Certification of school attendance. (1) OPM may periodically 
request the recipient of a child's annuity payments to furnish 
certification of school attendance. The certification must be completed 
in the form prescribed by OPM.
    (2) If OPM requests the recipient of a child's annuity payments to 
provide a self-certification of school attendance, the recipient must 
complete and sign the certification form.
    (3) If OPM requests the recipient of a child's annuity payments to 
provide a certification by the school, the certification must be signed 
by an official who is either in charge of the school or in charge of the 
school's records. OPM will not accept certification forms signed by 
instructors, counselors, aides, roommates, or others not in charge of 
the school or the records.
    (i) If the educational institution is above the high school level, 
the certification must be signed by the president or chancellor, vice 
president or vice chancellor, dean or assistant dean, registrar or 
administrator, assistant registrar or assistant administrator, or the 
equivalent.
    (ii) If the educational institution is at the high school level, the 
certification must be signed by the superintendent of schools, assistant 
superintendent of schools, principal, vice principal, assistant 
principal, or the equivalent.
    (iii) If the educational institution is a technical or trade school, 
the certification must be signed by the president, vice president, 
director, assistant director, or the equivalent.
    (4) OPM will accept a facsimile signature of a school official only 
if it is accompanied by a raised seal of the institution or other 
evidence clearly demonstrating the authenticity of the certification and 
making unauthorized use of the signature stamp unlikely.
    (d) Continuation of annuity during interim breaks. A child's annuity 
continues during interim breaks between school years if the following 
conditions are satisfied:
    (1) The student must have been a full-time student at the end of the 
school term immediately before the break.
    (2) The break between the end of the last term of full-time 
attendance and the return to full-time attendance must not exceed 5 
months. (See Sec. 831.107, concerning calculation of this time period.)
    (3) The recipient of a child's annuity payments must show that the 
student has a bona fide intent to return to school as a full-time 
student immediately after the break. The full-time certification for the 
prior term and the certification (in a form prescribed by OPM) by the 
recipient of a child's annuity payments that the student intends to 
return to school (immediately after the break) as a full-time student 
constitute prima facie evidence of a bona fide intent to return to 
school.
    (e) Benefits after age 22. (1) A student's eligibility for a child's 
annuity

[[Page 122]]

terminates based on reaching age 22 on--
    (i) June 30 of the calendar year of the child's 22nd birthday if the 
child's birthday is before July 1; or
    (ii) The last day of the month before the child's 22nd birthday if 
the child's birthday occurs after June 30 but before September 1 of the 
calendar year; or
    (iii) June 30 of the year after the one in which the child attains 
age 22 if the child's birthday is after August 31 of the calendar year.
    (2)(i) An otherwise eligible child who becomes a full-time student 
after his or her 22nd birthday but before the date the annuity 
terminates under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is eligible for 
annuity while he or she is a full-time student until the termination 
date under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (ii) An otherwise eligible child who is a full-time student, and 
whose parent dies after the child's 22nd birthday but before the date 
the annuity terminates under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, is 
eligible for annuity while he or she is a full-time student after the 
death of the parent until the termination date under paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section.

adoptive parent of that surviving child of the former employee or 
Member.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section,

Code, whenever a deceased employee, Member, or retiree is survived by a 
natural or adoptive parent of that surviving child of the employee, 
Member, or retiree.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the rate of 
annuity payable to a child survivor is computed under section 8341(e)(2) 
(i) through (iii) of title 5, United States Code, with adjustments in 
accordance with section 8340 of title 5, United States Code, when the 
deceased employee, Member, or retiree is not survived by a natural or 
adoptive parent of that surviving child of the former employee or 
Member.
    (e) On the death of a natural or adoptive parent or termination of 
the annuity of a child, the annuity of any other child or children is 
recomputed and paid as though the parent or child had not survived the 
former employee or Member.

<R05>
Sec. 831.682  Election by a retiree who retired before May 7, 1985, 
to provide a former spouse annuity.

    (a) A retiree who retired before May 7, 1985, including a retiree 
receiving a fully reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, 
may elect a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to 
provide a former spouse annuity.
    (b) The election should be made by letter addressed to OPM. The 
election must--
    (1) Be in writing; and
    (2) Agree to pay any deposit due under paragraph (c) of this 
section; and
    (3) Be signed by the retiree; and
    (4) Be filed with OPM before September 8, 1987.
    (c)(1)(i) If a retiree who is receiving an insurable interest 
annuity elects a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity 
under this section to benefit the same person, the insurable interest 
annuity terminates. A retiree who is receiving an insurable interest 
annuity at the time that an annuity is elected under this section does 
not owe any further deposit.
    (ii) If a retiree who had been receiving an insurable interest 
annuity, which was terminated to elect a reduced annuity to provide a 
current spouse annuity for a spouse acquired after retirement, elects to 
provide a former spouse annuity for a former spouse who was the 
beneficiary of the insurable interest annuity, the retiree must deposit 
an amount equal to the sum of the monthly differences between the self-
only annuity and a fully reduced annuity or partially reduced annuity 
(with the same base as elected to provide the former spouse annuity) 
from the date the insurable interest annuity terminated, plus 6 percent 
annual interest, computed under Sec. 831.105, from the date to which 
each monthly difference is attributable.
    (2) A retiree who elects a fully reduced annuity or a partially 
reduced annuity under this section, to provide a former spouse annuity 
for a former spouse for whom the retiree had elected (during the 
marriage to that former spouse) a reduced annuity to provide a current 
spouse annuity, must deposit an amount equal to the sum of the monthly 
differences between the self-only annuity and the amount of annuity that 
would have been in effect had a fully reduced annuity or partially 
reduced annuity (with the same base as elected to provide the former 
spouse annuity) been in effect continuously since the time of 
retirement, plus 6 percent annual interest, computed under Sec. 
831.105, from the date to which each monthly difference is attributable, 
except that the retiree will not be charged for any period during which 
the survivor reduction was in effect for that former spouse.
    (3) A retiree who elects a fully reduced annuity or a partially 
reduced annuity under this section, and is not covered under paragraph 
(c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, must deposit an amount equal to the 
sum of the monthly difference between the self-only annuity and a fully 
reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity (with the same base as 
elected to provide the former spouse annuity) since the time of 
retirement, plus 6 percent annual interest, computed under Sec. 
831.105, from the date to which each monthly difference is attributable.
    (d) If a retiree who is receiving a fully reduced annuity or a 
partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity elects a 
fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity under this section 
to provide a former spouse annuity, the annuity will be reduced 
separately to provide for the current and former spouse annuities. Each 
separate reduction will be computed based on the self-only annuity, and 
the separate reductions are cumulative.
    (e)(1) In response to a retiree's inquiry about providing a former 
spouse annuity under this section, OPM will send an application form. 
The application form will include a notice to retirees that filing the 
application constitutes an official election which cannot be revoked 
after 30 days after the annuity check in which the annuity reduction 
first appears.
    (2) If the retiree returns the application electing a fully reduced 
annuity or a partially reduced annuity under this section, OPM will 
notify the retiree of--
    (i) The rate of the fully reduced annuity or partially reduced 
annuity; and

[[Page 124]]

    (ii) The rate of the potential former spouse annuity; and
    (iii) The amount of the deposit, including interest, that is due as 
of the date that the annuity reduction is scheduled to begin; and
    (iv) The amount and duration of installment payments if no deposit 
is made.
    (3) The notice under paragraph (e)(2) of this section will advise 
the retiree that the deposit will be collected in installments under 
Sec. 831.665, unless lump-sum payment is made within 60 days from the 
date of the notice.
    (4) OPM will reduce the annuity and begin collection of the deposit 
in installments effective with the first check payable more than 60 days 
after the date on the notice required under paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section.
    (f)(1) A retiree who made an election under this section prior to 
September 9, 1986 may modify that election by designating a lesser 
portion of the retiree's annuity be used as the base for the annuity 
reduction and the former spouse annuity.
    (2) Any modification under paragraph (f)(1) of this section must be 
in writing and received in OPM no later than the date provided for 
applications in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (g) The annuity reduction resulting in a fully reduced annuity or 
partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity under this 
section terminates on the first day of the month after the former spouse 
remarries before age 55 or dies.
    (h) A former spouse is eligible to receive only one survivor annuity 
based on the service of one employee or Member.
    (i) If a former spouse is entitled to a former spouse annuity based 
on an election under this section, but absent that election would have 
been entitled to a former spouse annuity under Sec. 831.683 (i.e., 
filed a timely application as well as meeting all other requirements), 
the amount of the former spouse annuity payable will equal 55 percent of 
the annuity of the retiree on whose service the survivor annuity is 
based.

Sec. 831.683  Annuities for former spouses of employees or Members retired before May 7, 1985.

    (a)(1) The former spouse of a retiree who retired before May 7, 1985 
(or of an employee or Member who died before May 7, 1985, was employed 
in a position covered by CSRS at the time of death, and was eligible to 
retire at the time of death), is entitled, after the death of the 
retiree, employee, or Member, to a survivor annuity equal to 55 percent 
of the self-only annuity of the retiree on whose service the survivor 
annuity is based if the former spouse, at the time of application, meets 
all of the following requirements:
    (i) The former spouse's marriage to the retiree, employee, or Member 
was dissolved after September 14, 1978, and before May 8, 1987. The date 
of dissolution of a marriage is the date when the marriage between the 
former spouse and the retiree, employee, or Member ended under the law 
of the jurisdiction that terminated the marriage, rather than the date 
when restrictions on remarriage ended. The date of entry of the decree 
terminating the marriage will be rebuttably presumed to be the date when 
the marriage was dissolved.
    (ii) The former spouse was married to the retiree, employee, or 
Member for at least 10 years of the retiree's, employee's, or Member's 
creditable service. Creditability of service is determined in accordance 
with section 8332 of title 5, United States Code, and subpart C of this 
part.
    (iii) The former spouse has not remarried before reaching age 55.
    (iv) The former spouse applies to OPM for a survivor annuity, in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and Sec. 831.643(b), 
before May 8, 1989.
    (v) The former spouse is at least 50 years old on May 7, 1987, and 
when filing the application.
    (2) A former spouse who is not eligible for an annuity under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section and who is the

[[Page 125]]

former spouse of a retiree who retired before May 7, 1985 (or of an 
employee or Member who died before May 7, 1985, was employed in a 
position covered by CSRS at the time of death, and was eligible to 
retire at the time of death), is entitled, after the death of the 
retiree, employee, or Member, to a survivor annuity equal to 55 percent 
of the self-only annuity of the retiree on whose service the survivor 
annuity is based if the former spouse, at the time of application, meets 
all of the following requirements:
    (i) The former spouse was married to the retiree, employee, or 
Member for at least 10 years of the retiree's, employee's, or Member's 
creditable service. Creditability of service is determined in accordance 
with section 8332 of title 5, United States Code, and subpart C of this 
part.
    (ii) The former spouse has not remarried after September 14, 1978, 
before reaching age 55.
    (iii) The former spouse applies to OPM for a survivor annuity, in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and Sec. 831.643(b), 
before May 8, 1989.
    (iv) The former spouse is at least 50 years old on May 7, 1987, and 
when filing the application.
    (v) No current spouse, other former spouse, or insurable interest 
designee is receiving or has been designated to receive a survivor 
annuity based on the service of the employee, Member, or retiree.
    (3) If two or more eligible former spouses of a retiree, employee, 
or Member apply for annuities under paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
based on the service of the same retiree, employee, or Member, and 
neither meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the 
former spouse whose application OPM receives first is entitled to the 
annuity.
    (b)(1) Application must be filed on the form prescribed for that 
purpose by OPM. The application form will require the former spouse to 
certify under the penalty provided by section 1001 of title 18, United 
States Code, that he or she meets the requirements listed in paragraph 
(a) of this section.
    (2) In addition to the application form required in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the former spouse must submit proof of his or her age 
and the date when the marriage to the retiree commenced, and a certified 
copy of the divorce decree terminating the marriage to the retiree.
    (3)(i) Former spouses applying for benefits under this section must 
meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at the time of 
application.
    (ii) An annuity under this section terminates on the last day of the 
month before the former spouse remarries before age 55 or dies, except 
that a remarriage before September 15, 1978, does not cause termination 
of a former spouse annuity under this section. A former spouse who is 
receiving a former spouse annuity under this section must notify OPM 
within 30 days after he or she remarries before age 55.
    (c) Survivor annuities payable under this section commence on the 
later of the day after the date of death of the retiree or the first day 
of the second month after the application is filed under Sec. 
831.643(b).
    (d) Cost-of-living adjustments under section 8340 of title 5, United 
States Code, are applicable to annuities payable under this section.
    (e) If a former spouse is eligible for a former spouse annuity under 
this section and another current spouse annuity or former spouse annuity 
(under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees 
Retirement System) resulting from the death of the same retiree, the 
annuity under this section will be paid instead of the other current 
spouse annuity or former spouse annuity.

Sec. 831.684  Second chance elections to provide survivor benefits.

    (a) A married retiree who retired before May 7, 1985, and is not 
currently receiving a fully or partially reduced annuity to provide a 
current spouse annuity may elect a fully or partially reduced annuity to 
provide a current spouse annuity for a spouse acquired after retirement 
if the following conditions are met:

[[Page 126]]

    (1) (i) The retiree was married at the time of retirement and did 
not elect a survivor annuity at that time; or
    (ii) The retiree failed to elect a fully or partially reduced 
annuity within 1 year after a post-retirement marriage that occurred 
before November 8, 1984, and the retiree attempted to elect a fully or 
partially reduced annuity after the time limit expired and that request 
was disallowed as untimely.
    (2) The retiree applies for a fully or partially reduced annuity 
under this section before November 9, 1985.
    (3) The retiree agrees to pay the amount due under paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (b) Applications must be filed on the form prescribed by OPM, except 
filing the form is excused when the retiree dies before filing the 
required form if:
    (1) The retiree made a written request, after November 8, 1984, to 
elect a fully or partially reduced annuity under this section, and
    (2) The retiree was denied the opportunity to file the required form 
because the retiree, without fault, did not receive the form in 
sufficient time for the retiree to be reasonably expected to complete 
the form before death.
    (c)(1) In response to a retiree's inquiry about providing a current 
spouse annuity under this section, OPM will send an application form. 
This application will include instructions to assist the retiree in 
estimating the amount of reduction in the annuity to provide the current 
spouse annuity and the amount of the required deposit. The application 
form will include a notice to retirees that filing the application 
constitutes an official election which cannot be revoked after 30 days 
after the annuity check in which the annuity reduction first appears.
    (2) If the retiree returns the application electing a fully or 
partially reduced annuity under this section, OPM will notify the 
retiree of--
    (i) The rate of the fully reduced annuity; and
    (ii) The rate of the potential current spouse annuity; and
    (iii) The amount of the deposit, including interest, that is due as 
of the date that the annuity reduction is scheduled to begin; and
    (iv) The amount and duration of installment payments if no deposit 
is made.
    (3) The notice under paragraph (c)(2) of this section will advise 
the retiree that the deposit will be collected in installments under 
Sec. 831.665, unless lump-sum payment is made within 60 days from the 
date of this notice.
    (4) OPM will reduce the annuity and begin collection of the deposit 
in installments effective with the first check payable more than 60 days 
after the date on the notice required under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section.
    (d) The retiree must state on the application form whether the 
application is made under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section or 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. If the application is made under 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the retiree must prove that he or 
she had attempted to elect a fully reduced annuity and that OPM rejected 
that application because it was filed too late. The proof must consist 
of a copy of OPM's letter rejecting the previous election as untimely 
filed or an affidavit swearing or affirming that he or she made an 
untimely application which OPM rejected. The affidavit is sufficient 
documentation to provide proof of the retiree's attempt to elect a 
reduced annuity, unless the record contains convincing evidence to rebut 
the certification.
    (e) A retiree who elects to provide a current spouse annuity under 
this section must agree to pay a deposit equal to the difference between 
the amount of annuity actually paid to the retiree and the amount of 
annuity that would have been paid if a fully reduced annuity were being 
paid continuously since the time of retirement, plus 6 percent annual 
interest, computed under Sec. 831.105, from the date when each 
difference occurred.
    (f) The rate of a survivor annuity under this section will be 
computed under the laws in effect at the time of the retiree's 
separation from the Federal service.

Sec. 831.685  Changes in elections to provide a current spouse annuity
by a retiree who retired before May 28, 1986.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 831.613 and paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of this section, a retiree who retired before May 28, 1986, was married 
at the time of retirement, and at the time of retirement did not elect a 
fully reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity may elect a 
fully reduced annuity or a greater partially reduced annuity to provide 
a current spouse annuity.
    (b)(1) An election under paragraph (a) of this section may be made 
only by a retiree who is married to the same spouse to whom the retiree 
was married at the time of retirement.
    (2) A current spouse annuity based on an election under paragraph 
(a) of this section cannot be paid if it will, when combined with any 
former spouse annuity or annuities that are required by court order, 
exceed the maximum survivor annuity permitted under Sec. 831.641.
    (3)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, to 
make an election under paragraph (a) of this section, the retiree must 
pay the deposit computed under Sec. 831.662, in full, no later than 
November 28, 1987.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, failure 
to pay the deposit, in full, before November 29, 1987, voids an election 
made under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (4) If a retiree makes an election under paragraph (a) of this 
section and is prevented from paying the deposit within the 18-month 
time limit because OPM did not send him or her a notice of the amount of 
the deposit at least 30 days before the time limit expires, the time 
limit for making the deposit will be extended to 30 days after OPM sends 
the notice of the amount of the deposit.
    (5) For a retiree whose annuity commenced on or after May 7, 1985, 
an election under paragraph (a) of this section cancels any spouse 
consent under Sec. 831.611 to the extent of the election.
    (c) If a retiree who had elected a fully reduced annuity or a 
partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity makes an 
election under paragraph (a) of this section that would cause the 
combined current spouse annuity and former spouse annuity (or annuities) 
to exceed the maximum allowed under Sec. 831.641, the former spouse 
annuity (or annuities) must be reduced to conform with that allowed 
under Sec. 831.641.
    (d) An election under paragraph (a) of this section is void unless 
it is filed with OPM before the retiree dies.

    (2) An employee or Member retiring due to a disability; and
    (3) An employee or Member retiring after serving three days or less

    (2) Any cost-of-living increases in the State benefit shall require 
a corresponding deduction in the civil service annuity.
    (3) Any cost-of-living increase to a civil service annuity shall 
apply to the gross annuity before deduction for benefits under any State 
retirement system.
    (b) In the adjudication of claims arising under subchapter III of

<R05>
Sec. 831.703  Computation of annuities for part-time service.

    (a) Purpose. The computational method in this section shall be used 
to determine the annuity for an employee who has part-time service on or 
after April 7, 1986.
    (b) Definitions. In this section--
    Full-time service means any actual service in which the employee is 
schedule to work the number of hours and days required by the 
administrative workweek for his or her grade or class (normally 40 
hours).
    Intermittent service means any actual service performed with no 
prescheduled regular tour of duty.
    Part-time service means any actual service performed on a less than 
full-time basis, by an individual whose appointment describes a 
regularly scheduled tour of duty, and any period of time credited as non 
pay status time under 5 U.S.C. 8332(f), which follows a period of part-
time service without any intervening period of actual service other than 
part-time service. This definition is not limited to part-time career 
employment because it includes part-time temporary employment as well.
    Post-April 6, 1986 average pay means the largest annual rate 
resulting from averaging, over any period of 3 consecutive years of 
creditable service, the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable 
for full-time service by an employee during that period, with each rate 
weighted by the time it was in effect, except that for periods of 
service before April 7, 1986, the actual rate of basic pay based on the 
employee's established tour of duty, if different, is used in the 
computation. The rates of pay included in the computation for 
intermittent service or temporary service performed on a full-time basis 
are the actual rates of basic pay during those periods of creditable 
service.
    Pre-April 7, 1986, average pay means the largest annual rate 
resulting from averaging, over any period of 3 consecutive years of 
creditable service, an employee's actual rates of basic pay during that 
period, with each rate weighted by the time it was in effect.
    Proration factor means a fraction expressed as a percentage rounded 
to the nearest percent. The numerator is the sum of the number of hours 
the employee actually worked during part-time service, and the 
denominator is the sum of the number of hours that a full-time employee 
would be schedule to work during the same period of service included in 
the numerator. If an employee has creditable service in addition to 
part-time service (full-time service, intermittent service, or temporary 
service performed on a full-time basis), such service must be included 
in the numerator and denominator of the

[[Page 129]]

fraction. In general, this is done by including the number of days of 
such intermittent service, multiplied by 8, and the number of weeks of 
such temporary service or full-time service, multiplied by 40 in both 
the numerator and the denominator. The additional credit for unused sick 
leave under 5 U.S.C. 8339(m) is not included in the fraction.
    Temporary service means service under an appointment limited to one 
year or less, exclusive of intermittent service.
    (c) Pre-April 7, 1986, basic annuity. The partial annuity for pre-
April 7, 1986, service is computed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8339 
using the pre-April 7, 1986, average pay and length of service 
(increased by the unused sick leave credit at time of retirement) prior 
to April 7, 1986.
    (d) Post-April 6, 1986, basic annuity. The partial annuity for post-
April 6, 1986, service is computed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8339 
using the post-April 6, 1986, average pay and length of service after 
April 6, 1986. This amount is then multiplied by the proration factor.
    (e) Combined basic annuity. The combined basic annuity is equal to 
the sum of the partial annuity amounts computed under paragraphs (c) and 
(d). This amount is the yearly rate of annuity (on which the monthly 
rate is based) before reductions for retirement before age 55; pre-
October 1, 1982, nondeduction service and survivor benefits; or the 
reduction for an alternative annuity under section 204 of Pub. L 99-335.
    (f) Limitations. The use of the post-April 6, 1986, average pay is 
limited to the purposes stated in this section. It may not be used as 
the basis for computing:
    (1) The 80-percent limit on annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8339(f);
    (2) The minimum annuity amount under 5 U.S.C. 8339(e) (concerning 
air traffic controller annuity) or 5 U.S.C. 8339(g) (concerning 
disability annuity); or
    (3) A supplemental annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8344(a).

    (a) An annuity that includes credit for service with a 
nonappropriated fund instrumentality performed after December 31, 1965, 
based on an election under 5 CFR part 847, subpart D, is computed under 
5 CFR part 847, subpart F.
    (b) An annuity that includes credit for service with a 
nonappropriated fund instrumentality based on an election under 5 CFR 
part 847, subpart H, is computed under 5 CFR part 847, subpart I.

computation of annuity.
    (b) The regulations in this subpart are issued pursuant to the 
authority given to OPM in 5 U.S.C. 8347 to prescribe regulations to 
carry out 5 U.S.C., chapter 83, subchapter III, and in 5 U.S.C. 1104 to 
delegate authority for personnel management to the heads of agencies.

Sec. 831.802  Definitions.

    In this subpart--
    Agency head means the Secretary of Energy. For purposes of this 
subpart, agency head is also deemed to include the designated 
representative of the Secretary of Energy, except that the designated 
representative must be a department headquarters-level official who 
reports directly to the Secretary of Energy, or to the Deputy Secretary

[[Page 130]]

of Energy, and who is the sole such representative for the entire 
department.
    Nuclear materials courier means an employee of the Department of 
Energy, the duties of whose position are primarily to transport, and 
provide armed escort and protection during transit of, nuclear weapons, 
nuclear weapon components, strategic quantities of special nuclear 
materials or other materials related to national security, including an 
employee engaged in this activity who is transferred directly to a 
supervisory or administrative position within the same Department of 
Energy organization, after performing this activity for at least 3 
years. (See 5 U.S.C. 8331(27).)
    Primary duties are those duties of a position that--
    (1)(i) Are paramount in influence or weight; that is, constitute the 
basic reasons for the existence of the position;

over a typical work cycle; and
    (iii) Are assigned on a regular and recurring basis.
    (2) Duties that are of an emergency, incidental, or temporary nature 
cannot be considered primary even if they meet the substantial portion 
of time criterion. In general, if an employee spends an average of at 
least 50 percent of his or her time performing a duty or group of 
duties, they are his or her primary duties.
    Primary position means a position that is in an organization of the 
Department of Energy and whose primary duties are to transport, and 
provide armed escort and protection during transit of, nuclear weapons, 
nuclear weapon components, strategic quantities of special nuclear

    (1) Is clearly in the nuclear materials transportation field;
    (2) Is in an organization of the Department of Energy having a 
nuclear materials transportation mission; and
    (3) Is either--
    (i) Supervisory; i.e., a position whose primary duties are as a 
first-level supervisor of nuclear materials couriers in primary 
positions; or
    (ii) Administrative; i.e., an executive, managerial, technical, 
semiprofessional, or professional position for which experience in a 
primary nuclear materials courier position is a prerequisite.

    (a) An employee's service in a position that has been determined by 
the Secretary of the Department of Energy to be a primary nuclear 
materials courier position is covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
8336(c).
    (b) An employee who is not in a primary position, nor covered while 
in a secondary position, and who is detailed or temporarily promoted to 
a primary position is not covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
8336(c).


<R05>
Sec. 831.804  Conditions for coverage in secondary positions.

    (a) An employee's service in a position that has been determined by 
the Secretary of the Department of Energy to be a secondary nuclear 
materials courier position following 3 years of service in a primary 
nuclear materials courier position is covered under the provisions of 5 
U.S.C. 8336(c) if all of the following criteria are met:
    (1) The employee is transferred directly (i.e., without a break in 
service exceeding 3 days) from a primary position to a secondary 
position; and
    (2) If applicable, the employee has been continuously employed in 
secondary positions since transferring from a primary position without a 
break in service exceeding 3 days, except that a break in employment in 
secondary positions which begins with an involuntary separation (not for 
cause), within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8336(d)(1), is not considered in 
determining whether the service in secondary positions is continuous for 
this purpose.
    (b) An employee who is not in a primary position, nor covered while 
in a secondary position, and who is detailed or temporarily promoted to 
a secondary position is not covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
8336(c).

[[Page 131]]


<R05>
Sec. 831.805  Evidence.

    (a) The Secretary of Energy's determination under Sec. 831.803 that 
a position is a primary position must be based solely on the official 
position description of the position in question, and any other official 
description of duties and qualifications. The official documentation for 
the position must establish that it satisfies the requirements defined 
in Sec. 831.802.
    (b) A determination under Sec. 831.804 must be based on the 
official position description and any other evidence deemed appropriate 
by the agency head for making the determination.
    (c) If an employee is in a position not subject to the one-half 
percent higher withholding rate of 5 U.S.C. 8334(a)(1), and the employee 
does not, within 6 months after entering the position or after any 
significant change in the position, formally and in writing seek a 
determination from the employing agency that his or her service is 
properly covered by the higher withholding rate, the agency head's 
determination that the service was not so covered at the time of the 
service is presumed to be correct. This presumption may be rebutted by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the employee was unaware of his or 
her status or was prevented by cause beyond his or her control from 
requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service 
was performed.


<R05>
Sec. 831.806  Requests from individuals.

    (a) An employee who requests credit for service under 5 U.S.C. 
8336(c) bears the burden of proof with respect to that service, and must 
provide the employing agency with all pertinent information regarding 
duties performed.
    (b) An employee who is currently serving in a position that has not 
been approved as a primary or secondary position, but who believes that 
his or her service is creditable as service in a primary or secondary 
position may request the agency head to determine whether or not the 
employee's current service should be credited and, if it qualifies, 
whether it should be credited as service in a primary or secondary 
position. A written request for current service must be made within 6 
months after entering the position or after any significant change in 
the position.
    (c) A current or former employee (or the survivor of a former 
employee) who believes that a period of past service in an unapproved 
position qualifies as service in a primary or secondary position and 
meets the conditions for credit may request the agency head to determine 
whether or not the employee's past service should be credited and, if it 
qualifies, whether it should be credited as service in a primary or 
secondary position. A written request for past service must be made no 
later than December 31, 2000.
    (d) The agency head may extend the time limit for filing under 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section when, in the judgment of such 
agency head, the individual shows that he or she was prevented by 
circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within 
the time limit.


<R05>
Sec. 831.807  Withholdings and contributions.

    (a) During the service covered under the conditions established by 
Sec. 831.803 and Sec. 831.804, the Department of Energy will deduct 
and withhold from the employee's base pay the amount required under 5 
U.S.C. 8334(a) for such positions and submit that amount, together with 
agency contributions required by 5 U.S.C. 8334(a), to OPM in accordance 
with payroll office instructions issued by OPM.
    (b) If the correct withholdings and/or Government contributions are 
not submitted to OPM for any reason whatsoever, including cases in which 
it is finally determined that past service of a current or former 
employee was subject to the higher deduction and Government contribution 
rates, the Department of Energy must correct the error by submitting the 
correct amounts (including both employee and agency shares) to OPM as 
soon as possible. Even if the Department of Energy waives collection of 
the overpayment of pay under any waiver authority that may be available 
for this purpose, such as 5 U.S.C. 5584, or otherwise fails to collect 
the debt, the correct amount must still be submitted to OPM without 
delay as soon as possible.

[[Page 132]]

    (c) Upon proper application from an employee, former employee or 
eligible survivor of a former employee, the Department of Energy will 
pay a refund of erroneous additional withholdings for service that is 
found not to have been covered service. If an individual has paid to OPM 
a deposit or redeposit, including the additional amount required for 
covered service, and the deposit or redeposit is later determined to be 
erroneous because the service was not covered service, OPM will pay the 
refund, upon proper application, to the individual, without interest.
    (d) The additional employee withholding and agency contribution for 
covered or creditable service properly made as required under 5 U.S.C. 
8334(a)(1) or deposited under 5 U.S.C. 8334(c) are not separately 
refundable, even in the event that the employee or his or her survivor 
does not qualify for a special annuity computation under 5 U.S.C. 
8339(d).
    (e) While an employee who does not hold a primary or secondary 
position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a primary or secondary 
position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will not 
be made. While an employee who does hold a primary or secondary position 
is detailed or temporarily promoted to a position which is not a primary 
or secondary position, the additional withholdings and agency 
contributions will continue to be made.


<R05>
Sec. 831.808  Mandatory separation.

    (a) Effective on and after October 17, 1999, the mandatory 
separation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8335(b) apply to all nuclear materials 
couriers in primary and secondary positions. A mandatory separation 
under 5 U.S.C. 8335(b) is not an adverse action under part 752 of this 
chapter or a removal action under part 359 of this chapter. Section 
831.502 provides the procedures for requesting an exemption from 
mandatory separation.
    (b) In the event an employee is separated mandatorily under 5 U.S.C. 
8335(b), or is separated for optional retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c), 
and OPM finds that all or part of the minimum service required for 
entitlement to immediate annuity was in a position which did not meet 
the requirements of a primary or secondary position and the conditions 
set forth in this subpart, such separation will be considered erroneous.


<R05>
Sec. 831.809  Reemployment.

    An employee who has been mandatorily separated under 5 U.S.C. 
8335(b) is not barred from reemployment in any position except a primary 
position after age 60. Service by a reemployed annuitant is not covered 
by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c).


<R05>
Sec. 831.810  Review of decisions.

    The following decisions may be appealed to the Merit Systems 
Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board:
    (a) The final decision of the Department of Energy issued to an 
employee, former employee, or survivor as the result of a request for 
determination filed under Sec. 831.806; and
    (b) The final decision of the Department of Energy that a break in 
service referred to in Sec. 831.804(a)(2) did not begin with an 
involuntary separation within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8336(d)(1).


<R05>
Sec. 831.811  Oversight of coverage determinations.

    (a) Upon deciding that a position is a nuclear materials courier 
position, the agency head must notify OPM (Attention: Associate Director 
for Retirement and Insurance) stating the title of each position, the 
number of incumbents, and whether the position is primary or secondary. 
The Director of OPM retains the authority to revoke the agency head's 
determination that a position is a primary or secondary position, or 
that an individual's service in any other position is creditable under 5 
U.S.C. 8336(c).
    (b) The Department of Energy must establish a file containing each 
coverage determination made by the agency head under Sec. 831.803 and 
Sec. 831.804, and all background material used in making the 
determination.
    (c) Upon request by OPM, the Department of Energy will make 
available the entire coverage determination file for OPM to audit to 
ensure compliance with the provisions of this subpart.
    (d) Upon request by OPM, the Department of Energy must submit to OPM 
a

list of all covered positions and any other pertinent information 
requested.

    Source: 58 FR 64367, Dec. 7, 1993, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 831.901  Applicability and purpose.

    (a) This subpart contains regulations of the Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) to supplement 5 U.S.C. 8336(c), which establishes 
special retirement eligibility for law enforcement officers and 
firefighters employed under the Civil Service Retirement System; 5 
U.S.C. 8331(3) (C) and (D), pertaining to basic pay; 5 U.S.C. 8334(a) 
(1) and (c), pertaining to deductions, contributions, and deposits; 5 
U.S.C. 8335(b), pertaining to mandatory retirement; and 5 U.S.C. 
8339(d), pertaining to computation of annuity.
    (b) The regulations in this subpart are issued pursuant to the 
authority given to OPM in 5 U.S.C. 8347 to prescribe regulations to 
carry out subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 of the United States 
Code, and in 5 U.S.C. 1104 to delegate authority for personnel 
management to the heads of agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 831.902  Definitions.

    In this subpart--
    Agency head means, for the executive branch agencies, the head of an 
executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105; for the legislative branch, 
the Secretary of the Senate, the Clerk of the House of Representatives, 
or the head of any other legislative branch agency; for the judicial 
branch, the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts; 
for the Postal Service, the Postmaster General; and for any other 
independent establishment that is an entity of the Federal Government, 
the head of the establishment. For the purpose of an approval of 
coverage under this subpart, agency head is also deemed to include the 
designated representative of the head of an executive department as 
defined in 5 U.S.C. 101, except that the designated representative must 
be a department headquarters-level official who reports directly to the 
executive department head, or to the deputy department head, and who is 
the sole such representative for the entire department. For the purpose 
of a denial of coverage under this subpart, agency head is also deemed 
to include the designated representative of the agency head, as defined 
in the first sentence of this definition, at any level within the 
agency.
    Detention duties means duties that require frequent direct contact 
in the detention, direction, supervision, inspection, training, 
employment, care, transportation, or rehabilitation of individuals 
suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the 
United States or the District of Columbia or offenses against the 
punitive articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 
chapter 47). (See 5 U.S.C. 8331(20).)
    Firefighter means an employee, whose duties are primarily to perform 
work directly connected with the control and extinguishment of fires or 
the maintenance and use of firefighting apparatus and equipment. Also 
included in this definition is an employee engaged in this activity who 
is transferred to a supervisory or administrative position. (See 5 
U.S.C. 8331(21).) An employee whose primary duties are the performance 
of routine fire prevention inspection is excluded from this definition.
    Frequent direct contact means personal, immediate, and regularly-
assigned contact with detainees while performing detention duties, which 
is repeated and continual over a typical work cycle.
    Law enforcement officer means an employee, the duties of whose 
position are primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of 
individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws 
of the United States, including an employee engaged in this activity who 
is transferred to a supervisory or administrative position. (See 5 
U.S.C. 8331(20).) The definition does not include an employee whose 
primary duties involve maintaining law and order, protecting life and 
property, guarding against or inspecting for violations of law, or 
investigating persons other than persons who are suspected or convicted 
of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States.
    Primary duties are those duties of a position that--

[[Page 134]]

    (1) (i) Are paramount in influence or weight; that is, constitute 
the basic reasons for the existence of the position;
    (ii) Occupy a substantial portion of the individual's working time 
over a typical work cycle; and
    (iii) Are assigned on a regular and recurring basis.
    (2) Duties that are of an emergency, incidental, or temporary nature 
cannot be considered ``primary'' even if they meet the substantial 
portion of time criterion. In general, if an employee spends an average 
of at least 50 percent of his or her time performing a duty or group of 
duties, they are his or her primary duties.
    Primary position means a position whose primary duties are:
    (1) To perform work directly connected with controlling and 
extinguishing fires or maintaining and using firefighter apparatus and 
equipment; or
    (2) Investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals 
suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the 
United States.
    Secondary position means a position that:
    (1) Is clearly in the law enforcement or firefighting field;
    (2) Is in an organization having a law enforcement or firefighting 
mission; and
    (3) Is either--
    (i) Supervisory; i.e., a position whose primary duties are as a 
first-level supervisor of law enforcement officers or firefighters in 
primary positions; or
    (ii) Administrative; i.e., an executive, managerial, technical, 
semiprofessional, or professional position for which experience in a 
primary law enforcement or firefighting position, or equivalent 
experience outside the Federal government, is a prerequisite.

<R05>
Sec. 831.903  Conditions for coverage in primary positions.

    (a) An employee's service in a position that has been determined by 
the employing agency head to be a primary law enforcement officer or 
firefighter position is covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
8336(c).
    (b) An employee who is not in a primary position, nor covered while 
in a secondary position, and who is detailed or temporarily promoted to 
a primary position is not covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
8336(C)


<R05>
Sec. 831.904  Conditions for coverage in secondary positions.

    (a) An employee's service in a position that has been determined by 
the employing agency head to be a secondary law enforcement officer or 
firefighter position is covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) 
if all of the following criteria are met:
    (1) The employee is transferred directly (i.e., without a break in 
service exceeding 3 days) from a primary position to a secondary 
position; and
    (2) If applicable, the employee has been continuously employed in 
secondary positions since transferring from a primary position without a 
break in service exceeding 3 days, except that a break in employment in 
secondary positions which begins with an involuntary separation (not for 
cause), within the meaning of 8336(d)(1) of title 5, United States Code, 
is not considered in determining whether the service in secondary 
positions is continuous for this purpose.
    (b) This requirement for continuous employment in a secondary 
position applies only to voluntary breaks in service beginning after 
January 19, 1988.
    (c) An employee who is not in a primary position, nor covered while 
in a secondary position, and who is detailed or temporarily promoted to 
a secondary position is not covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
8336(c).
    (d) The service of an employee who is in a position on January 19, 
1988, that has been approved as a secondary position under this subpart 
will continue to be covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) as 
long as the employee remains in that position without a voluntary break 
in service, and coverage is not revoked by OPM under Sec. 831.911, or 
by the agency head.

[[Page 135]]


<R05>
Sec. 831.905  Evidence.

    (a) An agency head's determination that a position is a primary 
position must be based solely on the official position description of 
the position in question, and any other official description of duties 
and qualifications. The official documentation for the position must 
establish that it satisfies the requirements defined in Sec. 831.902.
    (b) A determination under Sec. 831.904 must be based on the 
official position description and any other evidence deemed appropriate 
by the agency head for making the determination.


<R05>
Sec. 831.906  Requests from individuals.

    (a) An employee who requests credit for service under 5 U.S.C. 
8336(c) bears the burden of proof with respect to that service, and must 
provide the employing agency with all pertinent information regarding 
duties performed, including--
    (1) For law enforcement officers, a list of the provisions of 
Federal criminal law the incumbent is responsible for enforcing and 
arrests made; and
    (2) For firefighters, number of fires fought, names of fires fought, 
dates of fires, and position occupied while on firefighting duty.
    (b) An employee who is currently serving in a position that has not 
been approved as a primary or secondary position, but who believes that 
his or her service is creditable as service in a primary or secondary 
position may request the agency head to determine whether or not the 
employee's service should be credited and, if it qualifies, whether it 
should be a primary or secondary position.
    (c) A current or former employee (or the survivor of a former 
employee) who believes that a period of past service in an unapproved 
position qualifies as service in a primary or secondary position and 
meets the conditions for credit must follow the procedure in paragraph 
(b) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the request must be made to the agency where the claimed 
service was performed.
    (d) For a current or former employee seeking credit under 5 U.S.C. 
8336(c) for service performed at an agency that is no longer in 
existence, and for which there is no successor agency, OPM will accept, 
directly from the current or former employee (or the survivor of a 
former employee), a request for a determination as to whether a period 
of past service qualifies as service in a primary or secondary position 
and meets the conditions for credit.
    (e) Coverage in a position or credit for past service will not be 
granted for a period greater than 1 year prior to the date that the 
request from an individual is received under paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) 
of this section by the employing agency, the agency where past service 
was performed, or OPM.
    (f) An agency head, in the case of a request filed under paragraph 
(b) or (c) of this section, or OPM, in the case of request filed under 
paragraph (d) of this section, may extend the time limit for filing 
when, in the judgment of such agency head or OPM, the individual shows 
that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control 
from making the request within the time limit.


<R05>
Sec. 831.907  Withholdings and contributions.

    (a) During the service covered under the conditions established by 
Sec. 831.903 and Sec. 831.904, the employing agency will deduct and 
withhold from the employee's base pay the amount required under 5 U.S.C. 
8334(a) for such positions and submit that amount, together with agency 
contributions required by 5 U.S.C. 8334(a), to OPM in accordance with 
payroll office instructions issued by OPM.
    (b) If the correct withholdings and/or Government contributions are 
not submitted to OPM for any reason whatsoever, including cases in which 
it is finally determined that past service of a current or former 
employee was subject to the higher deduction and Government contribution 
rates, the employing agency must correct the error by submitting the 
correct amounts (including both employee and agency shares) to OPM as 
soon as possible. Even if the agency waives collection of the 
overpayment of pay under any waiver authority that may be available for 
this purpose, such as 5 U.S.C. 5584, or otherwise fails to collect the 
debt,

[[Page 136]]

the correct amount must still be submitted to OPM without delay as soon 
as possible.
    (c) Upon proper application from an employee, former employee or 
eligible survivor of a former employee, an employing agency or former 
employing agency will pay a refund of erroneous additional withholdings 
for service that is found not to have been covered service. If an 
individual has paid to OPM a deposit or redeposit, including the 
additional amount required for covered service, and the deposit or 
redeposit is later determined to be erroneous because the service was 
not covered service, OPM will pay the refund, upon proper application, 
to the individual, without interest.
    (d) The additional employee withholding and agency contribution for 
covered or creditable service properly made as required under 5 U.S.C. 
8334(a)(1) or deposited under 5 U.S.C. 8334(c) are not separately 
refundable, even in the event that the employee or his or her survivor 
does not qualify for a special annuity computation under 5 U.S.C. 
8339(d).
    (e) While an employee who does not hold a primary or secondary 
position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a primary or secondary 
position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will not 
be made. While an employee who does hold a primary or secondary position 
is detailed or temporarily promoted to a position which is not a primary 
or secondary position, the additional withholdings and agency 
contributions will continue to be made.

<R05>
Sec. 831.908  Mandatory separation.

    (a) The mandatory separation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8335(b) apply to 
all law enforcement officers and firefighters in primary and secondary 
positions. A mandatory separation under section 8335(b) is not an 
adverse action under part 752 of this chapter or a removal action under 
part 359 of this chapter. Section 831.502 provides the procedures for 
requesting an exemption from mandatory separation.
    (b) In the event an employee is separated mandatorily under 5 U.S.C. 
8335(b), or is separated for optional retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c), 
and OPM finds that all or part of the minimum service required for 
entitlement to immediate annuity was in a position which did not meet 
the requirements of a primary or secondary position and the conditions 
set forth in this subpart, such separation will be considered erroneous.

<R05>
Sec. 831.909  Reemployment.

    An employee who has been mandatorily separated under 5 U.S.C. 
8335(b) is not barred from reemployment in any position except a primary 
position after age 60. Service by a reemployed annuitant is not covered 
by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c).


<R05>
Sec. 831.910  Review of decisions.

    (a) The final decision of an agency head or OPM issued to an 
employee, former employee, or survivor as the result of a request for 
determination filed under Sec. 831.906 may be appealed to the Merit 
Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board.
    (b) The final decision of an agency head that a break in service 
referred to in Sec. 831.904(a)(2) did not begin with an involuntary 
separation within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8336(d)(1) may be appealed to 
the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the 
Board.

[66 FR 38524, July 25, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 831.911  Oversight of coverage determinations.

    (a) Upon deciding that a position is a law enforcement officer or 
firefighter position, each agency head must notify OPM (Attention: 
Associate Director for Retirement and Insurance) stating the title of 
each position, the number of incumbents, and whether the position is 
primary or secondary. The Director of OPM retains the authority to 
revoke an agency head's determination that a position is a primary or 
secondary position, or that an individual's service in any other 
position is creditable under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c).

[[Page 137]]

    (b) Each agency must establish a file containing each coverage 
determination made by an agency head under Sec. 831.903 and Sec. 
831.904, and all background material used in making the determination.
    (c) Upon request by OPM, the agency will make available the entire 
coverage determination file for OPM to audit to ensure compliance with 
the provisions of this subpart.
    (d) Upon request by OPM, an agency must submit to OPM a list of all 
covered positions and any other pertinent information requested.
    (e) A coverage determination issued by OPM or its predecessor, the 
Civil Service Commission, will not be reopened by an employing agency, 
unless the agency head determines that new and material evidence is 
available that, despite due diligence, was not available before the 
decision was issued.

             Regulations Pertaining to Noncodified Statutes


<R05>
Sec. 831.912  Elections to be deemed a law enforcement officer for
retirement purposes by certain police officers employed

by the Metropolitan Washington  Airports Authority (MWAA).

    (a) Who may elect. Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) 
police officers employed as members of the MWAA police force as of 
December 21, 2000, who are covered by the provisions of the Civil 
Service Retirement System by 49 U.S.C. 49107(b) may elect to be deemed a 
law enforcement officer for retirement purposes and have past service as 
a member of the MWAA and Federal Aviation Administration police forces 
credited as law enforcement officer service.
    (b) Procedure for making an election. Elections by an MWAA police 
officer to be treated as a law enforcement officer for retirement 
purposes must be made in writing to the MWAA and filed in the employee's

OASDI tax.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1005  Offset from nondisability annuity.

would be entitled, to old-age benefits under title II of the Social 
Security Act.
    (b) The reduction required under paragraph (a) of this section is 
effective on the 1st day of the month during which the employee--
    (1) Is entitled to an annuity under CSRS; and
    (2) Is entitled, or on proper application would be entitled, to old-
age benefits under title II of the Social Security Act.
    (c) Subject to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the amount of 
the reduction required under paragraph (a) of this section is the lesser 
of--
    (1) The difference between--
    (i) The Social Security old-age benefit for the month referred to in 
paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (ii) The old-age benefit that would be payable to the individual for 
the month referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, excluding all 
wages from Federal service, and assuming the annuitant was fully insured 
(as defined by section 215(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
414(a)); or
    (2) The product of--
    (i) The old-age benefit to which the individual is entitled or 
would, on proper application, be entitled; and
    (ii) A fraction--
    (A) The numerator of which is the annuitant's total Federal service, 
rounded to the nearest whole number of years not exceeding 40 years; and
    (B) The denominator of which is 40.
    (d) Cost-of-living adjustments under 5 U.S.C. 8340 occurring after 
the effective date of the reduction required under paragraph (a) of this 
section will be based on only the annuity remaining after reduction 
under this subpart.
    (e) The amounts for paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(2)(i) 
of this section are computed without regard to subsections (b) through 
(l) of section 203 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 403) (relating 
to reductions in Social Security benefits), and without applying the 
provisions of the second sentence of section 215(a)(7)(B)(i) or section 
214(d)(5)(ii) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(a)(7)(B)(i) or 
415(d)(5)(ii) (relating to part of the computation of the Social 
Security windfall elimination provisions).
    (f) OPM will accept the determination of the Social Security 
Administration, submitted in a form prescribed by OPM, concerning

<R05>
Sec. 831.1006  Offset from disability or survivor annuity.

    (a) OPM will reduce the disability annuity (an annuity under 5 
U.S.C. 8337) of an individual who performed Federal service, if the 
individual is (or would on proper application be) entitled to disability 
payments under section 223 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 423).
    (b)(1) Before an application for disability retirement under 5 
U.S.C. 8337 can be finally approved in the case of an employee who has 
Federal service, the applicant must provide OPM with--
    (i) Satisfactory evidence that the applicant has filed an 
application for disability insurance benefits under section 223 of the 
Social Security Act; or
    (ii) An official statement from the Social Security Administration 
that the individual is not insured for disability insurance benefits as 
defined in section 223(c)(1) of the Social Security Act.

[[Page 140]]

    (2) A disability retirement application under 5 U.S.C. 8337 will be 
dismissed when OPM is notified by the Social Security Administration 
that the application referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section 
has been withdrawn unless the evidence described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) 
of this section has been provided.
    (c) OPM will reduce a survivor annuity (an annuity under 5 U.S.C. 
8341) based on the service of an individual who performed Federal 
service, if the survivor annuitant is entitled, or on proper application 
would be entitled, to survivor benefits under section 202 (d), (e), or 
(f) (relating to children's, widow's, and widowers' benefits, 
respectively) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 202 (d), (e), or 
(f)).
    (d) The reduction required under paragraphs (a) and (c) of this 
section begins (or is reinstated) on the 1st day of the month during 
which the disability or survivor annuitant--
    (1) Is entitled to disability or survivor annuity under CSRS; and
    (2) Is entitled, or on proper application would be entitled, to 
disability or survivor benefits under the Social Security Act provisions 
mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, respectively.
    (e) The reduction under paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section will 
be computed and adjusted in a manner consistent with the provisions of 
Sec. 831.1005(c) through (e).
    (f) A reduction under paragraph (a) or (c) of this section stops on 
the date entitlement to the disability or survivor benefits under title 
II of the Social Security Act terminates. In the case of a disability or 
survivor annuitant who has not made proper application for the Social 
Security benefit, the reduction under paragraph (a) or (c) of this 
section stops on the date entitlement to such disability or survivor 
benefits would otherwise terminate. If a Social Security benefit is 
reduced under any provision of the Social Security Act, even if reduced 
to zero, entitlement to that benefit is not considered to have 
terminated.
    (g) OPM will accept the determination or certification of the Social 
Security Administration, submitted in a form prescribed by OPM, 
concerning entitlement to Social Security disability or survivor 
benefits and the beginning and ending dates thereof.
    (h) If a disability annuitant who is not entitled to disability 
benefits under title II of the Social Security Act subsequently becomes 
entitled to old-age benefits under the Social Security Act, a reduction 
under Sec. 831.1005 will begin on the 1st day of the month during which 
the annuitant becomes entitled, or on proper application would be 
entitled, to Social Security old-age insurance benefits.

                     Subpart L_Disability Retirement

    Source: 58 FR 49179, Sept. 22, 1993, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1201  Introduction.

    This subpart sets out the requirements an employee must meet to 
qualify for disability retirement, how an employee applies for 
disability retirement, how an agency applies for disability retirement 
for an employee, when a disability annuity ends, an individual's 
retirement rights after the disability annuity ends, and the effect of 
reemployment in the Federal service on a disability annuitant.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1202  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    Accommodation means an adjustment made to an employee's job or work 
environment that enables the employee to perform the duties of the 
position. Reasonable accommodation may include modifying the worksite; 
adjusting the work schedule; restructuring the job; obtaining or 
modifying equipment or devices; providing interpreters, readers, or 
personal assistants; and reassigning or retraining the employee.
    Basic pay means the pay an employee receives that is subject to 
civil service retirement deductions. The definition is the same as the 
definition of ``basic pay'' under 5 U.S.C. 8331(3).
    Commuting area means the geographic area that usually constitutes 
one area for employment purposes. It includes a population center (or 
two or more neighboring ones) and the surrounding localities in which 
people live and can reasonably be expected to travel back and forth 
daily from home to work in their usual employment.
    Disabled and disability mean unable or inability, because of disease 
or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's 
current position, or in a vacant position in the same agency at the same 
grade or pay level for which the individual is qualified for 
reassignment.
    Examination and reexamination mean an evaluation of evidentiary 
material related to the question of disability. Unless OPM exercises its 
choice of a physician, the cost of providing medical documentation rests 
with the employee or disability annuitant, who must provide any 
information OPM needs to make an evaluation.
    Medical condition means a health impairment resulting from a disease 
or injury, including a psychiatric disease. This is the same definition 
of ``medical condition'' as in Sec. 339.104 of this chapter.
    Medical documentation and documentation of a medical condition mean 
a statement from a licensed physician or other appropriate practitioner 
that provides information OPM considers necessary to determine an 
individual's entitlement to benefits under this subpart. Such a 
statement must meet the

[[Page 143]]

criteria set forth in Sec. 339.104 of this chapter.
    Permanent position means an appointment without time limitation.
    Physician and practitioner have the same meanings given in Sec. 
339.104 of this chapter.
    Qualified for reassignment means able to meet the minimum 
requirements for the grade and series of the vacant position in 
question.
    Same grade or pay level means, in regard to a vacant position within 
the same pay system as the employee currently occupies, the same grade 
and an equivalent amount of basic pay. A position under a different pay 
system or schedule is at the ``same pay level'' if the representative 
rate, as defined in Sec. 532.401 of this chapter, equals the 
representative rate of the employee's current position.
    Useful and efficient service means (1) acceptable performance of the 
critical or essential elements of the position; and (2) satisfactory 
conduct and attendance.
    Vacant position means an unoccupied position of the same grade or 
pay level and tenure for which the employee is qualified for 
reassignment that is located in the same commuting area and is serviced 
by the same appointing authority of the employing agency. The vacant 
position must be full time, unless the employee's current position is 
less than full time, in which case the vacant position must have a work 
schedule of no less time than that of the current position. In the case 
of an employee of the United States Postal Service, a vacant position 
does not include a position in a different craft or a position to which 
reassignment would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective 
bargaining agreement covering the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1203  Basic requirements for disability retirement.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
following conditions must be met for an individual to be eligible for 
disability retirement:
    (1) The individual must have completed at least 5 years of civilian 
service that is creditable under the Civil Service Retirement System.
    (2) The individual must, while employed in a position subject to the 
Civil Service Retirement System, have become disabled because of a 
medical condition, resulting in a service deficiency in performance, 
conduct, or attendance, or if there is no actual service deficiency, the 
disabling medical condition must be incompatible with either useful and 
efficient service or retention in the position.
    (3) The disabling medical condition must be expected to continue for 
at least 1 year from the date the application for disability retirement 
is filed.
    (4) The employing agency must be unable to accommodate the disabling 
medical condition in the position held or in an existing vacant 
position.
    (5) An application for disability retirement must be filed with the 
employing agency before the employee or Member separates from service, 
or with the former employing agency or the Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) within 1 year thereafter. This time limit can be waived 
only in certain instances explained in Sec. 831.1204.
    (b) A National Guard technician who is retiring under the special 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8337(h) is not required to meet the conditions 
given in paragraphs (a) (2), (3), and (4) of this section. Instead, the 
individual must be disabled for membership in the National Guard or for 
the military grade required to hold his or her position and meet the 
other eligibility requirements under 5 U.S.C. 8337(h)(2).

<R05>
Sec. 831.1204  Filing disability retirement applications: General.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, an 
application for disability retirement is timely only if it is filed with 
the employing agency before the employee or Member separates from 
service, or with the former employing agency or OPM within 1 year 
thereafter.
    (b) An application for disability retirement that is filed with OPM, 
an employing agency or former employing agency by personal delivery is 
considered filed on the date on which OPM, the employing agency or 
former employing agency receives it. The date of

[[Page 144]]

filing by facsimile is the date of the facsimile. The date of filing by 
mail is determined by the postmark date; if no legible postmark date 
appears on the mailing, the application is presumed to have been mailed 
5 days before its receipt, excluding days on which OPM, the employing 
agency or former employing agency, as appropriate, is closed for 
business. The date of filing by commercial overnight delivery is the 
date the application is given to the overnight delivery service.
    (c) An application for disability retirement that is filed with OPM 
or the applicant's former employing agency within 1 year after the 
employee's separation, and that is incompletely executed or submitted in 
a letter or other form not prescribed by OPM, is deemed timely filed. 
OPM will not adjudicate the application or make payment until the 
application is filed on a form prescribed by OPM.
    (d) OPM may waive the 1-year time limit if the employee or Member is 
mentally incompetent on the date of separation or within 1 year 
thereafter, in which case the individual or his or her representative 
must file the application with the former employing agency or OPM within 
1 year after the date the individual regains competency or a court 
appoints a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.
    (e) An agency may consider the existence of a pending disability 
retirement application when deciding whether and when to take other 
personnel actions. An employee's filing for disability retirement does 
not require the agency to delay any appropriate personnel action.

<R05>
Sec. 831.1205  Agency-filed disability retirement applications.

    (a) Basis for filing an application for an employee. An agency must 
file an application for disability retirement of an employee who has 5 
years of civilian Federal service when all of the following conditions 
are met:
    (1) The agency has issued a decision to remove the employee;
    (2) The agency concludes, after its review of medical documentation, 
that the cause for unacceptable performance, attendance, or conduct is 
disease or injury;
    (3) The employee is institutionalized, or the agency concludes, 
based on a review of medical and other information, that the employee is 
incapable of making a decision to file an application for disability 
retirement;
    (4) The employee has no personal representative or guardian; and
    (5) The employee has no immediate family member who is willing to 
file an application on his or her behalf.
    (b) Agency procedures. (1) When an agency issues a decision to 
remove an employee and not all of the conditions described in paragraph 
(a) of this section have been satisfied, but the removal is based on 
reasons apparently caused by a medical condition, the agency must advise 
the employee in writing of his or her possible eligibility for 
disability retirement.
    (2) If the agency is filing a disability retirement application on 
the employee's behalf, the agency must inform the employee in writing at 
the same time it informs the employee of its removal decision, or at any 
time before the separation is effected, that--
    (i) The agency is submitting a disability retirement application on 
the employee's behalf to OPM;
    (ii) The employee may review any medical information in accordance 
with the criteria in Sec. 294.106(d) of this chapter; and
    (iii) The action does not affect the employee's right to submit a 
voluntary application for retirement under this part.
    (3) When an agency submits an application for disability retirement 
to OPM on behalf of an employee, it must provide OPM with copies of the 
decision to remove, the medical documentation, and any other documents 
needed to show that the cause for removal is due to a medical condition. 
Following separation, the agency must provide OPM with a copy of the 
documentation of the separation.
    (c) OPM procedures. (1) OPM will not act on any application for 
disability retirement filed by an agency on behalf on an employee until 
it receives the appropriate documentation of the separation. When OPM 
receives a complete application for disability retirement

[[Page 145]]

under this section, it will notify the former employee that it has 
received the application, and that he or she may submit medical 
documentation. OPM will determine entitlement to disability benefits 
under Sec. 831.1206.
    (2) OPM will cancel any disability retirement when a final decision 
of an administrative authority or court reverses the removal action and 
orders the reinstatement of an employee to the agency rolls.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1206  Evidence supporting entitlement to disability benefits.

    (a) Evidence to support disability retirement application. (1) 
Before OPM determines whether an individual meets the basic requirements 
for disability retirement under Sec. 831.1203, an applicant for 
disability retirement or the employing agency must submit to OPM the 
following forms included in Standard Form 2824, ``Documentation in 
Support of Disability Retirement Application:''
    (i) Standard Form 2824A--``Applicant's Statement;''
    (ii) Standard Form 2824B--``Supervisor's Statement;''
    (iii) Standard Form 2824D--``Agency Certification or Reassignment 
and Accommodation Efforts;'' and
    (iv) Standard Form 2824E--``Disability Retirement Application 
Checklist.''
    (2) Standard Form 2824C--``Physician's Statement'' and the 
supporting medical documentation may be submitted directly to OPM.
    (3) The applicant, or the employing agency, must also obtain and 
submit additional documentation as may be required by OPM to determine 
entitlement to the disability retirement benefit.
    (4) Refusal by the applicant, physician, or employing agency to 
submit the documentation OPM has determined is necessary to decide 
eligibility for disability retirement is grounds for disallowance of the 
application.
    (b) OPM procedures for processing a disability retirement 
application. (1) OPM will review the documentation submitted under 
paragraph (a) of this section in support of an application for 
disability retirement to determine whether the applicant has met the 
conditions stated in Sec. 831.1203 of this part. OPM will issue its 
decision in writing to the applicant and to the employing agency. The 
decision will include a statement of the findings and conclusions, and 
an explanation of the right to request consideration under Sec. 831.109 
of this part.
    (2) OPM may rescind a decision to allow an application for 
disability retirement at any time if there is an indication of error in 
the original decision, such as fraud or misstatement of fact, or if 
additional medical documentation is needed. The written notification 
will include a statement of the findings and conclusions, and an 
explanation of the right to request reconsideration under Sec. 831.109 
of this part.
    (c) Medical examination. OPM may offer the applicant a medical 
examination when it determines that additional medical evidence is 
necessary to make a decision on an application. The medical evaluation 
will be conducted by a medical officer of the United States or a 
qualified physician or board of physicians designated by OPM. The 
applicant's refusal to submit to an examination is grounds for 
disallowance of the application.
    (d) Responsibility for providing evidence. It is the responsibility 
of the applicant to obtain and submit documentation that is sufficient 
for OPM to determine whether there is a service deficiency, caused by 
disease or injury, of sufficient degree to preclude useful and efficient 
service, or a medical condition that warrants restriction from the 
critical task or duties of the position held. It is also the 
responsibility of the disability annuitant to obtain and submit evidence 
OPM requires to show continuing entitlement to disability benefits.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1207  Withdrawal of disability retirement applications.

    (a) OPM will honor, without question, an applicant's request to 
withdraw an employee-filed disability retirement application if it 
receives the withdrawal request before the employing agency has 
separated the current employee, or, if the employee has already 
separated from the service, the withdrawal request is received before 
the official notice of approval has been

[[Page 146]]

issued by OPM. Similarly, OPM will honor, without question, an agency's 
request to withdraw an agency-filed disability retirement application if 
it receives the withdrawal request before the employee has separated 
from the service. Once the request to withdraw the application is 
accepted, an applicant must reapply to receive any further 
consideration.
    (b) Withdrawal of a disability retirement application does not 
ensure the individual's continued employment. It is the employing 
agency's responsibility to determine whether it is appropriate to 
continue to employ the individual.
    (c) OPM considers voluntary acceptance of a permanent position in 
which the employee has civil service retirement coverage, including a 
position at a lower grade or pay level, to be a withdrawal of the 
employee's disability retirement application. The employing agency must 
notify OPM immediately when an applicant for disability retirement 
accepts a position of this type.
    (d) OPM also considers a disability retirement application to be 
withdrawn when the agency reports to OPM that it has reassigned an 
applicant or an employee has refused a reassignment to a vacant 
position, or the agency reports to OPM that it has successfully 
accommodated the medical condition in the employee's current position. 
Placement consideration is limited only by agency authority and can 
occur after OPM's allowance of the application up to the date of 
separation for disability retirement. The employing agency must notify 
OPM immediately if any of these events occur.
    (e) After OPM allows a disability retirement application and the 
employee is separated, the application cannot be withdrawn. However, an 
individual entitled to a disability annuity may decline to accept all or 
any part of the annuity under the waiver provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8345(d) 
or request to be found medically recovered under Sec. 831.1208(e) of 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1208  Termination of disability annuity because of recovery.

    (a) Each annuitant receiving disability annuity from the Fund shall 
be examined under the direction of OPM at the end of 1 year from the 
date of disability retirement and annually thereafter until the 
annuitant becomes 60 years of age unless the disability is found by OPM 
to be permanent in character. OPM may order a medical or other 
examination at any time to determine the facts relative to the nature 
and degree of disability of the annuitant. Failure to submit to 
reexamination shall result in suspension of annuity.
    (b) A disability annuitant may request medical reevaluation under 
the provisions of this section at any time. OPM will reevaluate the 
medical condition of disability annuitants age 60 or over only on their 
own request.
    (c) Recovery based on medical documentation. When an examination or 
reevaluation shows that a disability annuitant has medically recovered 
from the disability, OPM will terminate the annuity effective on the 
first day of the month beginning 1 year after the date of the medical 
examination showing recovery.
    (d) Recovery based on reemployment by the Federal Government. 
Reemployment by an agency at any time before age 60 is evidence of 
recovery if the reemployment is in a permanent position at the same or 
higher grade or pay level as the position from which the disability 
annuitant retired. The permanent position must be full-time unless the 
position the disability annuitant occupied immediately before retirement 
was less than full-time, in which case the permanent position must have 
a work schedule of no less time than that of the position from which the 
disability annuitant retired. In this instance, OPM needs no medical 
documentation to find the annuitant recovered. Disability annuity 
payments will terminate effective on the first day of the month 
following the month in which the recovery finding is made under this 
paragraph.
    (e) Recovery based on a voluntary request. OPM will honor a written 
and signed statement of medical recovery voluntarily filed by a 
disability annuitant when the medical documentation on file does not 
demonstrate that the annuitant is mentally incompetent. OPM needs no 
other documentation to

[[Page 147]]

find the annuitant recovered. Disability annuity payments will terminate 
effective on the first day of the month beginning 1 year after the date 
of the statement. A disability annuitant can withdraw the statement only 
if the withdrawal is received by OPM before annuity payments terminate.
    (f) When an agency reemploys a recovered disability annuitant at any 
grade or rate of pay within the 1-year period pending termination of the 
disability retirement benefit under paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this 
section, OPM will terminate the annuity effective on the date of 
reemployment.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1209  Termination of disability annuity because of restoration to earning capacity.

    (a) Restoration to earning capacity. If a disability annuitant is 
under age 60 on December 31 of any calendar year and his or her income 
from wages or self-employment or both during that calendar year equal at 
least 80 percent of the current rate of basic pay of the position 
occupied immediately before retirement, the annuitant's earning capacity 
is considered to be restored. The disability annuity will terminate on 
the June 30 after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity 
is restored. When an agency reemploys a restored disability annuitant at 
any grade or rate of pay within the 180-day waiting period pending 
termination of the disability retirement benefit, OPM will terminate the 
annuity effective on the date of reemployment.
    (b) Current rate of basic pay for the position occupied immediately 
before retirement. (1) A disability annuitant's income for a calendar 
year is compared to the gross annual rate of basic pay in effect on 
December 31 of that year for the position occupied immediately before 
retirement. The income for most disability annuitants is based on the 
rate for the grade and step which reflects the total amount of basic pay 
(both the grade and step and any additional basic pay) in effect on the 
date of separation from the agency for disability retirement. Additional 
basic pay is included subject to the premium pay restrictions of 5 
U.S.C. 5545 (c)(1) and (c)(2). A higher grade and step will be 
established if it results from using either the date of application for 
disability retirement or the date of reasonable accommodation, as 
adjusted by any increases in basic pay that would have been effected 
between each respective date and the date of final separation. Use of 
these two alternative pay setting methods is subject to paragraph (b)(1) 
(i) and (ii) of this section. The highest grade and step established as 
a result of setting pay under the normal method and the two alternative 
methods is designated as the rate of basic pay for the position occupied 
immediately before retirement and applies only to restoration to earning 
capacity decisions. In cases involving use of either of the two 
alternative pay setting methods, the determination of the rate of basic 
pay for the position occupied immediately before retirement is made by 
the employing agency at the time the disability retirement is allowed. 
OPM must review the rate so determined to establish whether the correct 
rate has been established, and will inform the employee of the proper 
rate at the time the disability annuity is awarded. This rate of basic 
pay becomes the basis for all future earning capacity determinations.
    (i) The ``date of application for disability retirement'' is the 
date the application is signed by the authorized official of the 
employing agency immediately before forwarding the application to OPM.
    (ii) The ``date of reasonable accommodation'' is the date of the 
employing agency's notice of reasonable accommodation to an employee's 
medical condition (as a result of its review of medical documentation) 
which results in a reduction in the rate of basic pay. The use of the 
date of reasonable accommodation to establish the rate of basic pay for 
the position held at retirement is subject to the following conditions:
    (A) The date of the employing agency's notice to provide 
accommodation is no more than 1 year before the date the disability 
retirement application is signed by the authorized official in the 
employing agency immediately before forwarding it to OPM; and
    (B) A complete record of the date of the personnel decision, the 
medical

[[Page 148]]

documentation substantiating the existence of the medical condition, and 
the justification for the accommodation is established in writing and 
included at the time the agency submits the application for disability 
retirement. OPM will review the record to determine whether the medical 
documentation demonstrates that the medical condition existed at the 
time of the accommodation and warranted the accommodation made.
    (2) In the case of an annuitant whose basic pay rate on the date 
determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section did not match a 
specific grade and step in a pay schedule:
    (i) For those retiring from a merit pay position, a position for 
which a special pay rate is authorized (except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii) of this section), or any other position in which the rate of 
basic pay is not equal to a grade and step in a pay schedule, the grade 
and step will be established for this purpose at the lowest step in the 
pay schedule grade that is equal to or greater than the actual rate of 
basic pay payable. This rule will not be applied when the rate exceeds 
that of the schedule applicable to the organization from which the 
individual retired, when there is no existing apposite schedule with 
grades and steps, or in other organizations which are excluded from 
coverage of schedules with grades and steps, as in the case of pay 
systems using pay bands.
    (ii) For those retiring with a retained rate of basic pay or from a 
position for which a special pay rate is in effect but whose rate of 
basic pay exceeds the highest rate payable in the pay schedule grade 
applicable to the position held, the grade and step is established for 
this purpose in the grade in the schedule that is closest to the grade 
of the position held and within which the amount of the retained pay 
falls. The step is established for this purpose at the lowest step in 
that grade which equals or exceeds the actual rate of pay payable.
    (iii) When the pay system under which an annuitant retired has been 
either modified or eliminated since the individual retired, the 
individual will be treated as if he or she had been employed at their 
retirement grade and step at the time of the system change, and will be 
deemed to have been placed under the new system using whatever rules 
would have been applicable at that time. This will only apply when a pay 
system has been abolished or modified, and not when the grade and step 
of a position has been modified subsequent to retirement by 
reclassification or other action, in which case the grade and step in 
effect at the time of retirement will control.
    (iv) If using the above rules it is not possible to set a grade and 
step for computing the current rate of pay, then if possible the current 
rate of pay will be set using the relative position in the range of pay 
applicable to the position from which the individual retired. For 
example, if at the time of retirement the rate of pay was $75,000 in a 
range from $70,000 to $90,000, for all future determinations, the 
current rate of pay would be 25% up the new pay range from the bottom. 
If the new range was $96,000 to $120,000, then the new current rate of 
pay would be $102,000 ($96,000 plus 0.25 times $24,000 ($120,000 minus 
$96,000)).
    (v) In those cases, such as of some former Congressional staff 
employees and others whose pay is not set under a formal system, where 
none of the above guidelines will yield a current rate of pay, OPM will 
ascertain the current rate of pay after consultation with the former 
employing organization, or successor organization.
    (3) For annuitants retiring from the United States Postal Service, 
only cost-of-living allowances subject to civil service retirement 
deductions are included in determining the current rate of basic pay of 
the position held at retirement.
    (c) Income. Earning capacity for the purposes of this section is 
demonstrated by an annuitant's ability to earn post-retirement income in 
a calendar year through personal work efforts or services. The total 
amount of income from all sources is used to determine earning capacity. 
This includes income received as gross wages from one or more employers, 
net earnings from one or more self-employment endeavors, and deferred 
income that is earned in a calendar year. In determining an annuitant's 
income for a

[[Page 149]]

calendar year, the following considerations apply:
    (1) There are two sources of income: wages and self-employment 
income. All income which is subject to Federal employment taxes (i.e., 
social security or Medicare taxes) or self-employment taxes constitutes 
earned income. In addition, any other income as described in this 
section also constitutes earned income. The determination of whether a 
disability annuitant earns wages as an employee of an organization or 
earns income as a self-employed person is based on the usual common law 
rules applicable in determining the existence of an employer-employee 
relationship. Whether the relationship exists under the usual common law 
rules will be determined by OPM after the examination of the particular 
facts of each case.
    (2) Income earned from one source is not offset by losses from 
another source. Income earned as wages is not reduced by a net loss from 
self-employment. The net income from each self-employment endeavor is 
calculated separately, and the income earned as net earnings from one 
self-employment endeavor is not reduced by a net loss from another self-
employment endeavor. The net incomes from each separate self-employment 
endeavor are added together to determine the total amount of income from 
self-employment for a calendar year.
    (3) Only income earned from personal work efforts or services is 
considered in determining earning capacity. All forms of non-work-
related unearned income are excluded. Paragraph (f) of this section 
includes a representative list of the types of unearned income that are 
not considered.
    (4) Income earned in a calendar year may only be reduced by certain 
self-employment business expenses, as provided in paragraph (e) of this 
section; job-connected expenses incurred because of the disabling 
condition, as provided in paragraph (g) of this section; and the return 
from investment allowance, as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. 
Once earned, income cannot be reduced by any other means. Thus, income 
cannot be lowered by such means as leave buy-back provisions, conversion 
of wages for paid time to leave without pay or a similar non-paid 
status, reductions in wages attributable to cash shortages or product 
losses, etc.
    (5) For determining annual income from wages or self-employment or 
both, income is earned in the calendar year the annuitant actually 
renders the personal work effort or service and either actually or 
constructively receives the remuneration, except as provided under 
paragraph (c)(7) of this section. For this purpose, income paid on a 
regular basis (i.e., on a weekly, bi-weekly, monthly or similar pay 
period basis) will be deemed earned in the year in which payment is made 
in the regular course of business.
    (6) Deferred income is included as income in the calendar year in 
which it is constructively received. Income is constructively received 
when it is credited, set apart, or otherwise made available so that the 
annuitant may draw upon it at any time, or could draw upon it during the 
calendar year if the annuitant had given notice of the intent to do so. 
Deferred income includes all earnings, whether in the form of cash or 
property or applied to provide a benefit for the employee, which are 
subject to the disability annuitant's designation or assignment. 
Usually, the earnings are set aside by a salary-reduction agreement, a 
deferred compensation arrangement, or the designation of specific 
earnings amounts towards the purchase of non-taxable employee fringe 
benefits. Thus, any earnings for which the individual has the 
opportunity to adjust the amount of income received in a calendar year 
by controlling the remuneration of voluntarily giving up the right to 
control the remuneration, regardless of whether a written instrument 
exists, are income for earning capacity purposes.
    (7) The Internal Revenue Code provides exceptions to the general 
rule on constructive receipt for certain deferred compensation plans 
which, by their design, defer receipt of income for Federal employment 
tax purposes as of the later of when services are performed or when 
there is no substantial risk of forfeiture of the rights to such amount. 
Even though these special deferred compensation plans defer the 
constructive receipt of the income for

[[Page 150]]

tax purposes to future years beyond the year in which the income is 
actually earned, the income reflects earning capacity. Therefore, 
employer contributions and employee payments to these special deferred 
compensation plans are considered income in the calendar year in which 
the services are performed, even though the Internal Revenue Code may 
exclude these contributions and payments from income for tax purposes.
    (d) Wages. For purposes of earning capacity determinations, the term 
``wages'' means the gross amount of all remuneration for services 
performed by an employee for his or her employer, unless specifically 
excluded herein, before any deductions or withholdings.
    (1) The name by which the remuneration for services is designated is 
immaterial. Remuneration includes but is not limited to one-time or 
recurring--
    (i) Base salary or pay; tips; commissions; professional fees; 
honoraria; bonuses and gift certificates of any type; golden parachute 
payments; payments for any non-work periods, such as vacation, holiday, 
or sick pay; pay advances; overtime pay; severance pay; dismissal pay; 
termination pay; and back pay;
    (ii) Deferred income, within the meaning of paragraphs (c) (6) and 
(7) of this section, or other employer contributions or payments in an 
arrangement in which the employee has the opportunity (whether exercised 
or not) to adjust income by recovering the contributions or payments 
during the calendar year in which earned, for general discretionary 
income purposes;
    (iii) Non-cash wages or payment of in-kind benefits, such as shares 
of stock in the business, real or personal property, stock in trade, 
inventory items, goods, lodging, food, and clothing. The valuation for 
all non-cash wages or other in-kind benefits is determined in a manner 
consistent with the fair value standards that appear in the Social 
Security Administration's regulations at 20 CFR 404.1041(d).
    (2) Any amount offset or deducted under 5 U.S.C. 8344 is treated as 
wages if the annuity continues while the annuitant is reemployed by the 
Federal Government.
    (3) As a general rule, remuneration as wages does not include any 
contribution, payment, benefits furnished, or service provided by an 
employer in any of the following areas:
    (i) The general retirement system established by the employer for 
its employees, usually either a qualified pension, profit-sharing, stock 
bonus plan, or a qualified annuity contract plan;
    (ii) Medical or hospitalization health benefit plans;
    (iii) Life insurance plans;
    (iv) Sickness or accident disability pay beyond 6 months of illness, 
or workers' compensation payments;
    (v) The value of meals and lodgings provided at the convenience of 
the employer;
    (vi) Moving expenses;
    (vii) Educational assistance programs;
    (viii) Dependent care assistance programs;
    (ix) Scholarships and fellowship grants;
    (x) De minimis fringe benefits, such as items of merchandise given 
by the employer at holidays which are not readily convertible into cash 
and courtesy discounts on company products offered not as remuneration 
for services performed but as a means of promoting good will;
    (xi) Qualified group legal services plans;
    (xii) Uniforms and tools supplied by the employer, including 
employer-provided allowances for such items, for the exclusive use by 
the employee on the job; and
    (xiii) Amounts that an employer pays the individual specifically, 
either as advances or reimbursements, for traveling or other ordinary 
and necessary expenses incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred 
in the employer's business.
    (4) However, there are two exceptions to this general rule:
    (i) When it is provided under circumstances in which either a salary 
reduction or deferral agreement is used (whether evidenced by a written 
instrument or otherwise); or
    (ii) When the employee had the opportunity (whether exercised or 
not) to elect to receive the cash value, whether in the form of money or 
personal or

[[Page 151]]

real property, of the employer-provided amount or service.
    (e) Self-employment income. (1) Self-employment income is the 
remuneration that is received as an independent contractor, either as
    (i) A sole proprietor of a business or farm;
    (ii) A professional in one's own practice; or
    (iii) A member of a partnership or corporation, as these terms are 
defined by the Internal Revenue Code, and regardless of whether the 
business entity is operated for profit.
    (2) The term ``net earnings'' from self-employment in a business 
enterprise means the gross revenue to the business endeavor from all 
sources before any other deductions or withholdings, minus
    (i) Allowable business expenses, as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of 
this section;
    (ii) Any job-connected disability expenses, as provided in paragraph 
(g) of this section; and
    (iii) Any return from investment allowance, as provided in paragraph 
(h) of this section.
    (3) Certain expenses of a self-employed business entity may be 
offset from the gross revenue from all sources of that self-employed 
business in determining the amount of net earnings for a particular 
calendar year. Expenses which may be deducted are only those items and 
costs which are permitted by the Internal Revenue Code for income tax 
purposes as ordinary and necessary to the operation of the business. 
However, expenses incurred on behalf of the disability annuitant may not 
be deducted, regardless of whether they are permitted by the Internal 
Revenue Code. These expenses that are incurred but cannot be deducted 
include the costs for wages paid to the individual, interest earnings, 
guaranteed payments, dividends, employee benefits, pension plans, and 
salary reduction or deferral plans. Also, self-employed disability 
annuitants may not deduct the costs of other withdrawals or expenses 
which are not used solely for business purposes. Examples of items that 
cannot be deducted if used at all for personal use by the self-employed 
disability annuitant include personal property items, such as 
automobiles and boats; real property, such as vacation property or 
residences; and memberships, dues, or fees for professional associations 
or public or private organizations or clubs.
    (4) Fees paid to an annuitant as a director of a corporation are a 
part of net earnings from self-employment.
    (f) Income not included. Other types of income not considered in 
determining earning capacity include--
    (1) Investment income, such as interest or dividends from savings 
accounts, stocks, personal loans or home mortgages held, unless the 
disability annuitant receives the return from capital investment in the 
course of his or her trade or business;
    (2) Capital gains from sales of real or personal property that the 
disability annuitant owns, unless received in the course of his or her 
trade or business:
    (3) Rents or royalties, unless received in the course of his or her 
trade or business;
    (4) Distributions from pension plans, annuity plans, Individual 
Retirement Accounts (IRA's), Simplified Employee Benefit-IRA's (SEP-
IRA's), Keogh Accounts, employee stock ownership plans, profit sharing 
plans, or deferred income payments that are received by the annuitant in 
any year after the calendar year in which the funds were contributed to 
the plan;
    (5) Income earned before the commencing date of civil service 
retirement annuity payments;
    (6) Scholarships or fellowships;
    (7) Proceeds from life insurance, inheritances, estates, trusts, 
endowments, gifts, prizes, awards, gambling or lottery winnings, and 
amounts received in court actions whether by verdict or settlement, 
unless received in the course of their trade or business;
    (8) Unemployment compensation under State or Federal law, 
supplemental unemployment benefits, or workers' compensation:
    (9) Alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments 
received;
    (10) Pay for jury duty; and

[[Page 152]]

    (11) Entitlement payments from other Federal agencies, such as 
benefits from the Social Security Administration or the Veterans 
Administration, Railroad Retirement System retirement pay, or military 
retirement pay.
    (g) Job-connected expenses incurred because of the disabling 
condition may be deducted from income. (1) Job-connected expenses 
deductible from income for purposes of determining earning capacity are 
those expenses that are primarily for and essential to the annuitant's 
occupation or business and are directly connected with or result from 
the disability for which the disability annuity was allowed.
    (2) The determination of whether a job-connected expense may be 
deducted from income is governed by the following considerations:
    (i) The expense must be directly attributable to the disability and 
must be one which would not have been incurred in the absence of the 
annuitant working in his or her business or occupation. Expenses 
incurred for the preservation of the annuitant's health, alleviation of 
his or her physical or mental discomfort, or other expenses of an 
employed person cannot be deducted.
    (ii) The disability must be of such severity that it requires the 
annuitant to use special means of transportation, services, or equipment 
to perform the duties of the occupation or business. Examples of such 
disabilities include blindness, paraplegia, multiple sclerosis, and 
cerebral hemorrhage. Claims involving transportation or equipment may be 
deducted only in the amount normally allowed for business expenses or as 
depreciation by the Internal Revenue Service for Federal income tax 
purposes.
    (iii) Claims involving services performed by a family member or 
other individual directly employed by the annuitant may be deducted only 
if a true employer-employee relationship exists between the annuitant 
and the employed individual, and the amount claimed as an expense does 
not exceed the local market rate of payment to individuals who provide 
similar services. It is the responsibility of the annuitant to provide 
evidence demonstrating that an employer-employee relationship exists, 
and what the local market rate is for such services. For the purpose of 
this paragraph, to establish that a true employer-employee relationship 
exists, the annuitant must provide evidence that all statutorily 
mandated employment requirements are met, including (but not limited to) 
income tax withholdings, FICA tax deductions and payments, and 
unemployment insurance. If the annuitant fails to provide evidence of 
the local market rate for such services, payments may be deducted only 
if the amount claimed does not exceed the Federal minimum hourly rate in 
effect on December 31 of the calendar year in which claimed. Absent 
evidence that it is customary and regular practice in the local labor 
market to work more hours per week, payment may not be deducted for 
services provided by an individual in excess of 40 hours a week.
    (3) A job-connected expense can be deducted only in the calendar 
year in which paid.
    (4) Claims for items used for both personal and job-related purposes 
may be deducted only by the prorated amount attributable to the job-
related use.
    (5) A job-connected expense may not be deducted from income from 
self-employment if the expense has already been deducted as a business 
expense.
    (6) It is the responsibility of the annuitant claiming job-connected 
expense to provide adequate documentation to substantiate the amount 
claimed. Adequate documentation will generally include the following 
information:
    (i) Written recommendation of a physician, vocational rehabilitation 
specialist, occupational health resource specialist, or other similar 
professional specialist that the retiree should use the transportation, 
services, or equipment;
    (ii) A description of the item and an explanation of its use by the 
annuitant in the performance of his or her occupation or business;
    (iii) A copy of the receipt of purchase, bill of sale, or leasing 
agreement for the item claimed with the date, duration of the agreement, 
and agreed upon price clearly specified;

[[Page 153]]

    (iv) A complete supporting explanation of how the amount claimed for 
the job-connected expense has been calculated; and
    (v) An explanation of the circumstances and calculation of the 
prorated cost of the item if used for both personal and business use.
    (h) Return from investment allowance. A disability annuitant may 
reduce the net earnings from a self-employed business endeavor (adjusted 
for any interest paid on borrowed capital) by 6 percent of his or her 
capital investment in that business, owned or borrowed. The capital 
investment's value is its fair-market value as of December 31 of the 
year for which the income is being reported.
    (i) Requirement to report income. All disability annuitants who, on 
December 31 of any calendar year, are under age 60 must report to OPM 
their income from wages or self-employment or both for that calendar 
year. Each year as early as possible, OPM will send a form to annuitants 
to use in reporting their income from the previous calendar year. The 
form specifies the date by which OPM must receive the report. OPM will 
determine entitlement to continued annuity on the basis of the report. 
If an annuitant fails to submit the report, OPM may stop annuity 
payments until it receives the report.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1210  Annuity rights after a disability annuity terminates.

    (a) An individual is entitled to an immediate annuity when the 
disability annuity stops because of recovery or restoration to earning 
capacity if the individual is not reemployed in a position subject to 
civil service retirement coverage and--
    (1) Is at least age 50 when the disability annuity stops and had 20 
or more years of service at the time of retirement for disability; or
    (2) Had 25 or more years of service at the time of retirement for 
disability regardless of age.
    (b) An individual whose annuity stops because of recovery or 
restoration to earning capacity and who is not eligible for an immediate 
annuity under paragraph (a) of this section, is eligible for a deferred 
annuity upon reaching age 62.
    (c) The disability annuity of an individual whose annuity stopped 
because of recovery or restoration to earning capacity may be reinstated 
under Sec. 831.1212 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1211  Reinstatement of disability annuity.

    (a) When a disability annuity stops, the individual must again prove 
that he or she meets the eligibility requirements in order to have the 
annuity reinstated.
    (b) When a recovered disability annuitant under age 62 whose annuity 
was terminated because he or she was found recovered on the basis of 
medical evidence (Sec. 831.1208(b)), is not reemployed in a position 
subject to civil service retirement coverage, and, based on the results 
of a current medical examination, OPM finds that the individual's 
medical condition has worsened since the finding of recovery and that 
the original disability on which retirement was based has recurred, OPM 
will reinstate the disability annuity. The right to the reinstated 
annuity begins with the date of the medical examination showing that the 
disability recurred.
    (c) OPM will reinstate the disability annuity of a recovered 
disability annuitant under age 62 whose annuity was terminated because 
he or she was found recovered on the basis of Federal reemployment 
(Sec. 831.1208(c)) when--
    (1) The results of a current medical examination show that the 
disabling medical condition that was the basis of the disability 
retirement continues to exist; and
    (2) Within 1 year after the date of reemployment, this medical 
condition has again caused the individual to be unable to provide useful 
and efficient service, and the employee has been--
    (i) Separated and not reemployed in a position subject to civil 
service retirement coverage; or
    (ii) Placed in a position that results in a reduction in grade or 
pay below the grade from which the individual retired, or in a change to 
a non-permanent position. The right to the reinstated annuity begins 
with the date of the medical examination showing that

[[Page 154]]

the disabling medical condition continues to exist, but not earlier than 
the first day after separation, or the effective date of the placement 
in the position which results in a reduction in grade or pay or change 
to a non-permanent position.
    (d) When a recovered disability annuitant under age 62 whose annuity 
was terminated because he or she was found recovered on the basis of a 
voluntary request (Sec. 831.1208(e)), is not reemployed in a position 
subject to civil service retirement coverage, and, based on the results 
of a current medical examination, OPM finds that the disability has 
recurred, OPM will reinstate the disability annuity. The right to the 
reinstated annuity begins with the date of the medical examination 
showing that the disability recurred, but not earlier than 1 year before 
the date the request for reinstatement is received by OPM.
    (e) When a disability annuitant whose earning capacity has been 
restored but who is not reemployed in a position in which he or she is 
subject to civil service retirement coverage, and who (except in the 
case of a National Guard technician whose annuity was awarded under 5 
U.S.C. 8337(h)), has not recovered from the disability for which 
retired, loses his or her earning capacity, as determined by OPM, before 
reaching age 62, OPM will reinstate the disability annuity. The 
reinstated annuity is payable from January 1 of the year following the 
calendar year in which earning capacity was lost. Earning capacity is 
lost if, during any calendar year, the individual's income from wages or 
self-employment or both is less than 80 percent of the current rate of 
basic pay of the position held at retirement.
    (f) A reinstated annuity is the same type as the original annuity 
and is paid at the rate of annuity to which the annuitant was entitled 
on the date his or her disability annuity was last discontinued.
    (g) Reinstatement of the disability annuity ends the right to any 
other annuity based on the same service, unless the annuitant makes a 
written election to receive the other annuity instead of the disability 
annuity.
    (h) When OPM reinstates an employee's disability annuity, the agency 
must offset the employee's pay by the amount of annuity allocable to the 
period of employment, unless the annuitant is exempted from this 
requirement under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8344(i). The offset begins 
on the date of OPM's determination of eligibility for reinstatement. OPM 
must reduce any retroactive payment of annuity for a period of 
employment with an agency before that date by the amount of pay earned 
during that period.
    (i) When an individual's annuity is terminated upon reemployment 
(subject to subchapter III of chapter 83, title 5, United States Code), 
OPM must determine the individual's future annuity rights under the law 
in effect at the date of his or her subsequent separation. If, upon 
separation from such reemployment, the individual does not meet the 
eligibility requirements under subchapter III of chapter 83, title 5, 
United States Code, for title to annuity based on such separation, OPM 
will resume payment of the terminated annuity at the rate last payable, 
unless payment is otherwise barred.

    (2) The date on which the full payment is due;
    (3) OPM's policy on interest, penalties, and administrative charges;

    (8) The right to a hearing by the Merit Systems Protection Board on 
a waiver request (if OPM's waiver decision finds the individual liable) 
in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and
    (9) The fact that a timely filing of a request for reconsideration, 
waiver and/or compromise, or a later timely appeal of a waiver denial to 
the Merit Systems Protection Board, will stop collection proceedings, 
unless (i) failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice the 
Government's ability to collect the debt; and (ii) the time before the 
payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of these 
procedures.
    (b) Requests for reconsideration, waiver, and/or compromise. (1) If

us by mail, it must be postmarked within 30 calendar

[[Page 156]]

days of the date of the notice detailed in paragraph (a) of this 
section. If a request for reconsideration, waiver, and/or compromise is 
hand delivered, it must be received within 30 calendar days of the date 
of the notice detailed in paragraph (a) of this section. OPM may extend 
the 30 day time limit for filing when individuals can prove that they: 
(i) Were not notified of the time limit and were not otherwise aware of 
it; or (ii) were prevented by circumstances beyond their control from 
making the request within the time limit.
    (2) When a request for reconsideration, waiver, and/or compromise 
covered by this paragraph is properly filed before the death of the 
debtor, it will be processed to completion unless the relief sought is 
nullified by the debtor's death.
    (3) Individuals requesting reconsideration, waiver, and/or 
compromise will be given a full opportunity to present any pertinent 
information and documentation supporting their position.
    (4) An individual's request for waiver will be evaluated on the

standards set forth in the FCCS (4 CFR part 103).
    (c) Reconsideration, waiver, and/or compromise decisions. (1) OPM's 
decision will be based upon the individual's written submissions, 
evidence of record, and other pertinent available information.
    (2) After consideration of all pertinent information, a written 
decision will be issued. The decision will state the extent of the 
individual's liability, and, for waiver and compromise requests, whether 
the debt will be waived or compromised. If the individual is determined 
to be liable for all or a portion of the debt, the decision will 
reaffirm or modify the conditions for the collection previously proposed 
under paragraph (a) of this section. The decision will state the 
individual's right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board as 
provided by Sec. 1201.3 of this title, and, in the case of a denial of 
waiver, that a timely appeal will stop collection of the debt.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1305  Collection of debts.

    (a) Means of collection. Collection of a debt may be made by means 
of offset under Sec. 831.1306, or under any statutory provision 
providing for offset of money due the debtor from the Federal 
Government, or by referral to the Justice Department for litigation, as 
provided in Sec. 831.1306. Referral may also be made to a collection 
agency under the provisions of the FCCS.
    (b) Additional charges. Interest, penalties, and administrative 
costs will be assessed on the debt in accordance with standards 
established in the FCCS at 4 CFR 102.13. Additional charges will be 
waived when required by the FCCS. In addition, such charges may be 
waived when OPM determines--
    (1) Collection would be against equity and good conscience under the 
standards prescribed in Sec. Sec. 831.1403 through 831.1405 of this 
part; or
    (2) Waiver would be in the best interest of the United States.
    (c) Collection in installments. Whenever feasible, debts will be 
collected in one lump sum. However, when the debtor is financially 
unable to pay in one lump sum of fails to respond to a demand for full 
payment and off-set is available, installment payments may be effected. 
The amount of the installment payments will be set in accordance with 
the criteria in 4 CFR 102.11.
    (d) Commencement of collection. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, collection will begin after the time limits for 
requesting further rights stated in Sec. 831.1304(a)(6) expire or OPM 
has issued decisions on all timely requests for those rights and the 
Merit Systems Protection Board has acted on any timely appeal of a 
waiver denial, unless: (i) Failure to make an offset would substantially 
prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt; and (ii) the 
time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the 
completion of the proceedings in Sec. 831.1304 or litigation. When 
offset begins without completion of the administrative review process, 
these procedures will be completed promptly, and amounts recovered by 
offset but later found not owed will be refunded promptly.
    (2) The procedures identified in Sec. 831.1304 will not be applied 
when the

[[Page 157]]

debt is caused by (i) a retroactive adjustment in the periodic rate of 
annuity or any deduction taken from annuity when the adjustment is a 
result of the annuitant's election of different entitlements under law, 
if the adjustment is made within 120 days of the effective date of the 
election; or (ii) interim, estimated payments made before the formal 
determination of entitlement to annuity, if the amount is recouped from 
the total annuity payable on the first day of the month following the 
last advance payment or the date the formal determination is made, 
whichever is later.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1306  Collection by administrative offset.

    (a) Offset from retirement payments. A debt may be collected in 
whole or in part from lump-sum retirement payment or recurring annuity 
payments.
    (b) Offset from other payments--(1) Administrative offset. (i) A 
debt may be offset from other payments due the debtor from other 
agencies in accordance with 4 CFR 102.3, except that offset from back 
pay awarded under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5596 (and 5 CFR 550.801 et 
seq.) will be made in accordance with Sec. 550.805(e)(2) of this 
chapter.
    (ii) In determining whether to collect claims by means of 
administrative offset after the expiration of the six year limitation 
provided in 5 U.S.C. 2415, the Director or his designee will determine 
the cost effectiveness of leaving a claim unresolved for more than 6 
years. This decision will be based on such factors as the amount of the 
debt; the cost of collection; and the likelihood of recovering the debt.
    (2) Salary offset. When the debtor is an employee, or a member of 
the Armed Forces or a reserve component of the Armed Forces, OPM may 
effect collection action by offset of the debtor's pay in accordance 
with 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550.1101 et seq. Due process described in 
Sec. 831.1304 will apply. The questions of fact and liability, and 
entitlements to waiver or compromise determined through that process are 
deemed correct and will not be amended under salary offset procedures. 
When the debtor did not receive a hearing on the amount of the offset 
under Sec. 831.1304 and requests such hearing, one will be conducted in 
accordance with subpart K of part 550 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1307  Use of consumer reporting agencies.

    (a) Notice. If a debtor's response to the notice described in Sec. 
831.1304(a) does not result in payment in full, payment by offset, or 
payment in accordance with a voluntary repayment agreement or other 
repayment schedule acceptable to OPM, and the debtor's rights under 
Sec. 831.1304 have been exhausted, OPM may report the debtor to a 
consumer reporting agency. In addition, a debtor's failure to make 
subsequent payments in accordance with a repayment schedule may result 
in a report to a consumer reporting agency. Before making a report to a 
consumer reporting agency, OPM will notify the debtor in writing that--
    (1) The payment is overdue;
    (2) OPM intends, after 60 days, to make a report as described in 
paragraph (b) of this section to a consumer reporting agency;
    (3) The debtor's right to dispute the liability has been exhausted 
under Sec. 831.1304; and
    (4) The debtor may suspend OPM action on referral by paying the debt 
in one lump sum or making payments current under a repayment schedule.
    (b) Report. When a debtor's response to the notice described in 
paragraph (a) of this section fails to comply with paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section and 60 days have elapsed since the notice was mailed, OPM 
may report to a consumer reporting agency that an individual is 
responsible for an unpaid debt and provide the following information:
    (1) The individual's name, address, taxpayer identification number, 
and any other information necessary to establish the identity of the 
individual;
    (2) The amount, status, and history of the debt; and
    (3) The fact that the debt arose in connection with the 
administration of the Civil Service Retirement System.
    (c) Subsequent reports. OPM will update its report to the consumer 
reporting agency whenever it has knowledge of events that substantially 
change the status or the amount of the liability.

[[Page 158]]


<R05>
Sec. 831.1308  Referral to a collection agency.

    (a) OPM may refer certain debts to commercial collection agencies 
under the following conditions:
    (1) All processing required by Sec. 831.1304 has been completed 
before the debt is released.
    (2) A contract for collection services has been negotiated.
    (3) OPM retains the responsibility for resolving disputes, 
compromising claims, referring the debt for litigation, or suspending or 
terminating collection action.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1309  Referral for litigation.

    From time to time and in a manner consistent with the General 
Accounting Office's and the Justice Department's instructions, OPM will 
refer certain overpayments to the Justice Department for litigation. 
Referral for litigation will suspend processing under this subpart.


<R04>
             Subpart N_Standards for Waiver of Overpayments

    Source: 45 FR 23635, Apr. 8, 1980, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1401  Conditions for waiver.

    Recovery of an overpayment from the Civil Service Retirement and 
Disability Fund may be waived pursuant to section 8346(b), of title 5, 
United States Code, when the annuitant (a) is without fault and (b) 
recovery would be against equity and good conscience. Where it has been 
determined that the recipient of an overpayment is ineligible for 
waiver, the individual is nevertheless entitled to an adjustment in the 
recovery schedule if he/she shows that it would cause him/her financial 
hardship to make payment at the rate scheduled.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1402  Fault.

    A recipient of an overpayment is without fault if he/she performed 
no act of commission or omission which resulted in the overpayment. The 
fact that the Office of Personnel Management may have been at fault in 
initiating an overpayment will not necessarily relieve the individual 
from liability.
    (a) Considerations. Pertinent considerations in finding fault are--
    (1) Whether payment resulted from the individual's incorrect but not 
necessarily fraudulent statement, which he/she should have known to be 
incorrect;
    (2) Whether payment resulted from the individual's failure to 
disclose material facts in his/her possession which he/she should have 
known to be material; or
    (3) Whether he/she accepted a payment which he/she knew or should 
have known to be erroneous.
    (b) Mitigation factors. The individual's age, physical and mental 
condition or the nature of the information supplied to him/her by OPM or 
a Federal agency may mitigate against finding fault if one or more 
contributed to his/her submission of an incorrect statement, a statement 
which did not disclose material facts in his/her possession, or his/her 
acceptance of an erroneous overpayment.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1403  Equity and good conscience.

    (a) Defined. Recovery is against equity and good conscience when--
    (1) It would cause financial hardship to the person from whom it is 
sought;
    (2) The recipient of the overpayment can show (regardless of his or 
her financial circumstances) that due to the notice that such payment 
would be made or because of the incorrect payment either he/she has 
relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse; or
    (3) Recovery could be unconscionable under the circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1404  Financial hardship.

    Financial hardship may be deemed to exist in--but not limited to--
those situations where the annuitant from whom collection is sought 
needs substantially all of his/her current income and liquid assets to 
meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities.
    (a) Considerations. Some pertinent considerations in determining 
whether recovery would cause financial hardship are as follows:

<R05>
Sec. 831.1805  Creditor agency processing for non-fraud claims.

    (a) Where to submit the debt claim, judgment or notice of debt--(1) 
Creditor agencies that are not the debtor's paying agency. (i) If the 
creditor agency knows that the debtor is employed by the Federal 
Government, it should send the debt claim to the debtor's paying agency 
for collection.
    (ii) If some of the debt is unpaid after the debtor separates from 
the paying agency, the creditor agency should send the debt claim to OPM 
as described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Creditor agencies that are the debtor's paying agency. 
Ordinarily, debts owed the paying agency should be offset under 31 
U.S.C. 3716 from any final payments (salary, accrued annual leave, etc.) 
due the debtor. If a balance is due after offsetting the final payments 
or the debt is discovered after the debtor has been paid, the paying 
agency may send the debt claim to OPM as described in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) Procedures for submitting a debt claim, judgment or notice of 
debt to

[[Page 162]]

OPM--(1) Debt claims for which the agency has a court judgment. If the 
creditor agency has a court judgment against the debtor specifying the 
amount of the debt to be recovered, the agency should send the debt 
claim and two certified copies of the judgment to OPM.
    (2) Debt claims previously processed under 5 U.S.C. 5514. If the 
creditor agency previously processed the debt claim under section 5514, 
it should--
    (i) Notify the debtor that the claim is being sent to OPM to 
complete collection from the Fund; and
    (ii) Send the debt claim (on SF 2805) to OPM with two copies of the 
paying agency's certification of the amount collected and one copy of 
the notice to the debtor that the claim was sent to OPM.
    (3) Debt claims not processed under 5 U.S.C. 5514, reduced to court 
judgment, or excepted by paragraph (b)(4) of this section. (i) If the 
debt claim was not processed under Sec. 5514, reduced to court judgment 
or excepted by paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the creditor agency 
must--
    (A) Comply with the procedures required by 4 CFR 102.4--issuing 
written notice to the debtor of the nature and amount of the debt, the 
agency's intention to collect by offset, the opportunity to inspect and 
copy agency records pertaining to the debt, the opportunity to obtain 
review within the agency of the determination of indebtedness, and the 
opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the agency to repay 
the debt; and
    (B) Complete the appropriate debt claim.
    (ii) If the debtor does not respond to the creditor agency's notice 
within the allotted time and there is no reason to believe that he or 
she did not receive the notice, the creditor agency may submit the debt 
claim to OPM after certifying that notice was issued and the debtor 
failed to reply.
    (iii) If the debtor responds to the notice by requesting a review 
(or hearing if one is available), the review (or hearing) must be 
completed before the creditor agency submits the debt claim.
    (iv) If the debtor receives the notice and responds by consenting to 
the collection, the creditor agency must send a copy of the debtor's 
consent along with the debt claim.
    (4) Debt claims excepted from procedures described in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section. Creditor agencies follow specific procedures 
approved by OPM, rather than those described in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section, for the collection of--
    (i) Debts due because of the individual's failure to pay health 
benefits premiums while he or she was in nonpay status or while his or 
her salary was not sufficient to cover the cost of premiums;
    (ii) Unpaid Federal taxes to be collected by Internal Revenue 
Service levy;
    (iii) Premiums due because of the annuitant's election of Part B, 
Medicare coverage (retroactive collection limited to 6 months of 
premiums); or
    (iv) Overpaid military retired pay an annuitant elects in writing to 
have withheld from his or her annuity.
    (5) General certification requirements for debt claims. Creditor 
agencies submitting debt claims must certify--
    (i) That the debt is owed to the United States;
    (ii) The amount and reason for the debt and whether additional 
interest accrues;
    (iii) The date the Government's right to collect the debt first 
accrued;
    (iv) The agency has complied with the applicable statutes, 
regulations, and OPM procedures;
    (v) That if a competent administrative or judicial authority issues 
an order directing OPM to pay a debtor an amount previously paid to the 
agency (regardless of the reasons behind the order), the agency will 
reimburse OPM or pay the debtor directly within 15 days of the date of 
the order (NOTE: OPM may, at its discretion, decline to collect other 
debt claims sent by an agency that does not abide by this 
certification.);
    (vi) If the collection will be in installments, the amount or 
percentage of net annuity in each installment; and,
    (vii) If the debtor does not (in writing) consent to the offset, or 
does not (in writing) acknowledge receipt of the required notices and 
procedures, or the creditor agency does not document a

[[Page 163]]

judgment offset or a previous salary offset, the action(s) taken to 
comply with 4 CFR 102.3, including any required hearing or review, and 
the date(s) the action(s) was taken.
    (6) Notice of debt. When a creditor agency cannot send a complete 
debt claim, it should notify OPM of the existence of the debt so the 
lump-sum will not be paid before the debt claim arrives.
    (i) The notice to OPM must include a statement that the debt is owed 
to the United States, the date the debt first accrued, and the basis for 
and amount of the debt, if known. If the amount of the debt is not 
known, the agency must establish the amount and notify OPM in writing as 
soon as possible after submitting the notice.
    (ii) The creditor agency may either notify OPM by making a notation 
in column 8 [Remarks] under ``Fiscal Record'' on the Standard Form 2806 
(Individual Retirement Record), if the SF 2806 is in its possession, or 
if not, by submitting a separate document identifying the debtor by 
name, giving his or her date of birth, social security number, and date 
of separation, if known.
    (c) Time limits for sending records and debt claims to OPM--(1) Time 
limits for submitting debt claims. Unless there is an application for 
refund pending, there is no specific time for submitting a debt claim or 
notice of debt to OPM. Generally, however, agencies must file a debt 
claim before the statute of limitations expires (4 CFR 102.4(c)) or 
before a refund is paid. Time limits are imposed (see Sec. 831.1806(a)) 
when the debtor is eligible for a refund and OPM receives his or her 
application requesting payment. In the latter situation, creditor 
agencies must file a complete debt claim within 120 days (or 180 days if 
the agency requests an extension of time before the refund is paid) of 
the date OPM requests a complete debt claim.
    (2) Time limit for submitting retirement records to OPM. A paying 
agency must send an individual's SF 2806 to OPM no later than 60 days 
after the separation, termination, or entrance on duty in a position in 
which the employee is not covered by the Civil Service Retirement 
System.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1806  OPM processing for non-fraud claims.

    (a) Refunds--incomplete debt claims. (1) If a creditor agency sends 
OPM a notice of debt or an incomplete debt claim against a refund OPM is 
processing for payment, OPM will withhold the amount of the debt but 
will not make any payment to the creditor agency. OPM will notify the 
creditor agency that the procedures in this subpart and 4 CFR 102.4 must 
be completed; and a debt claim must be completed and returned to OPM 
within 120 days of the date of OPM's notice to the creditor agency. Upon 
request, OPM will grant the creditor agency one extension of up to 60 
days if the request for extension is received before the lump-sum 
payment has been made. The extension will commence on the day after the 
120-day period expires so that the total time OPM holds payment of the 
refund will not exceed 180 days.
    (2) During the period allotted the creditor agency for sending OPM a 
complete debt claim, OPM will handle the debtor's application for refund 
under section 8342(a) of title 5, United States Code, in one of two 
ways:
    (i) If the amount of the debt is known, OPM will notify the debtor 
of the debt claim against his or her lump-sum credit, withhold the 
amount of the debt, and pay the balance to the debtor, if any.
    (ii) If the amount of the debt is not known, OPM will not pay any 
amount to the debtor until the creditor agency certifies the amount of 
the debt, submits a complete debt claim, or the time limit for 
submission of the debt claim expires, whichever comes first.
    (b) Refunds--complete debt claims--(1) If OPM receives an 
application from the debtor prior to or at the same time as the agency's 
debt claim. (i) If a refund has been paid, we will notify the creditor 
agency there are no funds available for offset. Except in the case of 
debts due because of the employee's failure to pay health benefits 
premiums while he or she is in nonpay status or while his or her salary 
was not sufficient to cover the cost of premiums, creditor agencies 
should refer to the instructions in the FCCS for other measures to 
recover the outstanding debt; however, OPM will retain the SF 2805 on

[[Page 164]]

file in the event the debtor is once again employed in a position 
subject to retirement deductions.
    (ii) If a refund is payable, and the creditor agency submits a 
complete debt claim in accordance with Sec. 831.1805(b) (1), (2), (3), 
or (4), the debt will be collected from the refund and any balance paid 
to the debtor. OPM will send the debtor a copy of the debt claim, 
judgment, consent, or other document, and notify him or her that the 
creditor agency was paid.
    (2) If OPM has not received an application from the debtor when the 
agency's debt claim is received. If a debtor has not filed application 
for a refund, OPM will retain the debt claim for future recovery. OPM 
will make the collection whenever an application is received, provided 
the creditor agency initiated the administrative offset before the 
statute of limitations expired. (See 4 CFR 102.3(b)(3) and 102.4(c).) 
OPM will notify the creditor agency that it does not have an application 
from the debtor so that the agency may take other action to recover the 
debt. (Note: If the recovery action is successful, the creditor agency 
must notify OPM so it can void the debt claim).
    (3) Future recovery. (i) If OPM receives an application for refund 
within 1 year of the date the agency's debt claim was received and the 
creditor agency does not indicate that interest is accruing on the debt, 
the debt will be processed as stated in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this 
section.
    (ii) If OPM receives an application for refund within 1 year of the 
date the agency's debt claim was received and the creditor agency 
indicates that interest accrues on the debt, when necessary, OPM will 
contact the creditor agency to confirm that the debt is outstanding and 
request submission in writing, of the total additional accrued interest. 
OPM will not make interest computations for creditor agencies.
    (iii) When OPM receives an application for refund more than 1 year 
after the creditor agency's debt claim was received, whether interest 
accrues or not, OPM will contact the creditor agency to see if the debt 
is still outstanding and, when necessary, request an update of the 
interest charges. If the debt is still due, the creditor agency must 
give the debtor an opportunity to establish that his or her changed 
financial circumstances, if any, would make the offset unjust. (See 4 
CFR 102.4(c).) If the creditor agency determines that offset as 
requested in the debt claim would be unjust because of the debtor's 
changed financial circumstances, the agency should permit the debtor to 
offer a satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset. If the agency 
decides to pursue the offset, it must submit to OPM the requested 
information and any new instructions within 60 days of the date of OPM's 
request or the claim may be voided and the balance paid to the 
individual.
    (c) Annuities--incomplete debt claims. If a creditor agency sends 
OPM notice of a debt or an incomplete debt claim against a debtor who is 
receiving an annuity, OPM will not offset the annuity. OPM will notify 
the creditor agency that the procedures in this subpart and 4 CFR 102.4 
must be completed; and a debt claim must be completed and sent to OPM. 
No time limit will be given for the submission of a debt claim against 
an annuity; however, a complete debt claim must be received within 10 
years of the date the Government's right to collect first accrued (4 CFR 
102.3(b)(3)).
    (d) Annuities--complete debt claims--(1) General--(i) Notice. When 
OPM receives a complete debt claim and an application for annuity, OPM 
will offset the annuity, pay the creditor agency, and mail the debtor a 
copy of the debt claim along with notice of the payment to the creditor 
agency.
    (ii) Beginning deductions. If OPM has already established the 
debtor's annuity payment, deductions will begin with the next available 
annuity payment. If OPM is in the process of establishing the annuity 
payments, deductions will not be taken from advance annuity payments, 
but will begin with the annuity payable on the first day of the month 
following the last advance payment.
    (iii) Updating accrued interest. Once OPM has completed a 
collection, if there are additional accrued interest charges, the 
creditor agency must contact OPM regarding any additional amount due 
within 90 days of the date of the final payment.

[[Page 165]]

    (2) Claims held for future recovery. (i) If OPM receives an 
application for annuity within 1 year of the date the agency's debt 
claim was received, the debt will be processed as stated in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section.
    (ii) If OPM receives an application for annuity more than 1 year 
after the agency's debt claim was submitted, OPM will contact the 
creditor agency to see if the debt is still outstanding. If the debt is 
still due, the creditor agency should permit the debtor to offer a 
satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset if the debtor establishes 
that his or her changed financial circumstances would make the offset 
unjust. (See 4 CFR 102.4(c).) If the agency decides to pursue the 
offset, it must submit the requested information and any new 
instructions about the collection to OPM.
    (3) Limitations on OPM review. In no case will OPM review--
    (1) The merits of a creditor agency's decision with regard to 
reconsideration, compromise, or waiver; or
    (2) The creditor agency's decision that a hearing was not required 
in any particular proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1807  Installment withholdings.

    (a) When possible, OPM will collect a creditor agency's full claim 
in one payment from the debtor's refund or annuity.
    (b) If collection must be made from an annuity and the debt is 
large, the creditor agency must generally accept payment in 
installments. The responsibility for establishing and notifying the 
debtor of the amount of the installments belongs to the creditor agency 
(see Sec. 831.1805(b)(5)). However, OPM will not make an installment 
deduction for more than 50 percent of net annuity, unless a higher 
percentage is needed to satisfy a judgment against a debtor within 3 
years or the annuitant has consented to the higher amount in writing. 
All correspondence concerning installment deductions received by OPM 
will be referred to the creditor agency for consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1808  Special processing for fraud claims.

    When an agency sends a claim indicating fraud, presentation of a 
false claim, misrepresentation by the debtor or any other party 
interested in the claim, or any claim based in whole or part on conduct 
violating the antitrust laws, to the Department of Justice (Justice) for 
possible treatment as a fraud claim (4 CFR 101.3), the following special 
procedures apply.
    (a) Agency processing. If the debtor is separated or separates while 
Justice is reviewing the claim, the paying agency must send the SF 2806 
to OPM, as required by Sec. 831.1805(c)(2). The agency where the claim 
arose must send OPM notice that a claim is pending with Justice. (See 
Sec. 831.1805(b)(6) for instructions on giving OPM a notice of debt.)
    (b) Department of Justice processing. (1) The Attorney General or a 
designee will decide whether a debt claim sent in by an agency will be 
reserved for collection by Justice as a fraud claim. Upon receiving a 
possible fraud claim to be collected by offset from the Fund, the 
Attorney General or a designee must notify OPM. The notice to OPM must 
contain the following:
    (i) The name, date of birth, and social security number of the 
debtor;
    (ii) The amount of the possible fraud claim, if known;
    (iii) The basis of the possible fraud claim; and
    (iv) A statement that the claim is being considered as a possible 
fraud claim, the collection of which is reserved to Justice.
    (2) When there is a pending refund application, the Attorney General 
or designee must file a complaint seeking a judgment on the claim and 
send a copy of the complaint to OPM; or as provided in 4 CFR 101.3, 
refer the claim to the agency where the claim arose and submit a copy of 
the referral to OPM within 180 days of the date of either notice from 
the agency that a claim is pending with Justice (paragraph (a) of this 
section) or notice from Justice that it has received a possible fraud 
claim (paragraph (b)(1) of this section) whichever is earlier. When the 
claim is referred to the agency where it arose, the agency must begin 
administrative collection action under 4 CFR 102.4 and send a complete 
debt claim to OPM as required in Sec. 831.1805.

[[Page 166]]

    (c) OPM processing against refunds. (1) Upon receipt of a notice 
under paragraph (a) or (b)(1) of this section, whichever is earlier, OPM 
will withhold the amount of the debt claim, if known; notify the debtor 
that the amount of the debt will be withheld from the refund for at 
least 180 days from the date of the notice that initiated OPM 
processing; and pay the balance to the debtor. If the amount of the debt 
claim is not known, OPM will notify the debtor that a debt claim may be 
offset against his or her refund and that OPM will not pay any amount 
until either the amount of the debt claim is established, or the time 
limit for filing a complaint in court or submitting the debt claim 
expires, whichever comes first.
    (2) If the Attorney General files a complaint and notifies OPM 
within the applicable 180-day period, OPM will continue to withhold 
payment of the lump-sum credit until there is a final judgment.
    (3) If the Attorney General refers the claim to the agency where the 
claim arose (creditor agency) and notifies OPM within the applicable 
180-day period, OPM will notify the creditor agency that the procedures 
in this subpart and 4 CFR 102.4 must be completed; and a debt claim must 
be sent to OPM within 120 days of the date of OPM's notice to the 
creditor agency. At the request of the creditor agency, one extension of 
time of not more than 60 days will be granted, as provided by Sec. 
831.1806(a).
    (4) If OPM is not notified that a complaint has been filed or that 
the claim has been referred to the creditor agency within the applicable 
180-day period, OPM will pay the balance of the refund to the debtor.
    (d) OPM processing against annuities. If the debtor has filed an 
annuity claim, OPM will not take action against the annuity. OPM will 
continue to pay the annuity unless and until there is a final judgment 
for the United States or submission of a complete debt claim.
    (e) OPM collection and payment of the debt. (1) If the United States 
obtains a judgment against the debtor for the amount of the debt or the 
creditor agency submits a complete debt claim, OPM will collect and pay 
the debt to the creditor agency as provided in Sec. Sec. 831.1806 and 
831.1807.
    (2) If the suit or the administrative proceeding results in a 
judgment for the debtor without establishing a debt to the United 
States, OPM will pay the balance of the refund to the debtor upon 
receipt of a certified copy of the judgment or administrative decision.

<R05>
Sec. 831.1902  Federal-State agreements.

    OPM will enter into an agreement with any State within 120 days of 
an application for agreement from the proper State official. The terms 
of the standard agreement will be Sec. Sec. 831.1903 through 831.1906 
of this subpart. OPM and the State may agree to additional terms and 
provisions, insofar as those additional terms and provisions do not 
contradict or otherwise limit the terms of the standard agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1903  OPM responsibilities.

    OPM will, in performance of this agreement:
    (a) Process the magnetic tape containing State tax transactions 
against the annuity roll once a month at the time monthly recurring 
payments are prepared for the United States Treasury Department. Errors 
that are identified will not be processed into the file, and will be 
identified and returned to the State for resolution via the monthly 
error report. Collections of State income tax will continue in effect 
until the State requesting the initial action supplies either a valid 
revocation or change. The magnetic tape must be received 35 days prior 
to the date of the check in which the transactions are to be effective. 
For example, withholding transactions for the July 1 check must be 
received 5 days prior to June 1. If the magnetic tape submitted by the 
State cannot be read, OPM will notify the State of this fact, and if a 
satisfactory replacement can be supplied in time for monthly processing, 
it will be processed.
    (b) Deduct from the regular, recurring annuity payments of an 
annuitant the amount he or she has so requested to be withheld, provided 
that:
    (1) The amount of the request is an even dollar amount, not less 
than Five Dollars nor more than the net recurring amount. The State may 
set any even dollar amount above Five Dollars as a minimum withholding 
amount.
    (2) The annuitant has not designated more than one other State for 
withholding purposes within the calendar year. The State can set any 
limit on the number of changes an annuitant may make in the amount to be 
withheld.
    (c) Retain the amounts withheld in the Fund until payment is due.
    (d) Pay the net withholding to the State on the last day of the 
first month following each calendar quarter.
    (e) Make the following reports:
    (1) A monthly report which will include all the State tax 
withholdings, cancellations and adjustments for the month, and also each 
request OPM was not able to process, with an explanation, in coded 
format, of the reason for rejection.

[[Page 168]]

    (2) A quarterly report which will include State, State address, 
quarterly withholdings, quarterly cancellations and adjustments, 
quarterly net withholdings and year-to-date amounts. Where cancelled or 
adjusted payments were made in a previous year, OPM shall append a 
listing of the cancelled or adjusted payments which shows the date and 
amount of each cancelled or adjusted tax withholding, and the name and 
Social Security identification number of the annuitant from whom it was 
withheld. If either party terminates the agreement and the amount of 
cancelled or adjusted deductions exceeds the amount withheld for the 
final quarter, then the quarterly report shall show the amount to be 
refunded to OPM and the address to which payment should be made.
    (3) An annual summary report which contains the name, Social 
Security identification number, and total amount withheld from non-
cancelled payments during the previous calendar year, for each annuitant 
who requested tax withholding payable to the State. In the event the 
annuitant had State income tax withholding in effect for more than one 
State in that calendar year, the report will show only the amount 
withheld for the State receiving the report.
    (4) An annual report to each annuitant for whom State income taxes 
were withheld giving the amount of withholding paid to the State during 
the calendar year.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1904  State responsibilities.

    The State will, in performance of this agreement:
    (a) Accept requests and revocations from annuitants who have 
designated that State income tax deductions will go to the State.
    (b) Convert these requests on a monthly basis to a machine-readable 
magnetic tape using specifications received from OPM, and forward that 
tape to OPM for processing.
    (c) Inform annuitants whose tax requests are rejected by OPM that 
the request was so rejected and of the reason why it was so rejected.
    (d) Recognize that, to the extent not prohibited by State laws, 
records maintained by the State relating to this program are considered 
jointly maintained by OPM and are subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 
U.S.C. 552a). Accordingly, the States will maintain such records in 
accordance with that statute and OPM's implementing regulations at 5 CFR 
part 297.
    (e) Respond to requests of annuitants for information and advice in 
regard to State income tax withholding.
    (f) Credit the amounts withheld from civil service annuities to the 
State tax liability of the respective annuitants, and, subject to 
applicable provisions of State law to the contrary, refund any balance 
over and above that liability to the annuitant, unless he or she should 
request otherwise.
    (g) Surrender all tax withholding requests to OPM when this 
agreement is terminated or when the documents are not otherwise needed 
for this State tax withholding program.
    (h) Allow OPM, the Comptroller General or any of their duly 
authorized representatives access to, and the right to examine, all 
records, books, papers or documents related to the processing of 
requests for State income tax withholding from civil service annuities.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1905  Additional provisions.

    These additional provisions are also binding on the State and OPM:
    (a) A request or revocation is effective when processed by OPM. OPM 
will process each request by the first day of the second month following 
the month in which it is received, but incurs no liability or 
indebtedness by its failure to do so.
    (b) Any amount deducted from an annuity payment and paid to the 
State as a result of a request is deemed properly paid, unless the 
annuity payment itself is cancelled.
    (c) OPM will provide the State with the information necessary to 
properly process a request for State income tax withholding.
    (d) If the State is paid withholding which is contrary to the terms 
of the annuitant's request, the State is liable to the annuitant for the 
amount improperly withheld, and subject to account verification from 
OPM, agrees to pay that amount to the annuitant on demand.

[[Page 169]]

    (e) In the case of a disputed amount in any of the reports described 
and authorized by this agreement, the Associate Director for 
Compensation of OPM will issue an accounting. If the State finds this 
accounting unacceptable, it may then and only then pursue such remedies 
as are otherwise available.
    (f) If a State receives an overpayment of monies properly belonging 
to the Fund, OPM will offset the overpayment from a future payment due 
the State. If there are no further payments due the State, OPM will 
inform the State in writing of the amount due. Within 60 days of the 
date of receipt of that communication the State will make payment of the 
amount due.


<R05>
Sec. 831.1906  Agreement modification and termination.

    This agreement may be modified or terminated in the following 
manner:
    (a) Either party may suggest a modification of non-regulatory

days written notice.

making process described in sections 553, 1103, 1105 of title 5, United 
States Code.

<R05>
Sec. 831.2011  Effect of part 772 of this chapter on CSRS lump-sum payments.

    (a) An interim appointment under Sec. 772.102 of this chapter does 
not affect the lump-sum payment of retirement contributions made to a 
separated employee unless it becomes effective within 31 days of the 
employee's separation from the service. An interim appointment effective 
within 31 days of the employee's separation makes the employee 
ineligible for the lump-sum payment. Payments made in error will be 
collected under subpart M of part 831 of this chapter.
    (b) When an employee's separation is cancelled after the MSPB 
initial decision becomes final, when the Board issues a final order 
cancelling the employee's separation, or when the agency and the 
employee agree to cancel the separation, the agency must notify OPM and 
request the amount of the erroneous lump-sum payment.
    (c) At the time the employee's separation is cancelled, the agency 
must deduct the amount of the lump-sum payment from any back pay to 
which the employee is entitled as required by 5 CFR 550.805(e).
    (d) Amounts recovered from back pay will not be subject to waiver 
consideration under 5 U.S.C. 8346(b). If there is no back pay or the 
back pay is insufficient to recover the erroneous payment, the employee 
may request that OPM waive the recovery of the uncollected portion of 
the overpayment. If waiver is not granted, the employee must repay the 
erroneous payment.

and reservists. ``Period of service'' includes consecutive periods of 
service where there is no break in service, but does not include any 
lost time.
    Service is active honorable military service performed after 
December 31, 1956.

employee, Member, or survivor eligible to make a deposit for service 
provides copies of all official military pay documents, as identified in 
instructions published by OPM, which show the exact basic pay he or she 
received for a full period of service. If an employee, Member, or 
survivor does not have sufficient evidence of basic pay, he or she shall 
obtain a statement of estimated earnings from the appropriate branch of 
the military service.
    Survivor shall have the same meaning as in 5 U.S.C. 8331(10).

<R05>
Sec. 831.2201  Purpose.

    This subpart explains the benefits available to employees and 
Members who elect an alternative form of annuity under section 8343a of 
title 5, United States Code.


<R05>
Sec. 831.2202  Definitions.

    In this subpart--
    Alternative form of annuity means the benefit elected under Sec. 
831.2204.
    Current spouse annuity has the same meaning as in Sec. 831.603.
    Date of final adjudication means the date 30 days after the date of 
the first regular monthly payment as defined in Sec. 831.603.
    Former spouse annuity has the same meaning as in Sec. 831.603.
    Lump-sum credit has the same meaning as in 5 U.S.C. 8331(8).
    Present value factor represents the amount of money (earning 
interest at an assumed rate) required at the time of retirement to fund 
an annuity that: (a) Starts out at the rate of $1 a month and is payable 
in monthly installments for the annuitant's lifetime based on mortality 
rates for non-disability annuitants under the Civil Service Retirement 
System; and (b) increases each year at an assumed rate of inflation. 
Interest, mortality, and inflation rates used in computing the present 
value are those used by the Board of Actuaries of the Civil Service 
Retirement System for valuation of the System, based on dynamic 
assumptions. The present value factors are unisex

[[Page 175]]

factors obtained by averaging sex-distinct present value factors, 
weighted by the total dollar value of annuities typically paid to new 
retirees at each age.
    Time of retirement has the same meaning as in Sec. 831.603.

before the date of final adjudication is deemed to have made an 
affirmative election under paragraph (a) with a fully reduced annuity to 
provide a current spouse annuity, regardless of any election completed

with the order of precedence established under 5 U.S.C. 8342(c).
    (g) If an annuitant described in paragraph (f) has completed an 
election under Sec. 831.611(a) or (b)--

Sec. 831.2203 may elect to receive his or her lump-sum credit plus an

    (b) A retired employee or Member who elected an alternative form of

except that an individual who elected an alternative form of annuity is 
not eligible to apply for disability annuity under section 8337 of such 
subchapter.

[51 FR 42989, Nov. 28, 1986, as amended at 53 FR 11634, Apr. 8, 1988; 54 
FR 10136, Mar. 10, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 831.2205  Computation of alternative form of annuity.

    (a) To compute the beginning rate of annuity payable to a retiree 
who elects an alternative form of annuity, OPM will first compute the 
monthly rate of annuity otherwise payable under subchapter III of 
chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, including all reductions 
provided under the subchapter other than those in Sec. 8343a. That 
monthly rate is then reduced by an amount equal to the retiree's lump-
sum credit divided by the present value factor for the retiree's 
attained age (in full years) at the time of retirement. The reduced 
monthly rate is then rounded to the next lowest dollar and becomes the 
rate of annuity payable.
    (b) OPM will publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing any 
proposed adjustments in present value factors at least 30 days before 
the effective date of the adjustments.


<R05>
Sec. 831.2206  Election to pay deposit or redeposit for civilian service.

    (a) If an employee or Member who elects an alternative form of 
annuity owes a deposit or redeposit for civilian service, and elects to 
pay that deposit or redeposit before the date of final adjudication, OPM 
will compute the annuity as if the deposit or redeposit had been made 
and will deem that deposit or redeposit to be included in the lump-sum 
credit for the purpose of computing the reduction in annuity under Sec. 
831.2205.
    (b) The amount of a deposit or redeposit deemed paid under paragraph 
(a) of this section will include any interest owed by the employee or 
Member under 5 U.S.C. 8334.
    (c) For the purpose of paragraph (a) of this section, ``redeposit'' 
does not include a redeposit owed for service for which credit is 
allowed pursuant to Sec. 831.303(c)(1).

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if the 
annuity of an employee or Member commences after

[[Page 177]]

January 3, 1988, and before October 1, 1989, the lump-sum credit payable 
under Sec. 831.2204 is payable to the individual, or his or her 
survivors, according to the following schedule:
    (1) Sixty percent of the lump-sum credit is payable at the time of 
retirement, and
    (2) Forty percent is payable, with interest determined under section 
8334(e)(3) of title 5, United States Code, one year after the time of 
retirement.
    (b) If an employee or Member whose annuity commences after January 
3, 1988, and before October 1, 1989, dies before the date of final 
adjudication, that individual is subject to Sec. 831.2203 (f) or (g), 
but the lump-sum credit will be paid in accordance with the schedule in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) An annuitant is exempt from the deferred payment schedule under 
paragraph (a) of this section if the individual--
    (1) Separates involuntarily, other than for cause on charges of 
delinquency or misconduct, or
    (2) Has, at the time of retirement, a life-threatening affliction or 
other critical medical condition.
    (3)(i) For the purpose of this section, life-threatening affliction 
or other critical medical condition means a medical condition so severe 
as to reasonably limit an individual's probable life expectancy to less 
than 2 years.
    (ii) The existence of one of the following medical conditions is 
prima facie evidence of a life threatening affliction or other critical 
medical condition:
    (A) Metastatic and/or inoperable neoplasms.
    (B) Aortic stenosis (severe).

alternative form of annuity. For the purpose of this section, 
``physician'' has the same meaning given that term in Sec. 339.102 of 
this chapter.
    (iv) If a medical condition other than those listed in paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section is claimed as a basis for exemption from the 
deferred payment schedule, OPM will review the physician's certification 
to determine whether the cited condition is life-threatening or 
critical.
    (v) The cost of providing medical documentation under this paragraph 
rests with the employee or Member, unless OPM exercises its choice of 
physician.

    (b) If a retiree whose annuity commences after December 2, 1989, and 
before October 1, 1994, and who is otherwise entitled to a computation 
under this subpart, dies before the date of final adjudication, that 
individual is subject to Sec. 831.2203 (f) or (g), but the lump-sum 
credit will be paid in accordance with the schedule in paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (c)(1) A retiree is exempt from the deferred payment schedule under

annuitant who does not elect, or is not eligible to elect, an

    (2) OPM can clearly establish at the time of the referral that the 
automatic stay under 11 U.S.C. 362 has been lifted or is no longer in 
effect with respect to the person owing the debt or his or her spouse, 
and the debt was not discharged in the bankruptcy proceeding;
    (g) Cannot currently be collected under the salary offset provisions 
of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);

exceed $100.


<R05>
Sec. 835.603  Notification of intent to collect.

    (a) Notification before submission to the IRS. A request for 
reduction of an IRS income tax refund will be made only after OPM makes 
a determination that an amount is owed and past-due and gives or makes a 
reasonable attempt to give the debtor 60 days written notice of the 
intent to collect by IRS tax refund offset.
    (b) Contents of notice. OPM's notice of intention to collect by IRS 
tax refund offset (Notice of Intent) will state:
    (1) The amount of the debt;
    (2) That unless the debt is repaid within 60 days from the date of 
OPM's Notice of Intent, OPM intends to collect the debt by requesting 
the IRS to reduce any amounts payable to the debtor as a Federal income 
tax refund by an amount equal to the amount of the debt and all 
accumulated interest and other charges;
    (3) A mailing address for forwarding any written correspondence and 
a contract name and a telephone number for any questions; and
    (4) That the debtor may present evidence to OPM that all or part of 
the debt is not past due or legally enforceable by--
    (i) Sending a written request for a review of the evidence to the 
address provided in the notice;
    (ii) Stating in the request the amount disputed and the reasons why

[[Page 180]]

the debtor believes that the debt is not past-due or is not legally 
enforceable;
    (iii) Including in the request any documents that the debtor wishes 
to be considered or stating that the additional information will be 
submitted within the remainder of the 60-day period.


<R05>
Sec. 835.604  Reasonable attempt to notify.

    In order to constitute a reasonable attempt to notify the debtor, 
OPM must have used a mailing address for the debtor obtained from the 
IRS pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6103(m)(2) within a period of 1 year preceding 
the attempt to notify the debtor, unless OPM received clear and concise 
notification from the debtor that notices from the agency are to be sent 
to an address different from the address obtained from IRS. Clear and 
concise notice means that the debtor has provided the agency with 
written notification, including the debtor's name and identifying number 
(as defined in 26 CFR 301.6109-1), and the debtor's intent to have the 
agency notices sent to the new address.


<R05>
Sec. 835.605  OPM action as a result of consideration of evidence submitted 
as a result of the notice of intent.

    (a) Consideration of evidence. If, as a result of the Notice of 
Intent, OPM receives notice that the debtor will submit additional 
evidence or receives additional evidence from the debtor within the 
prescribed time period, any notice to the IRS will be stayed until OPM 
can--
    (1) Consider the evidence presented by the debtor; and
    (2) Determine whether or not all or a portion of the debt is still 
past due and legally enforceable; and
    (3) Notify the debtor of its determination.
    (b) Notification to the debtor. Following review of the evidence, 
OPM will issue a written decision notifying the debtor whether OPM has 
sustained, amended, or canceled its determination that the debt is past-
due and legally enforceable. The notice will advise the debtor of any 
further action to be taken and explain the supporting rationale for the 
decision.
    (c) OPM action on the debt. (1) OPM will notify the debtor of its 
intent to refer the debt to the IRS for offset against the debtor's 
Federal income tax refund, if it sustains its decision that the debt is 
past-due and legally enforceable. OPM will also notify the debtor 
whether the amount of the debt remains the same or is modified.
    (2) OPM will not refer the debt to the IRS for offset against the 
debtor's Federal income tax refund, if it reverses its decision that the 
debt is past-due and legally enforceable.


<R05>
Sec. 835.606  Change in notification to Internal Revenue Service.

    (a) Except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section, after OPM 
sends IRS notification of an individual's liability for a debt, OPM will 
promptly notify IRS of any change in the notification, if OPM--
    (1) Determines that an error has been made with respect to the 
information contained in the notification;
    (2) Receives a payment or credits a payment to the account of the 
debtor named in the notification that reduces the amount of the debt 
referred to the IRS for offset; or
    (3) Receives notification that the individual owing the debt has 
filed for bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code or has 
been adjudicated bankrupt and the debt has been discharged.
    (b) OPM will not notify the IRS to increase the amount of a debt 
owed by a debtor named in OPM's original notification to the IRS.
    (c) If the amount of a debt is reduced after referral by OPM and 
offset by the IRS, OPM will refund to the debtor any excess amount and 
will promptly notify the IRS of any refund made by OPM.


<R05>
Sec. 835.607  Administrative charges.

    All administrative charges incurred in connection with the referral 
of the debts to the IRS will be assessed on the debt and thus increase 
the amount of the offset.

Sec. 837.202  Annuities that terminate on reemployment.

    (a) FERS annuitants. (1) The annuity of a FERS annuitant who is a 
disability annuitant whom OPM has found recovered or restored to earning 
capacity prior to reemployment terminates on reemployment.
    (2) The annuity of a FERS annuitant who is a former military reserve 
technician awarded a disability retirement annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8456, 
in addition to being subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, shall 
terminate on the date the annuitant declines an offer of employment with 
a department or agency, where the employment is in the same commuting 
area and of the same grade as, or a level equivalent to, the position 
from which the annuitant retired.
    (b) CSRS annuitants. (1) The annuity of a CSRS annuitant terminates 
on reemployment if--
    (i) The annuitant is a disability annuitant whom OPM has found 
recovered or restored to earning capacity prior to reemployment, or 
whose disability annuity was awarded under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
8337(h) because the annuitant was a National Guard Technician who was 
medically disqualified for continued membership in the National Guard;
    (ii) The annuitant is not a retired Member and the annuity is based 
on an involuntary separation (other than a separation that was mandated 
by statute based on the annuitant's age and length of service, or a 
separation for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency) where the 
reemployment would, if the individual were not an annuitant, be covered 
by CSRS;

President to a position that would, if the individual were not an 
annuitant, be covered by CSRS; or
    (iv) The annuitant is not a retired Member and is elected as a 
Member.
    (2) A disability annuity awarded a former National Guard Technician 
under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8337(h) shall terminate on the date the 
annuitant declines an offer of employment with a department or agency,

<R04>
                  Subpart C_Coverage and Contributions


<R05>
Sec. 837.301  Coverage.

    (a) When annuity terminates on, or is suspended during, 
reemployment. Retirement coverage under either CSRS or FERS is governed 
by subpart B of part 831 or subpart A of part 842 of this chapter, as is 
appropriate.
    (b) When annuity continues. (1) Unless a reemployed FERS annuitant's 
employment is on an intermittent basis, as an employee subject to 
another retirement system, or as President, deductions for the Fund 
shall be made under 5 U.S.C. 8422(a).
    (2) A CSRS annuitant is not subject to deductions, unless he or she 
is serving in an other-than-intermittent status (except as President), 
is not covered by another retirement system, and elects to have 
retirement deductions made from his or her pay. Generally, deductions 
are made no later than the beginning of the first pay period immediately 
following the date the reemployed annuitant files the election with the 
employing agency. When the annuitant elects to have deductions made, he 
or she may not change the election during continuous service with that 
agency.
    (3) The amount of basic pay prior to offset of annuity under Sec. 
837.303 of this part is used in computing the amount of deductions. The 
rate of retirement deductions is that which attaches to

[[Page 185]]

the position under the provisions of sections 8334(a), 8334(k), or 
8422(a) of title 5, United States Code, as is applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 837.302  Agency contributions.

    (a) FERS annuitants. An agency that reemploys a FERS annuitant 
subject to retirement deductions under Sec. 837.301(b)(1) of this part 
shall make contributions, as specified in 5 U.S.C. 8423, to the Fund, 
based on the reemployed annuitant's pay prior to offset of annuity under 
the provisions of Sec. 837.303 of this part.
    (b) CSRS annuitants. An agency that reemploys a CSRS annuitant is 
required to make an agency contribution when--
    (1) The annuity is suspended or terminated under the provisions of 
subpart B of this part; and
    (2) The appointment is subject to CSRS deductions under the 
provisions of subpart B of part 831 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 837.303  Annuity offset.

    (a) Applicability. When the right to receive annuity continues 
during reemployment (even though actual receipt of annuity may have been 
waived under 5 U.S.C. 8345(d) or 8465(a)), the pay of the reemployed 
annuitant shall be offset by the amount of annuity allocable to the 
period of reemployment, except that--
    (1) No amount shall be offset from pay in accordance with this 
section for a period for which the annuitant has elected to receive FEC 
benefits in lieu of annuity; and
    (2) No amount shall be offset from a lump-sum payment of annual 
leave, made on or after termination of the reemployment period.
    (b) Payment. The employing agency shall pay to the Fund the full 
amount required to be offset from a reemployed annuitant's salary under 
this section in accordance with instructions issued by OPM. Payment in 
full to the Fund is not contingent on actual offset from the reemployed 
annuitant's salary.
    (c) Computation. To compute the amount of the annuity offset for any 
particular pay period, divide the amount of annuity for the calendar 
days included in the pay period by the number of hours that would 
constitute a full-time tour of duty for that pay period, then multiply 
the result by the number of hours actually paid for the pay period, not 
to exceed the number of hours that constitutes a full-time tour of duty.


<R05>
Sec. 837.304  Agency liability for payments.

    (a) The agency will remit funds properly withheld from the pay of a 
reemployed annuitant in accordance with this subpart to OPM in the 
manner prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and contributions 
as soon as possible, but not later than provided by standards 
established by OPM.
    (b) When the employing agency fails to withhold from the pay of the 
reemployed annuitant some or all of the amounts required to be withheld 
from that pay by this subpart, the employee has received an overpayment 
of pay. The employing agency must collect the overpayment of pay (unless 
it is waived under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or some other applicable statute) and 
remit the proper funds to OPM in the manner prescribed for the 
transmission of withholdings and contributions as soon as possible, but 
not later than provided by standards established by OPM.
    (c) If the employing agency waives the annuitant's repayment of the 
salary overpayment, it must submit--on behalf of the reemployed 
annuitant--an amount equal to the correct deduction from pay (or the 
balance due in the case of a partial deduction) to OPM in the manner 
prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and contributions as 
soon as possible, but not later than provided by standards established 
by OPM.

Sec. 837.305  Lump-sum credit not reduced.

    When annuity continues during the period of reemployment, and the 
reemployment is subject to annuity offset under the provisions of Sec. 
837.303 of this subpart, or any similar provision of law or regulation, 
the amount of an annuitant's lump-sum credit to the Fund shall not be 
reduced by the amount of annuity allocable to the period of 
reemployment.

<R05>
Sec. 837.306  Refund of lump-sum credit.

    An annuitant serving as a justice or judge of the United States, as 
defined by section 451 of title 28, United States Code, may apply for 
and receive payment of the annuitant's lumpsum credit, less the amount 
of annuity or other benefits previously paid on that account. Receipt of 
a refund under this section will irrevocably terminate the right to 
annuity, and the annuitant status, of the recipient, based on any prior 
separations from employment covered by CSRS or FERS.


<R04>
             Subpart D_Reemployment of Disability Annuitants


<R05>
Sec. 837.401  Generally.

    A disability annuitant may be reemployed in any position for which 
he or she is qualified.


<R05>
Sec. 837.402  Special notice.

    (a) To annuitant. In addition to the advice described in paragraph 
837.103(b) of this part, the agency should generally also advise a 
disability annuitant, in writing, prior to reemployment, that--
    (1) Reemployment on a permanent basis in a position equivalent in 
grade and pay to the position from which the annuitant retired may 
constitute the basis for an OPM finding of recovery from disability;
    (2) Reemployment subject to medical and physical qualification 
standards equivalent to those of the position from which the annuitant 
retired may constitute the basis for an OPM finding of recovery from 
disability;
    (3) The pay of the position in which the annuitant is reemployed, 
prior to the offset of annuity, or the pay of an interim appointment 
under Sec. 772.102 of this chapter, as may be applicable, will be 
included as earnings in determining whether the disability annuity will 
be terminated due to restoration to earning capacity;
    (4) Receipt of, or continued entitlement to receive, full or partial 
FEC benefits during reemployment, when those benefits are based on the 
same injury or medical condition that is the basis for OPM's award of 
disability retirement, is conclusive evidence (unless there is 
contravening medical evidence) that the annuitant has not recovered from 
the disability; and
    (5) A disability annuitant age 60 or over cannot be found by OPM to 
be restored to earning capacity, and can only be found recovered at the 
annuitant's request.
    (b) To OPM. On reemployment of a disability annuitant, the employing 
agency shall, in addition to the notice required by Sec. 837.103(a) of 
this part, notify OPM in writing of--
    (1) The physical and medical requirements of the position (providing 
a copy of the employee's position description);
    (2) The position's grade level and/or rate of pay;
    (3) Whether the employment is full-time, part-time, or intermittent;
    (4) Whether, to the best of the agency's knowledge, the reemployed 
annuitant is receiving, or entitled to receive, FEC benefits; and
    (5) Whether any medical evidence was used in making the employment 
decision, and if so, provide OPM with a copy of the medical information.


<R05>
Sec. 837.403  Termination of annuity during reemployment.

    (a) Agency action. When a reemployed disability annuitant is found 
recovered from disability or restored to earning capacity by OPM, OPM 
shall terminate the annuity as of the date of the finding, and the 
employing agency shall cease reducing pay by the amount of annuity 
allocable to the period of reemployment effective that same date. If the 
appointment is subject to retirement deductions, retirement deductions 
will begin or continue, as the case may be.
    (b) Subsequent benefits--(1) CSRS. If, on separation from a period 
of reemployment during which the disability annuity was terminated 
because of recovery or restoration to earning capacity, the former 
disability annuitant is entitled to either an immediate or deferred 
annuity based on the most recent separation, any right to an annuity 
based on a prior separation is permanently extinguished. If no such 
right to immediate or deferred annuity

[[Page 187]]

accrues based on this most recent separation, however, any right to 
immediate or deferred annuity will be determined on the basis of the 
next prior separation.
    (2) FERS. If a disability annuity is terminated during a period of 
reemployment because of recovery or restoration to earning capacity, any 
right to an annuity based on a prior separation is permanently 
extinguished, except as otherwise provided by Sec. 844.405(b)(2) of 
this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 837.404  Reinstatement of annuity during a period of employment not subject to CSRS or FERS.

    When OPM reinstates the disability annuity of an individual employed 
in a position not subject to CSRS or FERS, the employing agency shall 
withhold retirement deductions and offset pay subject to the provisions 
of subpart C of this part, as of the date of OPM's administrative 
determination of reinstatement. OPM shall offset from any retroactive 
payment of annuity for a period that is also a period of employment an 
amount equal to the amount of annuity, or the pay for the period of 
employment, whichever is the lesser.


<R04>
               Subpart E_Retirement Benefits on Separation


<R05>
Sec. 837.501  Refund of retirement deductions.

    A reemployed annuitant who separates from reemployment without title 
to either a supplemental annuity or a redetermined annuity under this 
subpart is entitled to have any retirement deductions withheld from pay 
during the period of reemployment refunded without interest.


<R05>
Sec. 837.502  Reinstatement of annuity.

    (a) When appropriate. (1) When an annuity was terminated because of 
reemployment under the provisions of Sec. 837.202 of this part, or any 
similar provision of statute or regulation in effect prior to the 
promulgation of this part, the annuity that was terminated will be 
reinstated effective the date immediately following the date the 
reemployed annuitant separated from reemployment, if--
    (i) The reemployed annuitant's right to annuity has not been 
terminated under any other provision of regulation or statute; and
    (ii) The reemployed annuitant is not entitled to either an immediate 
or deferred CSRS or FERS annuity based on the separation from 
reemployment.
    (2) When an annuity was suspended because of reemployment under the 
provisions of Sec. 837.203 of this part, the annuity that was suspended 
will be reinstated effective the date immediately following the date the 
reemployed annuitant separated from reemployment.
    (b) Amount of reinstated annuity. The amount of an annuity 
reinstated under the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section will 
be the amount of the annuity at the effective date of termination, 
adjusted by such adjustments as would have occurred had the annuity 
remained payable during the period of reemployment.


<R05>
Sec. 837.503  Supplemental annuity.

    (a) Title requirements. A reemployed annuitant is entitled, on 
separation, or conversion to intermittent service, to a supplemental 
annuity if--
    (1) The annuitant performed--
    (i) At least 1 year of actual, continuous, full-time service;
    (ii) Actual, continuous part-time service equivalent to 1 year of 
actual full-time service; or
    (iii) A combination of part-time and full-time actual, continuous 
service that is equivalent to 1 year of actual full-time service; and
    (2)(i) The annuity is not terminated or suspended on reemployment; 
and
    (ii) The pay during reemployment was subject to offset by the amount 
of annuity allocable to the period of reemployment; or
    (iii) The reemployed annuitant separates from an interim appointment 
made under the provisions of Sec. 772.102 of this chapter.
    (b) Computation of supplemental annuity--(1) CSRS. (i) That portion 
of a supplemental annuity that is based on the total years and full 
months of creditable reemployment service performed while covered under 
CSRS, is computed under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8339(a), (b), (d), 
(e), (h), (i), (n) and (q). Unused

[[Page 188]]

sick leave to the reemployed annuitant's credit immediately prior to 
separation from reemployed annuitant service will be credited under the 
rules prescribed in Sec. 831.302 of this chapter, and 5 U.S.C. 8339(m), 
not to exceed the amount of unused sick leave available immediately 
before the effective date of an election of FERS coverage, and not 
including any unused sick leave included in the computation of an 
annuity or supplemental annuity the annuitant is receiving at the time 
of separation from the most recent period of reemployment.
    (ii) A supplemental annuity computed in whole or in part under the 
provisions of this paragraph, using CSRS-Offset service, is subject to 
reduction under subpart G of this part.
    (2) FERS. That portion of a supplemental annuity that is based on 
the total years and full months of creditable reemployment service 
performed on and after the effective date of FERS coverage is computed 
under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8415 (a) through (f).
    (3) Average pay. The average pay used in the computation of a 
supplemental annuity is the average basic pay for the entire period of 
actual continuous reemployment service, excluding intermittent service.
    (4) Survivor reduction. If the reemployed annuitant's annuity, at 
the time he or she applies for supplemental annuity, is reduced to 
provide a survivor benefit for a spouse, (or, for FERS annuitants only, 
a former spouse), the supplemental annuity will be reduced by 10 
percent, and the survivor annuities increased, if the annuitant was 
retired under CSRS, by 55 percent of the supplemental annuity, and if 
the annuitant was retired under FERS, by 50 percent of the supplemental 
annuity, unless the reemployed annuitant notifies OPM at the time of 
application that he or she does not wish to have such reductions and 
increases effected.
    (c) Creditable service. (1) All actual reemployment service 
performed after the date of retirement on a full-time or part-time basis 
may be credited in the computation of a supplemental annuity provided--
    (i) When the reemployment service was performed on or after October 
1, 1982, retirement deductions were withheld or, for CSRS annuitants, a 
deposit has been paid under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8334;
    (ii) The reemployment service was not performed subject to another 
retirement system, except when the deductions under the other retirement 
system have been refunded and a deposit paid to OPM, where the law so 
permits, or benefits under the other retirement system have been waived 
in favor of CSRS or FERS benefits; and
    (iii) The reemployment service has not been used in the computation 
of another supplemental or redetermined annuity.
    (2) A period of reemployment service during which annuitant status 
continues and annuity is paid, and which is excluded from the normal 
annuity offset from pay by special statutory provision, cannot be 
credited in the computation of a supplemental annuity or any subsequent 
annuity entitlement.
    (d) Commencing date. (1) Except as provided in clause (2) of this 
subparagraph, the supplemental annuity commences on the earlier of the 
first day of the month following--
    (i) The day the annuitant is separated from reemployment; or
    (ii) The day the annuitant is converted to an intermittent status.
    (2) The supplemental annuity of a FERS annuitant, and the 
supplemental annuity of a CSRS reemployed annuitant who has not elected 
FERS coverage and who was--
    (i) Involuntarily separated from the reemployment service (except by 
removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency);
    (ii) Involuntarily converted to an intermittent status, or;
    (iii) Separated from reemployment service, or converted to 
intermittent status, after serving 3 days or less in the month of such 
separation or conversion--shall commence on the earlier of the day after 
separation from reemployment service, the effective date of conversion 
to intermittent status, or the day after the date pay ceases.

<R05>
Sec. 837.504  Redetermined annuity.

    (a) Title requirements. (1) A reemployed annuitant is entitled, on 
separation, or conversion to intermittent service, to a redetermined 
annuity if--
    (i) The annuitant performed--
    (A) At least 5 years of actual, continuous, full-time service;
    (B) Actual, continuous part-time service equivalent to 5 years of 
actual full-time service, or;
    (C) A combination of part-time and full-time actual, continuous 
service that is equivalent to 5 years of actual full-time service.
    (ii)(A) The annuity was not terminated or suspended during 
reemployment; and
    (B) The pay during reemployment was subject to offset by the amount 
of annuity allocable to the period of reemployment; or
    (C) The reemployed annuitant separated from an interim appointment 
made under the provisions of Sec. 772.102 of this chapter.
    (iii) Retirement deductions are withheld, or a deposit is paid, for 
the entire period of continuous reemployment service immediately 
preceding the most recent separation from reemployment service; and
    (iv) The reemployed annuitant elects the redetermined annuity in 
lieu of his or her prior annuity and the supplemental annuity that would 
be payable under Sec. 837.503 of this subpart.
    (2) An employee whose annuity was terminated under the provisions of 
Sec. 837.202(b)(1)(iii) of this part, and who has not elected FERS 
coverage, is entitled to a redetermined annuity on separation.
    (b) Computation. (1) A redetermined annuity is computed using all 
the reemployed annuitant's creditable service, under the provisions of 
law in effect governing the payment of CSRS and/or FERS annuities, as 
may be applicable, at the time of separation from reemployment service, 
or conversion to intermittent status.
    (2) The amount of the redetermined annuity of an individual whose 
previous annuity was terminated under the provisions of Sec. 
837.202(b)(1)(iii) of this part will at least equal the amount of the 
terminated annuity plus any increases under section 8340 of title 5, 
United States Code, occurring after the termination of the previous 
annuity and before the commencement of the redetermined annuity, 
adjusted by any annuity increase or reduction resulting from additional 
or different elections made by the reemployed annuitant.
    (c) Commencing date. The commencing date of the redetermined annuity 
is the same as the law and/or regulations would provide in the case of a 
retiring employee.


<R05>
Sec. 837.505  Cost-of-living adjustments on Member annuities.

    (a) Applying cost-of-living adjustments to recomputed Member 
annuities under CSRS. A member annuity benefit that is recomputed under 
section 8344(d)(1) of title 5, United States Code, which applies to 
certain former Members who become employed in an appointive position 
subject to CSRS, will include the cost-of-living adjustments under 
section 8340 of title 5, United States Code, that are effective after 
the commencing date of the benefit computed under section 8344(d)(1).
    (b) Limitations on cost-of-living adjustments on recomputed Member 
annuities under CSRS. For purposes of determining limitations on cost-
of-living adjustments under section 8340(g) of title 5, United States 
Code, the final (or average) salary of a Member whose benefit has been 
recomputed under section 8344(d)(1) of title 5, United States Code, 
which applies to certain former Members who become employed in an 
appointive position subject to CSRS, will be increased by adjustments in 
the rates of the General Schedule under subpart I of chapter 53 of title 
5, United States Code, that are effective after the commencing date of 
the benefit computed under section 8344(d)(1).

<R05>
Sec. 837.601  Generally.

    Except as otherwise provided by this subpart, when an annuitant who 
is reemployed under circumstances that provide for continuation of 
annuitant status during reemployment dies, death benefits are payable 
under CSRS or FERS as if the individual died as an annuitant, and not as 
employee.


<R05>
Sec. 837.602  Lump-sum payment of retirement deductions.

    If an annuitant reemployed subject to the provisions of this part 
dies while so reemployed, and the annuitant would not have been entitled 
to a supplemental annuity, had the separation been for reasons other 
than death, or if there is no supplemental spousal survivor annuity 
payable (including a survivor annuity payable to a former spouse, if the 
annuitant retired under FERS) the amount of retirement deductions 
withheld during the period of reemployment will be paid in a lump sum to 
the person entitled under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8342(c) or 8424(d), 
as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 837.603  Increased survivor benefits.

    (a) Supplemental survivor annuity. (1) If an annuitant reemployed 
subject to the provisions of this part dies while so reemployed, and the 
annuitant would have been entitled to a supplemental annuity, had the 
separation been for reasons other than death, and there is a spousal 
survivor annuity payable (including a survivor annuity payable to a 
former spouse, if the annuitant retired under FERS) the amount of the 
spousal survivor annuity will, if any necessary deposit for service 
credit is made, be increased by 55 percent of the supplemental annuity, 
if the reemployed annuitant was retired under CSRS, or 50 percent of the 
supplemental annuity, if the reemployed annuitant was retired under 
FERS.
    (2) Supplemental survivor annuity benefits payable under this 
paragraph, computed in whole or in part under the provisions of Sec. 
837.503(b)(1)(i) of this part, using CSRS-Offset service, are subject to 
reduction under subpart G of this part.
    (b) Redetermined survivor annuity. If an annuitant reemployed 
subject to the provisions of this part dies while so reemployed, and the 
annuitant would have been entitled to elect a redetermined annuity, had 
the separation been for reasons other than death, and if there is a 
spousal survivor annuity payable (including a survivor annuity payable 
to a former spouse, if the annuitant retired under FERS), a person 
entitled to a spousal survivor annuity may elect to have his or her 
survivor annuity computed as if the annuitant had elected a redetermined 
annuity, provided any necessary deposit for service credit is made.

<R05>
Sec. 837.701  Offset from supplemental annuity.

    (a) OPM will reduce the supplemental annuity of an individual who 
has performed CSRS-Offset service, if the individual is entitled, or on 
proper application would be entitled, to old-age benefits under title II 
of the Social Security Act.
    (b) The reduction required under paragraph (a) of this section is 
effective on the first day of the month during which the reemployed 
annuitant--
    (1) Is entitled to a supplemental annuity under this part; and
    (2) Is entitled, or on proper application would be entitled, to old-
age benefits under title II of the Social Security Act.
    (c) Subject to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the amount of 
the reduction required under paragraph (a) of this section is the lesser 
of--
    (1) The difference between--
    (i) The social security old-age benefit for the month referred to in 
paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (ii) The old-age benefit that would be payable to the individual for 
the month

[[Page 191]]

referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, excluding all CSRS-Offset 
wages as a reemployed annuitant, and assuming the annuitant was fully 
insured (as defined by section 214(a) of the Social Security Act); or
    (2) The product of--
    (i) The old-age benefit to which the individual is entitled or 
would, on proper application, be entitled; and
    (ii) A fraction--
    (A) The numerator of which is the annuitant's total CSRS-Offset 
service as a reemployed annuitant, rounded to the nearest whole number 
of years not exceeding 40 years; and
    (B) The denominator of which is 40.
    (d) Cost-of-living adjustments under 5 U.S.C. 8340 occurring after 
the effective date of the reduction required under paragraph (a) of this 
section will be based on only the supplemental annuity remaining after 
reduction under this subpart.
    (e) The amounts for paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(2)(i) 
of this section are computed without regard to subsections (b) through 
(1) of section 203 of the Social Security Act (relating to reductions in 
social security benefits), and without applying the provisions of the 
second sentence of section 215(a)(7)(B)(i) or section 215(d)(5)(ii) of 
the Social Security Act (relating to part of the computation of the 
social security windfall elimination provisions).

Administration, submitted in a form prescribed by OPM, concerning 
entitlement to social security benefits and the beginning and ending 
dates thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 837.702  Offset from supplemental survivor annuity.

    (a) OPM will reduce a supplemental survivor annuity (an annuity 
under 5 U.S.C. 8341) based on the service of an individual who performed 
CSRS-Offset service, if the survivor annuitant is entitled, or on proper 
application would be entitled, to survivor benefits under section 
202(d), (e), or (f) (relating to children's, widows', and widowers' 
benefits, respectively) of the Social Security Act.
    (b) The reduction required under paragraph (a) of this section 
begins (or is reinstated) on the first day of the month during which the 
survivor annuitant--
    (1) Is entitled to a disability or survivor annuity under CSRS; and
    (2) Is entitled, or on proper application would be entitled, to 
survivor benefits under the Social Security Act provisions mentioned in 
paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, respectively.
    (c) The reduction under paragraphs (a) of this section will be 
computed and adjusted in a manner consistent with the provisions of 
Sec. 837.701 (c) through (e) of this part.
    (d) A reduction under paragraph (a) of this section stops on the 
date entitlement to the disability or survivor benefits under title II 
of the Social Security Act terminates. In the case of a survivor 
annuitant who has not made proper application for the social security 
benefit, the reduction under paragraph (a) of this section stops on the 
date entitlement to such survivor benefits would otherwise terminate. If 
a social security benefit is reduced under any provision of the Social 
Security Act, even if reduced to zero, entitlement to that benefit is 
not considered to have terminated.
    (e) OPM will accept the determination or certification of the Social 
Security Administration, submitted in a form prescribed by OPM, 
concerning entitlement to social security survivor benefits and the 
beginning and ending dates thereof.

       Subpart H_Alternative Entitlements and Canceled Retirements


<R05>
Sec. 837.801  Unperfected entitlement to CSRS benefits based on a prior separation.

    (a) An employee who meets the age and service requirements for title 
to a non-disability annuity under CSRS on the basis of a prior 
separation, but did not apply for that annuity before a subsequent 
separation from service to which a different annuity entitlement 
attaches, may elect, on application, to receive either--
    (1) The annuity based on the later separation; or
    (2) The annuity based on the prior separation, with payment of 
annuity

[[Page 192]]

suspended during the period(s) of employment subsequent to the 
commencing date of annuity, and such benefits as would be payable had 
the subsequent period(s) of employment been performed under the 
provisions of this part.
    (b) When an individual who has applied for a deferred annuity under 
CSRS is reemployed under CSRS before the commencing date of that 
annuity, the application is deemed to have not been made.


<R05>
Sec. 837.802  Benefits under another retirement system for Federal employees
based on the most recent separation.

    (a) Generally. An annuitant who has performed reemployment service 
after the commencing date of annuity under the provisions of another 
retirement system, and who is entitled to an annuity benefit from the 
other retirement system during a period in which he or she is also 
entitled to an annuity benefit under CSRS or FERS, may receive both 
benefits simultaneously, or for the same period, except that the 
annuitant may not receive both benefits simultaneously, or for the same 
period, if--
    (1) The provisions of law or regulation governing the other 
retirement system do not permit the annuitant to receive both benefits 
simultaneously, or for the same period of time; or
    (2) Entitlement to the annuity from the other retirement system is 
based on service credited in the computation of the CSRS or FERS 
annuity, or service credited in the computation of the annuity from the 
other retirement system was used in the computation of the CSRS or FERS 
annuity.
    (b) Election of alternative benefits. (1) Where simultaneous receipt 
of, or entitlement to, both annuities is barred under the provisions of 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the annuitant must elect to receive 
either the annuity under the other retirement system, or the CSRS 
annuity.
    (2) Where the annuitant, under the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, elects to receive annuity from the other retirement system 
in lieu of the CSRS or FERS annuity, the CSRS or FERS annuity terminates 
as of the commencing date of the other annuity, and any overpayment of 
CSRS annuity will be offset from the other annuity and paid to OPM.
    (c) Recomputation. Where simultaneous receipt of annuities from more 
than one retirement system is barred by paragraph (a)(2), but not by 
paragraph (a)(1), of this section, the CSRS or FERS annuity may be 
recomputed to exclude credit for service credited in determining 
entitlement to, or the amount of, the annuity from the other retirement 
system, effective as of the commencing date of the annuity from the 
other retirement system for Federal employees, and the recomputed CSRS 
or FERS annuity may be paid simultaneous with, or for the same period 
as, the annuity from the other retirement system for Federal employees.
    (d) Forfeiture. Where an annuitant's coverage as an employee under 
another retirement system, whether by election or by operation of law or 
regulation, results in forfeiture of annuity rights under CSRS or FERS, 
the CSRS or FERS annuity will terminate as of the effective date of 
coverage.
    (e) Survivors. The rules detailed in this section in regard to dual 
entitlement to annuity benefits under CSRS or FERS and another 
retirement system also apply to dual entitlement to survivor benefits 
under CSRS or FERS and another retirement system, unless the particular 
circumstance is otherwise governed by specific provision of statute or 
regulation.
    (f) Agency responsibilities. The agency responsible for 
administering another retirement system must--
    (1) Promptly notify OPM of an election of coverage under that 
retirement system by a reemployed CSRS or FERS annuitant, or the 
coverage of a reemployed CSRS annuitant under that retirement system by 
election or operation of law or regulation, when such coverage affects 
the annuitant's entitlement to CSRS annuity;
    (2) Promptly notify OPM when a reemployed annuitant separates with 
entitlement to an annuity under the other retirement system that cannot, 
under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, be paid 
simultaneous

[[Page 193]]

with, or during the same period as, the CSRS annuity; and
    (3) Reimburse OPM for overpayments of annuity resulting from a 
failure to comply with paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 837.803  Cancellation of retirement by judicial or administrative authority.

    (a) Cancellation of retirement action. A separation from employment 
on which an application for retirement is based may only be canceled by 
the former employing agency in response to a direct and final order of a 
judicial or administrative body charged with the responsibility of 
reviewing the legality of the separation, and authorized to make such 
order, or by agreement between the annuitant and the former employing 
agency in resolution of a grievance, complaint, dispute, appeal or other 
action, involving an allegedly erroneous separation, before such 
authority.
    (b) Agency notification to OPM. Upon receiving a final order 
requiring cancellation of the annuitant's separation or after the 
annuitant and the agency agree to cancel the separation, the employing 
agency must notify OPM and request the amount of the erroneous payment 
to be recovered under Sec. 550.805(e) of this chapter from any back pay 
adjustment to which the employee may be entitled.
    (c) Collection of erroneously paid retirement benefits. (1) If OPM 
determines that an overpayment of annuity or lump-sum credit has 
occurred and the employee is entitled to receive back pay because of the 
canceled separation, the overpaid retirement benefits must be deducted 
to the extent they can be recovered from the back pay adjustment as 
required by Sec. 550,805(e) of this chapter.
    (2) Amounts recovered from back pay will not be subject to waiver 
consideration under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8346(b) or 8470(b). If 
there is no back pay or the back pay is insufficient to recover the 
entire payment, the employee may request that OPM waive the uncollected 
portion of the overpayment. If waiver is not granted, the employee must 
repay the erroneous payment.


<R05>
Sec. 837.804  Finality of elections under this subpart.

    Except as otherwise provided by this subpart, an election of 
coverage under, or annuity from, another retirement system, in lieu of 
CSRS or FERS coverage or annuity, or the election between simultaneous 
entitlements under CSRS or FERS, is final and conclusive for the period 
of simultaneous entitlement to coverage or annuity.

    (2) In executing court orders under this part, OPM must honor the 
clear instructions of the court. Instructions must be specific and 
unambiguous. OPM will not supply missing provisions, interpret ambiguous 
language, or clarify the court's intent by researching individual State 
laws. In carrying out the court's instructions, OPM performs purely 
ministerial actions in accordance with these regulations. Disagreement 
between the parties concerning the validity or the provisions of any 
court order must be resolved by the court.

follow when applying for benefits based on a court order under sections 
8341(h), 8345(j), 8445 or 8467 of title 5, United States Code;
    (3) The procedures that OPM will follow in honoring court orders and 
in making payments to the former spouse or child abuse creditor; and
    (4) The effect of certain words and phrases commonly used in court 
orders affecting retirement benefits.
    (c)(1) Subparts A through I of this part apply only to court orders 
received by OPM on or after January 1, 1993.
    (2) Subpart J of this part applies only to court orders received by 
OPM before January 1, 1993.
    (3) Subpart K of this part applies only to court orders received by 
OPM on or after October 14, 1994.
    (d) This part has no application to the Thrift Savings Plan 
described in subchapter III of chapter 84 of title 5, United States 
Code.

employee annuity to the former employee have been met, including, but 
not limited to--
    (i) Separation from a position in the Federal service covered by 
CSRS or FERS under subpart B of part 831 of this chapter or subpart A of 
part 842 of this chapter, respectively;

    (b) Payment to a former spouse under a court order may not exceed 
the net annuity.
    (c) Waivers of employee annuity payments under the terms of section 
8345(d) or section 8465(a) of title 5, United States Code, exclude the 
waived portion of the annuity from availability for payment under a 
court order if such waivers are postmarked or received before the date 
that OPM receives a court order acceptable for processing.

    (1) The former spouse--
    (i) That the court order is acceptable for processing;

which the former spouse's benefit begins to accrue, and if known, the 
date on which OPM commences payment under the order;
    (iii) Of the amount of the former spouse's monthly benefit and the 
formula OPM used to compute the monthly benefit; and
    (iv) That, if he or she disagrees with the amount of the monthly

    (i) That the former spouse has applied for benefits under this 
subpart;
    (ii) That the court order is acceptable for processing and that OPM 
must comply with the court order;
    (iii) Of the date on which OPM received the court order, the date on 
which the former spouse's benefit begins or accrue, and if known, the 
date on which OPM commences payment under the court order;
    (iv) Of the amount of the former spouse's monthly benefit and the 
formula OPM used to compute the monthly benefit;
    (v) That, if he or she contests the validity of the court order, he 
or she must obtain, and submit to OPM, a court order invalidating the 
court order submitted by the former spouse; and
    (vi) That, if he or she disagrees with the amount of the former 
spouse's monthly benefits, he or she must obtain, and submit to OPM, an 
amended court order clarifying the amount.
    (b) If OPM receives a court order acceptable for processing that is 
directed at an employee annuity but the employee has died, or if a 
retiree dies after payments from an employee to a former spouse have 
begun, OPM will inform the former spouse that the employee or retiree 
has died and that OPM can only honor court orders dividing employee 
annuities during the lifetime of the retiree.

and
    (2) The employee, separated employee, or retiree--

subpart;
    (ii) That the court order is acceptable for processing and that OPM

[[Page 203]]

    (iii) To the extent possible, the formula that OPM will use to 
compute the former spouse's monthly benefit;
    (iv) That, if he or she contests the validity of the court order, he 
or she must obtain, and submit to OPM, a court order invalidating the 
court order submitted by the former spouse; and
    (v) That, if he or she disagrees with the amount of the former 
spouse's monthly benefits, he or she must obtain, and submit to OPM, an 
amended court order clarifying the amount.
    (d) The failure of OPM to provide, or of the employee, separated 
employee, or retiree or the former spouse to receive, the information 
specified in this section prior to the commencing date of a reduction or 
accrual does not affect--
    (1) The validity of payment under the court order; or
    (2) The commencing date of the reduction in the employee annuity or 
the commencing date of the accrual of former spouse benefits as 
determined under Sec. 838.231.


<R05>

    (1) Declares the court order submitted by the former spouse is 
invalid; or
    (2) Sets aside the court order submitted by the former spouse.
    (b) OPM must honor a court order acceptable for processing that 
appears to be valid and that the former spouse has certified is 
currently in force and has not been amended, superseded, or set aside, 
until OPM receives a court order described in paragraph (a) of this 
section or a court order amending or superseding the court order 
submitted by the former spouse.


<R05>
Sec. 838.225  Processing amended court orders.

    (a) If the employee, separated employee, retiree, or former spouse 
submits an amended court order pertaining to payment of a portion of the 
employee annuity, OPM will process the amended court order prospectively 
only, effective against employee annuity accruing beginning the first 
day of the second month after OPM receives the amended court order.
    (b) A court order is not effective to adjust payments prior to the 
first day of the second month after OPM receives the court order

                           Payment Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 838.231  Commencing date of payments.

    (a) A court order acceptable for processing is effective against 
employee annuity accruing beginning the first day of the second month 
after OPM receives the court order.
    (b)(1) OPM will not begin payments to the former spouse until OPM 
receives all the documentation required by Sec. 838.221 (b) and (c).
    (2) If payments are delayed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
after OPM receives all required documentation, it will authorize payment 
of the

[[Page 204]]

annuity that has accrued since the date determined under paragraph (a) 
of this section but the payment of which was delayed under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 838.232  Suspension of payments.

    (a) Payments from employee annuities under this part will be 
discontinued whenever the employee annuity payments are suspended or 
terminated. If employee annuity payments to the retiree are restored, 
payments to the former spouse will also resume subject to the terms of 
any court order acceptable for processing in effect at that time.
    (b) Paragraph (a) of this section will not be applied to permit a 
retiree to deprive a former spouse of payment by causing suspension of 
payment of employee annuity.


<R05>
Sec. 838.233  Termination of payments.

    A former spouse portion of an employee annuity stops accruing at the 
earliest of--
    (a) The date on which the terms of the court order require 
termination;
    (b)(1) The last day of the first month before OPM receives a court 
order invalidating, vacating, or setting aside the court order submitted 
by the former spouse if OPM receives the latest court order no later 
than 20 days before the end of the month; or
    (2) The last day of the month in which OPM receives a court order 
invalidating, vacating, or setting aside the court order submitted by

court order;
    (d) The last day of the first month before the death of the retiree;

former spouse dies.


<R05>
Sec. 838.234  Collection of arrearages.

Except as provided in Sec. 838.225(b), OPM will not increase a former 
spouse's share of employee annuity to satisfy an arrearage due the 
former spouse. However, under Sec. 838.225, OPM will prospectively 
honor the terms of an amended court order that either increases or 
decreases the court order's entitlement.


<R05>
Sec. 838.235  Payment of lump-sum awards.

    If a court order acceptable for processing awards a former spouse a 
lump-sum amount from the employee annuity and does not state the monthly 
rate at which OPM should pay the lump-sum, OPM will pay the former 
spouse equal monthly installments at 50 percent of the gross annuity 
(subject to the limitations under Sec. 838.211) at the time of 
retirement or the date of the order, whichever comes later, until the 
lump-sum amount is paid.


<R05>
Sec. 838.236  Court orders barring payment of annuities.

    (a) State courts lack authority to prevent OPM from paying employee 
annuities as required by section 8345(a) or section 8463 of title 5, 
United States Code. OPM will not honor court orders directing that OPM 
delay or otherwise not pay employee annuities at the time or in the 
amount required by statute.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, OPM will honor 
court orders acceptable for processing that direct OPM to pay the 
employee annuity to the court, an officer of the court acting as a 
fiduciary, or a State or local government agency during the pendency of 
a divorce or legal separation proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 838.237  Death of the former spouse.

    (a) Unless the court order acceptable for processing expressly 
provides otherwise, the former spouse's share of an employee annuity 
terminates on the last day of the month before the death of the former 
spouse, and the former spouse's share of employee annuity reverts to the 
retiree.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, OPM will honor a 
court order acceptable for processing or an amended court order 
acceptable for processing that directs OPM to pay, after the death of 
the former spouse, the former spouse's share of the employee annuity 
to--
    (1) The court;
    (2) An officer of the court acting as fiduciary;

[[Page 205]]

    (3) The estate of the former spouse; or
    (4) One or more of the retiree's children as defined in section 
8342(c) or section 8424(d) of title 5, United States Code.

[57 FR 33574, July 29, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 43493, Aug. 17, 1993]

               Procedures for Computing the Amount Payable


<R05>
Sec. 838.241  Cost-of-living adjustments.

    Unless otherwise provided in the court order, when the terms of the 
court order or Sec. 838.621 provide for cost-of-living adjustments on 
the former spouse's payment from employee annuity, the cost-of-living 
adjustment will be effected at the same time and at the same percentage 
rate as the cost-of-living adjustment in the employee annuity.


<R05>
Sec. 838.242  Computing lengths of service.

    (a)(1) The smallest unit of time that OPM will calculate in 
computing a formula in a court order is a month, even where the court 
order directs OPM to make a more precise calculation.
    (2) If the court order states a formula using a specified simple or 
decimal fraction other than twelfth parts of a year, OPM will use the 
specified number to perform simple mathematical computations.
    (b) Unused sick leave is counted as ``creditable service'' on the 
date of separation for an immediate CSRS annuity; it is not apportioned 
over the time when earned. Unused sick leave is not countable as 
``creditable service'' in a FERS annuity (except in a CSRS component for 
an employee who transferred to FERS) or in a deferred CSRS annuity.


<R05>
Sec. 838.243  Minimum amount of awards.

    OPM will treat any court order that awards a former spouse a portion 
of an employee annuity equal to less than $12 per year as awarding the 
former spouse $1 per month.


<R04>
  Subpart C_Requirements for Court Orders Affecting Employee Annuities


<R05>
Sec. 838.301  Purpose and scope.

    This subpart regulates the requirements that a court order directed 
at employee annuity must meet to be a court order acceptable for 
processing.


<R05>
Sec. 838.302  Language not acceptable for processing.

    (a) Qualifying Domestic Relations Orders. (1) Any court order 
labeled as a ``qualified domestic relations order'' or issued on a form 
for ERISA qualified domestic relations orders is not a court order 
acceptable for processing unless the court order expressly states that 
the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are 
governed by this part.
    (2) When a court order is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section to state that the provisions of a court order concerning CSRS or 
FERS benefits are governed by this part the court order must expressly--
    (i) Refer to part 838 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, and
    (ii) State that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or 
FERS benefits are drafted in accordance with the terminology used in 
this part.
    (3) Although any language satisfying the requirements of paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section is sufficient to prevent a court order from being 
unacceptable under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, OPM recommends the 
use of the language provided in ] 001 in appendix A to subpart F of this 
part to state that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or 
FERS benefits are governed by this part.
    (4) A court order directed at employee annuity that contains the 
language described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must also satisfy 
all other requirements of this subpart to be a court order acceptable 
for processing.
    (b) Benefits for the lifetime of the former spouse. Any court order 
directed at employee annuity that expressly provides that the former 
spouse's portion of the employee annuity may continue after the death of 
the employee or retiree, such as a court order providing that the former 
spouse's portion

[[Page 206]]

of the employee annuity will continue for the lifetime of the former 
spouse, is not a court order acceptable for processing.


<R05>
Sec. 838.303  Expressly dividing employee annuity.

    (a) A court order directed at employee annuity is not a court order 
acceptable for processing unless it expressly divides the employee 
annuity as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) To expressly divide employee annuity as required by paragraph 
(a) of this section the court order must--
    (1) Identify the retirement system using terms that are sufficient 
to identify the retirement system as explained in Sec. 838.611; and
    (2) Expressly state that the former spouse is entitled to a portion 
of the employee annuity using terms that are sufficient to identify the 
employee annuity as explained in Sec. 838.612.


<R05>
Sec. 838.304  Providing for payment to the former spouse.

    (a) A court order directed at employee annuity is not a court order 
acceptable for processing unless it provides for OPM to pay the former 
spouse a portion of an employee annuity as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) To provide for OPM to pay the former spouse a portion of an 
employee annuity as required by paragraph (a) of this section the court 
order must--
    (1) Expressly direct OPM to pay the former spouse directly;
    (2) Direct the retiree to arrange or to execute forms for OPM to pay 
the former spouse directly; or
    (3) Be silent concerning who is to pay the portion of the employee 
annuity awarded to the former spouse.
    (c) Except when the court order directed at employee annuity 
contains a provision described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a 
court order directed at employee annuity that instructs the retiree to 
pay a portion of the employee annuity to the former spouse is not a 
court order acceptable for processing.
    (d) Although paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section provide 
acceptable methods for satisfying the requirement that a court order 
directed at employee annuity provide for OPM to pay the former spouse, 
OPM strongly recommends that any court order directed at employee 
annuity expressly direct OPM to pay the former spouse directly.


<R05>
Sec. 838.305  OPM computation of formulas.

    (a) A court order directed at employee annuity is not a court order 
acceptable for processing unless the court order provides sufficient 
instructions and information that OPM can compute the amount of the 
former spouse's monthly benefit using only the express language of the 
court order, subparts A, B, and F of this part, and information from 
normal OPM files.
    (b)(1) To provide sufficient instructions and information for OPM to 
compute the amount of the former spouse's share of the employee annuity 
as required by paragraph (a) of this section the court order must state 
the former spouse's share as--
    (i) A fixed amount;
    (ii) A percentage or a fraction of the employee annuity; or
    (iii) A formula that does not contain any variables whose values are 
not readily ascertainable from the face of the court order directed at 
employee annuity or normal OPM files.
    (2) Normal OPM files include information about--
    (i) The dates of employment for all periods of creditable civilian 
and military service;
    (ii) The rate of basic pay for all periods of creditable civilian 
service;
    (iii) The annual rates of basic pay for each grade and step under 
the General Schedule since 1920;
    (iv) The amount of premiums for basic and optional life insurance 
under the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Program;
    (v) The amount of the Government and the employee shares of premiums 
for any health insurance plan under the Federal Employees Health 
Benefits Program;
    (vi) The standard Federal income tax withholding tables;
    (vii) The amount of cost-of-living adjustments under section 8340 or 
section 8462 of title 5, United States Code, and the amount of the 
percentage change

[[Page 207]]

in the national index on which the adjustment is based;
    (viii) The amount of pay adjustments to the General Schedule under 
section 5303 (or section 5305 prior to November 5, 1990) of title 5, 
United States Code, and the amount of the percentage change in the 
national index on which the adjustment is based;
    (ix) The provision of law under which a retiree has retired; and
    (x) Whether a retiree has elected to provide survivor benefits for a 
current spouse, former spouse, or a person with an insurable interest.
    (c)(1) A court order directed at employee annuity is not a court 
order acceptable for processing if OPM would have to examine a State 
statute or court decision (on a different case) to understand, 
establish, or evaluate the formula for computing the former spouse's 
share of the employee annuity.
    (2) A court order directed at employee annuity is not a court order 
acceptable for processing if it awards the former spouse a ``community 
property'' fraction, share, or percentage of the employee annuity and 
does not provide a formula by which OPM can compute the amount of the 
former spouse's share of the employee annuity from the face of the court 
order or from normal OPM files.
    (d) A court order directed at employee annuity is not a court order 
acceptable for processing if the court order awards a portion of the 
``present value'' of an annuity unless the amount of the ``present 
value'' is stated in the court order.
    (e) A court order directed at employee annuity is not a court order 
acceptable for processing if the court order directs OPM to determine a 
rate of employee annuity that would require OPM to determine a salary or 
average salary, other than a salary or average salary actually used in 
computing the employee annuity, as of a date prior to the date of the 
employee's separation and to adjust that salary for use in computing the 
former spouse share unless the adjustment is by--
    (1) A fixed amount or fixed annual amounts that are stated in the 
order;
    (2) The rate of cost-of-living or salary adjustments as those terms 
are described in Sec. 838.622;
    (3) The percentage change in pay that the employee actually received 
excluding changes in grade and/or step; or
    (4) The percentage change in either of the national indices used to 
compute cost-of-living or salary adjustments as those terms are 
described in Sec. 838.622.


<R05>
Sec. 838.306  Specifying type of annuity for application of formula, percentage or fraction.

    (a) A court order directed at employee annuity that states the 
former spouse's share of employee annuity as a formula, percentage, or 
fraction is not a court order acceptable for processing unless OPM can 
determine the type of annuity on which to apply the formula, percentage, 
or fraction.
    (b) The standard types of annuity to which OPM can apply the 
formula, percentage, or fraction are net annuity, gross annuity, or 
self-only annuity, which are defined in Sec. 838.103. Unless the court 
order otherwise directs, OPM will apply the formula, percentage, or 
fraction to gross annuity. Section 838.625 contains information on other 
methods of describing these types of annuity.

refund of employee contributions is not effective unless OPM receives 
the documentation required by Sec. 838.421 not later than--
    (1) The last day of the second month before payment of the refund; 
or
    (2) Twenty days after OPM receives the Statement required by Sec.

Sec. 838.423  OPM action on receipt of a court order acceptable for processing.

    (a) If OPM receives a court order acceptable for processing that is 
directed

[[Page 209]]

at a refund of employee contributions, OPM will inform--
    (1) The former spouse--
    (i) That the court order is acceptable for processing;
    (ii) Of the date on which OPM received the court order;
    (iii) Whether OPM has a record of unrefunded employee contributions 
on the employee;
    (iv) That the former spouse's share of the refund of employee 
contributions cannot be paid unless the employee separates from the 
Federal service and applies for a refund of employee contributions;
    (v) To the extent possible, the formula that OPM will use to compute 
the former spouse's share of a refund of employee contributions; and
    (vi) That, if the former spouse disagrees with the formula, the 
former spouse must obtain, and submit to OPM, an amended court order 
clarifying the amount; and
    (2) The employee or separated employee--
    (i) That the former spouse has applied for benefits under this 
subpart;
    (ii) That the court order is acceptable for processing and that OPM 
must comply with the court order;
    (iii) Of the date on which OPM received the court order;
    (iv) That the former spouse's share of the refund of employee 
contributions cannot be paid unless the employee separates from the 
Federal service and applies for a refund of employee contributions;
    (v) To the extent possible, the formula that OPM will use to compute 
the former spouse's share of the refund of employee contributions;
    (vi) That, if he or she contests the validity of the court order, he 
or she must obtain, and submit to OPM, a court order invalidating the 
court order submitted by the former spouse; and
    (vii) That, if he or she disagrees with the formula, he or she must 
obtain, and submit to OPM, an amended court order clarifying the amount.
    (b) The failure of OPM to provide, or of the employee or separated 
employee or the former spouse to receive, the information specified in 
this section does not affect the validity of payment under the court 
order.


<R05>
Sec. 838.424  OPM action on receipt of a court order not acceptable for processing.

    If OPM receives an application from a former spouse not based on a 
court order acceptable for processing, OPM will inform the former spouse 
that OPM cannot approve the application and provide the specific 
reason(s) for disapproving the application. Examples of reasons for 
disapproving an application include that the order does not meet the 
definition of court order in Sec. 838.103 or does not meet one or more 
of the requirements of subpart E of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 838.425  Contesting the validity of court orders.

    (a) An employee or separated employee who alleges that a court order 
is invalid must prove the invalidity of the court order by submitting a 
court order that--
    (1) Declares invalid the court order submitted by the former spouse; 
or
    (2) Sets aside the court order submitted by the former spouse.
    (b) OPM must honor a court order acceptable for processing that

currently in force and has not been amended, superseded, or set aside, 
until the employee or separated employee submits a court order described 
in paragraph (a) of this section or a court order amending or 
superseding the court order submitted by the former spouse.

                           Payment Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 838.431  Correcting failures to provide required spousal notification.

    The interests of a former spouse with a court order acceptable for 
processing that is directed at a refund of employee contributions who 
does not receive notice of an application for refund of employee 
contributions because the employee or separated employee submits 
fraudulent proof of notification or fraudulent proof that the former 
spouse's whereabouts are unknown are protected if, and only if--

[[Page 210]]

    (a) The former spouse files a court order acceptable for processing 
that affects or bars the refund of employee contributions with OPM no 
later than the last day of the second month before the payment of the 
refund; or
    (b) The former spouse submits proof that--
    (1) The evidence submitted by the employee was fraudulent; and
    (2) Absent the fraud, the former spouse would have been able to 
submit the necessary documentation required by Sec. 838.421 within the 
time limit prescribed in Sec. 838.422.


<R05>
Sec. 838.432  Court orders barring payment of refunds.

    A court order, notice, summons, or other document that attempts to 
restrain OPM from paying a refund of employee contributions is not 
effective unless it meets all the requirements of Sec. 838.505 or part 
581 of this chapter.

               Procedures for Computing the Amount Payable


<R05>
Sec. 838.441  Computing lengths of service.

    (a) The smallest unit of time that OPM will calculate in computing a 
formula in a court order is a month, even where the court order directs 
OPM to make a more precise calculation.

decimal fraction other than twelfth parts of a year, OPM will use the 
specified number to perform simple mathematical computations.


<R04>
 Subpart E_Requirements for Court Orders Affecting Refunds of Employee 
                              Contributions


<R05>
Sec. 838.501  Purpose and scope.

    This subpart regulates the requirements that a court order directed 
at or barring a refund of employee contributions must meet to be a court 
order acceptable for processing.
    (a) A court order is directed at a refund of employee contributions 
if it awards a former spouse a portion of a refund of employee 
contributions.
    (b) A court order bars a refund of employee contributions if it 
prohibits payment of a refund of employee contributions to preserve a 
former spouse's court-awarded entitlement to a portion of an employee 
annuity or to a former spouse survivor annuity.


<R05>
Sec. 838.502  Expressly dividing a refund of employee contributions.

    (a) A court order directed at a refund of employee contributions is 
not a court order acceptable for processing unless it expressly awards a 
former spouse a portion of a refund of employee contributions as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) To expressly award a former spouse a portion of a refund of 
employee contributions as required by paragraph (a) of this section, the 
court order must--
    (1) Identify the retirement system using terms that are sufficient 
to identify the retirement system as explained in Sec. 838.611; and
    (2) Expressly state that the former spouse is entitled to a portion 
of a refund of employee contributions using terms that are sufficient to 
identify the refund of employee contributions as explained in Sec. 
838.612.


<R05>
Sec. 838.503  Providing for payment to the former spouse.

    (a) A court order directed at a refund of employee contributions is 
not a court order acceptable for processing unless it provides for OPM 
to pay a portion of a refund of employee contributions to the former 
spouse as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) To provide for OPM to pay a portion of a refund of employee 
contributions to the former spouse as required by paragraph (a) of this 
section, the court order must--
    (1) Expressly direct OPM to pay the former spouse directly;
    (2) Direct the employee or separated employee to arrange or to 
execute forms for OPM to pay the former spouse directly; or
    (3) Be silent concerning who is to pay the portion of the refund of 
employee contributions awarded to the former spouse.
    (c) Although paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section provide 
acceptable methods for satisfying the requirement that the court order 
provide for OPM

[[Page 211]]

to pay the former spouse, OPM strongly recommends that the court order 
expressly direct OPM to pay the former spouse directly.


<R05>
Sec. 838.504  OPM computation of formulas.

    (a) A court order directed at a refund of employee contributions is 
not a court order acceptable for processing unless the court order 
provides sufficient instructions and information so that OPM can compute 
the amount of the former spouse's share of the refund of employee 
contributions using only the express language of the court order, 
subparts A, D, and F of this part, and information from normal OPM 
files.
    (b) To provide sufficient instructions and information that OPM can 
compute the amount of the former spouse's share of the refund of 
employee contributions as required by paragraph (a) of this section 
requires that the court order state the former spouse's share as--
    (1) A fixed amount;
    (2) A percentage or a fraction of the refund of employee 
contributions; or
    (3) A formula that does not contain any variables whose values are 
not readily ascertainable from the face of the court order or normal OPM 
files.
    (c) A court order directed at a refund of employee contributions is 
not a court order acceptable for processing if OPM would have to examine 
a State statute or court decision (on a different case) to understand, 
establish, or evaluate the formula for computing the former spouse's 
share of the refund of employee contributions.


<R05>
Sec. 838.505  Barring payment of refunds.

    A court order barring payment of a refund of employee contributions 
is not a court order acceptable for processing unless--
    (a) It expressly directs OPM not to pay a refund of employee 
contributions;
    (b) It awards, or a prior court order acceptable for processing has 
awarded, the former spouse a former spouse survivor annuity or a portion 
of the employee annuity; and
    (c) Payment of the refund of employee contributions would prevent 
payment to the former spouse under the court order described in 
paragraph (b) of this section.


<R04>
Subpart F_Terminology Used in Court Orders Affecting Employee Annuities 
                  or Refunds of Employee Contributions

                          Regulatory Structure


<R05>
Sec. 838.601  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart regulates the meaning of terms necessary to award 
benefits in a court order directed at an employee annuity or a refund of 
employee contributions. OPM applies the meanings to determine whether a 
court order directed at an employee annuity or a refund of employee 
contributions is a court order acceptable for processing and to 
establish the amount of the former spouse's share of an employee annuity 
or a refund of employee contributions.
    (b)(1) This subpart establishes a uniform meaning to be used for 
terms and phrases frequently used in awarding a former spouse a portion 
of an employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions.
    (2) This subpart informs the legal community about the definitions 
to apply terms used in drafting court orders so that the resulting court 
orders contain the proper language to accomplish the aims of the court.
    (c)(1) To assist attorneys and courts in preparing court orders that 
OPM can honor in the manner that the court intends, appendix A of this 
subpart contains model language to accomplish many of the more common 
objectives associated with the award of a former spouse's share of an 
employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions.
    (2) By using the language in appendix A of this subpart, the court, 
attorneys, and parties will know that the court order will be acceptable 
for processing and that OPM will treat the terminology used in the court 
order in the manner stated in the appendix.

[[Page 212]]

                       Identification of Benefits


<R05>
Sec. 838.611  Identifying the retirement system.

    (a) To satisfy the requirements of Sec. 838.303(b)(1) or Sec. 
838.502(b)(1), a court order must contain language identifying the 
retirement system to be affected. For example, ``CSRS,'' ``FERS,'' 
``OPM,'' or ``Federal Government'' benefits, or benefits payable ``based 
on service with the U.S. Department of Agriculture,'' etc., are 
sufficient identification of the retirement system.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this 
section, language referring to benefits under another retirement system, 
such as military retired pay, Foreign Service retirement benefits or 
Central Intelligence Agency retirement benefits, does not satisfy the 
requirements of Sec. 838.303(b)(1) or Sec. 838.502(b)(1).
    (1) A court order that mistakenly labels CSRS benefits as FERS 
benefits and vice versa satisfies the requirements of Sec. Sec. 
838.303(b)(1) and 838.502(b)(1).
    (2) Unless the court order expressly provides otherwise, for 
employees transferring to FERS, court orders directed at CSRS benefits 
apply to the entire FERS basic benefit, including the CSRS component, if 
any. Such a court order satisfies the requirements of Sec. Sec. 
838.303(b)(1) and 838.502(b)(1).
    (c) A court order affecting military retired pay, even when military 
retired pay has been waived for inclusion in CSRS annuities, does not 
award a former spouse a portion of an employee annuity or a refund of 
employee contributions under CSRS or FERS. Such a court order does not 
satisfy the requirements of Sec. 838.303(b)(1) or Sec. 838.502(b)(1).


<R05>
Sec. 838.612  Distinguishing between annuities and contributions.

    (a) A court order using ``annuities,'' ``pensions,'' ``retirement 
benefits,'' or similar terms satisfies the requirements of Sec. Sec. 
838.303(b)(2) and 838.502(b)(2) and may be used to divide an employee 
annuity and a refund of employee contributions.
    (b)(1) A court order using ``contributions,'' ``deductions,'' 
``deposits,'' ``retirement accounts,'' ``retirement fund,'' or similar 
terms satisfies the requirements of Sec. 838.502(b)(2) and may be used 
only to divide the amount of contributions that the employee has paid 
into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.
    (2) Unless the court order specifically states otherwise, when an 
employee annuity is payable, a court order using the terms specified in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section satisfies the requirements of Sec. 
838.303(b)(2) and awards the former spouse a benefit to be paid in equal 
monthly installments at 50 percent of the gross annuity at the time of 
retirement or the date of the court order, whichever comes later, until 
the specific dollar amount is reached.

                         Computation of Benefits


<R05>
Sec. 838.621  Prorata share.

    (a) Prorata share means one-half of the fraction whose numerator is 
the number of months of Federal civilian and military service that the 
employee performed during the marriage and whose denominator is the 
total number of months of Federal civilian and military service 
performed by the employee.
    (b) A court order that awards a former spouse a prorata share of an 
employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions by using the term 
``prorata share'' and identifying the date when the marriage began 
satisfies the requirements of Sec. Sec. 838.305 and 838.504 and awards 
the former spouse a prorata share as defined in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) A court order that awards a portion of an employee annuity as of 
a specified date before the employee's retirement awards the former 
spouse a prorata share as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) A court order that awards a portion of the ``value'' of an 
annuity as of a specific date before retirement, without specifying what 
``value'' is, awards the former spouse a prorata share as defined in 
paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 838.622  Cost-of-living and salary adjustments.

    (a)(1) A court order that awards adjustments to a former spouse's 
portion of an employee annuity stated in terms such as ``cost-of-living 
adjustments'' or

[[Page 213]]

``COLA's'' occurring after the date of the decree but before the date of 
retirement provides increases equal to the adjustments described in or 
effected under section 8340 or section 8462 of title 5, United States 
Code.
    (2) A court order that awards adjustments to a former spouse's 
portion of an employee annuity stated in terms such as ``salary 
adjustments'' or ``pay adjustments'' occurring after the date of the 
decree provides increases equal to the adjustments described in or 
effected under section 5303 of title 5, United States Code until the 
date of retirement.
    (b)(1) Unless the court order directly and unequivocally orders 
otherwise, a court order that awards a former spouse a portion of an 
employee annuity either on a percentage basis or by use of a fraction or 
formula provides that the former spouse's share of the employee annuity 
will be adjusted to maintain the same percentage or fraction whenever 
the employee annuity changes as a result of--
    (i) Salary adjustments occurring after the date of the decree and 
before the employee retires; and
    (ii) Cost-of-living adjustments occurring after the date of the 
decree and after the date of the employee's retirement.
    (2) A court order that awards a former spouse a specific dollar 
amount from the employee annuity prevents the former spouse from 
benefiting from salary and cost-of-living adjustments after the date of 
the decree, unless the court expressly orders their inclusion.
    (c)(1)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
court order that contains a general instruction to calculate the former 
spouse's share effective at the time of divorce or separation entitles 
the former spouse to the benefit of salary adjustments occurring after 
the specified date to the same extent as the employee.
    (ii) To prevent the application of salary adjustments after the date 
of the divorce or separation, the court order must either state the 
exact dollar amount of the award to the former spouse or specifically 
instruct OPM not to apply salary adjustments after the specified date in 
computing the former spouse's share of the employee annuity.
    (2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a court 
order that requires OPM to compute a benefit as of a specified date 
before the employee's retirement, and specifically instructs OPM not to 
apply salary adjustments after the specified date in computing the 
former spouse's share of an employee annuity provides that the former 
spouse is entitled to the application of cost-of-living adjustments 
after the date of the employee's retirement in the manner described in 
Sec. 838.241.
    (ii) To award cost-of-living adjustments between a specified date 
and the employee's retirement, the court order must specifically 
instruct OPM to adjust the former spouse's share of the employee annuity 
by any cost-of-living adjustments occurring between the specified date 
and the date of the employee's retirement.
    (iii) To prevent the application of cost-of-living adjustments that 
occur after the employee annuity begins to accrue to the former spouse's 
share of the employee annuity, the decree must either state the exact 
dollar amount of the award to the former spouse or specifically instruct 
OPM not to apply cost-of-living adjustments occurring after the date of 
the employee's retirement.


<R05>
Sec. 838.623  Computing lengths of service.

    (a) Sections 838.242 and 838.441 contain information on how OPM 
calculates lengths of service.
    (b) Unless the court order otherwise expressly directs--
    (1) For the purpose of describing a period of time to be excluded 
from any element of a computation, the term ``military service'' means 
military service as defined in section 8331(13) of title 5, United 
States Code, and does not include civilian service with the Department 
of Defense or the Coast Guard; and
    (2) For the purpose of describing a period of time to be included in 
any element of a computation, the term ``military service'' means all 
periods of military and civilian service performed with the Department 
of Defense or the Coast Guard.

[[Page 214]]

    (c)(1) When a court order contains a formula for dividing employee 
annuity that requires a computation of service worked as of a date prior 
to separation and using terms such as ``years of service,'' ``total 
service,'' ``service performed,'' or similar terms, the time 
attributable to unused sick leave will not be included.
    (2) When a court order contains a formula for dividing employee 
annuity that requires a computation of ``creditable service'' (or some 
other phrase using ``credit'' or its equivalent) as of a date prior to 
retirement, unused sick leave will be included in the computation 
(involving a CSRS employee annuity or the CSRS component of a FERS 
employee annuity) as follows:
    (i) If the amount of unused sick leave is specified, the court order 
awards a portion of the employee annuity equal to the monthly employee 
annuity at retirement times a fraction, the numerator of which is the 
number of months of ``creditable service'' as of the date specified plus 
the number of months of unused sick leave specified (which sum is 
rounded to eliminate partial months) and whose denominator is the months 
of ``creditable service'' used in the retirement computation.
    (ii) If the amount of unused sick leave is not specified, the court 
order awards a portion of the employee annuity equal to the monthly rate 
at the time of retirement times a fraction, the numerator of which is 
the number of months of ``creditable service'' as of the date specified 
(no sick leave included) and whose denominator is the number of months 
of ``creditable service'' used in the retirement computation (sick leave 
included).
    (d)(1) General language such as ``benefits earned as an employee 
with the U.S. Postal Service * * *'' provides only that CSRS retirement 
benefits are subject to division and does not limit the period of 
service included in the computation (i.e., service performed with other 
Government agencies will be included).
    (2) To limit the computation of benefits to a particular period of 
employment, the court order must--
    (i) Use language expressly limiting the period of service to be 
included in the computation (e.g., ``only U.S. Postal Service'' or 
``exclusive of any service other than U.S. Postal Service employment''); 
or
    (ii) Specify the number of months to be included in the computation; 
or
    (iii) Describe specifically the period of service to be included in 
the computation (e.g., ``only service performed during the period 
Petitioner and Defendant were married'' or ``benefits based on service 
performed through the date of divorce'').


<R05>
Sec. 838.624  Distinguishing between formulas and fixed amounts.

    (a) A court order that contains both a formula or percentage 
instruction and a dollar amount is deemed to include the dollar amount 
only as the court's estimate of the initial amount of payment. The 
formula or percentage instruction controls.
    (b) A court order that awards a portion of the ``present value'' of 
an employee annuity and specifically states the amount of either the 
``present value'' of the employee annuity or of the award is deemed to 
give the former spouse ``a specific dollar amount'' that is payable from 
a monthly employee annuity and will be paid as a lump-sum award in 
accordance with Sec. 838.235.


<R05>
Sec. 838.625  Types of annuity.

    (a) Terms that are synonymous with net annuity are--
    (1) Disposable annuity; and
    (2) Retirement check.
    (b) Terms that are synonymous with self-only annuity are--
    (1) Life rate annuity;
    (2) Unreduced annuity; and
    (3) Annuity without survivor benefit.
    (c) All court orders that do not specify net annuity or self-only 
annuity apply to gross annuity.

                            Model Paragraphs

  Appendix A to Subpart F of Part 838--Recommended Language for Court 
                   Orders Dividing Employee Annuities

    This appendix provides recommended language for use in court orders 
attempting to divide employee annuity. A court order directed at 
employee annuity should include five elements:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Identification of the benefits;

[[Page 215]]

    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Instructions that OPM pay the former spouse;
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> A method for computing the amount of the former 
spouse's benefit;
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Identification of the type of annuity to which to 
apply a fraction, percentage or formula; and
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Instructions on what OPM should do if the 
employee leaves Federal service before retirement and applies for a 
refund of employee contributions.
    The court order may also include instructions for disposition of the 
former spouse's share if the former spouse dies before the employee. By 
using the model language, courts will know that the court order will 
have the effect described in this appendix.
    The model language in this appendix does not award a benefit that is 
payable after the death of the employee. A separate, distinct award of a 
former spouse survivor annuity is necessary to award a former spouse a 
benefit that is payable after the death of the employee. Appendix A to 
subpart I of this part contains model language for awarding survivor 
annuities and contains some examples that award both a portion of an 
employee annuity and a survivor annuity.
    The model language uses the terms ``[former spouse]'' to identify 
the spouse who is receiving a former spouse's portion of an employee 
annuity and ``[employee]'' to identify the Federal employee whose 
employment was covered by the Civil Service Retirement System or the 
Federal Employees Retirement System. Obviously, in drafting an actual 
court order the appropriate terms, such as ``Petitioner'' and 
``Respondent,'' or the names of the parties should replace ``[former 
spouse]'' and ``[employee].''
    Similarly, the models are drafted for employees covered by the Civil 
Service Retirement System. The name of the retirement system should be 
changed for employees covered by the Federal Employees Retirement 
System.

<greek-a> 001 Language required in Qualified Domestic Relations Orders.
    Using the following paragraph will expressly state that the 
provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are 
governed by this part. A court order directed at employee annuity (or 
awarding a survivor annuity) that is labelled a ``Qualified Domestic 
Relations Order'' or is issued on an ERISA form will not be 
automatically rendered unacceptable under Sec. 838.302(a) or Sec. 
838.803(a) if the court order contains the following paragraph.
    ``The court has considered the requirements and standard terminology 
provided in part 838 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. The 
terminology used in the provisions of this order that concern benefits 
under the Civil Service Retirement System are governed by the standard 
conventions established in that part.''

<greek-a> 101 Identifying retirement benefits and directing OPM to pay 
the former spouse.
    Using the following paragraph will expressly divide employee annuity 
to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 838.303 and direct OPM to pay the 
former spouse a share of an employee annuity to satisfy the requirements 
of Sec. 838.304.

<greek-a> 102-110 [Reserved]
<greek-a> 111 Protecting a former spouse entitled to military retired 
pay.
    Using the following paragraph will protect the former spouse 
interest in military retired pay in the event that the employee waives 
the military retired pay to allow crediting the military service under 
CSRS or FERS. The paragraph should be used only if the former spouse is 
awarded a portion of the military retired pay. ``If [Employee] waives 
military retired pay to credit military service under the Civil Service 
Retirement System, [insert language for computing the former spouse's 
share from 200 series of this appendix]. The United States Office of 
Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly 
to [former spouse].''

    200 Series--Computing the amount of the former spouse's benefits.

    Paragraphs 201 through 204 contain model language for the most 
common types of wards that court orders make to former spouses. 
Subsequent paragraphs in the 200 series contain model language for less 
common, more complex awards.
    Awards other than fixed amounts require that the court order specify 
the type of annuity (``gross,'' ``net,'' or self-only) on which the 
award is computed. The types of annuity are defined in Sec. 838.103. 
Variations on type of annuity are covered by the 300 series of this 
appendix.
<greek-a> 201 Award of a fixed monthly amount.
    Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a fixed 
monthly amount. OPM will not apply COLA's to a fixed monthly amount 
unless the court order expressly directs that OPM and COLA's using the 
language in ] 231 of this appendix or similar language.
    ``[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under 
the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United 
States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to $[insert a number] per 
month from [employee]'s civil service retirement benefits. The United 
States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former 
spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].''

<greek-a> 202 Award of a percentage.
    Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a stated 
percentage of the employee annuity. Unless the court order expressly 
directly that OPM not add COLA's to the former spouse's share of the 
employee annuity, OPM will add COLA's to keep the former spouse's share 
at the stated percentage. Paragraph 232 of this appendix provides 
language for excluding COLA's.
    ``[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under 
the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United 
States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to [insert a number] 
percent of [employee]'s [insert ``gross,'' ``net,'' or ``self-only''] 
monthly annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The United 
States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former 
spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].''

<greek-a> 203 Award of a fraction.
    Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a stated 
fraction of the employee annuity. Unless the court order expressly 
directly that OPM not add COLA's to the former spouse's share of the 
employee annuity, OPM will add COLA's to keep the former spouse's share 
at the stated percentage. Paragraph 232 of this appendix provides 
language for excluding COLA's.
    ``[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under 
the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United 
States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to [insert fraction] ths 
of [employee]'s [insert ``gross,'' ``net,'' or ``self-only''] monthly 
annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The United States 
Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s 
share directly to [former spouse].''

<greek-a> 204 Award of a prorata share.
    Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a prorata 
share of the employee annuity. Prorata share is defined in Sec. 
838.621. To award a prorata share the court order must state the date of 
the marriage. Unless the court order specifies a different ending date, 
the marriage ends for computation purposes on the date that the court 
order is filed with the court clerk. Unless the court order expressly 
directs that OPM not add COLA's to the former spouse's share of the 
employee annuity, OPM will add COLA's to keep the former spouse's share 
at the stated percentage. Paragraph 232 of this appendix provides 
language for excluding COLA's.
    ``[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under 
the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United 
States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to a prorata share of 
[employee]'s [insert `gross,' `net,' or self-only] monthly annuity under 
the Civil Service Retirement System. The marriage began on [insert 
date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to 
pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].''

<greek-a> 205-210 [Reserved]

<greek-a> 211 Award based on a stated formula.

[[Page 217]]

    Using the following paragraphs will award the former spouse a share 
of the employee annuity based on a formula stated in the court order. 
The formula must be stated in the court order (including a court-
approved property settlement agreement). The formula may not be 
incorporated by reference to a statutory provision or a court decision 
in another case. If the court order uses a formula, the court order must 
include any data that is necessary for OPM to apply the formula unless 
the necessary data is contained in normal OPM files.
    ``[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under 
the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United 
States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to a share of 
[employee]'s [insert `gross,' `net,' or self-only] monthly annuity under 
the Civil Service Retirement System to be computed as follows: [Insert

    ``The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to

<greek-a> 212-230

<greek-a> 231 Awarding COLA's on fixed monthly amounts.
    Using the following paragraph will award COLA's in addition to a 
fixed monthly amount to the former spouse. The model awards COLA's at 
the same rate applied to the employee annuity.
    ``[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under 
the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United 
States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to $[insert a number] per 
month from [employee]'s civil service retirement benefits. When COLA's 
are applied to [employee]'s retirement benefits, the same COLA applies 
to [former spouse]'s share. The United States Office of Personnel 
Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to 
[former spouse].''

<greek-a> 232 Excluding COLA's on awards other than fixed monthly 
amounts.
    Using the following paragraph will prevent application of COLA's to 
a former spouse's share of an employee annuity in cases where the former 
spouse has been awarded a percentage, fraction or prorata share of the 
employee annuity, rather than a fixed dollar amount.
    ``[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under 
the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United 
States Government. [Insert language for computing the former spouse's 
share from ] 202, ] 203, ] 204, or ] 211 of this appendix.] The United 
States Office of Personnel Management is directed to determine the 
amount of [former spouse]'s share on the date [insert `when [employee] 
retires' if the employee has not retired, or `of this order' if the 
employee is already retired] and not to apply COLA's to that amount. The 
United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former 
spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].''

                      300 Series--Type of annuity.

    Awards of employee annuity to a former spouse (other than awards of 
fixed dollar amounts) must specify whether OPM will use the ``gross,'' 
``net,'' or self-only annuity as defined in Sec. 838.103 in determining 
the amount of the former spouse's entitlement. The court order may 
contain a formula that has the effect of creating other types of 
annuity, but the court order may only do this by providing a formula 
that starts from ``gross,'' ``net,'' or self-only annuity as defined in 
Sec. 838.103.

<greek-a> 301 Awards based on benefits actually paid.
    The court order may include a formula that effectively uses the 
court's definition of net annuity rather than the one provided by Sec. 
838.103. For example, using the following paragraph will award the 
former spouse a prorata share of the employee annuity reduced only by 
the amount deducted as premiums for basic life insurance under the 
Federal Employee Group Life Insurance Program.
    ``[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under 
the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United 
States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to a prorata share of 
[employee]'s monthly annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System, 
where monthly annuity means the self-only annuity less the amount 
deducted as premiums for basic life insurance under the Federal Employee 
Group Life Insurance Program. The marriage began on [insert date]. The 
United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former 
spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].''

<greek-a> 302-310 [Reserved]

<greek-a> 311 Awards of earned annuity in cases where the actual annuity 
is based on disability.
    Using the following paragraph will award a former spouse a prorata 
share of what the employee annuity would have been based on only the 
employee's actual service in cases where the actual employee annuity is 
based on disability. The paragraph also allows the court order to 
provide for the former spouse's share to begin when the employee reaches 
a stated age, using age 62 as an example. As with all other formulas the 
court order must specify whether the computation applies to ``gross,'' 
``net,'' or self-only annuity. OPM will apply COLA's that occurred after 
the date of the disability retirement to

[[Page 218]]

the former spouse's share. The following paragraph should be used only 
for disability retirees under CSRS. Under FERS, section 8452 of title 5, 
United States Code, provides a formula for recomputation of disability 
annuities at age 62 to approximate an earned annuity. Therefore to award 
a portion of the ``earned'' benefit under FERS add the introductory 
phrase, ``Starting when [employee] reaches age 62,'' to the paragraph 
describing how to compute the amount.
    ``[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under 
the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United 
State's Government. Starting when [employee] reaches age 62, [former 
spouse] is entitled to a prorata share of [employee]'s [insert 
``gross,'' ``net,'' or self-only] monthly annuity under the Civil 
Service Retirement System, where monthly annuity means the amount of 
[employee]'s monthly annuity computed as though [employee] had retired 
on an immediate, nondisability annuity on the commencing date of 
[employee]'s annuity based on disability. In computing the amount of the 
immediate annuity, the United States Office of Personnel Management will 
deem [employee] to have been age 62 at the time that [employee] retired 
on disability. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States 
Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s 
share directly to [former spouse].''

             400 Series--Refunds of employee contributions.

    Court orders that award a former spouse a portion of a future 
employee annuity of an employee who is not then eligible to retire 
should include an additional paragraph containing instructions that tell 
OPM what to do if the employee separates before becoming eligible to 
retire and requests a refund of employee contributions. The court order 
may award the former spouse a portion of the refund of employee 
contributions or bar payment of the refund of employee contributions.

<greek-a> 401 Barring payment of a refund of employee contributions.
    Using the following paragraph will bar payment of the refund of 
employee contributions if payment of the refund of employee 
contributions would extinguish the former spouse's entitlement to a 
portion of the employee annuity. ``The United States Office of Personnel 
Management is directed not to pay [employee] a refund of employee 
contributions.''

<greek-a> 402 Dividing a refund of employee contributions.
    Using the following paragraph will allow the refund of employee 
contributions to be paid but will award a prorata share of the refund of 
employee contributions to the former spouse. The sentence on the 
beginning date of the marriage is unnecessary if the beginning is stated 
elsewhere in the order. The award of a prorata share is used only as an 
example; the court order could provide another fraction, percentage, or 
formula, or a fixed amount. Note that a refund of employee contributions 
voids the employee's rights to an employee annuity and the former 
spouse's right to any portion of that annuity.
    ``If [employee] becomes eligible and applies for a refund of 
employee contributions, [former spouse] is entitled to a prorata share 
of the refund of employee contributions. The marriage began on [insert 
date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to 
pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].''

                 500 Series--Death of the former spouse.

<greek-a> 501 Full annuity restored to the retiree.
    No special provision is necessary to restore the entire annuity to 
the retiree upon the death of the former spouse. Unless the court order 
expressly provides otherwise, OPM will pay the former spouse's share to 
the retiree after the death of the former spouse.

<greek-a> 502 Former spouse share paid to children.
    Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse's share 
of an employee annuity to the children, including any adopted children, 
of the employee and former spouse.
    ``If [former spouse] dies before [employee], the United States 
Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s 
share of [employee]'s civil service retirement benefits to surviving 
children of the marriage including any adopted children, in equal 
shares. Upon the deaths of any child, that child's share will be 
distributed among the other surviving children.''
    The language may be modified to terminate the payments to the 
children when they reach a stated age. A court order that includes such 
a provision for termination must include sufficient information (such as 
the children's dates of birth) to permit OPM to determine when the 
children's interest terminate. OPM will not consider evidence outside 
the court order (and normal OPM files) to establish the children's dates 
of birth.

<greek-a> 503 Former spouse share paid to the court.
    Using the following paragraph will provide for payment of the former 
spouse's share of an employee annuity to the court after the death of 
the former spouse. This would allow a court officer to administer the 
funds. ``If [former spouse] dies before [employee], the United States 
Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s 
share of [employee]'s civil service retirement benefits to this court at 
the following address: ``[Insert address where checks should be sent. 
The address may be up to six lines and should include sufficient 
information for

court officials to credit the correct account.]''

<R05>
Sec. 838.721  Application requirements.

    (a)(1) A former spouse (personally or through a representative) must 
apply in writing to be eligible for a former spouse survivor annuity 
based on a court order acceptable for processing. No special form is 
required to give OPM notice of the court order.

must be accompanied by--
    (i) A certified copy of the court order;
    (ii) A certification from the former spouse or the former spouse's 
representative that the court order is currently in force and has not 
been amended, superseded, or set aside;
    (iii) Information sufficient for OPM to identify the employee or 
retiree, such as his or her full name, CSRS or FERS claim number, date 
of birth, and social security number;
    (iv) The current mailing address of the former spouse;
    (v) If the employee has not retired or died, the mailing address of 
the employee; and
    (vi) A statement in the form prescribed by OPM certifying--

of the occurrence of any remarriage before age 55; and
    (C) That the former spouse will be personally liable for any 
overpayment to him or her resulting from a remarriage before age 55.
    (2) OPM may subsequently require recertification of the statements 
required by this paragraph.

    (1) The former spouse--
    (i) That the court order is acceptable for processing;
    (ii) Of the date on which OPM received the court order, the date on 
which the former spouse's benefit will begin to accrue, and if known the

employee, or retiree, the former spouse, or anyone else to receive, the 
information specified in this section does not affect--
    (1) The validity of payment under the court order; or
    (2) The commencing date of the reduction in the employee annuity or 
the commencing date of the former spouse's entitlement as determined 
under Sec. 838.731.

<R05>
Sec. 838.723  OPM action on receipt of a court order not acceptable for processing.

    If OPM receives an application from a former spouse not based on a 
court order acceptable for processing, OPM will inform the former spouse 
that OPM cannot approve the application and provide the specific 
reason(s) for disapproving the application. Examples of reasons for 
disapproving an application include that the order does not meet the 
definition of court order in Sec. 838.103 or does not meet one or more 
of the requirements of subpart H of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 838.724  Contesting the validity of court orders.

    (a) An employee, retiree or person adversely affected by a court 
order who alleges that a court order is invalid must prove the 
invalidity of the court order by submitting to OPM a court order that--
    (1) Declares invalid the court order submitted by the former spouse; 
or
    (2) Sets aside the court order submitted by the former spouse.
    (b) OPM must honor a court order acceptable for processing that 
appears to be valid and that the former spouse has certified is 
currently in force and has not been amended, superseded, or set aside, 
until the employee, separated employee, retiree, or person adversely 
affected by the court order submits to OPM a court order described in 
paragraph (a) of this section or, if issued before the retirement or 
death of the employee or separated employee, a court order acceptable 
for processing amending or superseding the court order submitted by the 
former spouse.


<R05>
Sec. 838.725  Effect on employee and retiree election rights.

    (a) A court order acceptable for processing that awards a former 
spouse survivor annuity does not affect a retiring employee's or 
retiree's rights and obligations to make survivor elections under 
subpart F of part 831 of this chapter or subpart F of part 842 of this 
chapter.
    (b) A court order acceptable for processing that awards a former 
spouse survivor annuity requires OPM to pay a former spouse survivor 
annuity and prevents OPM from paying an elected survivor benefit to a 
widow or widower or another former spouse if the election is 
inconsistent with the court order.

court order acceptable for processing terminates in accordance with the 
terms of the court order.

<R05>
Sec. 838.733  Rights of current and other former spouses after termination

the entire entitlement lost by the former spouse, the retiree (except a 
retiree under CSRS who retired before May 7, 1985 and who remarried 
before February 27, 1986) may elect within 2 years after the former 
spouse loses entitlement to continue the reduction to provide a survivor

    (b)(1) If a former spouse of an employee or retiree loses 
entitlement to a former spouse survivor annuity based on a court order 
acceptable for processing after the death of the employee or retiree

survivor annuities to other former spouses, OPM will pay the next 
entitled former spouse in the order specified in Sec. 838.135; or

    (B) The first day of the second month after OPM receives a copy of 
the court order acceptable for processing; or

Subpart H_Requirements for Court Orders Awarding Former Spouse Survivor 
                                Annuities


<R05>
Sec. 838.801  Purpose and scope.

    This subpart regulates the requirements that a court order awarding 
a former spouse survivor annuity must meet to be a court order 
acceptable for processing.


<R05>
Sec. 838.802  CSRS limitations.

    (a) A court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity under 
CSRS is not a court order acceptable for processing unless the marriage 
terminated on or after May 7, 1985.
    (b) In the case of a retiree who retired under CSRS before May 7, 
1985, a court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity under CSRS 
is not a court order acceptable for processing unless the retiree was 
receiving a reduced annuity to provide a survivor annuity to benefit 
that spouse on May 7, 1985.


<R05>
Sec. 838.803  Language not acceptable for processing.

    (a) Qualifying Domestic Relations Orders. (1) Any court order 
labeled as a ``qualified domestic relations order'' or issued on a form 
for ERISA qualified domestic relations orders is not a court order 
acceptable for processing unless the court order expressly states that 
the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are 
governed by this part.
    (2) When a court order is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section to state that the provisions of a court order concerning CSRS or 
FERS benefits are governed by this part the court order must--
    (i) Expressly refer to part 838 of Title 5, Code of Federal 
Regulations, and
    (ii) Expressly state that the provisions of the court order 
concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are drafted in accordance with the 
terminology used in this part.
    (3) Although any language satisfying the requirement of paragraph 
(a) (2) of this section is sufficient to prevent a court order from 
being unacceptable under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, OPM 
recommends the use of the language provided in ] 001 in appendix A to 
subpart F of this part to state that the provisions of the court order 
concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are governed by this part.
    (4) A court order directed at employee annuity that contains the 
language described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must also satisfy 
all other requirements of this subpart to be a court order acceptable 
for processing.
    (b) Employee annuity cannot continue after the death of the retiree. 
Any court order that provides that the former spouse's portion of the 
employee annuity shall continue after the death of the employee or 
retiree, by using language such as ``will continue to receive benefits 
after the death of'' the employee, that the former spouse ``will 
continue to receive benefits for his (or her) lifetime,'' or ``that 
benefits will continue after the death of'' the employee, but does not 
use terms such as ``survivor annuity,'' ``death benefits,'' ``former 
spouse annuity,'' or similar terms is not a court order acceptable for 
processing.


<R05>
Sec. 838.804  Court orders must expressly award a former spouse survivor annuity
or expressly direct an employee or retiree to elect to provide a former spouse 
          survivor annuity.

    (a) A court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is not a 
court order acceptable for processing unless it expressly awards a 
former spouse survivor annuity or expressly directs an employee or 
retiree to elect to provide a former spouse survivor annuity as 
described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) To expressly award a former spouse survivor annuity or expressly 
direct an employee or retiree to elect to provide a former spouse 
survivor annuity as required by paragraph (a) of this section the court 
order must--
    (1) Identify the retirement system using terms that are sufficient 
to identify the retirement system as explained in Sec. 838.911; and
    (2) (i) Expressly state that the former spouse is entitled to a 
former spouse survivor annuity using terms that are sufficient to 
identify the survivor annuity as explained in Sec. 838.912; or

[[Page 224]]

    (ii) Expressly direct the retiree to elect to provide a former 
spouse survivor annuity using terms that are sufficient to identify the 
survivor annuity as explained in Sec. 838.912.


<R05>
Sec. 838.805  OPM computation of formulas in computing the designated base.

    (a) A court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is not a 
court order acceptable for processing unless the court order provides 
sufficient instructions and information so that OPM can determine the 
amount of the former spouse's monthly benefit using only the express 
language of the court order, subparts A, G and I of this part, and 
information from normal OPM files.
    (b) To provide sufficient instructions and information for OPM to 
compute the amount of a former spouse survivor annuity as required by 
paragraph (a) of this section, if the court order uses a formula to 
determine the former spouse survivor annuity, it must not use any 
variables whose values are not readily ascertainable from the face of 
the court order or normal OPM files.
    (c) A court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is not a 
court order acceptable for processing if OPM would have to examine a 
State statute or court decision (on a different case) to understand, 
establish, or evaluate the formula for computing the former spouse 
survivor annuity.


<R05>
Sec. 838.806  Amended court orders.

    (a) A court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is not a 
court order acceptable for processing if it is issued after the date of 
retirement or death of the employee and modifies or replaces the first 
order dividing the marital property of the employee or retiree and the 
former spouse.
    (b) For purposes of awarding, increasing, reducing, or eliminating a 
former spouse survivor annuity, or explaining, interpreting, or 
clarifying a court order that awards, increases, reduces or eliminates a 
former spouse survivor annuity, the court order must be--
    (1) Issued on a day prior to the date of retirement or date of death 
of the employee; or
    (2) The first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and 
the former spouse.
    (c) A court order that awards a former spouse survivor annuity and 
that is issued after the first order dividing the marital property of 
the retiree and the former spouse has been vacated, set aside, or 
otherwise declared invalid is not a court order acceptable for 
processing if--
    (1) It is issued after the date of retirement or death of the 
retiree;
    (2) It changes any provision concerning a former spouse survivor 
annuity in the court order that was vacated, set aside or otherwise 
declared invalid; and
    (3)(i) The court order is effective prior to the date when it is 
issued; or
    (ii) The retiree and former spouse do not compensate the Civil 
Service Retirement and Disability Fund for any uncollected annuity 
reduction due as a result of the court order vacating, setting aside, or 
otherwise invalidating the first order terminating the marital 
relationship between the retiree and the former spouse.
    (d) In this section, ``date of retirement'' means the later of--
    (1) The date that the employee files an application for retirement; 
or
    (2) The effective commencing date for the employee's annuity.
    (e) In this section, ``issued'' means actually filed with the clerk 
of the court, and does not mean the effective date of a retroactive 
court order that is effective prior to the date when actually filed with 
the clerk of the court (e.g., a court order issued nunc pro tunc).
    (f)(1) In this section, the ``first order dividing the marital 
property of the retiree and the former spouse'' means--
    (i) The original written order that first ends (or first documents 
an oral order ending) the marriage if the court divides any marital 
property (or approves a property settlement agreement that divides any 
marital property) in that order, or in any order issued before that 
order); or
    (ii) The original written order issued after the marriage has been 
terminated in which the court first divides any marital property (or 
first approves a

[[Page 225]]

property settlement agreement that divides any marital property) if no 
marital property has been divided prior to the issuance of that order.
    (2) The first order dividing marital property does not include--
    (i) Any court order that amends, explains, clarifies, or interprets 
the original written order regardless of the effective date of the court 
order making the amendment, explanation, clarification, or 
interpretation; or
    (ii) Any court order issued under reserved jurisdiction or any other 
court order issued subsequent to the original written order that divide 
any marital property regardless of the effective date of the court 
order.

[57 FR 33574, July 29, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 3202, Jan. 8, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 838.807  Cost must be paid by annuity reduction.

    (a) A court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is not a 
court order acceptable for processing unless it permits OPM to collect 
the annuity reduction required by section 8339(j)(4) or section 8419 of 
title 5, United States Code, from annuity paid by OPM. OPM will not 
honor a court order that provides for the retiree or former spouse to 
pay OPM the amount of the annuity reduction by any other means.
    (b) The amount of the annuity reduction required by section 
8339(j)(4) or section 8419 of title 5, United States Code, may be paid--
    (1) By reduction of the former spouse's entitlement under a court 
order acceptable for processing that is directed at employee annuity; or
    (2) By reduction of the employee annuity.
    (c) Unless the court order otherwise directs, OPM will collect the 
annuity reduction required by section 8339(j)(4) or section 8419 of 
title, 5, United States Code, from the employee annuity.


<R04>
   Subpart I_Terminology Used in Court Orders Awarding Former Spouse 
                           Survivor Annuities

                          Regulatory Structure


<R05>
Sec. 838.901  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart regulates the meaning of terms necessary to award a 
former spouse survivor annuity in a court order, and for OPM to 
determine whether a court order awarding a former spouse survivor 
annuity is a court order acceptable for processing and the amount of the 
former spouse survivor annuity.
    (b)(1) This subpart establishes a uniform meaning to be used for 
terms and phrases frequently used in awarding a former spouse survivor 
annuity.
    (2) This subpart informs the legal community about the definition to 
be applied to terms used in court orders, to permit the resulting orders 
to be more carefully drafted, using the proper language to accomplish 
the aims of the court.
    (c)(1) To assist attorneys and courts in preparing court orders that 
OPM can honor in the manner that the court intends, appendix A of this 
subpart contains model language to accomplish many of the more common 
objectives associated with the award of a former spouse survivor 
annuity.
    (2) By using the language in appendix A of this subpart, the court, 
attorneys, and parties will know that the court order will be acceptable 
for processing and that OPM will treat the terminology used in the court 
order in the manner stated in the appendix.

                       Identification of Benefits


<R05>
Sec. 838.911  Identifying the retirement system.

    (a) To satisfy the requirements of Sec. 838.804(b)(1), a court 
order must contain language identifying the retirement system affected. 
For example, ``CSRS,'' ``FERS,'' ``OPM,'' or ``Federal Government'' 
survivor benefits, or ``survivor benefits payable based on service with 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture,'' etc., are sufficient 
identification of the retirement system.

[[Page 226]]

    (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this 
section, language referring to benefits under another retirement system, 
such as military retired pay, Foreign Service retirement benefits and 
Central Intelligence Agency retirement benefits, does not satisfy the 
requirements of Sec. 838.804(b)(1).
    (1) A court order that mistakenly labels CSRS benefits as FERS 
benefits and vice versa satisfies the requirements of Sec. 
838.804(b)(1).
    (2) Unless the court order expressly provides otherwise, for 
employees transferring to FERS, court orders directed at CSRS benefits 
apply to this entire FERS basic benefit, including the CSRS component, 
if any. Such a court order satisfies the requirements of Sec. 
838.804(b)(1).
    (c) A court order affecting military retired pay, even when military 
retired pay has been waived for inclusion in CSRS annuities, does not 
award a former spouse survivor annuity under CSRS or FERS. Such a court 
order does not satisfy the requirements of Sec. 838.804(b)(1).
    (d) A court order that requires an employee or retiree to maintain 
survivor benefits covering the former spouse satisfies the requirements 
of Sec. 838.804(b)(1), if the former spouse was covered by a CSRS or 
FERS survivor annuity or the FERS basic employee death benefit as 
defined in Sec. 843.102 of this chapter at the time of the divorce.

Sec. 838.912  Specifying an award of a former spouse survivor annuity.

    (a) To satisfy the requirements of Sec. 838.804(b)(2), a court 
order must specify that it is awarding a former spouse survivor annuity. 
The court order must contain language such as ``survivor annuity,'' 
``death benefits,'' ``former spouse survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. 
8341(h)(1),'' etc.
    (b)(1) A court order that provides that the former spouse is to 
``continue as'' or ``be named as'' the beneficiary of CSRS survivor 
benefits or similar language satisfies the requirements of Sec. 
838.804(b)(2).
    (2) A court order that requires an employee or retiree to maintain 
survivor benefits covering the former spouse satisfies the requirements 
of Sec. 838.804(b)(2), if the former spouse was covered by a CSRS or 
FERS survivor annuity or the FERS basic employee death benefit as 
defined in Sec. 843.102 of this chapter at the time of the divorce.
    (c) Two types of potential survivor annuities may be provided by 
retiring employees to cover former spouses. Under CSRS, section 8341(h) 
of title 5, United States Code, provides for ``former spouse survivor 
annuities'' and section 8339(k) of title 5, United States Code, provides 
for ``insurable interest annuities.'' These are distinct benefits, each 
with its own advantages. The corresponding FERS provisions are sections 
8445 and 8444, respectively.
    (1) OPM will enforce court orders to provide section 8341(h) or 
section 8445 annuities. These annuities are less expensive and have 
fewer restrictions than insurable interest annuities but the former 
spouse's interest will automatically terminate upon remarriage before 
age 55. To provide a section 8341(h) or section 8445 annuity, the court 
order must use terms such as ``former spouse survivor annuity,'' 
``section 8341(h) annuity,'' or ``survivor annuity.''
    (2) OPM cannot enforce court orders to provide ``insurable interest 
annuities'' under section 8339(k) or section 8444. These annuities may 
only be elected at the time of retirement by a retiring employee who is 
not retiring under the disability provision of the law and who is in 
good health. The retirees may also elect to cancel the insurable 
interest annuity to provide a survivor annuity for a spouse acquired 
after retirement. The parties might seek to provide this type of annuity 
interest if the nonemployee spouse expects to remarry before age 55, if 
the employee expects to remarry a younger second spouse before 
retirement or if another former spouse has already been awarded a 
section 8341(h) annuity. However, the court will have to provide its own 
remedy if the employee is not eligible for or does not make the 
election. OPM cannot enforce the court order. Language including the 
words ``insurable interest'' or referring to section 8339(k) or section 
8444 does not

[[Page 227]]

satisfy the requirements of Sec. 838.804(b)(2).
    (3) In court orders which contain internal contradictions about the 
type of annuity, such as ``insurable interest annuity under section 
8341(h),'' the section reference will control.

                         Computation of Benefit


<R05>
Sec. 838.921  Determining the amount of a former spouse survivor annuity.

    (a) A court order that contains no provision stating the amount of 
the former spouse survivor annuity provides the maximum former spouse 
survivor annuity permitted under Sec. 831.641 or Sec. 842.613 of this 
chapter and satisfies the requirements of Sec. 838.805.
    (b)(1) A court order that provides that ``a former spouse will 
keep'' or ``an employee or retiree will maintain'' the survivor annuity 
to which he or she was entitled at the time of the divorce satisfies the 
requirements of Sec. 838.805 and provides a former spouse survivor 
annuity in the same proportion to the maximum survivor annuity under 
Sec. 831.641 or Sec. 842.613 of this chapter as the former spouse had 
at the time of divorce. For example, a former spouse of an employee 
would be entitled to a maximum survivor benefit; a former spouse of a 
retiree (who was married to the retiree at retirement and continuously 
until the divorce resulting in the court order) would be entitled to the 
survivor benefit elected at retirement.
    (2) If, at the time of divorce, the employee covered by FERS had at 
least 18 months of civilian service creditable under FERS but less than 
10 years of service creditable under FERS, a former spouse with a court 
order described in paragraph (b)(1) or paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
may be entitled to the basic employee death benefit as defined in Sec. 
843.102 of this chapter, but is not entitled to any other former spouse 
survivor annuity based on the court order.
    (c)(1) A court order that awards a former spouse survivor annuity of 
less than $12 per year satisfies the requirements of Sec. 838.805 and 
provides an initial rate of $1 per month plus all cost-of-living 
increases occurring after the later of--
    (i) The date of the court order; or
    (ii) The date when the employee retires.
    (2) The reduction in the employee annuity will be computed as though 
the court order provided a former spouse survivor annuity of $1 per 
month.
    (d)(1) A court order that awards a former spouse survivor annuity 
while authorizing the employee or retiree to elect a lesser former 
spouse survivor annuity upon the employee's or retiree's remarriage 
satisfies the requirements of Sec. 838.805, and provides the former 
spouse survivor annuity at the rate initially provided in the court 
order but does not allow the employee or retiree to elect a lesser 
benefit for the former spouse.
    (2) To provide full survivor annuity benefits to a former spouse 
while authorizing the employee or retiree to elect a lesser former 
spouse survivor annuity benefit in order to provide survivor annuity 
benefits for a subsequent spouse, the court order must provide for a 
reduction in the former spouse survivor annuity upon the employee's or 
retiree's election of survivor annuity benefits for a subsequent spouse.
    (3) A reduction in the amount of survivor benefits provided to the 
former spouse does not satisfy the requirements of Sec. 838.805 if it 
is contingent upon the employee's or annuitant's remarriage rather than 
his or her election of survivor annuity benefits for a subsequent 
spouse.

58 FR 52882, Oct. 13, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 838.922  Prorata share defined.

    (a) Prorata share means the fraction of the maximum survivor annuity 
allowable under Sec. 831.641 or Sec. 842.613 of this chapter whose 
numerator is the number of months of Federal civilian and military 
service that the employee performed during the marriage and whose 
denominator is the total number of months of Federal civilian and 
military service performed by the employee.
    (b) A court order that awards a former spouse a ``prorata share'' of 
a survivor annuity by using that term

[[Page 228]]

and identifying the date when the marriage began satisfies the 
requirements of Sec. 838.805 and awards the former spouse a former 
spouse survivor annuity equal to the prorata share as defined in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) A court order that awards a portion of a survivor annuity, as of 
a specified date before the employee's retirement, awards the former 
spouse a former spouse survivor annuity equal to the prorata share as 
defined in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) A court order that awards a portion of the ``value'' of a 
survivor annuity as of a specific date before retirement, without 
specifying what ``value'' is, awards the former spouse a former spouse 
survivor annuity equal to a prorata share as defined in paragraph (a) of 
this section.

[57 FR 33574, July 29, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 52882, Oct. 13, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 838.923  Cost-of-living adjustment before the death of a retiree.

    A court order that awards a former spouse survivor annuity is deemed 
to order OPM to add to the survivor annuity rate cost-of-living 
adjustments that occur before the death of a retiree (in the same manner 
as these adjustments are applied to the survivor rate generally) unless 
the court order contains an instruction expressly directing OPM not to 
add these adjustments to the survivor annuity rate. (See Sec. 838.735 
for information concerning cost-of-living adjustments after the death of 
an employee or retiree.)

                        Miscellaneous Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 838.931  Court orders that provide temporary awards of former 
spouse survivor annuities.

    A provision in a court order that temporarily awards a former spouse 
survivor annuity satisfies the requirements of Sec. 838.804(b)(2), but 
the temporary award becomes permanent on the date on which OPM is barred 
from honoring a modification of the court order (the date of retirement 
or death, or, in the case of a post-retirement divorce, the date of the 
initial court order), as provided in sections 8341(h)(4) and 8445(d) of 
title 5, United States Code.

[57 FR 33574, July 29, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 43493, Aug. 17, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 838.932  Court orders that permit the former spouse to elect to 
receive a former spouse survivor annuity.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a court 
order that gives the former spouse the right to elect a former spouse 
survivor annuity satisfies the requirements of Sec. 838.804(b)(2) and 
provides a former spouse survivor annuity in the amount otherwise 
provided by the court order.
    (b) A former spouse who has been awarded a former spouse survivor 
annuity by a court order that gives the former spouse the right to elect 
a former spouse survivor annuity may irrevocably elect not to be 
eligible for a former spouse survivor annuity based on the court order.
    (c) The former spouse may make the election under paragraph (b) of 
this section at any time after the issuance of the court order. An 
election under paragraph (b) of this section--
    (1) Must be in writing and in the form prescribed by OPM;
    (2) Is effective on the first day of the month following the month 
in which OPM received the election; and
    (3) Is irrevocable once it has become effective.
    (d) The reduction in an employee annuity based on a court order that 
gives the former spouse the right to elect a former spouse survivor 
annuity terminates on the last day of the month in which OPM receives 
the former spouse's election under paragraph (b) of this section.

[57 FR 33574, July 29, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 43493, Aug. 17, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 838.933  Payment of the cost of a former spouse survivor annuity.

    (a) A court order that unequivocally awards a former spouse survivor 
annuity and directs the former spouse to pay for that benefit satisfies 
the requirements of Sec. 838.805, and--
    (1) If the former spouse has also been awarded a portion of the 
employee annuity then the cost of the survivor benefit will be deducted 
from the former spouse's share of the employee annuity

[[Page 229]]

(if sufficient to cover the total cost--there will be no partial 
withholding); otherwise,
    (2) The reduction will be taken from the employee annuity and 
collection from the former spouse will be a private matter between the 
parties.
    (b) a court order that conditions the award of a former spouse 
survivor annuity on the former spouse's payment of the cost of the 
benefit satisfies the requirements of Sec. 838.805 only if a court 
order acceptable for processing also awards the former spouse a portion 
of the employee annuity sufficient to cover the cost.

                            Model Paragraphs

  Appendix A to Subpart I of Part 838--Recommended Language for Court 
            Orders Awarding Former Spouse Survivor Annuities

    This appendix provides recommended language for use in court orders 
awarding former spouse survivor annuities. A former spouse survivor 
annuity is not a continuation of a former spouse's share of an employee 
annuity after the death of the employee. A former spouse's entitlement 
to a portion of an employee annuity cannot continue after the death of 
the employee. A court order that attempts to extend the former spouse's 
entitlement to a portion of an employee annuity past the death of the 
employee is not effective. The model language in this appendix does not 
award benefits payable to the former spouse during the lifetime of the 
employee. A separate, distinct award of a portion of the employee 
annuity is necessary to award a former spouse a benefit during the 
lifetime of the employee. Appendix A to subpart F of this part contains 
model language for a portion of an employee annuity.
    Attorneys should exercise great care in preparing provisions 
concerning former spouse survivor annuities because sections 8341(h)(4) 
and 8445(d) of title 5, United States Code, prohibit OPM from accepting 
modifications after the retirement or death of the employee. (See Sec. 
838.806 concerning unacceptable modifications.) A court order awarding a 
former spouse survivor annuity should include four elements:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Identification of the retirement system;
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Explicit award of the former spouse survivor 
annuity.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Method for computing the amount of the former 
spouse's benefit; and
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Instructions on what OPM should do if the 
employee leaves Federal service before retirement and applies for a 
refund of employee contributions.
    By using the model language, courts will know that the court order 
will have the effect described in this appendix.
    The model language uses the terms ``[former spouse]'' to identify 
the spouse who is receiving a former spouse survivor annuity and 
``[employee]'' to identify the Federal employee whose employment was 
covered by the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees 
Retirement System. Obviously, in drafting an actual court order the 
appropriate terms, such as ``Petitioner'' and ``Respondent,'' or the 
names of the parties should replace ``[former spouse]'' and 
``[employee].''
    Similarly, except when the provision applies only to the basic 
employee death benefit (defined in Sec. 843.103 of this chapter) that 
is available only under the Federal Employees Retirement System, the 
models are drafted for employees covered by the Civil Service Retirement 
System (5 U.S.C. 8331 et seq.). The name of the retirement system should 
be changed for employees covered by the Federal Employees Retirement 
System (5 U.S.C. chapter 84.).
    Statutory references used in the models are to CSRS provisions (such 
as section 8341(h) of title 5, United States Code). When appropriate, 
the corresponding FERS provision (such as section 8445 of title 5, 
United States Code) should be used.

    700 Series--Computing the amount of the former spouse's benefit.

    Paragraphs 701 through 704 contain model language for awards of 
former spouse survivor annuities in amounts that do not require 
specification of the base on which the former spouse's share will be 
computed. Situations in which the computational base need not be 
specified include amounts defined by law or regulation. For example, the 
maximum former spouse survivor annuity is fixed by statute generally at 
55 percent of the employee annuity under CSRS and 50 percent of the 
employee annuity under FERS.
    Paragraphs 711 and 712 contain model language for awards of former 
spouse survivor annuities that use the employee annuity as the base on 
which the portion awarded will be computed (that is, on which 
percentage, fraction or formula will be applied). Paragraphs 721 and 722 
contain model language for awards of former spouse survivor annuities 
that use the maximum possible survivor annuity as the base on which the 
portion awarded will be computed (that is, on which percentage, fraction 
or formula will be applied). Using the maximum possible survivor annuity 
as the base will generally award 55 percent under CSRS and 50 percent 
under FERS of the amount that using the employee annuity as the base 
would produce.
    Paragraphs 750 and higher contain model language to implement the 
most common other types of awards.
    Each model paragraph includes a reference to the statutory provision 
under CSRS that authorizes OPM to honor court orders awarding former 
spouse survivor annuities. The FERS statutory provision that corresponds 
to section 8341(h) (mentioned in the first sentence of each example) is 
section 8445.

<greek-a> 701 Award of the maximum survivor annuity.
    Using the following paragraph will award the maximum possible former 
spouse survivor annuity. Under CSRS, the maximum possible survivor 
annuity is 55 percent of the employee annuity unless the surviving 
spouse or former spouse was married to the retiree at retirement and 
agreed to a lesser amount at that time. Under FERS, the maximum possible 
survivor annuity is 50 percent of the employee annuity unless the 
surviving spouse or former spouse was married to the retiree at 
retirement and agreed to a lesser amount at that time.
    ``Under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former 
spouse] is awarded the maximum possible former spouse survivor annuity 
under the Civil Service Retirement System.''

<greek-a> 702 Award that continues the pre-divorce survivor annuity 
benefits.
    Using the following paragraph will award a former spouse survivor 
annuity equal to the amount that the former spouse would have received 
if the marriage were never terminated by divorce.
    ``Under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former 
spouse] is awarded a former spouse survivor annuity under the Civil 
Service Retirement System in the same amount to which [former spouse] 
would have been entitled if the divorce had not occurred.''

<greek-a> 703 Award of a prorata share.
    Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a prorata 
share of the maximum possible survivor annuity. Prorata share is defined 
in Sec. 838.922. To award a prorata share the court order must state 
the date of the marriage. Unless the court order specifies a different 
ending date, the marriage ends for computation purposes on the date that 
the court order is filed with the court clerk.
    ``Under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former 
spouse] is awarded a former spouse survivor annuity under the Civil 
Service Retirement System. The amount of the former spouse survivor 
annuity will be equal to a prorate share. The marriage began on [insert 
date].''

<greek-a> 704 Award of a fixed monthly amount.
    Using the following paragraph will award a former spouse survivor 
annuity that will start at the amount stated in the order when the 
employee or retiree dies, unless the stated amount exceeds the maximum 
possible former spouse survivor annuity. If the amount stated in the 
order exceeds the maximum possible former spouse survivor annuity, the 
court order will be treated as awarding the maximum. After payment of 
the former spouse survivor annuity has began, COLA's will be applied in 
accordance with Sec. 838.735. If the final sentence of this model 
paragraph is omitted, OPM will add COLA's occurring after the date of 
the employee's retirement or the date of issuance of the court order, 
whichever is later.
    ``Under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former 
spouse] is awarded a former spouse survivor annuity under the Civil 
Service Retirement System. The amount of the former spouse survivor 
annuity will be equal to $[insert a number] per month. The Office of 
Personnel Management is ordered not to increase this amount by COLA's 
occurring before death of [employee or retiree].''
<greek-a> 705-710 [Reserved]
<greek-a> 711 Award of a percentage or fraction of the employee annuity.

[[Page 231]]

    Using the following paragraph will award a former spouse survivor 
annuity equal to the stated percentage or fraction of the employee 
annuity. The stated percentage or fraction may not exceed 55 percent 
under CSRS or 50 percent under FERS.
    ``Under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former 
spouse] is awarded a former spouse survivor annuity under the Civil 
Service Retirement System. The amount of the former spouse survivor 
annuity will be equal to [insert a percentage or fraction] percent of 
the [employee]'s employee annuity.''
<greek-a> 712 Award based on a stated formula as a share of employee 
annuity.
    Using the following paragraphs will award a former spouse survivor 
annuity in an amount to be determined by applying a stated formula to 
employee annuity. The amount of the former spouse survivor annuity may 
not exceed 55 percent of the employee annuity under CSRS or 50 percent 
under FERS. The formula must be stated in the court order (including a 
court-approved property settlement agreement). The formula may not be 
incorporated by reference to a statutory provision or a court decision 
in another case. If the court order uses a formula, the court order must 
include any data that is necessary for OPM to evaluate the formula 
unless the necessary data is contained in normal OPM files.
    ``Under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former

computed as follows:
    ``[Insert formula.]''
<greek-a> 713-720 [Reserved]
<greek-a> 721 Award of a percentage or fraction of the maximum survivor 
annuity.
    Using the following paragraph will award a former spouse survivor 
annuity equal to the stated percentage or fraction of the maximum 
possible survivor annuity. The stated percentage or fraction may not 
exceed 100 percent.
    ``Under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former

maximum possible survivor annuity.
<greek-a> 722 Award based on a stated formula as a share of maximum 
survivor annuity.
    Using the following paragraphs will award a former spouse survivor 
annuity based on a stated formula to be applied to the maximum possible 
survivor annuity. The formula must be stated in the court order 
(including a court-approved property settlement agreement). The formula 
may not be incorporated by reference to a statutory provision or a court 
decision in another case. If the court order uses a formula, the court 
order must include any data that is necessary for OPM to evaluate the 
formula unless the necessary data is contained in normal OPM files.
    ``Under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former

    ``[Insert formula.]''
<greek-a> 723-750 [Reserved]
<greek-a> 751 Changing amount of former spouse survivor annuity based on 
remarriage before retirement.
    Using the following paragraph will award the maximum possible former 
spouse survivor annuity unless the employee remarries before retirement. 
Upon the employee's remarriage before retirement the amount of the 
former spouse survivor annuity changes to a prorata share. The maximum 
possible and prorata share are used as examples only; other amounts may 
be substituted. Similar language is not acceptable for remarriages after 
retirement.
    ``Under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former

awarded a former spouse survivor annuity under the Civil Service 
Retirement System. The amount of the former spouse survivor annuity will 
be equal to a prorata share. The marriage to [former spouse] began on 
[insert data].''
<greek-a> 752 Changing amount of former spouse survivor annuity based on 
remarriage after retirement.
    Using the following paragraph will award the maximum possible former 
spouse survivor annuity unless the employee remarries after retirement 
and elects to provide a survivor annuity for the spouse acquired after 
retirement. Upon the employee's remarriage after retirement and election 
to provide a survivor annuity for the spouse acquired after retirement, 
the amount of the former spouse survivor annuity changes to a prorata 
share. The maximum possible and prorata share are used as examples only; 
other amounts maybe substituted. The change in the amount of the former 
spouse survivor annuity must be triggered by the election, which is a 
part of normal OPM files, rather than the remarriage, which is not 
documented in normal OPM files.
    ``Under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former 
spouse] is awarded the

for a new spouse acquired after retirement. If [employee] elects to 
provide a survivor annuity to a new spouse acquired after retirement, 
under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former spouse] 
is awarded a former spouse survivor annuity under the Civil Service 
Retirement System. The amount of the former spouse survivor annuity will 
be equal to a prorata share. The marriage to [former spouse] began on 
[insert data].''

    800 Series--Paying the cost of a former spouse survivor annuity.

    A court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity requires 
that the employee annuity be reduced. The reduction lowers the gross 
employee annuity. The costs associated with providing the former spouse 
survivor annuity must be paid by annuity reduction. Under Sec. 838.807, 
if the former spouse is awarded a portion of the employee annuity 
sufficient to pay the cost associated with providing the survivor 
annuity, the former spouse's share maybe reduced to pay the cost.
<greek-a> 801 Costs to be paid from the employee annuity.
    No special provision on payment of the costs associated with 
providing the former spouse survivor annuity is necessary if the court 
intends the cost to be taken from the employee annuity.
<greek-a> 802 Costs to be paid from former spouse's share of the 
employee annuity.
    Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a prorata 
share of the employee annuity and a prorata share of the maximum 
possible survivor annuity and provide that the cost associated with the 
survivor annuity be deducted from the former spouse's share of the 
employee annuity. Prorata share and self-only annuity are used as 
examples only; another amount or type of annuity may be substituted.
    ``[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under 
the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United 
States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to a prorata share of 
[employee]'s self-only monthly annuity under the Civil Service

             900 Series--Refunds of employee contributions.

    Court orders that award a former spouse survivor annuity based on 
the service of an employee who is not then eligible to retire should 
include an additional paragraph containing instructions that tell OPM 
what to do if the employee requests a refund of employee contributions 
before becoming eligible to retire. The court order may award the former 
spouse a portion of the refund of employee contributions or bar payment 
of the refund of employee contributions.
<greek-a> 901 Barring payment of a refund of employee contributions.
    Using the following paragraph will bar payment of the refund of 
employee contributions if payment of the refund of employee 
contributions would extinguish the former spouse's entitlement to a 
former spouse survivor annuity. ``The United States Office of Personnel 
Management is directed not to pay [employee] a refund of employee 
contributions.''
<greek-a> 902 Dividing a refund of employee contributions.
    Using the following paragraph will allow the refund of employee 
contributions to be paid but will award a prorata share of the refund of 
employee contributions to the former spouse. The award of a prorata 
share is used only an example; the court order could provide another 
fraction, percentage, or formula, or a fixed amount. A refund of 
employee contributions voids the employee's rights to an employee 
annuity unless the employee is reemployed under the retirement system. 
Payment of the refund of employee contributions will also extinguish the 
former spouse's right to a court-ordered portion of an employee annuity 
or a former spouse survivor annuity unless the employee is reemployed 
and reestablishes title to annuity benefits.
    ``If [employee] becomes eligible and applies for a refund of 
employee contributions, [former spouse] is entitled to a prorata share 
of the refund of employee contributions. The marriage began on [insert

pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse.]''

Sec. 838.1004  Qualifying court orders.

    (a) A former spouse is entitled to a portion of an employee's 
retirement benefits only to the extent that the division of retirement 
benefits is expressly provided for by the court order. The court order 
must divide employee retirement benefits, award a payment from employee 
retirement benefits, or award a former spouse annuity.
    (b) The court order must state the former spouse's share as a fixed 
amount, a percentage or a fraction of the annuity, or by a formula that 
does not contain any variables whose value is not readily ascertainable 
from the face of the order or normal OPM files.
    (c)(1) For purposes of payments from employee retirement benefits, 
OPM will review court orders as a whole to determine whether the 
language of the order shows an intent by the court that the former 
spouse should receive a portion of the employee's retirement benefits 
directly from the United States.
    (i) Orders that direct or imply that OPM is to make payment of a 
portion of employee retirement benefits, or are neutral about the source 
of payment, will be honored unless the retiree can demonstrate that the 
order is invalid in accordance with Sec. 838.1009.
    (ii) Orders that specifically direct the retiree to pay a portion of 
employee retirement benefits to a former spouse (and do not contain 
language to show the court intends payment from the Civil Service 
Retirement System) will be honored unless the retiree objects to direct 
payment by OPM within the 30-day notice period prescribed in Sec. 
838.1008, but will not be honored even if the retiree raises only a 
general objection to payment by OPM within that 30-day notice period.
    (2) For purposes of awarding a former spouse annuity, the court 
order must either state the former spouse's entitlement to a survivor 
annuity or direct an employee, Member, or retiree to provide a former 
spouse annuity.
    (d) For purposes of affecting or awarding a former spouse annuity, a 
court order is not a qualifying court order whenever--
    (1) The marriage was terminated before May 7, 1985; or
    (2)(i) The marriage was terminated on or after May 7, 1985; and
    (ii) The employee or Member retired under CSRS before May 7, 1985; 
and
    (iii)(A) The employee or Member had elected not to provide a current 
spouse annuity for that spouse at the time of retirement; or,
    (B) In the case of a post-retirement marriage, the annuitant had not 
elected to provide a survivor annuity for that spouse before May 7, 
1985.
    (e)(1) For purposes of awarding, increasing, reducing, or 
eliminating a former spouse survivor annuity, or explaining, 
interpreting, or clarifying a court order that awards, increases, 
reduces or eliminates a former spouse annuity, the court order must be--
    (i) Issued on a day prior to the date of retirement or date of death 
of the employee; or
    (ii) The first order dividing the marital property of the retiree 
and the former spouse.
    (2) In paragraph (e)(1) of this section, ``date of retirement'' 
means the later of--
    (i) The date that the employee files an application for retirement; 
or
    (ii) The effective commencing date for the employee's annuity.
    (3) In paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(4) of this section ``issued'' means 
actually filed with the clerk of the court, and does not mean the 
effective date of a retroactive court order that is effective prior to 
the date when actually filed with the clerk of the court (e.g., a court 
order issued nunc pro tunc).
    (4)(i) In paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, the ``first order 
dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse'' 
means--
    (A) The original written order that first ends (or first documents 
an oral order ending) the marriage if the court divides any marital 
property (or approves a property settlement agreement that divides any 
marital property) in that order, or in any order issued before that 
order; or

[[Page 235]]

    (B) The original written order issued after the marriage has been 
terminated in which the court first divides any marital property (or 
first approves a property settlement agreement that divides any marital 
property) if no marital property has been divided prior to the issuance 
of that order.
    (ii) The first order dividing marital property does not include--
    (A) Any court order that amends, explains, clarifies, or interprets 
the original written order regardless of the effective date of the court 
order making the amendment, explanation, clarification, or 
interpretation; or
    (B) Any court order issued under reserved jurisdiction or any other 
court orders issued subsequent to the original written order that divide 
any marital property regardless of the effective date of the court 
order.

    (2) That the former spouse will notify the Associate Director within 
15 calendar days of the occurrence of any remarriage; and

retiree that a court order has been received that appears to require 
that a portion of his or her retirement benefits be paid to a former

court order. The notice will inform the former employee or Member--
    (i) That OPM intends to honor the court order; and
    (ii) Of the effect that the court order will have on the former 
employee or Member's retirement benefits; and

    (ii) Of the amount that the former spouse is entitled to receive 
under the court order, and in cases that award a portion of the benefits 
on a percentage basis or by a formula, how the amount was computed; and
    (iii) That payment is being delayed for a period of 30 days to give 
the former employee or Member an opportunity to contest the court order.
    (b) In a case in which the court order awards a former spouse 
annuity--
    (1) The Associate Director will notify the retiree, if living, or, 
if the employee, Member, or retiree is dead, his or her surviving 
spouse, or the person entitled to the lump-sum death benefit under 
section 8342 of title 5, United States Code, if possible, that a court 
order has been received that requires the payment of a former spouse 
annuity. The notice will include a copy of the court order. The notice

entitled to receive and how the amount was computed; and
    (iii) That anyone adversely affected has a period of 30 days in

period provided for by Sec. 838.1008, the court order will be honored 
in accordance with the notification.

Associate Director will consider the response. The former spouse's claim 
will be denied and the former spouse will be notified of the right to 
request reconsideration under Sec. 831.109 of this chapter whenever is 
is shown that--
    (i) The court order is not a qualifying court order; or
    (ii) The court order is inconsistent with a contemporaneous or 
subsequent court order.
    (b) If any person who may lose benefits if OPM honors the court 
order objects to payment based on the validity of the court order and 
the record contains reasonable support for the objection, he or she will 
be granted 30 days to initiate legal action to determine the validity of 
the objection. If funds are available under Sec. 838.1006 and evidence 
is submitted that legal action had been started before the 30 days have 
expired, money will continue to be withheld, but no payment will be made 
to the former spouse pending judicial determination of the validity of 
the court order.

    (a) Payment of the lump-sum credit to a former employee or Member 
will be subject to the terms of any court order or decree issued with 
respect to any former spouse or to any current spouse from whom the 
employee or Member was legally separated, if--
    (1) The court order or decree expressly relates to any portion of 
the lump-sum credit involved; and
    (2) Payment of the lump-sum credit would extinguish entitlement of 
the current or former spouse to a survivor annuity under section 8341(h) 
of title 5, United States Code, or to any portion of an annuity under 
section 8345(j) of title 5, United States Code.
    (b) For paragraph (a) of this section to have effect, OPM must be in 
receipt of the court order or decree before authorizing payment of the 
refund.
    (c)(1) In the event that OPM receives two or more court orders or 
decrees--
    (i) When there are two former spouses, the court orders or decrees 
will be honored in the order in which they were issued until the lump-
sum has been exhausted.

the same former spouse, the one issued last will be honored first.
    (2) In no event will the amount paid out exceed the amount of the 
lump-sum credit.
    (d) OPM is not liable for any payment made from money due from or 
payable by OPM to any individual pursuant to a court order or decree 
regular on its face, if such payment is made in accordance with this 
subpart.
    (e) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, a court 
order or decree directed at a refund of retirement contributions is not 
effective unless the court order or decree and supporting documentation 
required by Sec. 838.1005 are received by OPM not later than--
    (1) The last day of the second month before payment of the refund; 
or
    (2) Twenty days after OPM receives the Statement required by Sec. 
831.2007(c) of this chapter if the former spouse has indicated on that 
Statement that such an order exists.

[[Page 238]]

    (f) The interests of a former spouse with a court order or decree 
who does not receive notice of a refund application because the former 
employee or Member submits fraudulent proof of notification or 
fraudulent proof that the former spouse's whereabouts are unknown are 
protected if, and only if--
    (1) The former spouse files the court order or decree with OPM no 
later than the last day of the second month before the payment of the 
refund; or
    (2) The former spouse submits proof that--
    (i) The evidence submitted by the employee was fraudulent; and
    (ii) Absent the fraud, the former spouse would have been able to 
submit the necessary documentation required by Sec. 838.1005 within the 
time limit prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (g) Court orders, notices, summons, or other documents that attempt 
to restrain OPM from paying refunds of retirement contributions are not 
effective unless they meet all the requirements of--
    (1) Paragraph (a) of this section, including the requirement that 
the court order or decree, or a prior court order or decree, has awarded 
the former spouse a former spouse annuity as defined in Sec. 831.603 of 
this chapter or a portion of the employee's or Member's future annuity 
benefit; or
    (2) Part 581 of this chapter.

retirement benefits regardless of the date of issuance of the court 
order or the date when the employee or Member retires.
    (2) The Associate Director will not increase the amount apportioned 
from current retirement benefits to satisfy an arrearage due the former 
spouse unless the court order states the amount of the arrearage and 
directs that it be paid from the employee retirement benefit. However, 
the Associate Director will honor the terms of a new or revised court 
order that either increases or decreases the former spouse's 
entitlement. These changes will be prospective only.
    (3) Benefits payable to a former spouse from a retiree's annuity 
begin to accrue no earlier than the beginning of the month after receipt

838.1005, and terminate no later than the last day of the month before 
the death of the retiree.
    (b)(1) The provisions of this subpart concerning former spouse 
annuities apply only with respect to a former spouse of an employee,

May 7, 1985, regardless of the date the employee separates from a 
position covered by CSRS.
    (2) The survivor annuity for a former spouse commences and 
terminates in accordance with the court order. However, a court order

    (ii) The first day of the second month beginning after OPM receives 
the court order, together with such additional information required by 
Sec. 838.1005, whichever is later. Further, a court order will not be

the former spouse's share of employee retirement benefits terminates on 
the last day of the month before the death of the former spouse, and the 
former spouse's share of employee retirement benefits reverts to the 
retiree.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, OPM will honor a 
qualifying court order or an amended qualifying court order that directs 
OPM to pay, after the death of the former spouse, the former spouse's 
share of the employee annuity to--

[[Page 239]]

    (1) The court;
    (2) An officer of the court acting as a fiduciary;
    (3) The estate of the former spouse; or
    (4) One or more of the retiree's children as defined in section 
8342(c) or section 8424(d) of title 5, United States Code.

<R05>
Sec. 838.1013  Limitations.

    (a) Employee retirement benefits are subject to apportionment by 
court order only while the former employee or Member is living. Payment 
of apportioned amounts will be made only to the former spouse and/or the 
children of the former employee or Member. Payment will not be made to 
any of the following:
    (1) The heirs or legatees of the former spouse; or
    (2) The creditors of the former employee or Member, or the former 
spouse; or
    (3) Other assignees of the former employee or Member, or the former 
spouse.
    (b) The amount of payment under this subpart will not be less than 
one dollar and, in the absence of compelling circumstances, will be in 
whole dollars.
    (c) In honoring and complying with a court order, the Associate 
Director will not disrupt the scheduled method of accruing retirement 
benefits or the normal timing for making such payment, despite the 
existence of a special schedule of accrual or payment of amounts due the 
former spouse.
    (d) Payments from employee retirement benefits under this subpart 
will be discontinued whenever the retiree's annuity payments are 
suspended or terminated. If annuity payments to the retiree are 
restored, payment to the former spouse will also resume.
    (e) Since the former spouse is entitled to payments from employee 
retirement benefits only while the former employee or Member is living, 
the former spouse is personally liable for any payments from employee 
retirement benefits received after the death of the retiree.


<R05>
Sec. 838.1014  Guidelines on interpreting court orders.

    As circumstances require, OPM will publish in the Federal Register a 
notice of the guidelines it uses in interpreting court orders. Upon 
publication of the notice in the Federal Register of such guidelines, 
they will become an appendix to this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 838.1015  Liability.

    OPM is not liable for any payment made from employee retirement 
benefits pursuant to a court order if such payment is made in accordance 
with the provisions of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 838.1016  Receipt of multiple court orders.

    In the event that OPM receives two or more qualifying court orders--
    (a) When there are two or more former spouses, the court orders will 
be honored in the order in which they were issued to the maximum extent 
possible under Sec. Sec. 831.641 of this chapter and 838.1006.
    (b) Where there are two or more court orders relating to the same 
former spouse, the one issued last will be honored.

<R05>
Sec. 838.1017  Cost-of-living adjustments.

    In cases where the court order apportions a percentage of the 
employee retirement benefit, the Associate Director will initially 
determine the amount of proper payment. That amount will be increased by 
future cost-of-living increases unless the court directs otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 838.1018  Settlements.

    The former spouse may request that an amount be withheld from the 
retirement benefits that is less than the amount stipulated in the court 
order. This lower amount will be deemed a complete fulfillment of the 
obligation of OPM for the period in which the request is in effect.

 Appendix A to Subpart J of Part 838--Guidelines for Interpreting State 
         Court Orders Dividing Civil Service Retirement Benefits

                        United States of America

                     Office of Personnel Management

                     Retirement and Insurance Group

 Guidelines for Interpreting State Court Orders Dividing Civil Service 
                           Retirement Benefits

    These guidelines explain the interpretation that the Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) will place on terms and phrases frequently 
used in dividing benefits. These guidelines are intended not only for 
the use of OPM, but also for the legal community as a whole, with the 
hope that by informing attorneys, in advance, about the manner in which 
OPM will interpret terms written into court orders, the resulting orders 
will be more carefully drafted, using the proper language to accomplish 
the aims of the court.
    A substantial number of State court orders are drafted under the 
mistaken belief that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) 
(29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.) applies to CSRS benefits. Sections 1003(b)(1) 
and 1051 of title 29, United States Code, exempt CSRS from ERISA, 
because CSRS is a ``governmental plan'' as defined in section 1001(23) 
of title 29, United States Code. Accordingly, OPM does not honor ERISA 
Qualifying Domestic Relations Orders (QDRO's) except to the extent that 
the law governing CSRS expressly authorizes compliance with State court 
orders. OPM will honor the orders to the extent permitted by CSRS. 
However, many provisions of ERISA QDRO's are not authorized under CSRS. 
Most significantly, a court cannot require that payments to the former 
spouse begin before the employee actually retires (i.e., begins to 
receive benefits) and, unless the order expressly provides that the 
former spouse is entitled to a survivor annuity, the payments to the 
former spouse cannot continue after the employee dies.

                        I. Computations generally

    A. Adjustments affecting court-awarded benefits. 1. Orders that 
award adjustments to a former spouse stated in terms such as ``cost-of-
living adjustments'' or ``COLAs'' occurring after the date of the decree 
but before the date of retirement will be interpreted to award increases 
equal to the adjustments described in or effected under section 8340 of 
title 5, United States Code.
    2. Orders that award adjustments to a former spouse stated in terms 
such as ``salary adjustments'' or ``pay adjustments'' occurring after 
the date of the decree will be interpreted to award increases equal to 
the adjustments described in or effected under section 5303 of title 5, 
United States Code until the date of retirement.
    3. Unless otherwise specified in the order, adjustments described in 
section 8340 of title 5, United States Code will be applied after the 
date of retirement.
    B. Application of COLAs. 1. Unless the court directly and 
unequivocally orders otherwise, decrees that divide annuities either on 
a percentage basis or by use of a formula will be interpreted to entitle 
the former spouse to salary adjustments occurring after the date of the 
decree and cost-of-living adjustments occurring after the date of the 
decree or occurring after the date of the employee's retirement, 
whichever comes later.
    2. On the other hand, decrees that award a former spouse a specific 
dollar amount from the annuity will be interpreted as excluding salary 
and cost-of-living adjustments after the date of the decree, unless the 
court expressly orders their inclusion.
    3. Orders that contain a general instruction to calculate the former 
spouse's share effective at the time of divorce or separation will not 
be interpreted to prevent the inclusion of salary adjustments occurring 
after the specified date. To prevent the application of salary 
adjustments after the date of the divorce or separation, the decree must 
either state the exact dollar amount of the award to the former spouse 
or specifically state that salary adjustments after the specified date 
are to be disregarded in computing the former spouse's share.
    4. Orders that require OPM to compute a benefit as of a specified 
date, and specifically state that salary adjustments after the specified 
date are to be disregarded in computing the former spouse's share will 
not be interpreted to prevent the application of COLAs after the date of 
the Federal employee's retirement. To award COLAs between the specified 
date and the Federal employee's retirement, the order must specifically 
state that the former spouse will receive the benefit of any COLAs 
occurring between the specified date and the date of the Federal 
employee's retirement. To prevent the application of COLAs after the 
retirement date, the decree must either state the exact dollar amount of 
the award to the former spouse or specifically state that the former 
spouse will not receive the benefit of COLAs occurring after the date of 
the Federal employee's retirement.
    C. Present value. 1. Orders that award a portion of the ``present 
value'' of an annuity will not be honored unless the amount of the 
``present value'' is stated in the order. (See 5 CFR 838.1004(b).)
    2. Orders that award a portion of the ``present value'' of an 
annuity stated in the

[[Page 241]]

order will be interpreted as awarding ``a specific dollar amount.'' 
Unless the court specifically states otherwise, such an award payable 
from a monthly annuity benefit will be paid in equal installments at 50 
percent of the monthly annuity rate at the time of retirement or the 
date of the order, whichever comes later, until the specific dollar 
amount is reached.
    3. Orders that award a portion of the ``value'' of an annuity as of 
a specific date before retirement, without specifying what ``value'' is, 
will be interpreted as awarding a portion of the annuity equal to the 
monthly annuity rate at the time of retirement times a fraction, the 
numerator of which is the number of months of ``creditable service'' or 
service worked as of the date specified and the denominator of which is 
the total number of months as of the time of retirement of ``creditable 
service'' or service worked, whichever term is used in the court order. 
(See III. C. of these Guidelines.)
    4. Orders that contain general language awarding a specified portion 
of a Federal employee's ``retirement benefits'' as of a specified date 
before retirement, but do not specify whether OPM should use 
``creditable service'' or ``service worked'' as of the date specified to 
complete the computation, will be interpreted to award a portion of the 
annuity equal to the monthly annuity rate at the time of retirement 
times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of 
service worked as of the date specified and the denominator of which is 
the number of months of ``creditable service'' as of the time of 
retirement.
    D. Annuity as of a date before retirement. Orders that award a 
portion of an employee's annuity as of a specified date before the 
employee's retirement will be interpreted as awarding a portion of the 
annuity equal to the monthly annuity rate at the time of retirement 
times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of 
``creditable service'' or service worked as of the date specified and 
the denominator of which is the number of months of ``creditable 
service'' or service worked used in the retirement computation.
    E. Formulas or percentage instructions. Orders that contain both a 
formula or percentage instruction and a dollar amount will be 
interpreted as including the dollar amount only as the court's estimate 
of the initial amount of payment. The formula or percentage instruction 
will control.
    F. Computation limited to a particular period of employment. In 
order to limit the computation of benefits to a particular period of 
employment, the court order must use language expressly limiting the 
period of service to be included in the computation. General language 
such as ``benefits accrued as a result of employment with the U.S. 
Postal Service * * *'' will be interpreted to mean only that CSRS 
retirement benefits are subject to division (see V.A. of appendix A to 
subpart J of part 838). Such language will not be interpreted to limit 
the period of service included in the computation (i.e., service 
performed with other Government agencies will be included). To limit the 
period of service, the court order should specify the number of months 
to be included in the computation or should describe specifically the 
period of service to be included in the computation (e.g., ``only U.S. 
Postal Service'' or ``exclusive of any service other than U.S. Postal 
Service employment'' or ``only service performed during the period 
Petitioner and Defendant were married'' or ``benefits based on service 
performed through the date of divorce,'' etc.).
    G. Amounts less than $12 per year. Orders awarding a former spouse 
less than $12 per year are qualifying court orders. Such orders will be 
interpreted as an award of $1 per month.

                          II. Types of annuity

    A. Gross annuity will be interpreted as the amount of the annuity 
payable after any applicable survivor reduction but before any other 
deduction.
    B. 1. To divide an annuity before any applicable survivor reduction, 
the decree must contain language to the effect that the division is to 
be made on the self-only annuity, the life-rate annuity, or the annuity 
unreduced for survivor benefit, or equivalent language. A division of 
``gross annuity'' will not accomplish this purpose.
    2. To divide an annuity before the social security offset under 
section 8349 of title 5, United States Code, the order must expressly 
state that the division is to occur before the social security offset. 
The term ``unreduced annuity'' will mean annuity after the social 
security offset.
    C. Net annuity or disposable annuity will be interpreted to mean net 
annuity as defined in Sec. 838.1003.
    D. Orders that fail to state the type of annuity that they are 
dividing will be interpreted as dividing gross annuity (defined above).
    E. Orders dividing a ``retirement check'' will be interpreted as 
dividing net annuity (as defined in Sec. 838.1003).

                          III. Calculating time

    A. The smallest unit of time that will be used in computing a 
formula in a decree is a month.
    1. This policy is based on section 8332 of title 5, United States 
Code, that allows credit for service for years or twelfth parts thereof. 
Requests to calculate smaller units of time will not be honored.
    2. Time calculations by the Office of Personnel Management will be 
no more precise

[[Page 242]]

than years and twelfth parts, even where the court order directs OPM to 
make a more precise calculation. However, if the court order states a 
formula using a specified simple or decimal fraction other than twelfth 
parts, OPM will use the specified number to perform simple mathematical 
computations. For example, the share of a former spouse awarded a 
portion of the annuity equal to \1/2\ of the fraction whose numerator is 
12.863 years and whose denominator is the total service on which the 
annuity is based would be computed by taking \1/2\ of the quotient 
obtained by dividing 12.863 by the total service measured in years and 
twelfth parts.
    B. The term ``military service'' will generally be interpreted to 
include only periods of service within the definition of military 
service contained in section 8331(13) of title 5, United States Code, 
i.e., active duty military service. Civilian service with military 
organizations will not be included as ``military service,'' except where 
the exclusion of such civilian service would be manifestly contrary to 
the intent of the court order.
    C. 1. Unused sick leave is counted as ``creditable service'' on the 
date of separation for immediate retirement; it is not apportioned over 
the time when earned.
    2. When an order contains a formula for dividing annuity that 
requires a computation of service worked as of a date prior to 
separation and using terms such as ``years of service,'' ``total 
service,'' or similar terms, the time attributable to unused sick leave 
will not be included.
    3. When an order contains a formula for dividing annuity that 
requires a computation of ``creditable service'' (or some other phrase 
using ``credit'' or its equivalent) as of a date prior to retirement, 
unused sick leave will be included in the computation as follows--
    (i) If the amount of unused sick leave is specified, the order will 
be interpreted to award a portion of the annuity equal to the monthly 
annuity at retirement times a fraction, the numerator of which is the 
number of months of ``creditable service'' as of the date specified plus 
the number of months of unused sick leave specified and whose 
denominator is the months of ``creditable service'' used in the 
retirement computation.
    (ii) If the amount of unused sick leave is not specified, the order 
will be interpreted to award a portion of the annuity equal to the 
monthly rate at the time of retirement times a fraction, the numerator 
of which is the number of months of ``creditable service'' as of the 
date specified (no sick leave included) and whose denominator is the 
number of months of ``creditable service'' used in the retirement 
computation.

     IV. Distinguishing Between Divisions of Annuity and Refunds of 
                              Contributions

    A. Orders that are unclear about whether they are dividing an 
annuity or a refund of contributions will be interpreted as dividing an 
annuity.
    B. Orders using ``annuities,'' ``pensions,'' ``retirement 
benefits,'' or similar terms will be interpreted as dividing an annuity 
and whatever other employee benefits become payable, such as refunds. 
Orders using ``contributions,'' ``deductions,'' ``deposits,'' 
``retirement accounts,'' ``retirement fund,'' or similar terms will be 
interpreted as dividing the amount of contributions the employee has 
paid into the Civil Service Retirement Fund. Unless the court order 
specifically states otherwise, when an annuity is payable, such orders 
will be paid in equal monthly installments at 50 percent of the monthly 
annuity at the time of retirement or the date of the order, whichever 
comes later, until the specific dollar amount is reached.

                    V. Identifying Benefits Affected

    A. Orders that do not specify what pension or retirement benefits 
are to be divided will not be interpreted as dividing CSRS benefits. 
Terms such as ``CSRS,'' ``United States,'' ``OPM,'' ``Federal 
Government'' benefits, ``Postal Service retirement benefits,'' 
``retirement benefits payable based on service with the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture,'' or similar terms will be considered sufficient to 
identify civil service retirement benefits for division.
    B. Except as provided below, orders directed at other retirement 
systems will not be interpreted as affecting CSRS benefits.
    1. Orders that mistakenly label CSRS benefits as Federal Employees 
Retirement System (FERS) benefits, will be interpreted as dividing CSRS 
benefits and vice versa.
    2. Unless the order expressly provides otherwise, for employees 
transferring to FERS, orders directed at CSRS benefits will be 
interpreted as applying to the entire FERS basic benefit, including the 
CSRS component, if any.
    C. Orders directed at other Federal retirement systems such as 
military retired pay, Foreign Service retirement benefits and Central 
Intelligence Agency retirement benefits will not be interpreted as 
dividing CSRS benefits.
    D. Orders dividing military retired pay, even when military retired 
pay has been waived for inclusion in CSRS annuities, will not be 
interpreted as dividing CSRS benefits. (Such orders cannot be qualifying 
orders under section 838.1004(b), because the amount cannot be computed 
from the face of the order or from normal OPM files.)

               VI. State Law not Specified in Court Orders

    A. 1. Except as provided in Guideline VI.A.2., OPM will not 
research, interpret, or

[[Page 243]]

apply State law regarding community or marital property rights or 
divisions.
    2. OPM will not divide disability retirement benefits when such a 
division would be contrary to State law unless the order expressly 
directs division of ``disability'' benefits.
    B. Orders that do not specify the ``community property'' fraction or 
percentage of the former spouse's share will not be considered 
qualifying because the amount of the benefit cannot be computed from the 
face of the order or from normal OPM files (5 CFR 838.1004(b)).

 Appendix B to Subpart J of Part 838--Guidelines for Interpreting State 
    Court Orders Awarding Survivor Annuity Benefits to Former Spouses

                        United States of America

                     Office of Personnel Management

                     Retirement and Insurance Group

Guidelines for Interpreting State Court Orders Awarding Survivor Annuity 
                       Benefits to Former Spouses

    These guidelines explain the interpretation that the Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) will place on terms and phrases frequently 
used in awarding survivor benefits. These guidelines are intended not 
only for the use of OPM, but also for the legal community as a whole, 
with the hope that by informing attorneys, in advance, about the manner 
in which OPM will interpret terms written into court orders, the 
resulting orders will be more carefully drafted, using the proper 
language to accomplish the aims of the court.

                     I. Insurable Interest Annuities

    Two types of potential survivor annuities may be provided by 
retiring employees to cover former spouses. Section 8341(h) of title 5, 
United States Code, provides for ``former spouse annuities.'' Section 
8339(k) of title 5, United States Code, provides for ``insurable 
interest annuities.'' These are distinct benefits, each with its own 
advantages.
    A. OPM will enforce State court orders to provide section 8341(h) 
annuities. These annuities are less expensive and have fewer 
restrictions than insurable interest annuities but the former spouse's 
interest will automatically terminate upon remarriage before age 55. To 
provide a section 8341(h) annuity, the order must use terms such as 
``former spouse annuity,'' ``section 8341(h) annuity,'' or ``survivor 
annuity.''
    B. OPM will not enforce State court orders to provide ``insurable 
interest annuities'' under section 8339(k). These annuities may only be 
elected at the time of retirement by a retiring employee who is not 
retiring under the disability provision of the law and who is in good 
health. The retiree may also elect to cancel the insurable interest 
annuity to provide a survivor annuity for a spouse acquired after 
retirement. The parties might seek to provide this type of annuity 
interest if the non-employee spouse expects to remarry before age 55, if 
the employee expects to remarry a younger second spouse before 
retirement, or if another former spouse has already been awarded a 
section 8341(h) annuity. However, the State court will have to provide 
its own remedy if the employee is not eligible for or does not make the 
election. OPM will not enforce the order. Language including the words 
``insurable interest'' or referring to section 8339(k) will be 
interpreted as providing for this type of survivor benefit.
    C. In orders which contain internal contradictions about the type of 
annuity, such as ``insurable interest annuity under section 8341(h),'' 
the section reference will control.

             II. Orders Directed at Other Retirement Systems

    A. Except as provided in paragraphs A1 and A2, orders directed at 
other retirement systems will not be interpreted as affecting Civil 
Service Retirement System (CSRS) benefits.
    1. Orders that mistakenly label CSRS benefits as Federal Employee's 
Retirement System (FERS) benefits, will be interpreted as affecting CSRS 
benefits and vice versa.
    2. Unless the order expressly provides otherwise, for employees 
transferring to FERS, orders directed at CSRS benefits will be 
interpreted as applying to the entire FERS basic benefit, including the 
CSRS component, if any.
    B. Orders directed at other Federal retirement systems such as 
military retired pay, Foreign Service retirement benefits and Central 
Intelligence Agency retirement benefits will not be interpreted as 
awarding a former spouse annuity under CSRS. Thus, orders should contain 
language identifying the retirement system from which survivor benefits 
are being awarded. For example, orders should contain terms such as 
``CSRS,'' ``OPM,'' ``Federal Government employee survivor benefits,'' or 
``survivor benefits payable based on service with the U. S. Department 
of Agriculture,'' etc.
    C. Orders affecting military retired pay, even when military retired 
pay has been waived for inclusion in CSRS annuities, will not be 
interpreted as awarding a former spouse annuity under CSRS.

[[Page 244]]

       III. Specificity Required To Award a Former Spouse Annuity.

    A. Orders must contain language identifying the benefits affected. 
For example, ``CSRS,'' ``OPM,'' or ``Federal Government'' survivor 
benefits, or ``survivor benefits payable based on service with the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture,'' etc., will be considered sufficient 
identification.
    B. 1. Except as provided paragraphs B2 through B4, orders must 
specify the benefit being awarded. Orders must contain language such as 
``survivor annuity,'' ``death benefits,'' ``former spouse annuity under 
5 U.S.C. 8341(h)(1),'' etc.
    2. Orders that provide that the former spouse is to ``continue as'' 
or ``be named as'' the ``designated beneficiary'' of CSRS benefits will 
be interpreted to award a former spouse annuity.
    3. Orders that provide that the former spouse will ``continue to 
receive benefits after the death of'' the employee or ``that benefits 
will continue after the death of'' the employee, but do not use terms 
such as ``survivor annuity,'' ``death benefits,'' ``former spouse 
annuity,'' or similar terms will not be interpreted to award a former 
spouse annuity.
    4. Orders that give the former spouse the right to elect a former 
spouse annuity will be interpreted to award a former spouse annuity. The 
former spouse does not have an election opportunity. OPM will not accept 
an election by the former spouse to eliminate the court-awarded former 
spouse annuity.
    C. 1. Orders that unequivocally award survivor annuity and direct 
the former spouse to pay for that benefit are qualifying court orders. 
If the former spouse has also been awarded a portion of the retiree's 
benefits then the cost of the survivor benefit will be deducted from the 
former spouse's portion of the annuity (if sufficient to cover the total 
cost--there will be no partial withholding). Otherwise, the reduction 
will be taken from the retiree's annuity and collection from the former 
spouse will be a private matter between the parties.
    2. Orders that condition the award of survivor annuity on the former 
spouse's payment of the cost of the benefit are qualifying only if there 
is also an award of retirement benefits sufficient to cover the cost. 
Absent a sufficient award of employee retirement benefits to pay the 
cost of survivor benefits, the order is not qualifying.
    D. Orders providing that former spouses will keep the survivor 
annuity to which they were entitled at the time of the divorce will be 
interpreted to award a former spouse annuity in the same amount as they 
had at the time of divorce.
    E. Orders that fail to state the amount of the former spouse annuity 
will be interpreted as providing the maximum former spouse annuity.
    F. Orders awarding a former spouse annuity of less than $12 per year 
are qualifying court orders. Such orders will be interpreted to provide 
an initial rate of $1 per month plus all cost-of-living increases 
occurring after the date of the order. The reduction in the retiree's 
annuity will be computed as though the order provided a former spouse 
annuity of $1 per month.
    G. Orders that provide full survivor annuity benefits to a former 
spouse with the contingency that the employee or annuitant may elect a 
lesser benefit for the former spouse upon his or her remarriage will be 
interpreted to provide only a full survivor annuity benefit to the 
former spouse. In order to provide full survivor annuity benefits to a 
former spouse with the contingency that the employee or annuitant may 
provide a lesser survivor annuity benefit to the former spouse in order 
to provide survivor annuity benefits for a subsequent spouse, the order 
should allow a reduction in the former spouse benefit contingent upon 
the employee's or annuitant's election of survivor annuity benefits for 
a subsequent spouse. A reduction in the amount of survivor benefits 
provided to the former spouse will not be permitted if it is contingent 
upon the employee's or annuitant's remarriage rather than his or her 
election of survivor annuity benefits for a subsequent spouse. (See 5 
CFR 838.1004(b).)

          Offset under this part?
839.1102 How are my retirement benefits computed if I elect FERS under 
          this part?
839.1103 If my qualifying retirement coverage error started when I 
          should have been placed under FERS automatically, but my
 
          agency put me in CSRS because I had some past service, will I 
          get a CSRS component in my FERS annuity for the service before

must have lasted for at least 3 years of Federal service after December 
31, 1986, as stated in the definitions section (Sec. 839.102). It does 
not matter whether you have left Federal service, retired, or have been

coverage error. In addition, the survivor of an employee, separated 
employee, or retiree who had a qualifying retirement coverage error is 
also covered by these rules.
    (b) An error that lasted less than 3 years of Federal service after 
December 31, 1986, is not qualifying under the rules in this part.
    (c) For errors lasting less than 3 years that involve erroneous 
placement in FERS during a period that the employee was eligible to 
elect FERS, see Sec. 846.204(b) of this chapter for guidance.

                          Election Opportunity


<R05>
Sec. 839.211  If these rules apply to me because I had a qualifying 
retirement coverage error, can I choose which retirement plan I want to be in?

    The FERCCA does not provide an election opportunity in all 
situations where there was a qualifying retirement coverage error. Even 
if your error is one that provides an election opportunity under the 
FERCCA, certain events may disqualify you from making an election under 
the FERCCA. If you had a qualifying retirement coverage error, your 
eligibility to choose your retirement plan may be affected by the 
situations described in the next seven questions.


<R05>
Sec. 839.212  May I make a retirement coverage election if I received a
refund of my retirement deductions after I was corrected to FERS?

    If your qualifying retirement coverage error was previously 
corrected to FERS and you then received a refund of your FERS retirement 
deductions, you are not allowed to elect retirement plan coverage under 
the FERCCA.


<R05>
Sec. 839.213  May I make a retirement coverage election if I withdrew all
or part of my TSP account after I was corrected to FERS?

    (a) You may not make a retirement coverage election if your 
qualifying retirement coverage error was previously corrected to FERS, 
and you later received one of the following TSP withdrawals:

[[Page 251]]

    (1) A TSP annuity after separation from service, but before 
receiving a FERS annuity; or
    (2) A single payment or monthly payments after separation from 
service; or
    (3) An age-based in-service withdrawal.
    (b) If you received an automatic cashout of your TSP account after 
you separated (because your account balance was $3,500 or less), or if 
you received a financial hardship in-service withdrawal, you may make a 
retirement coverage election.


<R05>
Sec. 839.214  Am I disqualified from making an election of retirement coverage
under the FERCCA if I withdrew my TSP account after I retired under FERS?

    No, you may make an election of retirement coverage under the FERCCA 
if you made a TSP withdrawal as a retiree.


<R05>
Sec. 839.215  May I make a retirement coverage election under the FERCCA if I
received a payment as settlement of my claim for losses because of a qualifying 
          retirement coverage error?

    You can make a retirement coverage election under the FERCCA if OPM 
waives repayment of the entire amount under Sec. 839.1202. If OPM does 
not waive the entire repayment, you must pay back the amount that OPM 
did not waive.

                      Previous Election Opportunity


<R05>
Sec. 839.221  If my qualifying retirement coverage error was that I was
put into FERS by mistake and then, after the error was discovered, I chose my current 
          retirement coverage, can I now make another election?

    No, OPM regulations allow certain employees who were put in FERS in 
error to choose between remaining in FERS or being covered under their 
automatic retirement coverage. (See Sec. 846.204(b)(2) of this 
chapter). If you already had this opportunity to choose your retirement 
coverage; then you may not make an election of retirement coverage based 
on the same error under these rules.

                Court-Ordered Benefits for Former Spouses


<R05>
Sec. 839.231  Can I make an election if my former spouse is entitled to a 
portion of my retirement benefits by qualifying court order?

    Yes, but if you want to elect FERS you need your former spouse's 
consent to the election. If you are subject to a qualifying court order 
and want to elect FERS, the requirements in Sec. 846.722 of this 
chapter (Former Spouse's Consent to an Election of FERS Coverage) apply 
to you.


<R05>
Sec. 839.232  If a deceased employee's survivors include both a current
spouse and a former spouse, or spouses, who are eligible for survivor annuities, must 
          all of them consent to an election of FERS?

    If the employee dies before making an election of retirement 
coverage under the FERCCA, all eligible potential survivors, that is, 
both the current and any former spouses, must consent to an election of 
FERS coverage. If they do not all consent, the election cannot be made.

                                Elections


<R05>
Sec. 839.241  Am I eligible to make an election under the FERCCA if I had
a qualifying retirement coverage error and none of the conditions mentioned in Sec. 
          839.212 through Sec. 839.232 apply to me?

    If you were in CSRS or CSRS Offset and should have been in FERS or 
Social Security-Only, or if you were in FERS and should have been in 
CSRS, CSRS Offset, or Social Security-Only, then you have an election 
opportunity. This is summarized in the following chart:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
            You are or were in:                  And you belong in:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSRS or CSRS Offset.......................  FERS.
CSRS or CSRS Offset.......................  Social Security-Only.
FERS......................................  Social Security-Only.
FERS......................................  CSRS.
FERS......................................  CSRS Offset.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 839.242  Do these rules apply to me if I had multiple errors?

    You must be in the wrong retirement plan for at least 3 years of 
Federal service after December 31, 1986. You

[[Page 252]]

need not be in the same wrong retirement plan during the entire 3-year 
period. If you had more than one type of erroneous retirement coverage, 
then you will have a retirement plan election under these rules if one 
of the errors is of a type that qualifies you for an election.


<R04>
          Subpart C_Employer Responsibility to Notify Employees


<R05>
Sec. 839.301  What should I do if I am not sure whether I am or was in the wrong retirement plan?

    (a) If you are an employee, your employer has your personnel records 
and will review them to determine whether an error has been made. 
Therefore, you should notify your employer's human resources office if 
you believe an error has been made in your case. Notify your current 
employer even if you believe the error occurred while you were employed 
at another agency.
    (b) If you are not currently employed by the Federal Government, you 
should notify OPM at: U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Retirement 
Operations Center, Post Office Box 45, Boyers, Pennsylvania 16017. You 
can also contact us by electronic mail at FERCCA@OPM.GOV. Notify OPM 
regardless of whether you are a retiree, survivor, or separated 
employee.
    (c) You may also get additional information about the FERCCA and 
whether or not you qualify at: www.opm.gov/benefits/correction.


<R05>
Sec. 839.302  Will my employer give me a written explanation?

    (a) Your employer must provide you with written notice of the error. 
The notice must include an explanation of the error, your options 
regarding the error, and any time limits that apply.
    (b) Your employer must inform you if they find that you do not have 
a retirement coverage error.


<R05>
Sec. 839.303  Is my employer required to find employees with a retirement coverage error?

    The FERCCA requires your employer to take reasonable and appropriate 
measures to identify individuals affected by a qualifying retirement 
coverage error and notify them of their rights under the law.


<R05>
Sec. 839.304  What if my employer does not notify me?

    (a) If your error has not previously been corrected, the 6-month 
time limit on making an election of retirement coverage under the FERCCA 
(see Sec. 839.611(a)) does not begin to run until you are notified of 
the error.
    (b) If your error was previously corrected, the 18-month time limit 
on making an election of retirement coverage ends on September 19, 2002. 
Employers and OPM may extend the time limit if you were prevented from 
making a timely election due to a cause beyond your control (see Sec. 
839.612).

<R05>
Sec. 839.501  What can I elect if my employer moved me out of CSRS or CSRS Offset?

    If you were moved out of CSRS or CSRS Offset due to a qualifying

Sec. 839.511  What can I elect under the FERCCA if my employer put me into FERS
by mistake and then I was not allowed to remain in FERS when the error was 
          discovered?

    An employee who was erroneously placed in FERS during a time when 
the employee should have had an opportunity to elect FERS is allowed to 
keep the erroneous FERS coverage. If the employee was given an 
opportunity to remain in FERS, then the employee is disqualified from 
making an election of retirement coverage under the FERCCA (see Sec. 
839.221). If you were not allowed to remain in FERS and were placed in 
CSRS due to a qualifying retirement coverage error, you may elect FERS 
or remain in CSRS. If you were not allowed to remain in FERS and were 
placed in CSRS Offset due to a qualifying retirement coverage error, you 
may elect FERS or remain in CSRS Offset. If you were not allowed to 
remain in FERS and were placed in Social Security-Only due to a 
qualifying retirement coverage error, you may elect FERS or remain in 
Social Security-Only. This is summarized in the following chart:

<R05>
Sec. 839.601  How do I make an election?

    You may make your election using the form issued by OPM. If you are 
an employee, your employer will provide you with this form. If you are

<R05>
Sec. 839.602  What if I don't make an election?

    (a) If your qualifying retirement coverage error was not previously 
corrected and you fail to make an election within the time limit under

                                   Only.

    (b) If your qualifying retirement coverage error was previously 
corrected

[[Page 254]]

and you fail to make an election within the time limit under Sec. 
839.611(b), you are considered to have elected to remain in your current 
retirement plan.


<R05>
Sec. 839.603  Can I later change my election?

    Your election is irrevocable once your employer or OPM processes it. 
If you do not make a timely election, the resulting coverage (see Sec. 
839.602) is also irrevocable.


<R05>
Sec. 839.604  When is my election effective?

    Your election is effective on the date that the retirement coverage 
error first occurred. This means that your election will be retroactive, 
or will change your retirement coverage for a period of service in the 
past.

                               Time Limits


<R05>
Sec. 839.611  What are the time limits for making an election?

    (a) If your qualifying retirement coverage error was not previously 
corrected, you have 6 months from the date you receive notice of the 
error under Sec. 839.302 to make an election.
    (b) If your qualifying retirement coverage error was previously 
corrected, the time limit for making an election expires on September 
19, 2002.


<R05>
Sec. 839.612  Can I make a belated election?

    (a) If you are an employee, your employer can waive the time limit 
for making an election if you request such a waiver in writing. The 
employer would have to determine that you exercised due diligence, but 
could not make an election within the time limit because of 
circumstances beyond your control.
    (b) Your employer's decision not to waive the time limit under this 
section must be in writing and include notice of your right to request 
OPM to reconsider the decision.
    (c) OPM can waive the time limit for separated employees, retirees, 
and survivors who exercised due diligence but could not make an election 
because of circumstances beyond their control if a request is submitted 
to OPM, and OPM concludes that a waiver is justified.

                             FERS Elections


<R05>
Sec. 839.621  Can I cancel my FERS election if I was in the wrong retirement
plan at the time I elected FERS coverage and I have an election opportunity under 
          the FERCCA?

    If you were erroneously in CSRS, CSRS Offset, or Social Security-
Only at the time you elected FERS and you have an election opportunity 
under the FERCCA, you can choose whether you want the FERS election to 
remain in effect. However, you may not choose whether you want your FERS 
election to remain in effect if you chose FERS after your employer 
notified you that you were put in FERS by mistake (see Sec. 839.221).


<R05>
Sec. 839.622  Can I cancel my FERS election if my qualifying retirement
coverage error was previously corrected and I now have an election opportunity under 
          the FERCCA?

    Yes, your FERS coverage election does not disqualify you from making 
a retirement coverage election under the FERCCA. You can choose whether 
you want the FERS election to remain in effect. However, you may not 
choose whether you want your FERS election to remain in effect if you 
chose FERS after your employer notified you that you were put in FERS by 
mistake (see Sec. 839.221).


<R05>
Sec. 839.623  If I decide to keep the FERS election in effect, may I
change the effective date of the FERS election?

    No, If you decide to keep FERS, the original FERS election will 
remain unchanged.


<R04>
             Subpart G_Errors That Don't Permit an Election


<R05>
Sec. 839.701  Is it correct that even though I had a qualifying retirement
coverage error under the FERCCA, I may not have a choice of retirement coverage?

    Under the FERCCA, the types of retirement coverage errors listed in 
Sec. 839.241 trigger a right to make a retirement coverage election. 
The following chart summarizes the types of errors that do not trigger 
an election right:

[[Page 255]]



------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      Your coverage must
           You are in:            And you belong in:   be corrected to:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSRS Offset.....................  CSRS..............  CSRS.
CSRS............................  CSRS Offset.......  CSRS Offset.
Social Security-Only............  CSRS..............  CSRS.
Social Security-Only............  CSRS Offset.......  CSRS Offset.
Social Security-Only............  FERS..............  FERS.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 839.702  How do these rules apply to me if I don't have an election right
under the FERCCA, but I did have a qualifying retirement coverage error?

    After your retirement coverage is corrected to the proper plan, your 
retirement deductions will be adjusted in accordance with subpart H of 
this part and your Social Security taxes will be adjusted in accordance 
with subpart I of this part, if applicable. You may also file a claim 
for losses in accordance with subpart L of this part.


<R04>
       Subpart H_Adjusting Retirement Deductions and Contributions

                     Employee Retirement Deductions


<R05>
Sec. 839.801  Do I owe more money if I had a qualifying retirement coverage error 
and the employee retirement deductions for the new retirement plan are more 

          than what I already paid?

    (a) No, your employer is responsible for paying any additional 
amount to the Fund. Your employer will not bill you for any additional 
retirement deductions.
    (b) For qualifying retirement coverage errors corrected under this 
part, the rules at Sec. 831.111(b) of this chapter (pertaining to 
employee options when the employer fails to withhold CSRS or CSRS Offset 
retirement deductions) do not apply.


<R05>
Sec. 839.802  If I was in CSRS during my qualifying retirement coverage error, 
paid into the Fund more than I would have paid as a CSRS Offset, Social 

          Security-Only, or FERS employee, and end up retroactively in 
          
          one of those retirement plans, will I get a refund of the 
          
          
          excess I had withheld from my pay?

    CSRS Offset and FERS require employees to pay Social Security taxes 
in addition to retirement deductions. When you are retroactively changed 
under the FERCCA to CSRS Offset, FERS, or Social Security-Only, the 
deductions you paid in under CSRS will be used to pay both the amounts 
required for retirement deductions under CSRS Offset or FERS, as 
applicable to you, and also the Social Security taxes that you would 
have paid had you been in CSRS-Offset, FERS, or Social Security-Only.


<R05>
Sec. 839.803  If I am like the person in the previous question, but the amount
I paid as deductions under CSRS is more than the amount of combined retirement 
          deductions and Social Security taxes due for my new retirement 
          
          coverage, will I get a refund of the excess?

    Yes, either OPM or your employer, as appropriate, will issue the 
payment in accordance with OPM instructions.


<R05>
Sec. 839.804  If my qualifying retirement coverage error occurred while I was a reemployed 
annuitant, and I am later corrected retroactively to a different 

          retirement plan, will I have to pay any additional amount for 
          retirement deductions?

    (a) If you (as a reemployed annuitant) were erroneously in CSRS and 
had retirement deductions withheld from pay, and later are corrected to 
CSRS Offset or FERS coverage, the amount erroneously withheld under CSRS 
will be used to pay the retroactive CSRS Offset or FERS retirement 
deductions and Social Security taxes.
    (b) If you (as a reemployed annuitant) were erroneously placed in 
CSRS and elected not to have retirement deductions withheld from pay, 
and later are corrected to CSRS Offset or FERS, your share of 
retroactive Social Security taxes will be treated as an overpayment of 
salary. If you are corrected to CSRS Offset, you may elect to have 
retirement deductions withheld from future salary as a reemployed 
annuitant and may also make a deposit to cover the retirement deductions 
for past service as a reemployed annuitant in accordance with Sec. 
837.503(c) of this chapter. If you are corrected to FERS, your 
retirement deductions under

[[Page 256]]

FERS will be treated as an overpayment of salary.
    (c) If you (as a reemployed annuitant) were erroneously in CSRS 
Offset and had retirement deductions withheld from pay, and later are 
corrected to CSRS or FERS coverage, the amount erroneously withheld 
under CSRS Offset will be used to pay the retroactive CSRS or FERS 
retirement deductions. The employer is responsible for paying to the 
Fund any additional retirement deductions.
    (d) If you (as a reemployed annuitant) were erroneously placed in 
CSRS Offset and elected not to have retirement deductions withheld from 
pay, and later are corrected to CSRS, you may elect to have retirement 
deductions withheld from future salary as a reemployed annuitant and may 
also make a deposit to cover the retirement deductions for past service 
as a reemployed annuitant in accordance with Sec. 837.503(c) of this 
chapter. Your retirement deductions under CSRS will be treated as an 
overpayment of salary.
    (e) If you (as a reemployed annuitant) were erroneously placed in 
CSRS Offset and elected not to have retirement deductions withheld from

FERS will be treated as an overpayment of salary.
    (f) A reemployed annuitant erroneously placed in FERS and later 
corrected to CSRS or CSRS Offset is considered to have elected 
retirement deductions as a reemployed annuitant under the corrected 
coverage. The employer is responsible for paying to the Fund any 
additional retirement deductions under the corrected retirement 
coverage.
    (g) If you have a salary overpayment, your employer will inform you 
of your rights regarding the overpayment.

                    Employer Retirement Contributions


<R05>
Sec. 839.811  Does my employer owe more money if I had a qualifying retirement coverage 
error and the employer retirement contributions for my new retirement 

          plan are more than what was already paid?

    Yes, your employer must pay any additional retirement contributions 
to the Fund.


<R05>
Sec. 839.812  Will my employer get a refund if I had a qualifying retirement
coverage error and the employer retirement contributions for my new retirement 
          plan are less than what was already paid?
          

    No, if you were erroneously in CSRS, CSRS Offset, or Social 
Security-Only, then a correction of a retirement coverage error will not 
reduce the employer retirement contribution owed. Also, the FERCCA 
states that an employer may not remove from the Fund FERS employer 
contributions when correcting a qualifying retirement coverage error 
under this part.

                           Records Correction


<R05>
Sec. 839.821  Who is responsible for correcting my records?

    (a) Your current employer will correct your records in accordance 
with OPM instructions. Your employer must not delay correcting your 
records.
    (b) For former employees and retirees, the last employer will 
correct the records. For survivors, the employee's last employer will 
correct the records. If an employer no longer exists as an organization, 
and there is no successor agency, then OPM will correct the records.


<R05>
Sec. 839.822  Which employer is responsible for submitting the employee and employer retirement deductions and contributions and correcting my records if I had 
          different employers?

    Your current or most recent employer will be responsible for this 
purpose. Even if that employer was not involved in the retirement 
coverage error, it must issue corrected records for the entire period of 
the retirement coverage error.


<R04>
                     Subpart I_Social Security Taxes


<R05>
Sec. 839.901  When will my employer begin withholding Social Security taxes if I was erroneously in CSRS during my qualifying retirement coverage error and my 
          corrected coverage will now require me to pay Social Security 
          taxes?

    (a) If you are in CSRS by mistake and belong in CSRS Offset, FERS, 
or Social Security-Only, your employer must begin withholding Social 
Security taxes by changing your retirement coverage to CSRS Offset. Your 
employer must begin this withholding as soon as possible after the error 
is discovered.
    (b) Your employer will correct your retirement coverage back to the 
date the error first occurred once you are notified of the error and 
have an opportunity to make any elections that you are eligible to make.


<R05>
Sec. 839.902  Will my CSRS retirement deductions be used to pay the Social Security taxes for the period of the qualifying retirement coverage error if I was 
          erroneously placed in CSRS and did not pay Social Security 
          taxes?

    (a) If your qualifying retirement coverage error was not previously 
corrected, the amount erroneously withheld for CSRS retirement 
deductions will be:
    (1) Used to pay your new retirement deduction amount; and
    (2) Applied toward any Social Security taxes you owe for the time 
you were in the wrong retirement plan.
    (b) You will get Social Security credit for all the time you were 
erroneously covered by CSRS. Your employer will send the Social Security 
Administration a record of your earnings for all the years you should 
have had Social Security coverage.

[[Page 258]]


<R05>
Sec. 839.903  What happens to the Social Security taxes I erroneously paid when my employer corrects my retirement coverage to CSRS?

    (a) Except for the last 3 years, the money you erroneously paid into 
Social Security will remain to your credit in the Social Security fund. 
The Social Security Administration will include all but those last 3 
years in determining your eligibility for, and the amount of, future 
benefits.
    (b) The amount you paid into Social Security for the last 3 years 
will be used to help pay your CSRS retirement deductions.


<R04>
  Subpart J_Lost Earnings for Certain Make-up Contributions to the TSP


<R05>
Sec. 839.1001  Does the FERCCA allow me to increase my TSP account if I was in CSRS during my qualifying retirement coverage error and my correct coverage will 
          be FERS?

    The Board's error correction regulations (5 CFR 1605 of chapter VI) 
generally allow you to increase your TSP account through a schedule of 
make-up contributions to replace the missed employee contributions. In 
addition, the FERCCA allows certain employees who have completed a 
schedule of make-up contributions, or who plan to schedule make-up 
contributions, to receive lost earnings on those contributions under 
certain circumstances. Employees are (and have been) entitled to lost 
earnings on the make-up agency contributions they receive as a result of 
the correction of an agency error.


<R05>
Sec. 839.1002  Will OPM compute the lost earnings if my qualifying retirement coverage error was previously corrected and I made TSP make-up contributions?

    If you made contributions to the TSP after your qualifying 
retirement coverage error was previously corrected, OPM will compute the 
lost earnings on your make-up contributions to the TSP under the 
following circumstances:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                       And were
          You were in:                previously        And under these
                                     corrected to:     rules you elect:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSRS............................  FERS..............  FERS.
CSRS Offset.....................  FERS..............  ..................
Social Security-Only............  FERS..............  No election
                                                       required.
Social Security-Only............  CSRS..............  ..................
Social Security-Only............  CSRS Offset.......  ..................
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 839.1003  How will OPM compute the amount of lost earnings?

    (a) Lost earnings will generally be computed in accordance with the 
Board's lost earnings regulations (5 CFR 1606 of chapter VI). However, 
the FERCCA states that OPM may compute the lost earnings in an 
alternative manner if such a computation is not administratively 
feasible. The alternative manner will yield an amount that is as close 
as practicable to the amount computed under 5 CFR 1606 of chapter VI.
    (b) Your employer is required to submit to OPM all information 
required to compute the amount of lost earnings.


<R05>
Sec. 839.1004  Are lost earnings payable if I separated or if the employee died?

    (a) Yes. If the TSP account is not withdrawn, the lost earnings are 
paid to the account.
    (b) If there is no TSP account at the time the lost earnings are 
payable, you or your survivors will receive the payment directly.


<R04>
                      Subpart K_Effect of Election

                           General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 839.1101  How are my retirement benefits computed if I elect CSRS or CSRS Offset under this part?

    Unless otherwise stated in this part, your retirement benefit is 
computed as if you were properly put in CSRS or CSRS Offset on the 
effective date of the error. All the eligibility and benefit computation 
rules for CSRS or CSRS Offset apply to your retirement benefit.


<R05>
Sec. 839.1102  How are my retirement benefits computed if I elect FERS under this part?

    OPM will compute your retirement benefit as if you were properly put 
in

[[Page 259]]

FERS on the effective date of the error. All the eligibility and benefit 
computation rules for FERS apply to your retirement benefit.


<R05>
Sec. 839.1103  If my qualifying retirement coverage error started when I should have been placed under FERS automatically, but my agency put me in CSRS because 
 
         I had some past service, will I get a CSRS component in my
 
          FERS annuity for the service before the error if I elect FERS?

    No, employees who should have been automatically placed in FERS 
(generally because they did not have 5 years of past service under CSRS 
rules) do not have a CSRS component in their future FERS benefit. All 
service must be treated as FERS service in this circumstance.

                         Retirees and Survivors


<R05>
Sec. 839.1111  If I elect to change my retirement coverage under the FERCCA, can I change the election I originally made at retirement for survivor benefits?

    (a) Yes, if you elect to change your retirement coverage under the 
FERCCA, you will have an opportunity to change the election you made for 
survivor benefits.
    (b) If you elect less than the maximum survivor benefit, your 
spouse's consent is necessary in accordance with Sec. 831.614 or Sec. 
842.603(a)(1) of this chapter, as applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 839.1112  If I elect to change my retirement coverage under the FERCCA, can I retroactively revoke the waiver of military retired pay I made at 
          retirement?

    Yes, you may retroactively change your decision regarding waiver of 
your military retired pay.


<R05>
Sec. 839.1113  If I elect to change my retirement coverage under the FERCCA, can I change my decision about making a deposit or redeposit for civilian or 
          military service?

    Yes, you or your survivor will have a new opportunity to decide 
whether to pay any deposits or redeposits.


<R05>
Sec. 839.1114  Will OPM actuarially reduce my benefit if I elect to change my retirement coverage under these rules?

    Your annuity may be subject to three possible actuarial reductions 
under the FERCCA. These reductions may be required for an unpaid deposit 
(see Sec. 831.303(d) and Sec. 839.1116 of this chapter), for 
Government contributions in a TSP account (see Sec. 839.1118), or for a 
previous payment of the Basic Employee Death Benefit (see Sec. 
839.1121).


<R05>
Sec. 839.1115  What is an actuarial reduction?

    An actuarial reduction allows you to receive benefits without having 
to pay an amount due in a lump sum. OPM reduces your annuity in a way 
that, on average, allows the Fund to recover the amount of the missing 
lump sum over your lifetime. The actuarial reduction becomes a permanent 
reduction in your benefit. The amount of the reduction depends on your 
age and the amount of the lump sum you would otherwise have to pay at 
that time. To compute an actuarial reduction, OPM divides the lump sum 
amount by the present value factor for your age at retirement.


<R05>
Sec. 839.1116  If, because of the change in my retirement coverage, I will owe larger deposits for military and civilian service credit, will I have to pay the 
          additional deposit due or will OPM actuarially reduce my 
          annuity?

    You can choose to pay the additional deposit amount. If you choose 
not to pay the deposit, OPM will actuarially reduce your annuity, as 
explained in 831.303(d) of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 839.1117  If I elect to change my retirement coverage under the FERCCA, can I get a refund of the service credit deposit I made and receive the actuarial 
          reduction instead?

    No, the FERCCA allows OPM to reduce an annuity by an actuarial 
reduction only for the deposit amount that remains unpaid.

[[Page 260]]


<R05>
Sec. 839.1118  Will my annuity be actuarially reduced because I had Government contributions in my TSP account?

    Retirees and survivors of deceased employees who received a 
Government contribution to their TSP account after being corrected to 
FERS and who later elect CSRS Offset under the FERCCA are allowed to 
keep the Government contributions, and earnings on the Government 
contributions in the TSP account. Instead of adjusting the TSP account, 
the FERCCA requires that the CSRS-Offset annuity be reduced actuarially.


<R05>
Sec. 839.1119  How is the actuarial reduction for TSP computed?

    (a) The part of your TSP account on the date you retired that is 
Government contributions and earnings on those Government contributions 
forms the basis for the actuarial reduction. OPM will divide the 
Government contributions and earnings by the present value factor for 
your age (in full years) at the time you retired. OPM will then round 
the result to the next highest dollar amount, which will be the monthly 
actuarial reduction amount.
    (b) If a survivor annuity is the only benefit that is payable, the 
present value factor for the survivor's age at the time of death is 
used. The survivor benefit is not reduced for TSP if the retiree's rate 
was reduced.

                            Survivor Benefits


<R05>
Sec. 839.1121  What is the Actuarial Reduction for the Basic Employee Death Benefit (BEDB)?

    If you received a BEDB under FERS and you elect CSRS Offset under 
these rules, you do not have to pay back the BEDB. Instead, the FERCCA 
requires that OPM actuarially reduce your survivor annuity. The 
reduction will be the amount of the BEDB divided by the present value 
factor for your age at the time of the employee's death. The result is 
rounded to the next highest dollar amount and is the monthly actuarial 
reduction amount. If you elected to receive the BEDB in installments 
rather than a lump sum, the lump-sum amount is used for the purpose of 
computing the actuarial reduction.


<R05>
Sec. 839.1122  Does receipt of a one-time payment of retirement contributions as a death benefit prevent me from electing CSRS Offset?

    You may still elect CSRS Offset if otherwise eligible. OPM will 
collect the amount of the one-time death benefit from any survivor 
benefits that are payable.


<R04>
                 Subpart L_Discretionary Actions by OPM


<R05>
Sec. 839.1201  If I took legal action against my employer because of a qualifying retirement coverage error, can OPM reimburse me for expenses related to my 
          legal actions?

    (a) The FERCCA allows OPM, in its sole discretion, to reimburse you 
for necessary and reasonable expenses you actually incurred while 
pursuing a legal or administrative remedy of your qualifying retirement 
coverage error.
    (b) Necessary and reasonable expenses include actual amounts paid 
for attorney fees, court costs, expert witness fees, and other 
litigation expenses.
    (c) You may not receive reimbursement under this section if you 
received a monetary award that compensated you for your litigation 
expenses.
    (d) You must support your request for reimbursement with evidence 
that supports your claim.
    (e) In determining what is a necessary and reasonable expense, OPM 
will consider:
    (1) The type and amount of the expense;
    (2) The circumstances that gave rise to the expense; and
    (3) Whether the expense is directly related to litigation concerning 
a retirement coverage error.


<R05>
Sec. 839.1202  Can OPM waive repayment of a monetary award I received as resolution of the harm caused me by a qualifying retirement coverage error?

    (a) The FERCCA allows OPM, in its sole discretion, to waive 
repayment of all or part of a settlement payment or court-ordered 
payment if you can demonstrate that CSRS Offset coverage does not fully 
compensate you for your losses.

[[Page 261]]

    (b) Your request for waiver must state why you believe waiver of 
repayment is appropriate and include any evidence that supports your 
request.


<R05>
Sec. 839.1203  Can OPM compensate me for my losses if I did not take any legal action against my employer, but did incur some expenses because of a qualifying 
          retirement coverage error?

    (a) The FERCCA allows OPM, in its sole discretion, to compensate you 
for a monetary loss that is a direct and proximate result of your 
retirement coverage error.
    (b) Monetary losses include payments of additional Social Security 
taxes, payment of additional retirement deductions, and other out-of-
pocket expenses that you incurred because of a retirement coverage 
error.
    (c) You must substantiate your claim for losses with any evidence 
that supports your request.
    (d) OPM cannot pay you for:
    (1) Claimed losses related to forgone contributions and earnings 
under the TSP, other than lost earnings on make-up contributions to the 
TSP as provided in subpart J of this part; and
    (2) Claimed losses related to any other investment opportunities.


<R05>
Sec. 839.1204  On what basis will OPM review claims under this subpart?

    (a) OPM will base its decision on only the written record, including 
all of your submissions and other documentation in OPM's possession.
    (b) At OPM's discretion, OPM may request your employer to provide an 
administrative report. The report may include:
    (1) A description of the retirement coverage error;
    (2) A statement as to whether a settlement or other court-ordered 
award was made;
    (3) The employer's recommendation for resolution of the claim; and
    (4) Any other information your employer believes OPM should 
consider.
    (c) The burden of proof that the criteria for approving a 
reimbursement of expenses is on you.


<R05>
Sec. 839.1205  Does the Director of OPM review the claims?

    The Associate Director for Retirement and Insurance and his or her 
delegatees have the authority to perform the Director's actions, as set 
out in this subpart (see section 2208 of the FERCCA).


<R05>
Sec. 839.1206  How do I submit a claim under this subpart?

    (a) No specific form is required. Your request must be in writing

    (b) Send your claim to: Office of Personnel Management, Retirement 
and Insurance Service, ATTN: FC Section, Washington, DC 20415-3200


<R04>
                         Subpart M_Appeal Rights


<R05>
Sec. 839.1301  What if my employer determines my error is not subject to these rules?

    (a) Your employer must provide you with a written decision. The 
decision must include the reason for the decision, and notice of your 
right to appeal the decision to the MSPB.
    (b) If your employer determines that it cannot waive the time limit 
for making an election under Sec. 839.612, the decision must inform you 
of your right to ask OPM to review the decision. OPM will advise you in 
writing of your appeal rights following its review of your employer's 
decision.


<R05>
Sec. 839.1302  What types of decisions can I appeal?

    (a) You can appeal to the MSPB a decision that affects your rights 
and interests under this part, except an OPM decision under subpart L

category of employees or 500 employees in any of the special categories 
may appeal to the Board the normal cost percentage for that category as 
applied to that agency.
    (2) The Secretary of the Treasury or the Postmaster General may 
request the Board to reconsider a determination of the amount of any 
supplemental liability due from the Treasury of the United States or the 
United States Postal Service, respectively.
    (b) No appeal will be considered by the Board unless the agency 
files, no later than 6 months after the date of publication of the 
notice of normal cost percentages under Sec. 841.407, a petition for 
appeal that meets all the requirements of Sec. 841.410.
    (c) No request for reconsideration will be considered by the Board 
unless the Secretary of the Treasury or the Postmaster General files, no 
later than 6 months after the date of receipt of the notice of 
supplemental liability, a request for reconsideration supported by an 
actuarial report similar to the report described in Sec. 841.410(c).

[52 FR 25196, July 6, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 841.410  Contents of petition for appeal.

    (a) To file an appeal, an agency head must, before expiration of the 
time limit, file with OPM--
    (1) A letter of appeal;
    (2) An actuarial report; and
    (3) A certificate of eligibility (described in paragraph (d) of this 
section).
    (b)(1) The letter of appeal must be in writing and signed by the 
agency head. Delegation of signatory authority is not permitted.
    (2) The letter of appeal may contain any argument the agency wishes 
to make or may simply submit the actuarial report for consideration.
    (c) The actuarial report must contain a detailed actuarial analysis 
of the normal cost of FERS benefits as applied to the employees of that 
agency in the category of employees for which the agency is appealing 
the use of the Government-wide rate. The actuarial report must--
    (1) Be signed by an actuary;
    (2) Use the economic assumptions under Sec. 841.405; and
    (3) Specifically address and consider each of the demographic 
factors listed in Sec. 841.404. The appealing agency is responsible for 
developing data relating to the first nine demographic factors as they 
relate to the category of agency employees for which the appeal is being 
filed. Government-wide demographic factors (available from OPM) will be 
presumed to be sufficient and reliable for factors 10 through 13 unless 
the appealing agency is able to demonstrate, through sufficient and 
reliable data relating to its employees or former employees, the use of 
alternative factors is appropriate. The fourteenth factor, 
administrative expenses, will be supplied by OPM.

[[Page 272]]

    (d) The certificate of eligibility is a letter from the agency's 
director of personnel certifying that the agency has the requisite 1,000 
or 500 in the category of employees under consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 841.411  Appeals procedure.

    (a) A Government-wide normal cost percentage is presumed to apply to 
all agencies. Any agency appealing application of a Government-wide 
normal cost percentage to any category of employees in its workforce 
must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board that the normal cost 
percentage for that category of employees in that agency is 
significantly different from the Government-wide normal cost percentage.
    (b) While an agency has an appeal pending, the Government-wide 
normal cost percentage continues to apply to that agency.
    (c) The Board cannot consider an appeal unless all the documents 
required for a petition for appeal under Sec. 841.410(a) are filed 
before expiration of the time limit for an appeal.
    (d) The Board cannot sustain an appeal unless the Board finds that--
    (1) The data used in the agency's actuarial analysis are sufficient 
and reliable (As a general rule, at least 5 years of data pertaining to 
any group of employees must be analyzed before the results are 
considered sufficient and reliable.);
    (2) The assumptions used in the agency's actuarial analysis are 
justified;
    (3) When all relevant factors are considered together, there is a 
demonstrated difference between the normal cost for the group at issue 
in the appeal and the normal cost for the same group calculated on a 
Government-wide basis; and
    (4) The difference between the Government-wide normal cost 
percentage and the single agency rate would be at least 10 percent of 
the normal cost being appealed.


<R05>
Sec. 841.412  Rates determined by appeal.

    (a) If the Board finds that a different normal cost is warranted 
based on an agency appeal, it will establish a single agency rate for 
the category of employees in that agency.
    (b) The single agency rate will be effective at the beginning of the 
first pay period beginning 30 days after the date of the Board's 
decision.
    (c) A single agency rate may be higher or lower than the Government-
wide rate and will remain in force for not less than 3 years.
    (d) After a single agency rate has been in force for at least 3 
years, OPM may--
    (1) Require, no more often than annually, that the agency justify 
continuation of the rate; and/or
    (2) When it publishes a notice of normal cost percentages under 
Sec. 841.407, terminate the single agency rate.


<R05>
Sec. 841.413  Determinations of amount due from each agency.

    (a) For each pay period, each agency will determine the total amount 
of basic pay paid to employees in each category of employees.
    (b) For each category of employees, the amount due from each agency 
for a pay period is the product of--
    (1) The total amount of basic pay of employees in that category of 
employees in that agency; and
    (2) The normal cost percentage.

security.
    (c) Employee deductions will be at the rate in paragraph (a) or (b) 
of this section as if social security deductions were being made even if 
social security deductions have ceased because of the amount of earnings 
during the year, or are not made for any other reason.

<R05>
Sec. 841.504  Agency responsibilities.

    (a) Each employing agency is required to contribute the total amount 
of the normal cost percentage for each category of its employees, 
determined under Sec. 841.413 of this part, to the Fund.
    (b) Each employing agency must withhold the appropriate amount of 
employee deductions from the basic pay paid each covered employee for 
each pay period. No employee deduction is due if an employee receives no 
basic pay for a pay period.
    (c) An employing agency must record the appropriate amount of

each employee in the manner prescribed by OPM.
    (d) When an employee separates from Federal service or transfers to 
another agency, or transfers to a position in which he or she is not 
covered by FERS, the agency must close the employee's Individual 
Retirement Record (IRR) and forward it to OPM within the time standards 
prescribed by OPM. However, if an employee transfers to another position 
covered under FERS--
    (1) Within the same agency, and
    (2) To a position serviced by another payroll office, the agency 
may, in lieu of forwarding an IRR to OPM at the time of the intra-agency 
transfer, record the transfer for future IRR certification in an 
internal automated system of records.
    (e) An agency must maintain payroll systems and records in such 
manner as to permit accurate and timely reporting to OPM, in the manner 
prescribed by OPM.
    (f) An agency must report the employee deduction and agency 
contribution amounts for each pay period in the manner prescribed by 
OPM.
    (g) An agency must make such other reports of the normal cost, 
employee deductions and Government contributions amounts as are 
prescribed and in the manner prescribed by OPM.
    (h) An agency must remit in full the total amount of normal cost 
(which includes both employee deductions and Government contributions), 
so that payment is received by the Fund on the day of payment to the 
employee of the basic pay from which the employee deductions were made.
    (i) Upon the death of an employee whose tour of duty is less than 
full time, the employing agency must certify to OPM--
    (1) The number of hours that the employee was entitled to basic pay 
(whether in a duty or paid-leave status) in the 52-week work year 
immediately preceding the end of the last pay period in which the 
employee was in a pay status; and

[[Page 274]]

    (2) If the employee's tour of duty was part time (regularly 
scheduled), the number of hours of work in the employee's tour of duty.

<R05>
Sec. 841.505  Correction of error.

    (a) When it is determined that an agency has paid less than the 
correct total amount of the normal cost for any or all of its current or 
past employees, for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to, 
coverage decisions, correction of the percentage applicable or of the 
amount of basic pay, or additional payment of basic pay, the agency must 
pay the total additional amount payable under 5 U.S.C. 8423 and subpart 
D of the this part to the Fund.
    (b) The agency withholds the appropriate employee deduction from any 
payment of additional basic pay which is part of, or the result of, the 
corrective action.
    (c) The payment to the Fund described in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be made as soon as possible, but not later than provided 
by standards established by OPM, regardless of whether or when the 
portion which should have been deducted from employee basic pay is 
recovered by the agency.
    (d) Any portion of the payment to the Fund described in paragraph 
(a) of this section which should have been deducted, but was not, from 
employee basic pay constitutes an overpayment of pay, subject to 
collection by the agency from the employee, unless waived under 
applicable authority such as 5 U.S.C. 5584.
    (e) Corrections and the related agency payments and employee 
deductions will be reported to OPM in the manner prescribed by OPM.


<R05>
Sec. 841.506  Effect of part 772 of this chapter on FERS payments.

    (a) Agency notification to OPM. (1) When it is determined that a 
FERS employee is to be given interim relief under 5 U.S.C. 
7701(b)(2)(A), the employing agency must notify OPM of the effective 
date of the interim appointment under Sec. 772.102 of this chapter. The 
notice must specify that the appointment is required by the 
Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989.
    (2) When the MSPB initial decision cancelling the employee's 
separation becomes final, when the Board issues a final order cancelling 
the retiree's separation, or when the agency agrees to cancel the 
separation, the employing agency must notify OPM of the date the interim 
appointment ends and request the amount of the erroneous payment to be 
recovered under Sec. 550.805(e) of this chapter from any back pay 
adjustment to which the employee may be entitled.
    (b) Employee deductions and normal cost percentage. For the duration 
of the appointment, the agency will withhold the appropriate employee 
deduction and contribute the total amount of the normal cost percentage 
for the employee as prescribed by OPM. If and when a separation action 
is cancelled, the agency must make the corrections specified under Sec. 
841.507 of this subpart.

[57 FR 3714, Jan. 31, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 48273, Sept. 15, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 841.507  Correction of unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.

    (a) When an ``appropriate authority'' determines that there has been 
an ``unjustified or unwarranted personnel action'' as these terms are 
defined in subpart H of part 550 of this title, the employing agency 
will pay the Fund the amount of the normal cost percentage of the basic 
pay included in back pay. The normal cost percentage owed the Fund is 
computed on the amount of gross basic pay without regard to deductions 
described in Sec. 550.805(e) of this chapter for other amounts earned 
or erroneous payments received.
    (b) The agency will withhold the appropriate employee deductions 
from the amount of basic pay included in gross back pay giving due 
regard to deductions described in Sec. 550.805(e) of this chapter.
    (c) The payment to the Fund described in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be made within the time period established by OPM 
standards.
    (d)(1) Any FERS benefits--lump-sum payments or annuity benefits--
paid

[[Page 275]]

based on a separation that is later cancelled are considered erroneous 
payments that must be repaid to OPM. Agencies must deduct such payments 
from any back pay adjustment to which the employee may be entitled as 
required by 5 CFR 550.805(e).
    (2) Amounts recovered from back pay will not be subject to waiver 
consideration under 5 U.S.C. 8470(b). If there is no back pay, or the 
back pay is insufficient to recover the entire erroneous payment, the 
employee may request that OPM waive recovery of the uncollected portion 
of the overpayment. If waiver is not granted, the employee must repay 
the erroneous payment.

<R05>
Sec. 841.605  Interest included in the unexpended balance.

    (a) Interest on each Individual Retirement Record is computed 
separately.
    (b) For determining the amount of interest in the unexpended balance 
when none of the employee deductions have been returned (e.g., employee 
refunds or at the time of retirement), the amount of interest in the 
unexpended balance equals the sum of the amounts of interest applicable 
to each calendar year's deductions. The amount of interest on each 
calendar year's deductions equals the sum of--
    (1) For the calendar year in which the deductions were taken--
    (i) Except during the last year of service, the amount of the 
employee's deductions for that calendar year times the rate of interest 
set under Sec. 841.603 for that calendar year times the fraction whose 
numerator is the number of full months when deductions were withheld and 
whose denominator is 24;
    (ii) During the last year of service, the amount of the employee's 
deductions for that year times the rate of interest set under Sec. 
841.603 for that year times the fraction--
    (A) Whose numerator equals the sum of--
    (1) One half times the number of months (fractional months rounded 
up) of that year during which the employee was employed;
    (2) One for each full month of that year after the employee's 
service terminated; and
    (B) Whose denominator is 12.
    (2) For each calendar year after the year when the deductions were 
withheld but before the calendar year of the computation, the amount of 
the employee's deductions plus interest for prior years, times the rate 
of interest set under Sec. 841.603 for that year; and
    (3) For the year of the computation--
    (i) If it is not the same calendar year that the deductions were 
withheld, the amount of the employee's deductions plus interest for 
prior years, times the rate of interest set under Sec. 841.603 for that 
year times the fraction whose numerator is the number of full months 
that have been completed in the year of the computation and whose 
denominator is 12; or
    (ii) If it is the same calendar year that the deductions were 
withheld, the amount of the employee's deductions for that year times 
the rate of interest set under Sec. 841.603 for that year times the 
fraction--
    (A) Whose numerator equals the sum of--
    (1) One half times the number of months (fractional months rounded 
up) of that year during which the employee was employed;
    (2) One for each full month of that year after the employee's 
service terminated; and
    (B) Whose denominator is 12.
    (c)(1) For adding interest to the unexpended balance after 
retirement, the unexpended balance including interest computed under 
paragraph (b) of this section is computed as of the time of retirement.
    (2) Each month after retirement, the unexpended balance is reduced 
by the amount of annuity paid and interest is added to the remaining 
portion at the rate computed as follows:
    (i) Add one to the interest rate under Sec. 841.603 for the current 
year.
    (ii) Raise the sum produced under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this 
section to the \1/12\ power.
    (iii) Subtract one from the result of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this 
section to produce the interest rate for the month.
    (d)(1) Interest on payments of the unexpended balance will be paid 
for the month unless the payment has been authorized before the 5th 
workday before the end of the month (excluding the 31st day of 31-day 
months).
    (2) For the purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, payment is 
authorized when the person with authority to approve the claim approves 
payment.

[[Page 277]]


<R05>
Sec. 841.606  Interest on survivor reduction deposits.

    Interest on deposits under subpart F of part 842 of this chapter is 
compounded annually and accrued monthly.
    (a) The initial interest on each monthly difference between the 
reduced annuity rate and the annuity rate actually paid equals the 
amount of the monthly difference times the difference between--
    (1) One and six tenths raised to the power whose numerator is the 
number of months between the date when the monthly difference in annuity 
rates occurred and the date when the initial interest is computed and 
whose denominator is 12; and
    (2) One.
    (b) The total initial interest due is the sum of all of the initial 
interest on each monthly difference computed in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Additional interest on any uncollected balance will be 
compounded annually and accrued monthly. The additional interest due 
each month equals the remaining balance due times the difference 
between--
    (1) One and six tenths raised to the \1/12\ power; and
    (2) One.

survivor under Sec. 843.308 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 841.703  Increases on basic annuities and survivor annuities.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 841.704, 841.706, and 841.707, 
and paragraph (e) of this section, COLA's on basic annuities and 
survivor annuities are the greater of--
    (1) One dollar per month; or
    (2)(i) If the percentage change is less than 2 percent, the 
percentage change;
    (ii) If the percentage change is at least 2 percent and not greater 
than 3 percent, 2 percent; and
    (iii) If the percentage change exceeds 3 percent, 1 percentage point 
less than the percentage change.
    (b) After survivor annuities commence, they are subject to COLA's 
computed under paragraph (a) of this section, even if they are based on 
a basic employee annuity that includes a CSRS component.
    (c) COLA's apply to basic annuities (not to annuity supplements), 
survivor annuities, and survivor supplements.
    (d) COLA's do not apply for annuitants who are under age 62 as of 
the effective date, except--
    (1) Survivors;
    (2) Disability retirees (other than disability retirees whose 
benefits is based on 60% of high-3 average salary);
    (3) Retirees who retired under Sec. 842.208 of this chapter (the 
special provisions for law enforcement officers and firefighters);
    (4) Retirees who retired under Sec. 842.207 of this chapter (the 
special provision for air traffic controllers);
    (5) Retirees who retired under Sec. 842.210 of this chapter (the 
special provision for military reserve technicians who ceased satisfying 
the requirements of their position) due to a disability.
    (e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, 
COLA's are not payable to disability retirees during the first year.
    (2) COLA's are payable to disability retirees during the first year 
if the annuity rate payable is the retiree's earned benefit or the 
annuity is redetermined because the retiree has reached age 62.
    (3) After the first year, both the disability benefit and the social 
security offset (it any) are increased by COLA's. Disability retirees' 
earned benefits also increase with COLA's, even when earned benefits are 
not paid. After application of the COLA, the greater of the increased 40 
percent benefit offset by social security or the increased earned 
benefit is paid until the annuity is redetermined at age 62. After age 
62, the redetermined annuity is paid.
    (f) COLA's are payable to retirees and survivors whose annuities 
commence before the effective date.


<R05>
Sec. 841.704  Proration of COLA's.

    (a) The full amounts of COLA's are payable on annuities having a 
commencing date more than 11 months before the effective date.
    (b)(1) Prorated portions of COLA's are payable of annuities having a 
commencing date within 11 months before the effective date.
    (2) Proration is based on the number of months (with any portion of 
a month counting as a month) between the annuity commencing date and the 
effective date.
    (3) For survivors of deceased retirees, proration is determined by 
the date the annuity was first payable to the deceased retiree.

[[Page 279]]

    (4) Proration applied to the assume social security disability 
insurance benefit is based on the commencing date of the disability 
annuity, not the beginning of the social security disability benefit.


<R05>
Sec. 841.705  Increases on basic employee death benefits.

    (a) COLA's on the basic employee death benefit increase the $15,000 
component by the percentage change.
    (b) Recipients of the basic employee death benefit are entitled to 
COLA's if the employee or Member died on or after the effective date.


<R05>
Sec. 841.706  Increases on combined CSRS/FERS annuities.

    (a) COLA's on combined CSRS/FERS annuities are computed by 
increasing the CSRS component by the percentage change and the FERS 
component by the amount of COLA's under Sec. 841.703(a).
    (b) The initial monthly rate is computed by--
    (1) Applying CSRS rules to CSRS service to obtain the annual rate of 
the self-only annuity (as defined in Sec. 831.603 of this chapter) 
based on the CSRS service; then
    (2) Applying FERS rules to FERS service to obtain the annual rate of 
annuity determined under Sec. Sec. 842.403, 842.405, 842.406, or 
842.407 of this chapter based on the FERS service; then
    (3) Making any applicable FERS reductions for age and/or survivor 
benefits to the amounts computed under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of 
this section; then
    (4) Dividing the sum of the reduced amounts computed under paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section by 12; then
    (5) Dropping any cents.
    (c) The initial monthly CSRS component is computed by--
    (1) Applying CSRS rules to CSRS service to obtain the annual rate of 
the self-only annuity (as defined in Sec. 831.603 of this chapter) 
based on the CSRS service; then
    (2) Making any applicable FERS reductions for age and/or survivor 
benefits; then
    (3) Dividing the annual amount by 12; then
    (4) Dropping any cents.
    (d) The initial monthly FERS component is computed by subtracting 
the initial monthly CSRS component from the initial monthly rate.
    (e) A retiree who was covered under FERS for at least one month has 
a FERS component. If the amount of the FERS component as computed under 
paragraph (d) of this section is zero (because the CSRS component is 
equal to the monthly rate, leaving no balance for the FERS component), 
the FERS component is $1 per month. The retiree is due a full dollar 
increase on the FERS component with the next COLA. An employee with less 
than a month of FERS service has no FERS component and is not due any 
FERS COLA's.
    (f) COLA's are determined by applying the appropriate increase to 
each component and rounding to the next lower dollar (each component 
must increase by at least one dollar if a COLA applies to each 
component) before adding them together for the new monthly amount 
payable.


<R05>
Sec. 841.707  COLA's affecting computation of survivor supplements.

    For purposes of computing the assumed CSRS annuity under Sec. 
843.308 of this chapter, the assumed CSRS annuity includes COLA's 
computed under CSRS rules.


<R05>
Sec. 841.708  Special provisions affecting retired military reserve technicians.

    (a) Military reserve technicians who retire as a result of a medical 
disability are excepted from the bar against COLA increases for retirees 
under age 62.
    (b) Military reserve technicians have retired as a result of a 
medical disability if they retire under--
    (1) Section 8451(a)(1)(B) of title 5, United States Code (allowing 
retirement by military reserve technicians who are medically disabled 
for their positions); or
    (2) Section 8456 of title 5, United States Code (allowing retirement 
by military reserve technicians who are not disabled for their positions 
and who are not eligible under the special military technician 
discontinued service provisions (section 8414(c)) but who are medically 
disqualified for military

[[Page 280]]

service or the rank required to hold their positions).
    (c)(1) Military reserve technicians have not retired as a result of 
a medical disability if they retire under section 8414(c) of title 5, 
United States Code (allowing retirement by military reserve technicians 
who may not be disabled for their positions, but are medically or 
nonmedically disqualified for military service or the rank required to 
hold the position, and who are at least age 50 with 25 years of 
service), unless they provide OPM official documentation showing that 
their disqualification was for medical reasons.
    (2) When OPM receives no information about the reason for the 
disqualification of a military reserve technician retiring under section 
8414(c) of title 5, United States Code, OPM will process the case 
assuming that the disqualification was for nonmedical reasons. OPM will 
inform these retirees that they will not receive COLA's until they reach 
age 62 unless they provide an official certification from the military 
showing that their disqualification was for medical reasons.

<R05>
Sec. 841.1001  Purpose.

    This subpart regulates state income tax withholding from payments of 
basic benefits under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS).


<R05>
Sec. 841.1002  Definitions.

    For the purpose of this subchapter:
    Agreement means the Federal-State agreement contained in this 
subpart.
    Annuitant means an employee or Member retired, or a spouse, widow, 
or widower receiving survivor benefits, under chapter 84 of title 5,

Code.
    Income tax and State income tax mean any form of tax for which, 
under a State statute, (a) collection is provided, either in imposing on 
employers generally the duty of withholding sums from the compensation 
of employees and making returns of such sums to the State or by granting 
to employers generally the authority to withhold sums from the 
compensation of employees, if any employee voluntarily elects to have 
such sums withheld; and (b) the duty to withhold generally is imposed, 
or the authority to withhold generally is granted, with respect to the 
compensation of employees who are residents of the State.
    Net recurring payment means the amount of annuity or survivors 
benefits (not recurring interim payments made while a claim is pending 
adjudication) payable to the annuitant on a monthly basis less the 
amounts currently being deducted for health benefits, Medicare, life 
insurance, Federal income tax, overpayment of annuity, indebtedness to 
the Government, voluntary allotments, waivers, or being paid to a third 
party or a court officer in compliance with a court order or decree.
    Net withholding means the amount of State income tax deductions

to which payment is to be made, which is signed by the annuitant or, in 
the case of incompetence, his or her representative payee.
    State means a State, the District of Columbia, or any territory or

<R05>
Sec. 841.1003  Federal-State agreements.

    OPM will enter into an agreement with any State within 120 days of 
an application for agreement from the proper State official. The terms 
of the standard agreement will be Sec. Sec. 841.1004 through 841.1007 
of this subpart. OPM and the State may agree to additional terms and 
provisions, insofar as those additional terms and provisions do not 
contradict or otherwise limit the terms of the standard agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 841.1004  OPM responsibilities.

    OPM will, in performance of this agreement:
    (a) Process the magnetic tape containing State tax transactions 
against

[[Page 282]]

the annuity roll once a month at the time monthly recurring payments are 
prepared for the United States Treasury Department. Errors that are 
identified will not be processed into the file, and will be identified 
and returned to the State for resolution via the monthly error report. 
Collections of State income tax will continue in effect until the State 
requesting the initial action supplies either a valid revocation or 
change. The magnetic tape must be received 35 days prior to the date of 
the check in which the transactions are to be effective. For example, 
withholding transactions for the July 1 check must be received 5 days 
prior to June 1. If the magnetic tape submitted by the State cannot be 
read, OPM will notify the State of this fact, and if a satisfactory 
replacement can be supplied in time for monthly processing, it will be 
processed.
    (b) Deduct from the regular, recurring annuity payments of an 
annuitant the amount he or she has so requested to be withheld, provided 
that:
    (1) The amount of the request is an even dollar amount, not less 
than Five Dollars nor more than the net recurring amount. The State may 
set any even dollar amount above Five Dollars as a minimum withholding 
amount.
    (2) The annuitant has not designated more than one other State for 
withholding purposes within the calendar year. The State can set any 
limit on the number of changes an annuitant may make in the amount to be 
withheld.
    (c) Retain the amounts withheld in the Fund until payment is due.
    (d) Pay the net withholding to the State on the last day of the 
first month following each calendar quarter.
    (e) Make the following reports:
    (1) A monthly report which will include all the State tax 
withholdings, cancellations and adjustments for the month, and also each 
request OPM was not able to process, with an explanation, in coded 
format, of the reason for rejection.
    (2) A quarterly report which will include State, State address, 
quarterly withholdings, quarterly cancellations and adjustments, 
quarterly net withholdings and year-to-date amounts. Where cancelled or 
adjusted payments were made in a previous year, OPM shall append a 
listing of the cancelled or adjusted payments which shows the date and 
amount of each cancelled or adjusted tax withholding, and the name and 
Social Security identification number of the annuitant from whom it was 
withheld. If either party terminates the agreement and the amount of 
cancelled or adjusted deductions exceeds the amount withheld for the 
final quarter, then the quarterly report shall show the amount to be 
refunded to OPM and the address to which payment should be made.
    (3) An annual summary report which contains the name, Social 
Security identification number, and total amount withheld from non-
cancelled payments during the previous calendar year, for each annuitant 
who requested tax withholding payable to the State. In the event the 
annuitant had State income tax withholding in effect for more than one 
State in that calendar year, the report will show only the amount 
withheld for the State receiving the report.
    (4) An annual report to each annuitant for whom State income taxes 
were withheld giving the amount of withholding paid to the State during 
the calendar year.


<R05>
Sec. 841.1005  State responsibilities.

    The State will, in performance of this agreement:
    (a) Accept requests and revocations from annuitants who have 
designated that State income tax deductions will go to the State.
    (b) Convert these requests on a monthly basis to a machine-readable 
magnetic tape using specifications received from OPM, and forward that 
tape to OPM for processing.
    (c) Inform annuitants whose tax requests are rejected by OPM that 
the request was so rejected and of the reason why it was so rejected.
    (d) Recognize that, to the extent not prohibited by State laws, 
records maintained by the State relating to this program are considered 
jointly maintained by OPM and are subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 
U.S.C. 552a). Accordingly, the States will maintain such records in 
accordance with that

[[Page 283]]

statute and OPM's implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 297.
    (e) Respond to requests of annuitants for information and advice in 
regard to State income tax withholding.
    (f) Credit the amounts withheld from FERS annuities to the State tax 
liability of the respective annuitants, and, subject to applicable 
provisions of State law to the contrary, refund any balance over and 
above that liability to the annuitant, unless he or she should request 
otherwise.
    (g) Surrender all tax withholding requests to OPM when this 
agreement is terminated or when the documents are not otherwise needed 
for this State tax withholding program.
    (h) Allow OPM, the Comptroller General or any of their duly 
authorized representatives access to, and the right to examine, all 
records, books, papers or documents related to the processing of 
requests for State income tax withholding from FERS annuities.


<R05>
Sec. 841.1006  Additional provisions.

    These additional provisions are also binding on the State and OPM:
    (a) A request or revocation is effective when processed by OPM. OPM 
will process each request by the first day of the second month following 
the month in which it is received, but incurs no liability or 
indebtedness by its failure to do so.
    (b) Any amount deducted from an annuity payment and paid to the 
State as a result of a request is deemed properly paid, unless the 
annuity payment itself is cancelled.
    (c) OPM will provide the State with the information necessary to 
properly process a request for State income tax withholding.
    (d) If the State is paid withholding which is contrary to the terms 
of the annuitant's request, the State is liable to the annuitant for the 
amount improperly withheld, and subject to account verification from 
OPM, agrees to pay that amount to the annuitant on demand.
    (e) In the case of a dispute amount in any of the reports described 
and authorized by this agreement, the Associate Director will issue an 
accounting. If the State finds this accounting unacceptable, it may then 
and only then pursue such remedies as are otherwise available.
    (f) If a State received an overpayment of monies properly belonging 
to the Fund, OPM will offset the overpayment from a future payment due 
the State. If there are no further payments due the State, OPM will 
inform the State in writing of the amount due. Within 60 days of the 
date of receipt of that communication that State will make payment of 
the amount due.


<R05>
Sec. 841.1007  Agreement modification and termination.

    This agreement may be modified or terminated in the following 
manner:
    (a) Either party may suggest a modification of non-regulatory 
provisions of the agreement in writing to the other party. The other 
party must accept or reject the modification within 60 calendar days of 
the date of the suggestion.
    (b) The agreement may be terminated by either party on 60 calendar 
days written notice.
    (c) OPM may modify this agreement unilaterally through the rule 
making process described in sections 553, 1103, and 1105 of title 5, 
United States Code.

    (a) A specific designee is defined as a senior official within an

of the agency. Examples include a Chief Human Capital Officer, an 
Assistant Secretary for Administration, a Director of Human Resources 
Management, or other official.
    (b) An agency's request for voluntary early retirement authority 
must be signed by the head of the agency or by a specific designee.
    (c) The request must contain the following information:
    (1) Identification of the agency or specified component(s) for which 
the authority is being requested;
    (2) Reasons why the agency needs voluntary early retirement 
authority. This must include a detailed summary of the agency's 
personnel and/or budgetary situation that will result in an excess of 
personnel because of a substantial delayering, reorganization, reduction 
in force, transfer of function, or other workforce restructuring or 
reshaping, consistent with agency human capital goals;
    (3) The date on which the agency expects to effect the substantial 
delayering, reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of function, or 
other workforce restructuring or reshaping;
    (4) The time period during which the agency plans to offer voluntary 
early retirement;
    (5) The total number of non-temporary employees in the agency (or 
specified component(s));
    (6) The total number of non-temporary employees in the agency (or 
specified component(s)) who may be involuntarily separated, downgraded, 
transferred, or reassigned as a result of the substantial delayering, 
reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of function, or other 
workforce restructuring or reshaping;
    (7) The total number of employees in the agency (or specified 
component(s)) who are eligible for voluntary early retirement;
    (8) An estimate of the total number of employees in the agency (or 
specified component(s)) who are expected to retire early during the 
period covered by the request for voluntary early retirement authority; 
and
    (9) A description of the types of personnel actions anticipated as a 
result of the agency's need for voluntary early retirement authority. 
Examples include separations, transfers, reassignments, and 
downgradings.
    (d) OPM will evaluate a request for voluntary early retirement based 
on:
    (1) A specific request to OPM from the agency for voluntary early 
retirement authority;
    (2) A voluntary separation incentive payment implementation plan, as 
discussed in part 576, subpart A, of this

[[Page 293]]

chapter, which must outline the intended use of the incentive payments 
and voluntary early retirement; or
    (3) The agency's human capital plan, which must outline its intended 
use of voluntary separation incentive payments and voluntary early 
retirement authority, and the changes in organizational structure it 
expects to make as the result of projected separations and early 
retirements.
    (e) Regardless of the method used, the request must include all of 
the information required by paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) OPM may approve an agency's request for voluntary early 
retirement authority to cover the entire period of the substantial 
delayering, reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of function, or 
other workforce restructuring or reshaping described by the agency, or 
the initial portion of that period with a requirement for subsequent 
information and justification if the period covers multiple years.
    (g) After OPM approves an agency's request, the agency must 
immediately notify OPM of any subsequent changes in the conditions that 
served as the basis for the approval of the voluntary early retirement 
authority. Depending upon the circumstances involved, OPM will modify 
the authority as necessary to better suit the agency's needs.
    (h) The agency may further limit voluntary early retirement offers 
based on:
    (1) An established opening and closing date for the acceptance of 
applications that is announced to employees at the time of the offer; or
    (2) The acceptance of a specified number of applications for 
voluntary early retirement, provided that, at the time of the offer, the 
agency notified employees that it retained the right to limit the number 
of voluntary early retirements.
    (i) Within the timeframe specified for its approved voluntary early 
retirement authority, the agency may subsequently establish a new or 
revised closing date, or reduce or increase the number of early 
retirement applications it will accept, if management's downsizing and/
or reshaping needs change. If the agency issues a revised closing date, 
or a revised number of applications to be accepted, the new date or 
number of applications must be announced to the same group of employees 
included in the original announcement. If the agency issues a new window 
period with a new closing date, or a new instance of a specific number 
of applications to be accepted, the new window period or number of 
applications to be accepted may be announced to a different group of 
employees as long as they are covered by the approved voluntary early 
retirement authority.
    (j) Chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, requires that 
agencies treat employees on military duty, for all practical purposes, 
as though they were still on the job. Further, employees are not to be 
disadvantaged because of their military service. In accordance with 
these provisions, employees on military duty who would otherwise be 
eligible for an offer of voluntary early retirement will have 30 days 
following their return to duty to either accept or reject an offer of 
voluntary early retirement. This will be true even if the voluntary 
early retirement authority provided by OPM has expired.
    (k) An employee who separates from the service voluntarily after 
completing 25 years of service, or becoming age 50 and completing 20 
years of service, is entitled to an annuity if, on the date of 
separation, the employee:
    (1) Is serving in a position covered by a voluntary early retirement 
offer; and
    (2) Meets the following conditions which are covered in 5 U.S.C. 
8414(b)(1)(B):
    (i) Has been employed continuously, by the agency in which the 
employee is serving, for at least the 31-day period ending on the date

842.213(b);
    (ii) Is serving under an appointment that is not time limited;
    (iii) Has not been duly notified that such employee is to be 
involuntarily separated for misconduct or unacceptable performance;
    (iv) Is separated from the service voluntarily during a period in 
which, as determined by the Office of Personnel Management (upon request 
of the agency) under regulations prescribed by the Office:

[[Page 294]]

    (A) Such agency (or, if applicable, the component in which the 
employee is serving) is undergoing substantial delayering, substantial 
reorganization, substantial reductions in force, substantial transfer of 
function, or other substantial workforce restructuring (or shaping);
    (B) A significant percentage of employees serving in such agency (or 
component) are likely to be separated or subject to an immediate 
reduction in the rate of basic pay (without regard to subchapter VI of 
chapter 53, or comparable provisions); or
    (C) Identified as being in positions which are becoming surplus or 
excess to the agency's future ability to carry out its mission 
effectively; and
    (v) As determined by the agency under regulations prescribed by the 
Office, is within the scope of the offer of voluntary early retirement, 
which may be made based on the following criteria:
    (A) 1 or more organizational units;
    (B) 1 or more occupational series or levels;
    (C) 1 or more geographical locations;
    (D) Specific periods;
    (E) Skills, knowledge, or other factors related to a position; or
    (F) Any appropriate combination of such factors.
    (l) Agencies are responsible for ensuring that employees are not 
coerced into voluntary early retirement. If an agency finds any 
instances of coercion, it must take appropriate corrective action.
    (m) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, an agency 
may not offer or process voluntary early retirements beyond the stated 
expiration date of a voluntary early retirement authority or offer early 
retirements to employees who are not within the scope of the voluntary 
early retirement authority approved by OPM.
    (n) OPM may terminate a voluntary early retirement authority if it 
determines that the condition(s) that formed the basis for the approval 
of the authority no longer exist.
    (o) OPM may amend, limit, or terminate a voluntary early retirement 
authority to ensure that the requirements of this subpart are properly 
being followed.
    (p) Agencies must provide OPM with interim and final reports for 
each voluntary early retirement authority, as covered in OPM's approval 
letter to the agency. OPM may suspend or cancel a voluntary early 
retirement authority if the agency is not in compliance with the 
reporting requirements or reporting schedule specified in OPM's 
voluntary early retirement authority approval letter.

Sec. 842.305  Deposits for civilian service.

    (a) Eligibility--current and former employees or Members. An 
employee or Member subject to FERS and a former employee or Member who 
is entitled to an annuity may make a deposit for civilian service 
described under paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of Sec. 842.304 upon 
application to OPM in a form prescribed by OPM. A deposit for civilian 
service cannot be made later than 30 days after the first regular 
monthly payment as defined in Sec. 842.602.
    (b) Eligibility--survivors. If an employee or Member was, at the 
time of death, eligible to make a deposit, the employee's survivor may 
make the deposit for civilian service. A deposit under this paragraph 
cannot be made after adjudication of the survivor's application for 
benefits becomes final, which is 30 days after the date of OPM's notice 
to the survivor of the annuity rates with and without making the 
deposit.
    (c) Distinct period of service. A deposit is not considered to have 
been made for any distinct period of service unless the total amount due 
for the period is paid in full. A distinct period of civilian service 
for this purpose is a period of civilian service that is not interrupted 
by a break in service of more than 3 days.
    (d) Amount of deposits. The amount of a deposit for a period of 
service under

[[Page 298]]

Sec. 842.304(a)(2) equals 1.3 percent of the basic pay for the service, 
plus interest. The amount of a deposit for a period of service under 
Sec. 842.304(a)(3) equals the amount that would have been deducted from 
pay under 5 U.S.C. 8422(a) had the employee been subject to FERS during 
the service, plus interest.
    (e) Interest. (1) Interest is charged at the rate of 4 percent a 
year through December 31, 1947; 3 percent a year beginning January 1, 
1948, through December 31, 1984; and thereafter at a rate as determined 
by the Secretary of the Treasury for each calendar year that equals the 
overall average yield to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability 
Fund (the Fund) during the preceding fiscal year from all obligations 
purchased by the Secretary during such fiscal year under 5 U.S.C. 8348 
(c), (d), and (e).
    (2) The computation of interest is on the basis of 30 days to the 
month. Interest is computed for the actual calendar time involved in 
each case; but, whenever applicable, the rule of average applies.
    (3) Interest is computed from the midpoint of each service period 
included in the computation. The interest accrues annually on the 
outstanding portion, and is compounded annually, until the portion is 
deposited. Interest is not charged after the commencing date of annuity 
or for a period of separation from the service that began before October 
1, 1956.
    (f) Forms of deposit. Deposits may be made in a single lump sum or 
in installments not smaller than $50 each.
    (g) Cadet Nurse Corps. (1) Upon receiving an application for service 
credit with the Cadet Nurse Corps, OPM will determine whether all the 
conditions for creditability (Sec. 842.304(b)) have been met; compute 
the deposit, including interest; and advise the employing agency and the 
employee of the total amount of the deposit due. The rate of basic pay 
for this purpose is deemed to be $15 per month for the first 9 months of 
study; $20 per month for the 10th through the 21st months of study; and 
$30 per month for any month in excess of 21 months. Interest is computed 
in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) The employing agency must establish a deposit account showing 
the total amount due and a payment schedule (unless deposit is made in 
one lump sum) to record the date and amount of each payment.
    (3) If the individual cannot make payment in one lump sum, the 
employing agency must accept installment payments (by allotments or 
otherwise). The employing agency, however, is not required to accept 
individual checks in amounts less than $50.
    (4) Payments received by the employing agency must be remitted to 
OPM immediately for deposit to the Civil Service Retirement and 
Disability Fund.
    (5) Once the employee's deposit has been paid in full or closed out, 
the employing agency must submit the documentation pertaining to the 
deposit to OPM in accordance with instructions issued by OPM.
    (h) Processing applications for pre-1969 National Guard technician 
service credit for employees subject to FERS retirement deductions after 
November 5, 1990--(1) OPM determines creditable service. OPM will 
determine whether all conditions for crediting the additional service 
have been met, compute the deposit, and notify the employee of the 
amount of and the procedures for submitting the deposit payments to OPM 
to obtain credit for the service.
    (2) Computing the deposit. (i) For individuals who will not have a 
CSRS component, the deposit will be computed based on--
    (A) One and three tenths percent of basic pay at the time the 
service was performed; and
    (B) Interest at the rate of 3 percent per year computed as specified 
by section 8334(e)(2) of title 5, United States Code, until the date the 
deposit is paid.
    (ii) For individuals who will have a CSRS component, the deposit 
will be computed as specified in 5 CFR 831.306(c).
    (i) Processing applications for pre-1969 National Guard technician 
service credit for annuitants (and survivors) and for former employees 
who separated after December 31, 1968, and before November 6, 1990--(1) 
OPM determines creditable service. OPM will determine whether all 
conditions for crediting the additional

[[Page 299]]

service have been met, compute the amount of the deposit, and notify the 
individual.
    (2) Computing the deposit for annuitants and survivors. (i) For 
individuals who do not have a CSRS component, the deposit will be 
computed based on--
    (A) One and three tenths percent of basic pay at the time the 
service was performed; and
    (B) Interest at the rate of 3 percent per year as specified by 
section 8334(e)(2) of title 5, United States Code, to the midpoint of 
the 24-month installment period, or if paid in a lump sum, the date the 
deposit is paid.
    (ii) For individuals who will have a CSRS component, the deposit 
will be computed as specified in 5 CFR 831.306(e)(2)(i) and (ii)(A).
    (iii)(A) OPM will notify annuitants and survivors of the amount of 
the deposit and give them a proposed installment schedule for paying the 
deposit from monthly annuity payments. The proposed installment payments 
will consist of equal monthly payments that will not exceed a period 24 
months from the date a complete written application is received by OPM.
    (B) The annuitant or survivor may allow the deposit installments to 
be deducted from his or her annuity as proposed or make payment in a 
lump sum within 30 days from the date of the notice.
    (C) Increased annuity payments will begin to accrue the first day of 
the month after OPM receives the complete written application.
    (iv) If an annuitant dies before completing the deposit installment 
payments, the remaining installments will be deducted as established for 
the annuitant from benefits payable to the survivor annuitant (but not 
if the only survivor benefit is payable to a child or children of the 
deceased), if any. If no survivor annuity is payable, OPM may collect 
the balance of the deposit from any lump sum benefits payable or from 
the decedent's estate, if any.
    (3) Computing the deposit for former Federal employees separated 
after December 31, 1968 but before November 6, 1990. For former 
employees with title to a deferred annuity that commences after November 
6, 1990, the deposit will be computed as provided in paragraph (i)(2) 
above, except that interest will be computed through the commencing date 
of annuity or the date the deposit is paid, whichever comes first.
    (j) Certain Government service performed abroad after December 31, 
1988, and before May 24, 1998--(1) Eligibility-current and former 
employees, and retirees. A current or former employee, or a retiree who 
performed certain Government service abroad described in Sec. 
842.304(e) may make a deposit for such service, in a form prescribed by 
OPM.
    (2) Eligibility-survivors. A survivor of a current employee, former 
employee, or a retiree eligible to make a deposit under paragraph (j)(1) 
of this section may make a deposit under this section if the current or 
former employee, or retiree is deceased and the survivor is eligible or 
would be eligible for a survivor annuity under FERS based on the service 
of the current or former employee, or retiree.
    (3) Filing of deposit application. An individual eligible to make a 
deposit under paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section for service 
described in Sec. 842.304(e) must submit a written application to make 
a deposit for such service with the appropriate office in the department 
or agency where such service was performed. If the department or agency 
where the service was performed no longer exists, the individual must 
submit the written application to the appropriate office in the 
Department of State.
    (4) Time limit for filing application. An application to make a 
deposit under this section must be submitted on or before August 29, 
2008.
    (5) Amount of deposit. (i) A deposit under this section must be 
computed using distinct periods of service. For the purpose of this 
section, a distinct period of service means a period of service not 
interrupted by a break in service of more than 3 days. A deposit may be 
made for any or all distinct periods of service.
    (ii) The amount of deposit under this section equals the amount of 
deductions from basic pay that would have been required under section

performed the service

[[Page 300]]

had been subject to FERS deductions under that section, plus interest.

must process the deposit applications and payments under this section. 
If the department or agency where the service was performed no longer 
exists, the Department of State must process the deposit applications 
and payments under this section.
    (ii) Whenever requested, the Department of State must assist the

Sec. 842.306  Military service.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), and unless otherwise 
provided under title III of the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act 
of 1986, an employee's or Member's military service is creditable if it 
was performed--
    (1) Before January 1, 1957; or
    (2) After December 31, 1956, subject to payment, before separation 
from service, of the deposit required by Sec. 842.307.
    (b) Credit for a period of military service is not allowed if the 
employee or Member is receiving military retired pay for such period 
awarded for reasons other than--

[[Page 301]]

    (1) Service-connected disability incurred in combat with an enemy of 
the United States;
    (2) Service-connected disability caused by an instrumentality of war 
and incurred in the line of duty during a period of war (within the 
meaning of chapter 11 of title 38, United States Code); or
    (3) Retirement under chapter 67 of title 10, United States Code.
    (c) When adjudicating annuity claims, OPM will accept determinations 
made by the agency that authorized military retired pay concerning--
    (1) The effective date of a waiver of military retired pay;
    (2) Whether an individual's military retired pay was awarded for any 
of the reasons mentioned under paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (3) Whether a period of military service forms the basis for 
military retired pay.
    (d)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this 
section, the computation of a survivor's annuity includes credit for any 
military service allowable under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) If the separated employee (as defined in Sec. 843.102 of this 
chapter) was awarded military retired pay, died after the date of 
separation from civilian service, and did not waive military retired pay 
effective before the date of death, military service upon which the 
military retired pay was based is not creditable.
    (3) If the survivor of a deceased employee who had been awarded 
military retired pay files, in a form prescribed by OPM, an election not 
to have a period of military service included in the computation of 
survivor benefits, that period of military service is not included in 
the computation of survivor benefits.


<R05>
Sec. 842.307  Deposits for military service.

    (a) Eligibility to make a deposit. (1) An employee or Member subject 
to FERS may make a deposit for any distinct period of military service 
by filing an application in a form prescribed by OPM.
    (2) An application to make a deposit is filed with the appropriate 
office in the employing agency, or, for Members and Congressional 
employees, with the Secretary of the Senate, or the Clerk of the House 
of Representatives, as appropriate.
    (3) An employee's or Member's deposit for military service must be 
completed before separation from service. If a deceased employee or 
Member was, at the time of death, eligible to make a deposit, the 
employee's or Member's survivor may make the deposit in one lump sum to 
the former employing agency, the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of 
the House of Representatives, before OPM completes adjudication of the 
survivor annuity application. A person who was eligible to make a 
deposit for military service but failed to complete the deposit within 
the time limits provided in this paragraph, may complete the deposit in 
a lump sum within the time limit set by OPM when it rules that an 
administrative error has been made.
    (b) Amount of deposit. (1) The amount of a deposit for military 
service equals 3 percent of the basic pay for the service under 37 
U.S.C. 207, or an estimate of the basic pay (see paragraph (c)(1)(iii) 
of this section), plus interest, unless interest is not required under 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (2) Interest is charged at a rate as determined by the Secretary of 
the Treasury for each calendar year that equals the overall average 
yield to the Fund during the preceding fiscal year from all obligations 
purchased by the Secretary during such fiscal year under 5 U.S.C. 
8348(c), (d), and (e).
    (3) The computation of interest is on the basis of 30 days to the 
month. Interest is computed for the actual calendar time involved in 
each case; but whenever applicable, the rule of average applies.
    (4) Interest is computed from the mid-point of each full period of 
service included in the computation. The interest accrues annual on the 
outstanding portion beginning on the second anniversary of the 
employee's or Member's beginning date of coverage under FERS, and is 
compounded annually, until the portion is deposited. Interest is charged 
to the date of deposit. No interest will be charged if the deposit is 
completed before the end of the

[[Page 302]]

year after interest begins. For example, if an employee becomes subject 
to FERS on March 1, 1988, interest begins to accrue on March 1, 1990; 
however, no interest would be included in the deposit due if the deposit 
is completed by February 28, 1991.
    (c) Processing deposit applications and payments. (1) The agency, 
Clerk of the House of Representatives, or Secretary of the Senate will 
have the employee or Member--
    (i) Complete an application to make deposit;
    (ii) Provided a copy of his or her DD Form 214 or its equivalent to 
verify the period(s) of service; and
    (iii) Provide copies of all official military pay documents, as 
identified in instructions issued by OPM, which show the exact basic pay 
he or she received for full period of service; or, if such evidence is 
not available, obtain a statement of estimated earnings from the 
appropriate branch of the military service and submit the statement.
    (2) Upon receipt of the application, the DD Form 214, and either the 
evidence of exact basic pay or the statement of estimated earnings, the 
agency, Clerk of the House of Representatives, or Secretary of the 
Senate will establish a deposit account showing--
    (i) The total amount due, including interest, if any;
    (ii) A payment schedule (unless deposit is made in a lump sum); and
    (iii) The date and amount of each payment.
    (3) Deposits may be made in a single lump sum or in installments. 
The agency, Clerk of the House of Representatives, and Secretary of the 
Senate are not required to accept installment payments in amounts less 
than $50.
    (4) Payments received by the employing agency, the Clerk of the 
House of Representatives, or the Secretary of the Senate will be 
remitted to OPM for deposit to the Fund in accordance with payroll 
office instructions issued by OPM.
    (d) Distinct periods of service. A deposit is not considered to have 
been made for any distinct period of service unless the total amount due 
for the period is paid in full. A ``distinct period'' for this purpose 
is the total years, months, and days from the date of entry on active 
duty (or from January 1, 1957, if later) to the date of final discharge 
for enlisted military personnel, or to the date of final release from 
active duty for officers and reservists. A ``distinct period'' also 
includes consecutive periods of service where there is no break in 
service, but does not include any lost time.

to civilian service performed before becoming subject to FERS and 
totaling less than 5 years, not counting service after 1983 that was 
covered simultaneously by both CSRS and social security) that were 
previously made for a period of service performed before becoming

form prescribed by OPM. The amount of this refund is the difference 
between--
    (1) The amount of deductions and deposits to his or her credit for 
such service, plus any interest computed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 
8331(8): and
    (2) The amount of the deposit required for such service under Sec. 
842.305.
    (b) A former employee or Member who is eligible under 5 U.S.C. 
8342(a) for a refund of deductions or deposits covering civilian service 
of the types described in paragraph (a) of this section is eligible for 
a refund, upon proper application in a form prescribed by OPM. The 
individual may irrevocably elect a refund, with resepct to this service, 
of either--
    (1) The amount provided under paragraph (a) of this section; or
    (2) The full amount of deductions and deposits to his or her credit 
for such service, plus any interest computed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 
8331(8). If the full amount of deductions and deposits is elected by the 
former employee or Member, no future deposit for the service may be 
made.
    (c) An employee or Member, who, before becoming subject to FERS, 
made a deposit for military service is eligible

[[Page 303]]

upon proper application in a form prescribed by OPM, while currently 
employed, for a refund of the amount deposited, excluding interest, to 
the extent that this amount exceeds the amount of the deposit required 
for such service under Sec. 842.307.
    (d) A former employee or Member who, before becoming subject to 
FERS, made a deposit for military service is eligible for a refund, upon 
proper application in a form prescribed by OPM. The former employee or 
Member may irrevocably elect to receive either--
    (1) The amount provided under paragraph (c) of this section; or
    (2) The full amount deposited and remaining to the individual's 
credit. If the full amount of the deposit is elected, no future deposit 
for the service may be made.
    (e) If the current employing agency holds all necessary records 
pertaining to the amounts in question under paragraph (a) or (c) of this 
section, the current employing agency will pay the refund in accordance 
with OPM instructions. Otherwise, OPM will pay the refund.


<R05>
Sec. 842.309  Contract service.

    Contract service with the United States will only be included in the 
computation of, or used to establish title to, an annuity under chapter 
84 of title 5, United States Code, if--
    (a) The employing agency exercised an explicit statutory authority 
to appoint an individual into the civil service by contract; or
    (b) The head of the agency which was party to the contract, based on 
a timely-filed application, in accordance with section 110 of Public Law 
100-238, and the regulations promulgated by OPM pursuant to that 
statute, certifies that the agency intended that an individual be 
considered as having been appointed to a position in which (s)he would 
have been subject to subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United 
States Code, and deposit has been paid in accordance with OPM's 
regulations.

Sec. 842.401  Purpose.

    This subpart regulates the basic annuity computation under the 
Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS).


<R05>
Sec. 842.402  Definitions.

    In this subpart--
    Full-time service means any actual service in which the employee is 
scheduled to work the number of hours and days required by the 
administrative workweek for his or her grade or class (normally 40 
hours).
    Part-time service means any actual service performed on a less than 
full-time basis, by an individual whose appointment describes a 
regularly scheduled tour of duty, and any period of time credited as 
nonpay status time under 5 U.S.C 8411(d), that follows a period of part-
time service without any intervening period of actual service other than 
part-time service.
    Proration factor means a fraction expressed as a percentage rounded 
to the nearest percent. The numerator is the sum of the number of hours 
the employee actually worked during part-time service; and the 
denominator is the sum of the number of hours that a full-time employee 
would be scheduled to work during the same period of service included in 
the numerator. If an employee has creditable service in addition to 
part-time service, such service must be included in the numerator and 
denominator of the fraction.
    Total service means the full years and twelfth parts thereof of an 
employee's or Member's service creditable under

[[Page 304]]

subpart C of this part, excluding any fractional part of a month.

Sec. 842.406  Members of Congress and Congressional employees.

    The annuity of an employee or Member who has had at least 5 years of 
service as a congressional employee, Member, or any combination thereof 
totaling 5 years is--
    (a) One and seven-tenths percent of average pay multiplied by the

Sec. 842.407  Proration of annuity for part-time service.

    The annuity of an employee whose service includes part-time service 
is computed in accordance with Sec. 842.403, using the average pay 
based on the annual rate of basic pay for full-time service. This amount 
is then multiplied by the proration factor. The result is the annual 
rate of annuity before reductions for retirement before age 62, survivor 
benefits, or the reduction for an alternative form of annuity required 
by Sec. 842.706.

    Source: 52 FR 2061, Jan. 16, 1987, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 842.601  Purpose.

    This subpart explains the survivor annuity elections available under 
FERS for retirees, and retiring employees and Members, and the actions 
that they must take to provide these survivor annuities.


<R05>
Sec. 842.602  Definitions.

    In this subpart--
    Current spouse means a living person who is married to the employee, 
Member, or retiree at the time of the employee's, Member's, or retiree's 
death.
    Current spouse annuity means a recurring benefit under FERS that is 
payable (after the employee's, Member's or

[[Page 307]]

retiree's death) to a current spouse who meets the requirements of Sec. 
843.303 of this chapter.
    Deposit means a deposit required to provide a survivor benefit. 
Deposit, as used in this subpart, does not include a service credit 
deposit or redeposit.
    FERS means chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code.
    First regular monthly payment means the first annuity check payable 
on a recurring basis (other than an estimated payment or an adjustment 
check) after OPM has initially adjudicated the regular rate of annuity 
payable under FERS and has paid the annuity accrued since the time of 
retirement. The first regular monthly payment is generally preceded by 
estimated payments before the claim can be adjudicated and by an 
adjustment check (including the difference between the estimated rate 
and the initially adjudicated rate).
    Former spouse means a living person who was married for at least 9 
months to an employee, Member, or retiree who performed at least 18 
months of creditable service under FERS. The ``former spouse's'' 
marriage to the employee must have been terminated prior to the death of 
the employee, Member, or retiree.
    Former spouse annuity means a recurring benefit under FERS that is 
payable to a former spouse after the employee's, Member's, or retiree's 
death.
    Fully reduced annuity means the recurring payments under FERS 
received by a retiree who has elected the maximum reduction in his or 
her annuity to provide a current spouse annuity and/or a former spouse 
annuity or annuities.
    Insurable interest rate means the recurring payments under FERS to a 
retireee who has elected a reduction in annuity to provide a survivor 
annuity to a person with an insurable interest in the retiree.
    Marriage has the same meaning as in Sec. 843.102 of this chapter.
    Member means a Member of Congress.
    Net annuity means the net annuity as defined in Sec. 838.103 of 
this chapter.
    One-half reduced annuity means the recurring payments under FERS 
received by a retiree who has elected one-half of the full reduction in 
his or her annuity to provide a partial current spouse annuity or a 
partial former spouse annuity or annuities.
    Present value factor means the amount of money (earning interest at 
an assumed rate) required at the time of retirement to fund an annuity 
that starts out at the rate of $1 a month and is payable in monthly 
installments for the annuitant's lifetime based on mortality rates for 
non-disability annuitants under the Civil Service Retirement System; and 
increases each year at an assumed rate of inflation. Interest, 
mortality, and inflation rates used in computing the present value are 
those used by the Board of Actuaries of the Civil Service Retirement 
System for valuation of the System, based on dynamic assumptions. The 
present value factors are unisex factors obtained by averaging six 
distinct present value factors, weighted by the total dollar value of 
annuities typically paid to new retirees at each age.
    Qualifying court order means a court order that awards a former 
spouse annuity and that satisfies the requirements of section 8445 of 
title 5, United States Code, for awarding a former spouse annuity.
    Retiree means a former employee or Member who is receiving recurring 
payments under FERS based on service by the employee or Member. 
``Retiree,'' as used in this subpart, does not include a current spouse, 
former spouse, child, or person with an insurable interest receiving a 
survivor annuity.
    Self-only annuity means the recurring unreduced payments under FERS 
to a retiree with no survivor annuity payable to anyone.
    Time of retirement means the effective commencing date for retired 
employee's or Member's annuity. An employee or Member is unmarried at 
the time of retirement for all purposes under this subpart only if the 
employee or Member was unmarried on the date that the annuity begins to 
accrue.

fully reduced annuity or a one-half reduced annuity to provide a former 
spouse annuity or annuities.
    (b) A married employee or Member retiring under FERS may elect a 
fully reduced annuity or a one-half reduced annuity to provide a former 
spouse annuity or annuities instead of a fully reduced annuity to

election in accordance with Sec. 842.606 or spousal consent is waived 
in accordance with Sec. 842.607.
    (c) An election under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is void

exceed the maximum amount of survivor annuity that the employee or 
Member is entitled to provide under Sec. 842.613.
    (d) Any reduction in an annuity to provide a former spouse annuity 
will terminate on the first day of the month after the former spouse 
remarries before age 55 or dies, or the former spouse's eligibility for 
a former spouse annuity terminates under the terms of a qualifying court 
order, unless--

death or remarriage, to continue the reduction to provide a former 
spouse annuity for another former spouse, or to provide a current spouse 
annuity; or

    (2) Five percent of the employee's or Member's annuity if the 
employee or Member elects a one-half reduced annuity.

<R05>
Sec. 842.605  Election of insurable interest rate.

    (a) At the time of retirement, an employee or Member in good health 
and who is applying for a non-disability annuity may elect an insurable 
interest rate. An election under this section does not exempt a married 
employee or Member from the provisions of Sec. 842.603(a).
    (b) An insurable interest rate may be elected by an employee or 
Member electing a fully reduced annuity or a one-half reduced annuity to 
provide a current spouse annuity or a former spouse annuity or 
annuities.
    (c)(1) In the case of a married employee or Member, an election 
under this section may not be made on behalf of a current spouse unless 
that current spouse has consented to an election not to provide a 
current spouse annuity in accordance with Sec. 842.603(a)(1).

[[Page 309]]

    (2) A consent (to an election not to provide a current spouse 
annuity in accordance with Sec. 842.603(a)(1)) required by paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section to be eligible to be the beneficiary of an 
insurable interest rate is cancelled if--
    (i) The retiree fails to qualify to receive the insurable interest 
rate; or
    (ii) The retiree changes his or her election to receive an insurable 
interest rate under Sec. 842.608; or
    (iii) The retiree elects a fully reduced annuity to provide a 
current spouse annuity under Sec. 842.610.
    (3) An election of a one-half reduced annuity under Sec. 842.610(b) 
to provide a current spouse annuity for a current spouse who is the 
beneficiary of an insurable interest rate is void unless the spouse 
consents to the election.
    (4) If a retiree who had elected an insurable interest rate to 
benefit a current spouse elects a fully reduced annuity to provide a 
current spouse annuity (or with the consent of the spouse, a one-half 
reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity) under Sec. 
842.610(b), the election of the insurable interest rate is cancelled.
    (5)(i) A retiring employee or Member may not elect a fully reduced 
annuity or a one-half reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity 
and an insurable interest rate to benefit the same former spouse.
    (ii) If a retiring employee or Member who is required by court order 
to provide a former spouse annuity elects an insurable interest rate to 
benefit the former spouse with the court-ordered entitlement--
    (A) If the benefit based on the election is greater than or equal to 
the benefit based on the court order, the election of the insurable 
interest rate will satisfy the requirements of the court order as long 
as the insurable interest rate continues.
    (B) If the benefit based on the election is less than the benefit 
based on the court order, the election of the insurable interest rate is 
void.
    (iii) An election under Sec. 842.611 of a fully reduced annuity or 
a one-half reduced annuity to benefit a former spouse by a retiree who 
elected and continues to receive an insurable interest rate to benefit 
that former spouse is void.
    (d) To elect an insurable interest rate, an employee or Member must 
indicate the intention to make the election on the application for 
retirement and must submit a certificate of good health in a form 
prescribed by OPM.
    (e) An insurable interest rate may be elected to provide a survivor 
benefit only for a person who has an insurable interest in the retiring 
employee or Member.
    (1) An insurable interest is presumed to exist with--
    (i) The current spouse;
    (ii) A blood or adopted relative closer than first cousins;
    (iii) A former spouse;
    (iv) A person to whom the employee or Member is engaged to be 
married;
    (v) A person with whom the employee or Member is living in a 
relationship that would constitute a common-law marriage in 
jurisdictions recognizing common-law marriages.
    (2) When an insurable interest is not presumed, the employee or 
Member must submit affidavits from one or more persons with personal 
knowledge of the named beneficiary's having an insurable interest in the 
employee or Member. The affidavits must set forth the relationship, if 
any, between the named beneficiary and the employee or Member, the 
extent to which the named beneficiary is dependent on the employee or 
Member, and the reasons why the named beneficiary might reasonably 
expect to derive financial benefit from the continued life of the 
employee or Member.
    (3) The employee or Member may be required to submit documentary 
evidence to establish the named beneficiary's date of birth.
    (f) OPM will notify the employee or Member of initial monthly 
annuity rates with and without the election of an insurable interest 
rate and the initial rate payable to the named beneficiary. No election 
of an insurable interest rate is effective unless the employee or Member 
confirms the election in writing or dies no later than 60 days after the 
date of the notice described in this paragraph.
    (g)(1) When an employee or Member elects both an insurable interest 
rate, and a fully reduced annuity or a one-

[[Page 310]]

half reduced annuity, the combined reduction may exceed the maximum 40 
percent reduction in the retired employee's or Member's annuity 
permitted under section 8420 of title 5, United States Code, applicable 
to insurable interest annuities.
    (2) The additional reduction to provide a current spouse annuity or 
a former spouse annuity is not considered in determining the rate of 
annuity payable to a beneficiary of an insurable interest election.
    (h)(1) Except as provided in Sec. 842.604(d), if a retiree who is 
receiving a fully reduced annuity or a one-half reduced annuity to 
provide a former spouse annuity has also elected an insurable interest 
rate to benefit a current spouse and if the eligible former spouse 
remarries before age 55, dies, or loses eligibility under the terms of 
the court order, and no other former spouse is entitled to a survivor 
annuity based on an election made in accordance with Sec. 842.611 or a 
qualifying court order, the retiree may elect, within 2 years after the 
former spouse's remarriage, death, or loss of eligibility under the 
terms of the court order, to convert the insurable interest rate to a 
fully reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, effective on 
the first day of the month following the event causing the former spouse 
to lose eligibility.
    (2) An election under paragraph (h)(1) of this section cancels any 
consent not to receive a current spouse annuity required by paragraph 
(c) of this section for the current spouse to be eligible for an annuity 
under this section.
    (3) When a former spouse receiving an annuity under section 8445 of 
title 5, United States Code, loses eligibility to that annuity, a 
beneficiary of an insurable interest rate who was the current spouse at 
both the time of the retiree's retirement and death may, within 2 years 
after the former spouse's death, remarriage, or loss of eligibility 
under the terms of the court order, elect to receive a current spouse 
annuity instead of the annuity he or she had been receiving.
    The election is effective on the first day of the month following 
the event causing the former spouse to lose eligibility.
    (i) Upon the death of the current spouse, a retiree whose annuity is 
reduced to provide both a current spouse annuity and an insurable 
interest benefit for a former spouse is not permitted to convert the 
insurable interest rate to a reduced annuity to provide a former spouse 
annuity.
    (j) An employee or Member may name only one natural person as the 
named beneficiary of an insurable interest rate. OPM will not accept the 
designation of contingent beneficiaries and such a designation is void.
    (k)(1) An election under this section is prospectively voided by an 
election of a fully reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity 
under Sec. 842.612 that would benefit the same person.
    (2)(i) If the current spouse is not the beneficiary of the election 
under this section, a retiree may prospectively void an election under 
this section at the time the retiree elects a reduced annuity to provide 
a current spouse annuity under Sec. 842.612.
    (ii) A retiree's election to void an election under paragraph 
(k)(2)(i) of this section must be filed at the same time as the election 
under Sec. 842.612.
    (3) An annuity reduction under this section terminates on the first 
day of the month after the beneficiary of the insurable interest rate 
dies.

Sec. 842.607  Waiver of spousal consent requirement.

    (a) The spousal consent requirement will be waived upon a showing 
that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined. A request for waiver 
on this basis must be accompanied by--
    (1) A judicial determination that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be 
determined; or
    (2)(i) Affidavits by the employee or Member and two other persons, 
at least one of whom is not related to the employee or Member, attesting

made to locate the spouse; and
    (ii) Documentary corroboration such as tax returns filed separately 
or newspaper stories about the spouse's disappearance.
    (b) The spousal consent requirement will be waived based on 
exceptional circumstances if the employee or Member presents a judicial 
determination finding that--
    (1) The case before the court involves a Federal employee who is in 
the process of retiring from Federal employment and the spouse of that 
employee;
    (2) The nonemployee spouse has been given notice and an opportunity 
to be heard concerning this order;
    (3) The court has considered sections 8416(a) of title 5, United 
States Code, and this section as they relate to waiver of the spousal 
consent requirement for a married Federal employee to elect an annuity 
without a reduction to provide a survivor benefit to a spouse at 
retirement; and
    (4) The court finds that exceptional circumstances exist justifying 
waiver of the nonemployee spouse's consent.

Sec. 842.608  Changes of election before final adjudication.

    An employee or Member may name a new survivor or change his or her 
election of type of annuity if, not later than 30 days after the date of

Sec. 842.610  Changes of election after final adjudication.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 842.611, Sec. 842.612, or paragraph 
(b) of this section, an employee or Member may not revoke or change the 
election or name another survivor later than 30 days after the date of 
the first regular monthly payment.
    (b)(1) Except as provided in Sec. 842.605 and paragraphs (b)(2) and 
(b)(3) of this section, a retiree who was married at the time of 
retirement and has elected a self-only annuity, a one-half reduced 
annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, a fully reduced annuity or 
a one-half reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity, or an 
insurable interest rate may elect, no later than 18 months after the 
time of retirement, an annuity reduction or an increased annuity 
reduction to provide a current spouse annuity.
    (2) A current spouse annuity based on an election under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section cannot be paid if it will, when combined with any 
former spouse annuity or annuities that are required by court order, 
exceed the maximum survivor annuity permitted under Sec. 842.613.

[[Page 312]]

    (3) To make an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the 
retiree must pay, in full no later than 18 months after the time of 
retirement, a deposit equal to the sum of the monthly differences 
between the annuity paid to the retiree and the annuity that would have 
been paid if the additional annuity reduction elected under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section had been in effect since the time of retirement, 
plus--
    (i) If the election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section changes 
the annuity from a self only annuity to a fully reduced annuity, 24.5 
percent of the retiree's annual annuity, plus 6 percent interest on 
both; or
    (ii) If the election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section changes 
the annuity from a self only annuity to a one-half reduced annuity or 
from a one-half reduced annuity to a fully reduced annuity, 12.25 
percent of the retiree's annual annuity, plus 6 percent interest on 
both.
    (4) If a retiree makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section and is prevented from paying the deposit within the 18-month 
time limit because OPM did not send him or her a notice of the amount of 
the deposit at least 30 days before the time limit expires, the time 
limit for making the deposit will be extended 30 days after OPM sends 
the notice of the amount of the deposit.
    (5) An election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section cancels any 
spousal consent under Sec. 842.603.
    (6) An election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is void 
unless filed with OPM before the retiree dies.
    (7) If a retiree who had elected a fully reduced annuity or a one-
half reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity (or annuities) 
makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section which would 
cause the combined current spouse annuity and former spouse annuity (or 
annuities) to exceed the maximum allowed under Sec. 842.613, the former 
spouse annuity (or annuities) must be reduced to not exceed the maximum 
allowable under Sec. 842.613.

or
    (ii) Would cause the sum of all current and former spouse annuities 
based on a retiree's elections under Sec. Sec. 842.603, 842.604,

amount that is inconsistent with any joint designation or waiver made at 
the time of retirement under Sec. 842.603(a)(1) or (a)(2).

order, unless--
    (1) The retiree elects, within 2 years after the event causing the 
former spouse to lose eligibility, to continue the reduction to provide 
or increase a former spouse annuity for another former spouse, or to 
provide or increase a current spouse annuity; or
    (2) A qualifying court order requires the retiree to provide another 
former spouse annuity.
    (e) The amount of the reduction to provide one or more former spouse 
annuities or a combination of a current spouse annuity and one or more 
former spouse annuities under this section equals--

election.
    (c)(1) Qualifying court orders prevent payment of current spouse 
annuities to the extent necessary to comply with the court order and 
Sec. 842.613.
    (2) If an election under this section causes the total of all 
current and former spouse annuities provided by a qualifying court order

annual interest, computed under Sec. 841.606 of this chapter, from the

    (3) If an election under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section does 
not become effective, no deposit under paragraph (d) of this section is 
required.
    (4) If payment of the deposit under paragraph (d) of this section is 
not required because the election never became effective and if some or 
all of the deposit has been paid, the amount paid will be returned to 
the retiree, or, if the retiree has died, to the person who would be 
entitled to any lump-sum benefits under the order of precedence in 
section 8424 of title 5, United States Code.
    (f) Any reduction in an annuity to provide a current spouse annuity 
will terminate effective on the first day of the month after the 
marriage to the current spouse ends, unless--

former spouse annuity and who has remarried that former spouse (before 
the former spouse attained age 55) dies, the retiree will be deemed to 
have elected to continue the reduction to provide a current spouse 
annuity unless the retiree requests (or has requested) in writing that 
OPM terminate the reduction.

Sec. 842.613  Division of a survivor annuity.

    (a) The maximum combined total of all current and former spouse 
annuities (not including any benefits based on an election of an 
insurable interest rate) payable based on the service of a former 
employee or Member equals 50 percent of the rate of the self-only 
annuity that otherwise would have been paid to the employee, Member, or 
retiree.
    (b) By using the elections available under this subpart or to comply 
with a court order under subpart I of part 841 of this chapter, a

annuities and a current spouse annuity so long as the aggregate total of 
the current and former spouse annuities does not exceed the maximum 
limitation in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Upon termination of former spouse annuity payments because of 
death or remarriage of the former spouse, or by operation of a court

or an increased current spouse annuity if--
    (1) The employee or Member died while employed in a position covered 
under FERS; or
    (2) The current spouse was married to the employee or Member 
continuously from the time of retirement and did not consent to an

percent of the amount of the employee's annuity on which the survivor 
benefits will be computed (called the ``base'').

equal to the lesser of--
    (i) The amount of the deposit under Sec. 842.611 or Sec. 842.612 
divided by the present value factor for the retiree's age on the 
commencing date of the reduction under paragraph (b)(3) of this section 
(plus any previous reduction(s) in the retiree's annuity required under 
paragraph (b)(2) or (c)(2) of this section); or

<R05>
Sec. 842.701  Purpose.

    This subpart explains the benefits available to employees and 
Members who elect alternative forms of annuity

[[Page 316]]

under section 8420a of title 5, United States Code.


<R05>
Sec. 842.702  Definitions.

    In this subpart--
    Alternative form of annuity means the benefit elected under Sec. 
842.705.
    Current spouse annuity has the same meaning as in Sec. 842.602.
    Date of final adjudication means the date 30 days after the date of 
the first regular monthly payment as defined in Sec. 831.603.
    Former spouse annuity has the same meaning as in Sec. 842.602.
    Present value factor represents the amount of money (earning 
interest at an assumed rate) required at the time of retirement to fund 
an annuity that (a) starts out at the rate of $1 a month and is payable 
in monthly installments for the annuitant's lifetime based on mortality 
rates for non-disability annuitants; and (b) increases each year at an 
assumed rate of inflation. Interest, mortality, and inflation rates used 
in computing the present value are those used by the Board of Actuaries 
for valuation of the System, based on dynamic assumptions. The present 
value factors are unisex factors obtained by averaging sex-distinct 
present value factors, weighted by the total dollar value of annuities 
typically paid to new retirees at each age.
    Time of retirement has the same meaning as in Sec. 842.602.

After the date of final adjudication, an election of the alternative 
form of annuity is irrevocable.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d), an annuitant who dies 
before the time limit prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is 
deemed to have made an affirmative election under Sec. 842.703(a) with 
a reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, regardless of any 
election completed under Sec. 842.606, and the lump-sum credit will be 
paid in accordance with the order of precedence described in section 
8424 of title 5, United States Code.
    (d) If an annuitant described in paragraph (c) has completed an 
election under Sec. 842.604 (a) or (b)--
    (1) The lump-sum credit will be paid in accordance with the order of 
precedence described in section 8424 of title 5, United States Code; and
    (2) The election under Sec. 842.604 (a) or (b) will be honored.

<R05>
Sec. 842.705  Alternative forms of annuities available.

    (a) An employee or Member who is eligible to make an election under 
Sec. 842.703 may elect to receive his or her lump-sum credit, excluding 
interest, plus an annuity computed in accordance with sections 8415 and 
8421 of title 5, United States Code, for which they qualify (including 
any reduction for survivor benefits) and reduced under Sec. 842.706.
    (b) A retired employee or Member who elected an alternative form of 
annuity is subject to all provisions of subchapters II and IV of chapter 
84 of title 5, United States Code, as would otherwise apply to a retired 
employee or Member who did not elect an alternative form of annuity. An 
individual who has elected an alternative form of annuity is not 
eligible to apply for disability annuity under subchapter V of such 
chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 842.706  Computation of alternative form of annuity.

    (a) To compute the beginning rate of annuity payable to a retiree 
who elects an alternative form of annuity, OPM will first compute the 
monthly rate of annuity (and annuity supplement, if any), otherwise 
payable under subchapter II of chapter 84 of title 5, United States 
Code, including all reductions provided under the subchapter other than 
those in section 8420a of that title. That monthly rate is then reduced 
by an amount equal to the retiree's lump-sum credit, excluding interest, 
divided by the applicable present value factor for the retiree's 
attained age (in full years) at the time of retirement. The reduced 
monthly rate is then rounded to the next lowest dollar and becomes the 
rate of annuity payable.

[[Page 318]]

    (b) OPM will publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing any 
proposed adjustments in present value factors at least 30 days before 
the effective date of the adjustments.


<R05>
Sec. 842.707  Partial deferred payment of the lump-sum credit if annuity commences after January 3, 1988, and before October 1, 1989.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if the 
annuity of an employee or Member commences after January 3, 1988, and 
before October 1, 1989, the lump-sum credit payable under Sec. 842.705 
is payable to the individual, or his or her survivors, according to the 
following schedule:
    (1) Sixty percent of the lump-sum credit is payable at the time of 
retirement, and
    (2) Forty percent is payable, with interest determined under section 
8334(e)(3) of title 5, United States Code, one year after the time of 
retirement.
    (b) If an employee or Member whose annuity commences after January 
3, 1988, and before October 1, 1989, dies before the time limit 
prescribed in Sec. 842.704(b)(2), that individual is subject to Sec. 
842.704 (c) or (d), but the lump-sum credit will be paid in accordance 
with the schedule in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) An annuitant is exempt from the deferred payment schedule under 
paragraph (a) of this section if the individual--
    (1) Separates involuntarily, other than for cause on charges of 
delinquency or misconduct, or
    (2) Has, at the time of retirement, a life-threatening affliction or 
other critical medical condition.
    (3)(i) For the purpose of this section, life-threatening affliction 
or other critical medical condition means a medical condition so severe 
as to reasonably limit an individual's probable life expectancy to less 
than 2 years.
    (ii) The existence of one of the following medical conditions is 
prima facie evidence of a life-threatening affliction or other critical 
medical condition:
    (A) Metastatic and/or inoperable neoplasms.
    (B) Aortic stenosis (severe).
    (C) Class IV cardiac disease with congestive heart failure.
    (D) Respiratory failure.
    (E) Cor pulmonale with respiratory failure.
    (F) Emphysema with respiratory failure.
    (G) [Reserved]
    (H) Severe cardiomyopathy--Class IV.
    (I) Aplastic anemia.
    (J) Uncontrolled hypertension with hypertensive encephalopathy.
    (K) Cardiac aneurysm not amenable to surgical treatment.
    (L) Agranulocytosis.
    (M) Severe hepatic failure.
    (N) Severe hypoxic brain damage.
    (O) Severe portal hypertension with esophageal varices.
    (P) AIDS (Active--Not AIDS Related Complex or only seropositivity).
    (Q) Life-threatening infections (encephalitis, meningitis, rabies, 
etc.).
    (R) Scleroderma with severe esophageal involvement.
    (S) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (rapidly progressive).
    (T) Hemiplegia with life threatening complications.
    (U) Quadriplegia with life threatening complications.
    (iii) Evidence of the existence of a life-threatening affliction or 
other critical medical condition must be certified by a physician and 
sent to OPM on or before the date the annuitant elects to receive an 
alternative form of annuity. For the purpose of this section, 
``physician'' has the same meaning given that term in Sec. 339.102 of 
this chapter.
    (iv) If a medical condition other than those listed in paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section is claimed as a basis for exemption from the 
deferred payment schedule, OPM will review the physician's certification 
to determine whether the cited condition is life-threatening or 
critical.
    (v) The cost of providing medical documentation under this paragraph 
rests with the employee or Member, unless OPM exercises its choice of 
physician.

may waive that exemption by notifying OPM, in writing, on or before the 
date he or she elects to receive the alternative form of annuity.
    (ii) Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section does not apply to an

    (iii) A waiver under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section cannot be 
revoked.

    Source: 52 FR 2069, Jan. 16, 1987, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 842.801  Applicability and purpose.

    (a) This subpart contains regulations of the Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) to supplement--
    (1) 5 U.S.C. 8412 (d) and (e), which establish special retirement 
eligibility for law enforcement officers, firefighters, and air traffic

authority given to OPM in 5 U.S.C. 8461(g) to prescribe regulations to 
carry out the provisions of chapter 84 of title 5 of the United States 
Code, and in 5 U.S.C. 1104 to delegate authority for personnel 
management to the heads of agencies.

<R05>
Sec. 842.802  Definitions.

    In this subpart--
    Agency head means, for the executive branch agencies, the head of an 
executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105; for the legislative branch, 
the Secretary of State, the Clerk of the House of representatives, or 
the head of any other legislative branch agency; for the judicial 
branch, the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts; 
for the Postal Service, the Postmaster General; and for any other 
independent establishment that is an entity of the Federal Government, 
the head of the establishment. For the purpose of an approval of 
coverage under this subpart, agency head is also deemed to include the 
designated representative of the head of an executive department as 
defined in 5 U.S.C. 101, except that, for

[[Page 320]]

provisions dealing with law enforcement officers and firefighters, the 
designated representative must be a department headquarters-level 
official who reports directly to the executive department head, or to 
the deputy department head, and who is the sole such representative for 
the entire department. For the purpose of a denial coverage under this 
subpart, agency head is also deemed to include the designated 
representative of the agency head, as defined in the first sentence of 
this definition, at any level within the agency.
    Air traffic controller means a civilian employee of the Department 
of Transportation or the Department of Defense in an air traffic control 
facility or flight service station facility who is actively engaged in 
the separation and control of air traffic or in providing preflight, 
inflight, or airport advisory service to aircraft operators, or who is 
the immediate supervisor of such an employee, as provided by 5 U.S.C. 
8401(35)(A). Also included in this definition is a civilian employee of 
the Department of Transportation or the Department of Defense who is the 
immediate supervisor of a person described under 5 U.S.C. 2109(1)(B) 
(i.e., a second-level supervisor), as provided by 5 U.S.C. 8401(35)(B).
    Detention duties means duties that require frequent direct contact 
in the detention, direction, supervision, inspection, training, 
employment, care, transportation, or rehabilitation of individuals 
suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the 
United States or the District of Columbia or offenses against the 
punitive articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (chapter 47 of 
title 10, United States Code). (See 5 U.S.C. 8401(17).)
    Employee means an employee as defined by 5 U.S.C. 8401(11).
    Firefighter means an employee occupying a rigorous position, whose 
primary duties are to perform work directly connected with the control 
and extinguishment of fires, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 8401(14). Also 
included in this definition is an employee occupying a rigorous 
firefighter position who moves to a supervisory or administrative 
position and meets the conditions of Sec. 842.803(b).
    First-level supervisors are employees classified as supervisors who 
have direct and regular contact with the employees they supervise. 
First-level supervisors do not have subordinate supervisors. A first-
level supervisor may occupy a rigorous position or a secondary position 
if the appropriate definition is met.
    Frequent direct contact means personal, immediate, and regularly-
assigned contact with detainees while performing detention duties, which 
is repeated and continual over a typical work cycle.
    Law enforcement officer means an employee occupying a rigorous 
position, whose primary duties are the investigation, apprehension, or 
detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the 
criminal laws of the United States, or the protection of officials of 
the United States against threats to personal safety, as provided in 5 
U.S.C. 8401(17). Also included in this definition is an employee 
occupying a rigorous law enforcement officer position who moves to a 
supervisory or administrative position and meets the conditions of Sec. 
842.803(b). Law enforcement officer also includes, as required by 5 
U.S.C. 8401(17)(B), an employee of the Department of the Interior or the 
Department of the Treasury who occupies a position that, but for 
enactment of chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, would be subject 
to the District of Columbia Police and Firefighters' Retirement System, 
as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of the 
Treasury, as appropriate. Except as provided above, the definition does 
not include an employee whose primary duties involve maintaining order, 
protecting life and property, guarding against or inspecting for 
violations of law, or investigating persons other than those who are 
suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the 
United States.
    Primary duties means those duties of a position that--
    (a) Are paramount in influence or weight; that is, constitute the 
basic reasons for the existence of the position;

[[Page 321]]

    (b) Occupy a substantial portion of the individual's working time 
over a typical work cycle; and
    (c) Are assigned on a regular and recurring basis.
    Duties that are of an emergency, incidental, or temporary nature 
cannot be considered ``primary'' even if they meet the substantial 
portion of time criterion. In general, if an employee spends an average 
of at least 50 percent of his or her time performing a duty or group of 
duties, they are his or her primary duties.
    Rigorous position means a position the duties of which are so 
rigorous that employment opportunities should, as soon as reasonably 
possible, be limited (through establishment of a maximum entry age and 
physical qualifications) to young and physically vigorous individuals 
whose primary duties are--
    (a) To perform work directly connected with controlling and 
extinguishing fires; or
    (b) Investigating, apprehending, or detaining individuals suspected 
or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States 
or protecting the personal safety of United States officials.

The condition in this definition that employment opportunities be 
limited does not apply with respect to an employee who moves directly 
(i.e., without a break in service exceeding 3 days) from one rigorous 
law enforcement officer position to another or from one rigorous 
firefighter position to another. Rigorous position is also deemed to 
include a position held by a law enforcement officer as identified in 5 
U.S.C. 8401(17)(B) (related to certain employees in the Departments of 
the Interior and the Treasury).
    Secondary position means a position that--
    (a) Is clearly in the law enforcement or firefighting field;
    (b) Is in an organization having a law enforcement or firefighting 
mission; and
    (c) Is either--
    (1) Supervisory; that is, a position whose primary duties are as a 
first-level supervisor or law enforcement officers or firefighters in 
rigorous positions; or
    (2) Administrative; that is, an executive, managerial, technical, 
semiprofessional, or professional position for which experience in a 
rigorous law enforcement or firefighting position, or equivalent 
experience outside the Federal Government, is a mandatory prerequisite.

<R05>
Sec. 842.803  Conditions for coverage.

    (a) Rigorous positions. (1) An employee's service in a position that 
has been determined by the employing agency head to be a rigorous law 
enforcement officer or firefighter position is covered under the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8412(d).
    (2) An employee who is not in a rigorous position, nor covered while 
in a secondary position, and who is detailed or temporarily promoted to 
a rigorous position is not covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
8412(d).
    (3) A first-level supervisor position may be determined to be a 
rigorous position if it satisfies the conditions set forth in Sec. 
842.802.
    (b) Secondary positions. (1) An employee's service in a position 
that has been determined by the employing agency head to be a secondary 
law enforcement officer or firefighter position is covered under the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8412(d), if all of the following criteria are 
met:
    (i) The employee, while covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C 
8412(d), moves directly (that is, without a break in service exceeding 3 
days) from a rigorous position to a secondary position;
    (ii) The employee has completed 3 years of service in a rigorous 
position, including any such service during which no FERS deductions 
were withheld; and
    (iii) The employee has been continuously employed in a secondary 
position or positions since moving from a rigorous position without a 
break in service exceeding 3 days, except that a break in employment in 
secondary positions that begins with an involuntary separation (not for 
cause), within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8414(b)(1)(A), is not considered 
in determining whether the

[[Page 322]]

service in secondary positions is continuous for this purpose.
    (2) An employee who is not a rigorous position, nor covered while in 
a secondary position, and who is detailed or temporarily promoted to a 
secondary position is not covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
8412(d).
    (c) Air traffic controller. An employee's service in a position that 
has been determined to be an air traffic controller position by the 
employing agency head is covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
8412(e).
    (d) Except as specifically provided in this subpart, an agency 
head's authority under this section cannot be delegated.

[52 FR 2069, Jan. 16, 1987, as amended at 57 FR 32690, July 23, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 842.804  Evidence.

    (a) An agency head's determination under Sec. 842.803(a) (finding 
that a position is a rigorous position) must be based solely on the 
official position description of the position in question and any other 
official description of duties and qualifications. The official 
documentation for the position should, as soon as is reasonably 
possible, establish that the primary duties of the position are so 
rigorous that the agency does not allow individuals to enter the 
position if they are over a certain age or if they fail to meet certain 
physical qualifications (that is, physical requirements and/or medical 
standards), as determined by the employing agency head based on the 
personnel management needs of the agency for the positions in question.
    (b) A determination under Sec. Sec. 842.803 (b) or (c) must be 
based on the official position description and any other evidence deemed 
appropriate by the agency head for making the determination.
    (c) If an employee is in a position not subject to the one-half 
percent higher withholding rate of 5 U.S.C. 8422(a)(2)(B), and the 
employee does not, within 6 months after entering the position or after 
any significant change in the position, formally and in writing seek a 
determination from the employing agency that his position is properly 
covered by the higher withholding rate, the agency head's determination 
that the service was not so covered at the time of the service is 
presumed to be correct. This presumption may be rebutted by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the employee was unaware of his or 
her status or was prevented by cause beyond his or her control from 
requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service 
was performed.

[52 FR 2069, Jan. 16, 1987, as amended at 57 FR 32690, July 23, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 842.805  Withholding and contributions.

    (a) During service covered under the conditions established by Sec. 
842.803 (a), (b), or (c), the employing agency will deduct and withhold 
from the employee's base pay the amounts required under 5 U.S.C. 
8422(a)(2)(B) and submit that amount to OPM in accordance with payroll 
office instructions issued by OPM.
    (b) During service described in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
employing agency must submit to OPM the Government contributions 
required under 5 U.S.C. 8423(a)(1)(B) in accordance with payroll office 
instructions issued by OPM.
    (c) If the correct withholdings and/or Government contributions are 
not timely submitted to OPM for any reason whatsover, including cases in 
which it is finally determined that past service of a current or former 
employee was subject to the higher deduction and Government contribution 
rates, the employing agency must correct the error by submitting the 
correct amounts (including both employee and agency shares) to OPM as 
soon as possible. Even if the agency waives collection of the 
overpayment of pay under any waiver authority that may be available for 
this purpose, such as 5 U.S.C. 5584, or otherwise fails to collect the 
debt, the correct amount must still be submitted to OPM as soon as 
possible.
    (d) Upon proper application from an employee, former employee or 
eligible survivor of a former employee, an employing agency or former 
employing agency will pay a refund or erroneous additional withholdings 
for service that is found not to have been covered service. If an 
individual has paid to OPM a deposit or redeposit, including

[[Page 323]]

the additional amount required for covered service, and the deposit is 
later determined to be erroneous because the service was not covered 
service, OPM will pay the refund, upon proper application, to the 
individual, without interest.
    (e) The additional employee withholding and agency contributions for 
covered service properly made are not separately refundable, even in the 
event that the employee or his or her survivor does not qualify for a 
special annuity computation under 5 U.S.C. 8415(d).
    (f) While an employee who does not hold a rigorous, secondary, or 
air traffic controller position is detailed or temporarily promoted to 
such a position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions 
will not be made.
    (g) While an employee who holds a rigorous, secondary, or air 
traffic controller position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a 
position that is not a rigorous, secondary, or air traffic controller 
position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will 
continue to be made.

FR 3340, Jan. 17, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 842.806  Mandatory separation.

    (a) The mandatory separation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8425 apply to 
all law enforcement officers and firefighters, including those in 
secondary positions, and air traffic controllers, with the exception of 
a civilian employee of the Department of Transportation or the 
Department of Defense who is the immediate supervisor of a person 
described under 5 U.S.C. 2109(1)(B) (i.e., a second-level supervisor). A 
mandatory separation under 5 U.S.C. 8425 is not an adverse action under 
part 752 of this chapter or a removal action under part 359 of this 
chapter.
    (b) Exemptions from mandatory separation are subject to the 
conditions set forth under 5 U.S.C. 8425. An exemption may be granted at 
the sole discretion of the head of the employing agency or by the 
President in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8425(c).
    (c) In the event that an employee is separated mandatorily under 5 
U.S.C. 8425, or is separated for optional retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8412 
(d) or (e), and OPM finds that all or part of the minimum service 
required for entitlement to immediate annuity was in a position that did 
not meet the requirements of a primary or secondary position and the 
conditions set forth in this subpart or, if applicable, in part 831 of 
this chapter, such separation will be considered erroneous.

<R05>
Sec. 842.807  Review of decisions.

    (a) The final decision of an agency head denying an individual's 
request for approval of a position as a rigorous, secondary, or air 
traffic controller position made under Sec. 842.804(c) may be appealed 
to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the 
Board.
    (b) The final decision of an agency head denying an individual 
coverage while serving in an approved secondary position because of 
failure to meet the conditions in Sec. 842.803(b) may be appealed to 
the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the 
Board.

[66 FR 38525, July 25, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 842.808  Oversight of coverage determinations.

    (a) Upon deciding that a position is a law enforcement officer or 
firefighter position, each agency head must notify OPM (Attention: 
Associate Director for Retirement and Insurance) stating the title of 
each position, the number of incumbents, whether the position is 
rigorous or secondary, and, if the position is rigorous, the established 
maximum entry age (or if no maximum entry age has yet been established, 
the date by which it will be established). The Director of OPM retains 
the authority to overrule an agency head's determination that a position 
is a rigorous or secondary position, except such a determination under 5 
U.S.C. 8401(17)(B) (concerning certain employees in the Departments of 
the Interior and the Treasury) or under 5 U.S.C. 8401(17)(D) (concerning 
certain positions primarily involved in detention activities).
    (b) Each agency must establish a file containing all coverage 
determinations

[[Page 324]]

made by an agency head under Sec. 842.803, and all background material 
used in making the determination.
    (c) Upon request by OPM, the agency will make available the entire 
coverage determination file for OPM to audit to ensure compliance with 
the provisions of this subpart.
    (d) Upon request by OPM, an agency must submit to OPM a list of all 
covered positions and any other pertinent information requested. For 
rigorous positions, the list must show the specific entry age 
requirement and physical qualification requirements for each position.

Sec. 842.809  Transitional provisions.

    (a) Any service as an air traffic controller, within the meaning of 
this term under 5 U.S.C. 2109 as in effect on or after January 1, 1987--
even if performed before that date--is included in determining an 
employee's length of air traffic controller service under 5 U.S.C. 
8412(e) for the purposes of retirement eligibility and for mandatory 
separation under 5 U.S.C. 8425(a) as long as the annuity is based on a 
separation from service occurring after 1986.
    (b) Any service as a law enforcement officer or firefighter, within 
the meaning of these terms under 5 U.S.C. 8331 (20) and (21), that was 
performed before the date on which an employee becomes subject to 
chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, is included in determining 
the employee's length of law enforcement officer and firefighter service 
under 5 U.S.C. 8412(d) for the purposes of retirement eligibility and 
mandatory separation under 5 U.S.C. 8425(b). Service performed as a law 
enforcement officer or firefighter within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8331, 
other than service in a supervisory or administrative position, is 
considered to be service in a rigorous position for the purpose of the 
3-year requirement of Sec. 842.803(b)(1)(ii). The FERS definitions of 
firefighter under 5 U.S.C. 8401(14) and law enforcement officer under 5 
U.S.C. 8401(17) are not applicable to service performed--
    (1) Before 1987; or
    (2) After 1986 and before an employee first becomes subject to 
chapter 84 (that is, subject to FERS deductions), unless that service 
was neither subject to CSRS deductions nor creditable in a CSRS 
component as described in Sec. 846.304(b).
    (c)(1) An individual who--
    (i) Is covered as a law enforcement officer or firefighter under 5 
U.S.C. 8336(c) in a supervisory or administrative position, having 
already met the transfer requirement of subpart I of part 831 of this 
chapter; and
    (ii) Elects under section 301 of Pub. L. 99-335 to become subject to 
chapter 84 of such title and begins service in a secondary position with 
no break in service is considered to have met the transfer and 3-year 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 842.803(b)(1)(i) and (ii) for coverage in a 
secondary position upon the effective date of the election.
    (2) An individual who--
    (i) Is covered as a law enforcement officer or firefighter under 5 
U.S.C. 8336(c) in a supervisory or administrative position, having 
already met the transfer requirement of subpart I of part 831 of this 
chapter; and
    (ii) Automatically becomes subject to chapter 84 of title 5 of the 
United States Code (not by election under section 301 of Pub. L. 99-335) 
serving in a secondary position is considered to have met the 3-year 
requirement of Sec. 842.803(b)(1)(ii) for coverage in a secondary 
position. The employee is not covered as a law enforcement officer or 
firefighter in a secondary position if he or she had a break in coverage 
as a law enforcement officer or firefighter (within the meaning of 5 
U.S.C. 8331) exceeding 3 days immediately before becoming subject to 
chapter 84 of title 5 of United States Code. However, a break in 
coverage in supervisory or administrative positions occurring before the 
individual becomes subject to such chapter 84 that began with an 
involuntary separation (not for cause), within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 
8414(b)(1)(A), is not considered to be a break in service for this 
purpose.
    (d) (1) The CSRS definitions of law enforcement officer under 5 
U.S.C. 8331(20) and firefighter under 5 U.S.C.

[[Page 325]]

8331(21) are applicable to service performed before an employee became 
subject to chapter 84 if the service was--
    (i) Subject to CSRS deductions at the time it was performed 
(including service that becomes creditable under FERS annuity 
computation rules);
    (ii) Performed before 1987 and not subject to retirement deductions; 
or
    (iii) Performed after 1986 and not subject to retirement deductions 
but is creditable in a CSRS component as described in Sec. 846.304(b).
    (2) The determination of whether any service meets the CSRS 
definitions of law enforcement officer under 5 U.S.C. 8331 (20) or 
firefighter under 5 U.S.C. 8331(21) must be made in accordance with the 
provisions of subpart I of part 831 of this chapter.

separated under 5 U.S.C. 8425(b) is not barred from reemployment in any 
position except a FERS rigorous or secondary law enforcement officer 
position after age 60. Service by a reemployed former MWAA police 
officer who retired under 5 U.S.C. 8412(d) is not covered by the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8412(d).

<R05>
Sec. 842.811  Deposits for second-level supervisory air traffic controller service performed before February 10, 2004.

    (a)(1) Eligibility--current and former employees, and retirees. A 
current or former employee, or a retiree who was employed as a civilian 
employee of the Department of Transportation or the Department of 
Defense before February 10, 2004, as the immediate supervisor of a 
person described in 5 U.S.C. 2109(1)(B) may make a deposit for such 
service, in a form prescribed by OPM, so that such service may be 
credited as air traffic controller service for FERS purposes subject to 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (2) Eligibility--survivors. A survivor of a current employee, former 
employee, or a retiree eligible to make a deposit under paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section may make a deposit under this section when the current 
or former employee, or a retiree--
    (i) Dies during the period beginning February 10, 2004, and ending 
November 28, 2006, without submitting an application under this section; 
or
    (ii) Dies after submitting an application to make a deposit under 
this section within the time limit set out in paragraph (c) of this 
section without completing a deposit.
    (b) Filing of deposit application. An individual eligible to make a 
deposit under paragraph (a) of this section for service described under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section must submit a written application to 
make a deposit for such service with the appropriate office in the 
agency where such service was performed.
    (c) Time limit for filing application. An application to make a

    (d)(1) Amount of deposit. A deposit under this section shall be 
computed using distinct periods of service. For the purpose of this 
section, a distinct period of service means a period of service not 
interrupted by a break in service of more than 3 days. A deposit may be 
made for a distinct period of service; however, such a deposit shall be 
ineffective if deposits are not completed for all distinct periods of 
service described under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) The amount of deposit under this section shall be an amount 
equal to the amount by which the deductions from pay which would have 
been required under 5 U.S.C. chapter 84, subchapter II, if at the time 
the service was performed the service had been air traffic controller 
service exceeds the unrefunded deductions or deposits actually made 
under 5 U.S.C. chapter 84, subchapter II, with respect to such service, 
plus interest.
    (e)(1) Interest. Interest shall be computed as described under 
paragraphs (2) and (3) of 5 U.S.C. 8334(e). Interest shall be computed 
for each distinct period of service from the midpoint of the distinct 
period of service.
    (2) The computation of interest is on the basis of 30 days to the 
month. Interest is computed for the actual calendar time involved in 
each case.
    (f) Forms of deposit. A deposit under this section may be made as a 
single lump sum or in installments.
    (g)(1) Processing deposit applications and payments. Upon receiving 
an application for deposit under this section, the agency shall 
determine whether the application meets the requirements of this 
section; compute the deposit, including interest; and advise the 
applicant of the total amount of deposit due.
    (2) The agency shall establish a deposit account showing the total 
amount due and a payment schedule (unless deposit is made in one lump 
sum) to record the date and amount of each payment.
    (3) If an eligible individual cannot make payment in one lump sum, 
the agency shall accept installment payments (by allotments or 
otherwise). The agency, however, is not required to

[[Page 327]]

accept individual checks in amounts less than $50.
    (4) Payments received by the agency shall be remitted to OPM 
immediately for deposit to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability

OPM in accordance with instructions issued by OPM.
    (h) Effect of deposit. An individual completing a deposit under this 
section whose entitlement to an annuity is based on a separation from 
service on or after February 10, 2004, will receive air traffic 
controller retirement credit for such service, for annuity entitlement 
and computation purposes, when OPM receives certification that the 
deposit has been paid in full, and the deposit payment is remitted to 
the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.

                  Subpart I_Nuclear Materials Couriers

    Source: 65 FR 2524, Jan. 18, 2000, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 842.901  Applicability and purpose.

    (a) This subpart contains regulations of the Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) to supplement--
    (1) 5 U.S.C. 8412(d) and (e), which establish special retirement 
eligibility for law enforcement officers, firefighters, air traffic 
controllers, and nuclear materials couriers employed under the Federal 
Employees Retirement System (FERS);
    (2) 5 U.S.C. 8422(a), pertaining to deductions;
    (3) 5 U.S.C. 8423(a), pertaining to Government contributions; and
    (4) 5 U.S.C. 8425, pertaining to mandatory retirement.
    (b) The regulations in this subpart are issued pursuant to the 
authority given to OPM in 5 U.S.C. 8461(g) to prescribe regulations to 
carry out the provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 84 and in 5 U.S.C. 1104 to 
delegate authority for personnel management to the heads of agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 842.902  Definitions.

    Agency head means the Secretary of Energy. For purposes of this 
subpart, agency head is also deemed to include the designated 
representative of the Secretary of Energy, except that the designated 
representative must be a department headquarters-level official who 
reports directly to the Secretary of Energy, or to the Deputy Secretary 
of Energy, and who is the sole such representative for the entire 
department.
    Employee means an employee as defined by 5 U.S.C. 8401(11).
    Nuclear materials courier means an employee of the Department of 
Energy, the duties of whose position are primarily to transport, and 
provide armed escort and protection during transit of, nuclear weapons, 
nuclear weapon components, strategic quantities of special nuclear 
materials or other materials related to national security, including an 
employee engaged in this activity who is transferred directly to a 
supervisory or administrative position within the same Department of 
Energy organization, after performing this activity for at least 3 
years. (See 5 U.S.C. 8331(27).)
    Primary duties means those duties of a position that--
    (1)(i) Are paramount in influence or weight; that is, constitute the 
basic reasons for the existence of the position;
    (ii) Occupy a substantial portion of the individual's working time 
over a typical work cycle; and
    (iii) Are assigned on a regular and recurring basis.
    (2) Duties that are of an emergency, incidental, or temporary nature 
cannot be considered ``primary'' even if they meet the substantial 
portion of time criterion. In general, if an employee spends an average 
of at least 50 percent of his or her time performing a duty or group of 
duties, they are his or her primary duties.
    Primary position means a position that is in an organization of the 
Department of Energy and whose primary duties are to transport, and 
provide armed escort and protection during transit of, nuclear weapons, 
nuclear weapon components, strategic quantities of special nuclear 
materials or

[[Page 328]]

other materials related to national security.
    Secondary position means a position that--
    (1) Is clearly in the nuclear materials transportation field;
    (2) Is in an organization of the Department of Energy having a 
nuclear materials transportation mission; and
    (3) Is either--
    (i) Supervisory; that is, a position whose primary duties are as a 
first-level supervisor of nuclear materials couriers in primary 
positions; or
    (ii) Administrative; that is, an executive, managerial, technical, 
semiprofessional, or professional position for which experience in a 
primary nuclear materials courier position is a prerequisite.


<R05>
Sec. 842.903  Conditions for coverage in primary positions.

    (a) An employee's service in a position that has been determined by 
the Secretary of the Department of Energy to be a primary nuclear 
materials courier position is covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
8412(d).
    (b) An employee who is not in a primary position, nor covered while 
in a secondary position, and who is detailed or temporarily promoted to 
a primary position is not covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
8412(d).


<R05>
Sec. 842.904  Conditions for coverage in secondary positions.

    (a) An employee's service in a position that has been determined by 
the Secretary of the Department of Energy to be a secondary nuclear 
materials courier position following 3 years of service in a primary 
nuclear materials courier position is covered under the provisions of 5 
U.S.C. 8412(d) if all of the following criteria are met:
    (1) The employee is transferred directly (i.e., without a break in 
service exceeding 3 days) from a primary position to a secondary 
position; and
    (2) If applicable, the employee has been continuously employed in 
secondary positions since transferring from a primary position without a 
break in service exceeding 3 days, except that a break in employment in 
secondary positions which begins with an involuntary separation (not for 
cause), within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8414(b)(1)(A), is not considered 
in determining whether the service in secondary positions is continuous 
for this purpose.
    (b) An employee who is not in a primary position, nor covered while 
in a secondary position, and who is detailed or temporarily promoted to 
a secondary position is not covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
8412(d).


<R05>
Sec. 842.905  Evidence.

    (a) The Secretary of Energy's determination under Sec. 842.903 that 
a position is a primary position must be based solely on the official 
position description of the position in question, and any other official 
description of duties and qualifications. The official documentation for 
the position must establish that it satisfies the requirements defined 
in Sec. 842.902.
    (b) A determination under Sec. 842.904 must be based on the 
official position description and any other evidence deemed appropriate 
by the agency head for making the determination.
    (c) If an employee is in a position not subject to the one-half 
percent higher withholding rate of 5 U.S.C. 8422(a)(3), and the employee 
does not, within 6 months after entering the position or after any 
significant change in the position, formally and in writing seek a 
determination from the employing agency that his or her service is 
properly covered by the higher withholding rate, the agency head's 
determination that the service was not so covered at the time of the 
service is presumed to be correct. This presumption may be rebutted by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the employee was unaware of his or 
her status or was prevented by cause beyond his or her control from 
requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service 
was performed.


<R05>
Sec. 842.906  Requests from individuals.

    (a) An employee who requests credit for service under 5 U.S.C. 
8412(d) bears the burden of proof with respect to that service, and must 
provide the employing agency with all pertinent information regarding 
duties performed.
    (b) An employee who is currently serving in a position that has not 
been

[[Page 329]]

approved as a primary or secondary position, but who believes that his 
or her service is creditable as service in a primary or secondary 
position may request the agency head to determine whether or not the 
employee's current service should be credited and, if it qualifies, 
whether it should be credited as service in a primary or secondary 
position. A written request for current service must be made within 6 
months after entering the position or after any significant change in 
the position.
    (c) A current or former employee (or the survivor of a former 
employee) who believes that a period of past service in an unapproved 
position qualifies as service in a primary or secondary position and 
meets the conditions for credit may request the agency head to determine 
whether or not the employee's past service should be credited and, if it 
qualifies, whether it should be credited as service in a primary or 
secondary position. A written request for past service must be made no 
later than December 31, 2000.
    (d) The agency head may extend the time limit for filing under 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section when, in the judgment of such 
agency head, the individual shows that he or she was prevented by 
circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within 
the time limit.


<R05>
Sec. 842.907  Withholding and contributions.

    (a) During service covered under the conditions established by Sec. 
842.903 (a) or (b), the Department of Energy will deduct and withhold 
from the employee's base pay the amounts required under 5 U.S.C. 
8422(a)(3) and submit that amount to OPM in accordance with payroll 
office instructions issued by OPM.
    (b) During service described in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
employing agency must submit to OPM the Government contributions 
required under 5 U.S.C. 8423(a) in accordance with payroll office 
instructions issued by OPM.
    (c) If the correct withholding and/or Government contributions are 
not timely submitted to OPM for any reason whatsoever, including cases 
in which it is finally determined that past service of a current or 
former employee was subject to the higher deduction and Government 
contribution rates, the employing agency must correct the error by 
submitting the correct amounts (including both employee and agency 
shares) to OPM as soon as possible. Even if the agency waives collection 
of the overpayment of pay under any waiver authority that may be 
available for this purpose, such as 5 U.S.C. 5584, or otherwise fails to 
collect the debt, the correct amount must still be submitted to OPM as 
soon as possible.
    (d) Upon proper application from an employee, former employee or 
eligible survivor of a former employee, an employing agency or former 
employing agency will pay a refund of erroneous additional withholdings 
for service that is found not to have been covered service. If an 
individual has paid to OPM a deposit or redeposit, including the 
additional amount required for covered service, and the deposit is later 
determined to be erroneous because the service was not covered service, 
OPM will pay the refund, upon proper application, to the individual, 
without interest.
    (e) The additional employee withholding and agency contributions for 
covered service properly made are not separately refundable, even in the 
event that the employee or his or her survivor does not qualify for a 
special annuity computation under 5 U.S.C. 8415(d).
    (f) While an employee who does not hold a primary or secondary 
position is detailed or temporarily promoted to such a position, the 
additional withholdings and agency contributions will not be made.
    (g) While an employee who holds a primary or secondary position is 
detailed or temporarily promoted to a position that is not a primary or 
secondary position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions 
will continue to be made.


<R05>
Sec. 842.908  Mandatory separation.

    (a) Effective on and after October 17, 1999, the mandatory 
separation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8425 apply to all nuclear materials 
couriers including those in secondary positions. A mandatory separation 
under 5 U.S.C. 8425 is

[[Page 330]]

not an adverse action under part 752 of this chapter or a removal action 
under part 359 of this chapter.
    (b) Exemptions from mandatory separation are subject to the 
conditions set forth under 5 U.S.C. 8425. An exemption may be granted at 
the sole discretion of the head of the employing agency or by the 
President in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8425(c).
    (c) In the event that an employee is separated mandatorily under 5 
U.S.C. 8425, or is separated for optional retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8412 
(d) or (e), and OPM finds that all or part of the minimum service 
required for entitlement to immediate annuity was in a position that did 
not meet the requirements of a primary or secondary position and the 
conditions set forth in this subpart or, if applicable, in part 831 of 
this chapter, such separation will be considered erroneous.


<R05>
Sec. 842.909  Review of decisions.

    The following decisions may be appealed to the Merit Systems 
Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board:
    (a) The final decision of the Department of Energy issued to an 
employee, former employee, or survivor as the result of a request for 
determination filed under Sec. 842.906; and
    (b) The final decision of the Department of Energy that a break in 
service referred to in Sec. 842.904(a)(2) did not begin with an 
involuntary separation within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8414(b)(1)(A).


<R05>
Sec. 842.910  Oversight of coverage determinations.

    (a) Upon deciding that a position is a nuclear materials courier 
position, the agency head must notify OPM (Attention: Associate Director 
for Retirement and Insurance) stating the title of each position, the 
number of incumbents, and whether the position is primary or secondary. 
The Director of OPM retains the authority to revoke the agency head's 
determination that a position is a primary or secondary position, or 
that an individual's service in any other position is creditable under 5 
U.S.C. 8412(d).
    (b) The Department of Energy must establish a file containing each 
coverage determination made by the agency head under Sec. 842.903 and 
Sec. 842.904, and all background material used in making the 
determination.
    (c) Upon request by OPM, the Department of Energy will make 
available the entire coverage determination file for OPM to audit to 
ensure compliance with the provisions of this subpart.
    (d) Upon request by OPM, the Department of Energy must submit to OPM 
a list of all covered positions and any other pertinent information 
requested.

    In this part--
    Accrued benefit means the accrued, unpaid annuity payable after the 
death of a retiree.
    Adult child means a child who has attained age 18.
    Basic annuity means the recurring payments (after the death of an 
employee, separated employee, or retiree) made to a current or former

children of an employee or retiree would receive under CSRS.
    Basic employee death benefit means the payment to the current spouse 
of a deceased employee equal to $15,000 (indexed under section 8462 of 
title 5, United States Code), plus one-half of the employee's final 
salary (or average salary, if higher).
    Child means a child as defined in section 8441(4) of title 5, United 
States Code.
    Compensationer means a person receiving recurring benefits under 
chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code.
    CSRS means subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States 
Code.
    Current spouse means a living person who is married to the employee, 
separated employee, or retiree at the time of the employee's, separated 
employee's or retiree's death. Current spouse includes a spouse who is 
legally separated but not divorced from the employee, separated 
employee, or retiree.
    Current spouse annuity means the basic annuity (and supplementary 
annuity, if any) payable to a current spouse.
    Duly appointed representative of the deceased employee's, separated 
employee's, retiree's, survivor's or Member's estate means an individual 
named in an order of a court having jurisdiction over the estate of the 
deceased which grants the individual the authority to receive, or the 
right to possess, the property of the deceased; and also means, where 
the law of the domicile of the deceased has provided for the 
administration of estates through alternative procedures which dispense 
with the need for a

[[Page 332]]

court order, an individual who demonstrates that he or she is entitled 
to receive, or possess, the property of the deceased under the terms of 
those alternative procedures.
    Employee means an employee as defined in section 8401(11) of title 
5, United States Code, and a Member as defined in section 8401(20) of 
title 5, United States Code. ``Employee'' includes a person who has

    FERS means chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code.
    Final annual rate of basic pay means the basic pay that an employee 
or Member would receive in a year at the current rate of pay. A pay rate 
other than an annual salary is converted to an annual rate by 
multiplying the prescribed rate by the number of pay units in a 52-week 
work year.
    (a) The annual pay of a part-time (regularly scheduled) employee is 
the product of the employee's final hourly rate of pay and the higher 
of--
    (1) The number of hours that the employee was entitled to basic pay 
whether in a duty or paid leave status (not to exceed 2000 for Postal 
employees or 2080 for non-postal employees) in the 52-week work year 
immediately preceding the end of the last pay period in which the 
employee was in a pay status; or
    (2) The number of hours in the employee's regularly scheduled tour 
of duty in a 52-week work year.
    (b) The annual pay of an intermittent (not regularly scheduled) 
employee is the product of the employee's final hourly rate of pay and 
the number of hours that the employee was entitled to basic pay whether 
in a duty or paid leave status (not to exceed 2000 for Postal employees 
or 2080 for non-Postal employees) in the 52-week work year immediately 
preceding the end of the last pay period in which the employee was in a 
pay status.
    (c) If the part-time or intermittent employee's current appointment 
began less than 52 weeks prior to the end of the last pay period in 
which the employee was in a pay status, the number of hours that the 
employee was entitled to basic pay is computed by multiplying the number 
of hours that the employee was paid basic pay by a fraction whose 
numerator is 52 and whose denominator is the number of weeks between the 
date of appointment and the end of the last pay period in which the 
employee was in a pay status.
    (d) The annual pay for customs officers is the sum of the employee's 
general schedule pay, locality pay, and the lesser of--
    (1) Two times the employee's final hourly rate of pay times the 
number of hours for which the employee was paid two times salary as 
compensation for overtime inspectional service under section 5(a) of the 
Act of February 11, 1911 (19 U.S.C. 261 and 267) plus three times the 
employee's final hourly rate of pay times the number of hours for which 
the employee was paid three times salary as compensation for overtime 
inspectional service under section 5(a) in the 52-week work year 
immediately preceding the end of the last pay period in which the 
employee was in pay status; or
    (2) $12,500.
    Former spouse means a living person who was married for at least 9 
months to an employee, separated employee, or retiree who performed at 
least 18 months of service creditable under FERS and whose marriage to 
the employee, separated employee, or retiree was terminated before the 
death of the employee, separated employee, or retiree.
    Former spouse annuity means the basic annuity (and supplementary 
annuity, if any) payable to a former spouse.
    Insurable interest beneficiary means a person designated to receive 
a survivor annuity under Sec. 842.605 of this chapter.
    Insurable interest reduction means the reduction in a retiree's 
annuity because the retiree elected to provide a survivor annuity to an 
insurable interest beneficiary.
    Marriage means a marriage recognized in law or equity under the 
whole law of the jurisdiction with the most significant interest in the 
marital status of the employee, Member, or retiree. If a jurisdiction 
would recognize

[[Page 333]]

more than one marriage in law or equity, the Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) will recognize only one marriage but will defer to the 
local courts to determine which marriage should be recognized.
    Minimum retirement age means the minimum retirement age as defined 
in Sec. 842.202 of this chapter.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

title 5, United States Code, for awarding a former spouse annuity.

payments under FERS based on service by the employee or Member. Retiree,

spouse, child, or person with an insurable interest receiving a survivor 
annuity. Retiree for purposes of determining a person's status at the

and had met all the requirements to receive an annuity including having 
filed an application for the annuity prior to his or her death.
    Separated employee means a former employee who has been separated 
from the service but who has not met all the requirements for retirement 
under FERS or who has not filed an application for retirement under 
FERS.
    Step-child means a child who is the issue of a current or former 
spouse of the employee or retiree but is not the issue of the employee 
or retiree. A child is not a step-child unless the relationship between 
the employee or retiree and the child's parent is a marriage.

8442(f) of title 5, United States Code.

rate which, for any calendar year, will be equal to the overall average 
yield to the Civil Service Retirement Fund during the preceding fiscal 
year from all obligations purchased by the Secretary of the Treasury 
during that fiscal year under section 8348 (c), (d), and (e) of title 5, 
United States Code, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. 
Interest on deductions and deposits does not include interest--
    (1) If the service covered by the contributions totals 1 year or 
less; or
    (2) For a fractional part of a month in the total service.

    Someone entitled to an annuity for purposes of Sec. Sec. 843.203 
and 843.204 includes a child, even if the amount of the child's annuity

Sec. 843.304  Commencing and terminating dates of survivor annuities.

    (a) A current or former spouse annuity under this subpart commences 
on the day after the death of the person on whose service the annuity is 
based.
    (b) A current or former spouse annuity under this subpart terminates 
on the last day of the month before the current or former spouse 
remarries before age 55 or dies.
    (c) A current spouse annuity under this subpart terminated for 
reasons other than death may be restored under Sec. 843.305.
    (d) A survivor annuity accrues on a daily basis, one-thirtieth of 
the monthly rate constituting the daily rate. An annuity does not accrue 
for the 31st day of any month, except in the initial month if the 
survivor's (of a deceased employee) annuity commences on the 31st day. 
For accrual purposes, the last day of a 28-day month constitutes 3 days 
and the last day of a 29-day month constitutes 2 days.


<R05>
Sec. 843.305  Reinstatement.

    (a) If a current spouse annuity is terminated because of a 
remarriage of the recipient, the annuity is reinstated on the day of the 
termination of the remarriage by death, annulment, or divorce if--
    (1) The surviving spouse elects to receive this annuity instead of 
another survivor benefit to which he or she may be entitled (under FERS 
or another retirement system for Government employees) by reason of the 
remarriage; and
    (2) Any lump sum paid on termination of the annuity is repaid (in a 
single payment or by withholding payment of the annuity until the amount 
of the lump sum has accrued).
    (b) If present or future entitlement to a former spouse annuity 
terminates because of remarriage of the recipient or potential 
recipient, the entitlement is permanently extinguished. An annulment of 
the remarriage does not reinstate the entitlement.


<R05>
Sec. 843.306  Basic benefits on death of a non-disability retiree.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 843.307 and 843.312, and 
paragraph (b) of this section, if an annuitant dies and is survived by a 
current spouse, the current spouse is entitled to a current spouse 
annuity equal to 50 percent of an annuity computed under subpart D of 
part 842 of this chapter, with respect to the retiree, unless--
    (1) The right to a current spouse annuity was waived under Sec. 
842.603 of this chapter (and no election was subsequently made under 
Sec. 842.610 of this chapter nullifying the waiver); or
    (2) In the case of a marriage after retirement, the retiree did not 
file an election under Sec. 842.612 of this chapter.
    (b) A current spouse who married the retiree after retirement is 
entitled to an annuity under paragraph (a) of this section only upon 
electing this annuity instead of any other survivor benefit to which 
such spouse may be entitled under this subpart, subpart B of this part, 
or under another retirement system for Government employees.

<R05>
Sec. 843.307  Basic benefits on death of a disability retiree.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 843.312, the widow or widower of a 
retiree who retired based on disability under part 844 of this chapter 
is entitled to a current spouse annuity based on the service of the 
disability annuitant computed under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b)(1) In the case of a current spouse entitled to an annuity based 
on the service of a disability annuitant who died after attaining age 
62, the amount of the current spouse annuity is one-half of the amount 
of the annuity to

[[Page 338]]

which such disability annuitant was entitled as computed under part 844 
of this chapter (including any appropriate reduction under Sec. 
844.302(b)(2) or (c)(2) of this chapter, and any adjustments under 
section 8462 of title 5, United States Code) as of the day before the 
date of the disability annuitant's death.
    (2) In the case of a current spouse entitled to an annuity based on 
the service of a disability annuitant who dies before age 62, the amount 
of the current spouse annuity equals 50 percent of the amount to which 
the disability annuitant would have been entitled under Sec. 844.303 of 
this chapter, if the disability annuitant had attained age 62 on the day 
before his or her death. However, in determining the amount under Sec. 
844.303(a) of this chapter, creditable service includes the period of 
time between the date of death and the date of the 62nd anniversary of 
the birth of the annuitant, but average pay is adjusted (under section 
8462 of title 5, United States Code) only through date of death.

<R05>
Sec. 843.308  Supplementary benefits on death of a retiree.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 843.312 and paragraph (d) of this 
section, a current spouse of a deceased retiree who is entitled to a 
current spouse annuity based on the retiree's service is also entitled 
to a supplementary annuity.
    (b) The amount of the supplementary annuity under this section 
equals the lesser of--
    (1) The amount by which the survivor's assumed CSRS annuity exceeds 
the annuity payable to the current spouse under Sec. 843.306 or Sec. 
843.307; or
    (2) The amount equal to the widow's or widower's insurance benefits 
that would be payable to him or her under title II of the Social 
Security Act (without regard to section 202(f)(2) of the Act) based on 
the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant, except 
that for purposes of this calculation--
    (i) The social security earnings test (section 203 of the Act) does 
not apply; and
    (ii) The benefit is computed--
    (A) As of the date on which the retiree dies; and
    (B) As if the survivor had attained age 60 and made application for 
those benefits under subsection (e) or (f) of section 202 of the Act; 
and
    (iii) In computing the primary insurance amount--
    (A) For years of service under FERS, only the retiree's basic pay is 
considered to be wages; and
    (B) For each year after age 21 for which the retiree did not work 
under FERS, the retiree's wages are deemed to equal the National Average 
Wage Index (as determined by the Commissioner of the Social Security 
Administration) corresponding to that year, multiplied by the retiree's 
basic pay for his or her first full year of employment under FERS, 
divided by the National Average Wage Index corresponding to the 
retiree's first full year of employment under FERS.
    (c)(1) The supplementary annuity terminates at the beginning of the 
month in which the survivor first satisfies the minimum age requirement 
under section 202(e)(1)(B)(i) or 202(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Social Security 
Act.
    (2) The supplementary annuity is not payable to a survivor--
    (i) Who would not be entitled to benefits under section 202 (e) or 
(f) of the Social Security Act based on the wages and self-employment 
income of the deceased annuitant (determined, as of the date of the 
annuitant's death, as if the survivor had attained age 60 and made 
appropriate application for benefits, but without regard to any 
restriction relating to remarriage); or
    (ii) For any calendar month in which the survivor is entitled (or 
would, on proper application, be entitled) to benefits under section 
202(g) of the Social Security Act (relating to mother's and father's 
insurance benefits), or under section 202 (e) or (f) of the Act by 
reason of having become disabled, based on the wages and self-employment 
income of the deceased annuitant.
    (d) For purposes of this section--
    (1) ``Assumed CSRS annuity,'' as used in the case of a survivor, 
means the amount of the annuity to which such survivor would be entitled 
under CSRS based on the service of the deceased annuitant, which is 
determined--

[[Page 339]]

    (i) As of the day after the date of the annuitant's death;
    (ii) As if the survivor had made appropriate application therefor; 
and
    (iii) As if the service of the deceased annuitant were creditable 
under CSRS.
    (2) ``Basic pay'' means ``basic pay'' as defined in section 8401 of 
title 5, United States Code.
    (e) An amount payable under this section will be adjusted under 
section 8462 of title 5, United States Code, and will be treated in the 
same way as an amount payable under Sec. 843.306 or Sec. 843.307.

Sec. 843.309  Basic employee death benefit.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 843.312, if an employee or Member 
dies after completing at least 18 months of civilian service creditable 
under subpart C of part 842 of this chapter and is survived by a current 
spouse who meets the requirements of Sec. 843.303, the current spouse

    (1) Fifty percent of the final annual rate of basic pay (or of the 
average pay, if higher) of the employee; and
    (2) Fifteen thousand dollars as adjusted under section 8462 of title 
5, United States Code.
    (b) The current spouse may elect to receive the basic employee death 
benefit in one of the following forms--
    (1) A one-time payment; or
    (2) For deaths occurring on or after October 1, 2004, 36 equal 
monthly installments of 3.03771 percent of the amount of the basic 
employee death benefit.
    (c)(1)(i) A current spouse who has elected to receive the basic 
employee death benefit in 36 installments under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section may elect to receive the remaining portion of the basic employee 
death benefit in one payment.
    (ii) The election to receive the remaining portion of the basic 
employee death benefit in one payment must be in writing and signed by 
the current spouse.
    (iii) The election to receive the remaining portion of the basic 
employee death benefit in one payment is irrevocable when OPM authorizes 
the payment.
    (2) Upon the death of a current spouse who was receiving the basic 
employee death benefit in 36 installments under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, the remaining portion of the basic employee death benefit will 
be paid as one payment to the estate of the current spouse.
    (3) As used in this section, ``remaining portion of the basic 
employee death benefit'' means the amount of the basic employee death 
benefit computed under paragraph (a) of this section that has not been 
paid. The amount is the remaining principal computed based on an 
amortization schedule with the initial principal equal to the amount 
computed under paragraph (a) of this section and the interest rate based 
on the applicable factor under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

Government employees.
    (c) A former spouse who marries a retiree is entitled to a former

<R05>
Sec. 843.401  Purpose.

    This subpart explains the survivor benefits payable under FERS to 
children based on the deaths of employees and retirees.


<R05>
Sec. 843.402  Eligibility requirements.

    A surviving child of an employee or retiree who dies after 
completing 18 months of civilian service creditable under FERS is 
entitled to an annuity under this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 843.403  Proof of parentage.

    (a) A judicial determination of parentage conclusively establishes 
the paternity of a child.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, a child 
born to the wife of a married person is presumed to be the child of the 
wife's husband. This presumption may be rebutted only by clear and 
convincing evidence that the husband is not the father of the child.
    (c) When paternity is not established under paragraph (a) or (b) of 
this section, paternity is determined by a preponderance of the credible 
evidence as defined in Sec. 1201.56(c)(2) of this title.

of the employee's or retirees death; or
    (4) A recognized natural child for whom a judicial determination of 
support was obtained; or
    (5) A recognized natural child to whose support the employee or 
retiree made regular and substantial contributions.
    (b) The following are examples of proofs of regular and substantial 
support. More than one of the following proofs may be required to show 
support of a natural child who did not live with the employee or retiree 
in a regular parent-child relationship and for whom a judicial 
determination of support was not obtained.
    (1) Evidence of eligibility as a dependent child for benefits under 
other State or Federal programs;
    (2) Proof of inclusion of the child as a dependent on the decedent's 
income tax returns for the years immediately before the employee's or 
retiree's death;
    (3) Cancelled checks, money orders, or receipts for periodic 
payments received from the employee or retiree for or on behalf of the 
child;
    (4) Evidence of goods or services that show regular contributions of 
considerable value;
    (5) Proof of coverage of the child as a family member under the 
employee's or retiree's Federal Employees Health Benefits enrollment; 
and
    (6) Other proof of a similar nature that OPM may find to be 
sufficient to demonstrate support or parentage.
    (c) Survivor benefits may be denied--
    (1) If evidence shows that the deceased employee or retiree did not 
recognize the claimant as his or her own despite a willingness to 
support the child; or

[[Page 343]]

    (2) If evidence casts doubt upon the parentage of the claimant, 
despite the deceased employee's or retiree's recognition and support of 
the child.


<R05>
Sec. 843.407  Disabilities.

    A child is eligible for continued annuity because the child is 
incapable of self-support if the Social Security Administration finds 
that the child is eligible for continued social security child's 
benefits because the child is incapable of self-support.


<R05>
Sec. 843.408  Commencing and terminating dates of child annuities.

    (a) An annuity under this subpart--
    (1) Commences on the day after the retiree or employee dies;
    (2) Commences or resumes on the first day of the month in which the 
child later becomes or again becomes a student as described by Sec. 
843.313, if any lump sum paid is returned to the Civil Service 
Retirement Fund; or
    (3) Commences or resumes on the first day of the month in which the 
child later becomes or again becomes incapable of self-support because 
of a mental or physical disability incurred before age 18 (or a later 
recurrence of such disability), if any lump sum is returned to the Fund.
    (b) An annuity under this subpart terminates on the last day of the 
month before the child--
    (1) Becomes 18 years of age unless he or she is a student as 
described in Sec. 843.410 or is incapable of self-support;
    (2) Becomes capable of self-support after becoming 18 years of age 
unless he or she is a student as described in Sec. 843.410;
    (3) Becomes 22 years of age if he or she is a student as described 
in Sec. 843.410 and--
    (i) Capable of self-support; or
    (ii) Incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical 
disability incurred after age 18;
    (4) Ceases to be such a student as described in Sec. 843.410 after 
becoming 18 years of age unless he or she is incapable of self-support; 
or
    (5) Dies or marries.
    (c) A survivor annuity accrues on a daily basis, one-thirtieth of 
the monthly rate constituting the daily rate. An annuity does not accrue 
for the 31st day of any month, except in the initial month if the 
survivor's (of a deceased employee) annuity commences on the 31st day. 
For accrual purposes, the last day of a 28-day month constitutes 3 days 
and the last day of a 29-day month constitutes 2 days.


<R05>
Sec. 843.409  Rates of annuities.

    (a) For each month, the amount of annuity payable to each surviving 
child under this subpart is--
    (1) The difference between the basic child's annuity rate for that 
month and the total amount of child's insurance benefits under title II 
of the Social Security Act payable for that month to all children of the 
employee or retiree based on the total earnings (including any non-
Federal wages or self employment subject to FICA taxes) of the employee 
or retiree;
    (2) Divided by the total number of children entitled to annuity 
based on the service of that employee or retiree.
    (b) On the death of the current spouse or the former spouse or 
termination of the annuity of a child, the annuity of any other child or 
children is recomputed and paid as though the spouse, former spouse, or 
child had not survived the former employee or Member.


<R05>
Sec. 843.410  Annuity for a child age 18 to 22 during full-time school attendance.

    (a) General requirements for an annuity. (1) For a child age 18 to 
22 to be eligible to receive an annuity as a full-time student, the 
child must also meet all other requirements applicable to qualify for an 
annuity by a child who has not attained age 18.
    (2) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, OPM must receive certification, in a form prescribed by OPM, 
that the child is regularly pursuing a full-time course of study in an 
accredited institution.
    (b) Full-time course of study. (1) Generally, a full-time course of 
study is a noncorrespondence course which, if successfully completed, 
will lead to completion of the education within the period generally 
accepted as minimum for completion, by a full-time day student, of the 
academic or training program concerned.

[[Page 344]]

    (2) A certification by an accredited institution that the student's 
workload is sufficient to constitute a full-time course of study for the 
program in which the student is enrolled is prima facie evidence that 
the student is pursuing a full-time course of study.
    (c) Certification of school attendance. (1) OPM may periodically 
request the recipient of a child's annuity payments to furnish 
certification of school attendance. The certification must be completed 
in the form prescribed by OPM.
    (2) If OPM requests the recipient of a child's annuity payments to 
provide a self-certification of school attendance, the recipient must 
complete and sign the certification form.
    (3) If OPM requests the recipient of a child's annuity payments to 
provide a certification by the school, the certification must be signed 
by an official who is either in charge of the school or in charge of the 
school's records. OPM will not accept certification forms signed by 
instructors, counselors, aides, roommates, or others not in charge of 
the school or the records.
    (i) If the educational institution is above the high school level, 
the certification must be signed by the president or chancellor, vice 
president or vice chancellor, dean or assistant dean, registrar or 
administrator, assistant registrar or assistant administrator, or the 
equivalent.
    (ii) If the educational institution is at the high school level, the 
certification must be signed by the superintendent of schools, assistant 
superintendent of schools, principal, vice principal, assistant 
principal, or the equivalent.
    (iii) If the educational institution is a technical or trade school, 
the certification must be signed by the president, vice president, 
director, assistant director, or the equivalent.
    (4) OPM will accept a facsimile signature of a school official only 
if it is accompanied by a raised seal of the institution or other 
evidence clearly demonstrating the authenticity of the certification and 
making unauthorized use of the signature stamp unlikely.
    (d) Continuation of annuity during interim breaks. A child's annuity 
continues during interim breaks between school years if the following 
conditions are satisfied:
    (1) The student must have been a full-time student at the end of the 
school term immediately before the break.
    (2) The break between the end of the last term of full-time 
attendance and the return to full-time attendance must not exceed 5 
months. (See Sec. 841.109 of this chapter, concerning calculation of 
this time period.)
    (3) The recipient of a child's annuity payments must show that the 
student has a bona fide intent to return to school as a full-time 
student immediately after the break. The full-time certification for the 
period term and the certification (in a form prescribed by OPM) by the 
recipient of a child's annuity payments that the student intends to 
return to school (immediately after the break) as a full-time student 
constitute prima facie evidence of a bona fide intent to return to 
school.
    (e) Benefits after age 22. (1) A student's eligibility for a child's 
annuity terminates based on reaching age 22 on--
    (i) June 30 of the calendar year of the child's 22nd birthday if the 
child's birthday is before July 1; or
    (ii) The last day of the month before the child's 22nd birthday if 
the child's birthday occurs after June 30 but before September 1 of the 
calendar year; or
    (iii) June 30 of the year after the one in which the child attains 
age 22 if the child's birthday is after August 31 of the calendar year.
    (2)(i) An otherwise eligible child who becomes a full-time student 
after his or her 22nd birthday but before the date the annuity 
terminates under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is eligible for 
annuity while he or she is a full-time student until the termination 
date under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (ii) An otherwise eligible child who is a full-time student, and 
whose parent dies after the child's 22nd birthday but before the date 
the annuity terminates under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, is 
eligible for annuity while he or she is a full-time student after the 
death of

[[Page 345]]

the parent until the termination date under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.

survivor's (of a deceased employee) annuity commences on the 31st day. 
For accrual purposes, the last day of a 28-day month constitutes 3 days 
and the last day of a 29-day month constitutes 2 days.


<R05>

<R04>
                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 844.101  Purpose.

    This part establishes the requirements under the Federal Employees' 
Retirement System (FERS) for eligibility to receive a disability 
annuity, application procedures for disability annuities, rules for 
computing a disability annuity, and the conditions and

[[Page 346]]

procedures under which a disability annuity is terminated and 
reinstated.


<R05>
Sec. 844.102  Definitions.

    In this part:
    Accommodation means a reasonable adjustment made to an employee's 
job or work environment that enables the employee to perform the duties 
of the position. Accommodation may include modifying the worksite; 
adjusting the work schedule; restructuring the job; obtaining or 
modifying equipment or devices; providing interpreters, readers, or 
personal assistants; and retraining the employee.
    Basic pay means the pay an employee receives that is subject to 
deductions under FERS.
    Commuting area has the meaning given the term ``local commuting 
area'' in Sec. 351.203 of this chapter.
    Disabled and disability means unable or inability, because of 
disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the 
employee's current position.
    FERS means the Federal Employees' Retirement System established 
under chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code.
    Medical condition means a health impairment resulting from a disease 
or injury, including a psychiatric disease. This is the same definition 
of ``medical condition'' that is found in Sec. 339.104 of this chapter.
    Medical documentation means a statement from a licensed physician, 
which may be supplemented by a statement from another appropriate 
practitioner, that provides information OPM considers necessary to 
determine an individual's entitlement to benefits under this part. Such 
a statement must meet the criteria set forth in Sec. 339.104 of this 
chapter.
    Military reserve technician has the same meaning given this term in 
5 U.S.C. 8401(30).
    OPM means the Office of Personnel Management.
    Permanent position means an appointment without time limitation.
    Physician and practitioner have the same meaning given these terms 
in Sec. 339.104 of this chapter.
    Qualified for reassignment means able to meet the minimum 
requirements for the grade and series of the vacant position in 
question.
    Same grade or pay level means, in regard to a vacant position within 
the same pay as the position the employee currently occupies, the same 
grade and an equivalent amount of basic pay. A position under a 
different pay system or schedule is at the same pay level if the 
representative rate, as defined in Sec. 532.401 of this chapter, equals 
the representative rate of the employee's current position.
    Useful and efficient service means acceptable performance of the 
critical or essential elements of the position; and satisfactory conduct 
and attendance.
    Vacant position means an unoccupied position of the same grade or 
pay level and tenure for which the employee is qualified for 
reassignment that is located in the same commuting area and, except in 
the case of a military reserve technician, is serviced by the same 
appointing authority of the employing agency. The vacant position must 
be full time, unless the employee's current position is less than full 
time, in which case the vacant position must have a work schedule of no 
less time than that of the current position. In the case of an employee 
of the United States Postal Service, a vacant position does not include 
a position in a different craft or a position to which reassignment 
would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining 
agreement covering the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 844.103  Eligibility.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, an 
individual must meet the following requirements in order to receive a 
disability annuity:
    (1) The individual must have completed at least 18 months of 
civilian service that is creditable under FERS, as defined in Sec. 
842.304 of this chapter;
    (2) The individual must, while employed in a position subject to 
FERS, have become disabled because of a medical condition, resulting in 
a deficiency in performance, conduct, or attendance, or if there is no 
such deficiency, the disabling medical condition must be incompatible 
with either useful and efficient service or retention in the position;

[[Page 347]]

    (3) The disabling medical condition must be expected to continue for 
at least 1 year from the date the application for disability retirement 
is filed;
    (4) Accommodation of the disabling medical condition in the position 
held must be unreasonable; and
    (5) The individual must not have declined an offer of reassignment 
to a vacant position.
    (b) The employing agency must consider a disability applicant for 
reassignment to any vacant position. The agency must certify to the 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) either that there is no vacant 
position or that, although it made no offer of reassignment, it 
considered the individual for a vacant position. If an agency offers a 
reassignment and the individual declines the offer, the individual may 
appeal the agency's determination that the individual is not disabled 
for the position in question to the Merit Systems Protection Board under 
5 U.S.C. 7701.
    (c)(1) Paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4) of this section do not apply 
to a military reserve technician who retires under 5 U.S.C. 8456.
    (2) An individual who separates from employment as a military 
reserve technician under circumstances set forth in 5 U.S.C. 8456(a)(1) 
after reaching age 50 and completing 25 years of service is not entitled 
to a disability annuity under this part, but is entitled to an annuity 
under Sec. 842.210 of this chapter.
    (3) A former military reserve technician is not entitled to an 
annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8456 based on service as a technician if the 
technician is subsequently appointed to another position in the Federal 
Government.


<R05>
Sec. 844.104  Administrative review of OPM decisions.

    Any individual whose rights or interests under FERS are affected by 
an initial decision of OPM may request OPM to review its decision under 
Sec. 841.306.


<R05>
Sec. 844.105  Relationship to workers' compensation.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an 
individual who is eligible for both an annuity under part 842 or 844 of 
this chapter and compensation for injury or disability under subchapter 
I of chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code (other than a scheduled 
award under 5 U.S.C. 8107(c)), covering the same period of time must 
elect to receive either the annuity or compensation.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, 
an individual may concurrently receive an annuity based on the 
individual's service under part 842 or 844 of this chapter and a benefit 
under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code, on 
account of the death of another individual. An individual may also 
receive an annuity under part 843 of this chapter and compensation for 
injury or disability to himself or herself under such subchapter I 
covering the same period of time.
    (c) An individual who elects to receive compensation payments under 
paragraph (a) of this section and who has not received a refund of 
contributions under Sec. 843.202 retains the right to elect to receive 
an annuity under part 842 or 844, as the case may be, in the event that 
the individual's compensation payments cease or are reduced.


<R05>
Sec. 844.106  Disability annuities which include credit for service with a nonappropriated fund instrumentality.

    A disability annuity that includes credit for service with a 
nonappropriated fund instrumentality performed after December 31, 1965, 
based on an election under 5 CFR part 847, subpart D, is computed under 
5 CFR part 847, subpart F.

<R04>
            Subpart B_Applications for Disability Retirement


<R05>
Sec. 844.201  General requirements.

    (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this 
section, an application for disability retirement is timely only if it 
is filed with the employing agency before the employee or Member 
separates from service, or with the former employing agency or OPM 
within 1 year thereafter.
    (2) An application for disability retirement that is filed with OPM, 
an employing agency or former employing

[[Page 348]]

agency by personal delivery is considered filed on the date on which 
OPM, the employing agency or former employing agency receives it. The 
date of filing by facsimile is the date of the facsimile. The date of 
filing by mail is determined by the postmark date; if no legible 
postmark date appears on the mailing, the application is presumed to 
have been mailed 5 days before its receipt, excluding days on which OPM, 
the employing agency or former employing agency, as appropriate, is 
closed for business. The date of filing by commercial overnight delivery 
is the date the application is given to the overnight delivery service.
    (3) An application for disability retirement that is filed with OPM 
or the applicant's former employing agency within 1 year after the 
employee's separation, and that is incompletely executed or submitted in 
a letter or other form not prescribed by OPM, is deemed timely filed. 
OPM will not adjudicate the application or make payment until the 
application is filed on a form prescribed by OPM.
    (4) OPM may waive the 1-year time limit if the employee or Member is 
mentally incompetent on the date of separation or within 1 year 
thereafter, in which case the individual or his or her representative 
must file the application with the former employing agency or OPM within 
1 year after the date the individual regains competency or a court 
appoints a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.
    (b)(1) Before payment of a disability annuity under this part can be 
authorized, the applicant must provide OPM with:
    (i) Satisfactory evidence that the applicant has filed an 
application for disability insurance benefits under section 223 of the 
Social Security Act; or
    (ii) An official statement from the Social Security Administration 
that the individual is not insured for disability insurance benefits as 
defined in section 223(c)(1) of the Social Security Act.
    (2) A disability retirement application under this part will be 
dismissed when OPM is notified by the Social Security Administration 
that the application referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section 
has been withdrawn. All rights to an annuity under this part terminate 
upon withdrawal of an application for social security disability 
benefits.
    (c) An agency may consider the existence of a pending disability 
retirement application when deciding whether and when to take other 
personnel actions. An employee's filing for disability retirement does 
not require the agency to delay any appropriate personnel action.

[55 FR 6598, Feb. 26, 1990, as amended at 63 FR 17050, Apr. 8, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 844.202  Agency-filed disability retirement applications.

    (a) Basis for filing an application for an employee. An agency must 
file an application for disability retirement of an employee who has 18 
months of Federal civilian service when all of the following conditions 
are met:
    (1) The agency has issued a decision to remove the employee;
    (2) The agency concludes, after its review of medical documentation, 
that the cause for unacceptable performance, attendance, or conduct is 
disease or injury;
    (3) The employee is institutionalized, or the agency concludes, 
based on a review of medical and other information, that the employee is 
incapable of making a decision to file an application for disability 
retirement;
    (4) The employee has no personal representative or guardian; and
    (5) The employee has no immediate family member who is willing to 
file an application on his or her behalf.
    (b) Agency procedures. (1) When an agency issues a decision to 
remove an employee and not all of the conditions described in paragraph 
(a) of this section have been satisfied, but the removal is based on 
reasons apparently caused by a medical condition, the agency must advise 
the employee in writing of his or her possible eligibility for 
disability retirement and of the time limit for filing an application.
    (2) If all of the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this 
section have been met, the agency must inform the employee in writing at 
the same time it informs the employee of its removal decision, or at any 
time before the separation is effected, that:

[[Page 349]]

    (i) The agency is submitting a disability retirement application on 
the employee's behalf to OPM;
    (ii) The employee may review any medical information in accordance 
with Sec. 294.106(d) of this chapter; and
    (iii) The action does not affect the employee's right to submit a 
voluntary application for disability retirement or any other retirement 
benefit to which the employee is entitled under FERS.
    (3) When an agency submits an application for disability retirement 
to OPM on behalf of an employee, it must provide OPM with copies of the 
decision to remove the employee, the medical documentation, and any 
other documents needed to show that the cause for removal results from a 
medical condition. Following separation, the agency must provide OPM 
with a copy of the documentation of the separation.
    (c) OPM procedures. (1) OPM will not act on any application for 
disability retirement filed by an agency on behalf of an employee until 
it receives the appropriate documentation of the separation. When OPM 
receives a complete application for disability retirement under this 
section, it will notify the former employee that it has received the 
application and that he or she may submit medical documentation. OPM 
will determine entitlement to disability benefits under Sec. 844.203.
    (2) OPM will cancel any disability retirement when a final decision 
of an administrative authority or court reverses the removal action and 
orders the reinstatement of an employee to the agency rolls.


<R05>
Sec. 844.203  Supporting documentation.

    (a) An individual or agency filing an application for disability 
retirement is responsible for providing OPM with the evidence described 
in Sec. 844.201(b)(1), as well as whatever documentation OPM requires 
in order to determine whether the individual meets the eligibility 
requirements set forth in Sec. 844.103. The documentation must be 
provided in a form prescribed by OPM. Failure to submit the 
documentation required is grounds for dismissing the application. It is 
also the responsibility of the disability annuitant to obtain and submit 
evidence OPM requires to show continuing entitlement to disability 
benefits. Unless OPM orders an examination by a physician of its choice 
under paragraph (b) of this section, the cost of providing medical 
documentation rests with the applicant or disability annuitant.
    (b) OPM may offer the applicant a medical examination when it 
determines that an independent evaluation of medical evidence is needed 
in order to make a decision regarding an application for a disability 
annuity or a disability annuitant's entitlement to continuing benefits. 
The medical examination will be conducted by a medical officer of the 
United States or a qualified physician or board of physicians designated 
by OPM. The applicant's refusal to submit to an examination is grounds 
for dismissal of the application or termination of payments to an 
annuitant.
    (c)(1) OPM will review the documentation submitted under paragraph 
(a) of this section to determine whether the individual has met the 
eligibility requirements set forth in Sec. 844.103. OPM will issue its 
decision in writing to the individual and to the employing agency. The 
decision will include a statement of OPM's findings and conclusions and 
an explanation of the applicant's right to request reconsideration or 
MSPB review under Sec. 844.104.
    (2) OPM may rescind a decision to allow an application for 
disability retirement at any time if OPM determines that the original 
decision was erroneous due to fraud, misstatement of fact, or upon the 
acquisition of additional medical or other documentation. OPM will 
provide the individual and the employing agency with written 
notification of the rescission, including a statement of OPM's findings 
and conclusions and an explanation of the individual's right to request 
reconsideration or MSPB review under Sec. 844.104.
    (d) Subject to 5 U.S.C. 552a, any supporting documentation provided 
to OPM under this section may be shared with the Social Security 
Administration and the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs of the 
U.S. Department of Labor.

               Subpart C_Computation of Disability Annuity


<R05>
Sec. 844.301  Commencing date of disability annuity.

    A disability annuity under this part commences on the day after the 
employee separates or the day after pay ceases and the employee meets 
the requirements for title to an annuity.


<R05>
Sec. 844.302  Computation of disability annuity before age 62.

    (a) For the purposes of this subpart, the ``adjusted social security 
disability benefit'' is the benefit to which an annuitant is entitled 
under section 223 of the Social Security Act:
    (1) For the month in which the annuity under this part commences, or 
is reinstated under Sec. 844.405, or, if later, the first month for 
which the annuitant is entitled to both an annuity under this part and a 
social security disability benefit;
    (2) Including, where appropriate, a reduction under section 224 of 
the Social Security Act, based on the amount of the disability annuity 
under this subpart without regard to paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(2) of 
this section; and
    (3) Adjusted by each cost-of-living increase effective under 5 
U.S.C. 8462(b) beginning with the later of the month after the 12-month 
period referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or the first 
month for which the annuitant is entitled to both an annuity under this 
part and a social security disability benefit.
    (b)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this part, the annuity 
payable under this subpart until the end of the 12th month beginning 
after the annuity commences (or is reinstated under Sec. 844.405) is 
equal to 60 percent of the annuitant's average pay.
    (2) For months for which the annuitant is also entitled to a social 
security disability benefit, the amount computed under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section is reduced by 100 percent of the annuitant's adjusted 
social security disability benefit.
    (c)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this part, the annuity under 
this subpart after the period described in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section is equal to 40 percent of the annuitant's average pay.
    (2) For months after the period described in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section for which the annuitant is also entitled to a social 
security disability benefit, the amount computed under paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section is reduced by 60 percent of the annuitant's adjusted 
social security disability benefit.
    (d) For months in which an annuity is reduced under paragraph (b) or 
(c) of this section, any reduction for survivor benefits is made after 
the reduction for social security benefits.


<R05>
Sec. 844.303  Minimum disability annuity.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, an annuity payable 
under this part cannot be less than the amount of an annuity computed 
under 5 U.S.C. 8415 (excluding subsection (f) of that section) based on 
the annuitant's service.


<R05>
Sec. 844.304  Computation of disability annuity for those otherwise eligible to retire.

    (a) An individual retiring under this part is not entitled to elect 
to receive an alternative form of annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8420a, even if 
the individual meets the requirements for retirement under another part 
and would be entitled to elect an alternative form of annuity in 
connection therewith.
    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, an annuity 
payable under this part will be computed under 5 U.S.C. 8415 if it 
commences or is reinstated under Sec. 844.405 (b) or (c) of this part 
on or after:
    (1) The annuitant has satisfied the age and service requirements for 
retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8412 (a) through (f); or
    (2) The annuitant has reached age 62.


<R05>
Sec. 844.305  Redetermination of disability annuity at age 62.

    Effective on and after the annuitant's 62nd birthday, the rate of 
annuity payable to a disability annuitant will be the amount of an 
annuity computed with respect to the annuitant under 5 U.S.C. 8415 
(including subsection (g) of that section), including

[[Page 351]]

credit for all periods before the annuitant's 62nd birthday during which 
he or she was entitled to an annuity under this part. The average pay 
used in computing the annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8415 is adjusted by all 
cost-of-living increases effective under 5 U.S.C. 8462(b) during the 
period the annuitant was receiving the disability annuity under this 
part.


<R04>
      Subpart D_Termination and Reinstatement of Disability Annuity


<R05>
Sec. 844.401  Recovery from disability.

    (a) Each annuitant receiving disability annuity from the Fund shall 
be examined under the direction of OPM at the end of one year from the 
date of disability retirement and annually thereafter until the 
annuitant becomes 60 years of age unless the disability is found by OPM 
to be permanent in character. OPM may order a medical or other 
examination at any time to determine the facts relative to the nature 
and degree of disability of the annuitant. Failure to submit to 
reexamination shall result in suspension of annuity.
    (b) A disability annuitant may request medical reevaluation under 
the provisions of this section at any time. OPM may reevaluate the 
medical condition of disability annuitants age 60 or over only on their 
own request.
    (c) Recovery based on medical or other documentation. When OPM 
determines on the basis of medical documentation or other evidence that 
a disability annuitant has recovered from the disability, OPM will 
terminate the annuity effective on the first day of the month beginning 
1 year after the date of the medical documentation or other evidence 
showing recovery. If an agency reemploys a disability annuitant who has 
been found recovered at any grade or rate of pay within the 1-year 
period pending termination of the disability annuity under this 
paragraph, OPM will terminate the annuity effective on the date of 
reemployment.
    (d) Recovery based on reemployment by the Federal Government. 
Reemployment by an agency at any time before age 60 is evidence of 
recovery if the reemployment is under an appointment not limited to a 
year or less, at the same or higher grade or pay level as the position 
from which the disability annuitant retired. The new position must be 
full-time unless the position the disability annuitant occupied 
immediately before retirement was less than full-time, in which case the 
new position must have a work schedule of no less time than that of the 
position from which the disability annuitant retired. In this instance, 
OPM needs no medical documentation to find the annuitant recovered. 
Disability annuity payments will terminate effective on the first day of 
the month following the month in which the recovery finding is made 
under this paragraph.


<R05>
Sec. 844.402  Restoration of earning capacity.

    (a) Earning capacity determinations. If a disability annuitant is 
under age 60 on December 31 of any calendar year and his or her income 
from wages or self-employment or both during that calendar year equals 
at least 80 percent of the current rate of basic pay of the position 
occupied immediately before retirement, the annuitant's earning capacity 
is considered to be restored. The disability annuity will terminate on 
the June 30 after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity 
is restored.
    (b) Current rate of basic pay for the position occupied immediately 
before retirement. (1) A disability annuitant's income for a calendar 
year is compared to the gross annual rate of basic pay in effect on 
December 31 of that year for the position occupied immediately before 
retirement. The income limitation for most disability annuitants is 
based on the rate for the grade and step that reflects the total amount 
of basic pay (both the grade and step and any additional basic pay) in 
effect on the date of separation from the agency for disability 
retirement. Additional basic pay is included subject to the premium pay 
restrictions of 5 U.S.C. 5545 (c)(1) and (c)(2).
    (2) In the case of an annuitant whose basic pay rate on the date 
determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section did not match a 
specific grade and step in the pay schedule:
    (i) For those retiring from a Senior Executive Service position, a 
merit pay

[[Page 352]]

position, a position for which a special pay rate is authorized (except 
as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section), or any other 
position in which the rate of basic pay is not equal to a grade and step 
in a pay schedule, the grade and step will be established for this 
purpose at the lowest step in the pay schedule grade that is equal to or 
greater than the actual rate of basic pay payable.
    (ii) For those retiring with a retained rate of basic pay or from a 
position for which a special pay rate is in effect but whose rate of 
basic pay exceeds the highest rate payable in the pay schedule grade 
applicable to the position held, the grade is established for this 
purpose at the highest grade in the schedule that is closest to the 
grade of the position held and within which the amount of the retained 
pay falls. The step is established for this purpose at the lowest step 
in that grade that equals or exceeds the actual rate of pay payable.
    (3) For annuitants retiring from the United States Postal Service, 
only cost-of-living allowances subject to FERS deductions are included 
in determining the current rate of basic pay of the position held at 
retirement.
    (c) Income. (1) Earning capacity for the purposes of this section is 
demonstrated by an annuitant's ability to earn post-retirement income in 
exchange for personal services or a work product, or as a profit from 
one or more businesses wholly or partly owned by the disability 
annuitant and in the management of which the annuitant has an active 
role. Income for the purposes of this section is not necessarily the 
same as income for the purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (2) Income earned from one source is not offset by losses from 
another source. Income earned as wages is not reduced by a net loss from 
self-employment. The net income from each self-employment endeavor is 
calculated separately, and the income earned as net earnings from one 
self-employment endeavor is not reduced by a net loss from another self-
employment endeavor. Thus, a net loss from one endeavor is considered to 
be a net income of zero, and the net incomes from each separate self-
employment endeavor are added together to determine the total amount of 
income from self-employment for a calendar year.
    (3) Income is counted in the calendar year in which it is earned, 
even though receipt may be deferred.
    (d) Requirement to report income. All disability annuitants who, on 
December 31 of any calendar year, are under age 60 must report to OPM 
their income from wages or self-employment or both for that calendar 
year. Each year as early as possible, OPM will send a form to annuitants 
to use in reporting their income from the previous calendar year. The 
form specifies the date by which OPM must receive the report. OPM will 
determine entitlement to continued annuity on the basis of the report. 
If an annuitant fails to submit the report, OPM may stop annuity 
payments until it receives the report.


<R05>
Sec. 844.403  Annuity rights after a disability annuity terminates.

    (a) When a disability annuity is terminated because of recovery or 
restoration of earning capacity and the individual is not employed in 
the Government, the individual is entitled to an annuity:
    (1) Under 5 U.S.C. 8414(b) if the individual:
    (i) Is at least age 50 when the disability annuity ceases and had 20 
or more years of service at the time of retiring for disability; or
    (ii) Has 25 or more years of service at the time of retiring for 
disability, regardless of age; or
    (2) Under 5 U.S.C. 8412(g) if the individual is at least the minimum 
retirement age applicable under 5 U.S.C. 8412(h) when the disability 
annuity ceases and had 10 or more years of service at the time of 
retiring for disability.
    (b) When a disability annuitant whose annuity was terminated because 
of Federal reemployment is separated and meets the age and service 
requirements for immediate retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8412 or 8414, the 
individual is entitled to an annuity computed under 5 U.S.C. 8415.

[[Page 353]]


<R05>
Sec. 844.404  Reinstatement of disability annuity.

    (a) When a disability annuity stops, the individual must again prove 
that he or she meets the eligibility requirements in order to have the 
annuity reinstated.
    (b) Reinstatement of annuity terminated based on recovery. (1) When 
a recovered disability annuitant under age 62 whose annuity was 
terminated because he or she was found recovered on the basis of medical 
evidence (Sec. 844.401) is not reemployed in a position subject to 
FERS, and, based on the results of a current medical examination, OPM 
finds that the disability has recurred, OPM will reinstate the 
disability annuity as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. The 
right to the reinstated annuity begins on the date of the medical 
documentation showing that the disability has recurred, or if the 
medical documentation clearly shows that the disability recurred on an 
earlier date, the annuity will be reinstated on that earlier date.
    (2) Except in the case of an individual receiving an annuity under 
Sec. 844.404(b), OPM will, as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, reinstate the disability annuity of a former annuitant whose 
annuity was terminated because he or she was found recovered on the 
basis of Federal reemployment when:
    (i) The results of a current medical examination show that the 
individual's medical condition has worsened since the finding of 
recovery and that the original disability on which retirement was based 
has recurred; and
    (ii) As a result, he or she has been:
    (A) Separated and not reemployed in a position subject to FERS; or
    (B) Placed in a position that results in a reduction in grade or pay 
below that from which the individual retired, or in a change to a 
temporary or intermittent appointment. The right to the reinstated 
annuity begins on the date the reemployment ends or the effective date 
of the placement in the position that results in a reduction in grade or 
pay or change in appointment.
    (c) Reinstatement of annuity terminated because earning capacity was 
restored. (1) OPM will reinstate the disability annuity as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section when a disability annuitant whose annuity 
was terminated under Sec. 844.402(a):
    (i) Is not reemployed in a position subject to FERS;
    (ii) Has not recovered from the disability for which the individual 
retired (except in the case of a military reserve technician whose 
annuity was awarded under 5 U.S.C. 8456); and
    (iii) Again loses earning capacity, as determined by OPM.
    (2) The reinstated annuity is payable from January 1 of the year 
following the calendar year in which earning capacity was lost. Earning 
capacity is lost if, during any calendar year, the individual's income 
from wages or self-employment or both is less than 80 percent of the 
current rate of basic pay of the position held at retirement.
    (d) Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 844.303 and 844.304, a 
disability annuity reinstated under the preceding paragraphs of this 
section is paid at the rate provided under Sec. 844.302(b) until the 
end of the 12th month beginning after the annuity is reinstated. 
Thereafter, the rate determined under Sec. 844.302(c) is payable until 
age 62.
    (e) Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, an annuity may not be 
reinstated under this section if the individual is receiving an annuity 
under part 842 of this chapter.

decision will be based upon the individual's written submissions, 
evidence of record, and other pertinent available information.
    (2) After consideration of all pertinent information, OPM will issue 
a written decision. The decision will state the extent of the 
individual's liability, and, for waiver and compromise requests, whether 
the debt will be waived or compromised. If the individual is determined 
to be liable for all or a portion of the debt, the decision will 
reaffirm or modify the conditions for the collection previously proposed 
under paragraph (a) of this section. The decision will state the 
individual's right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board as 
provided by Sec. 1201.3 of this title, and, in the case of a denial of 
waiver or reconsideration request that a timely appeal will stop 
collection of the debt.

provided in Sec. 845.206. Referral may also be made to a collection 
agency under the provisions of the FCCS.
    (b) Additional charges. Interest, penalties, and administrative 
costs will be assessed on the debt in accordance with standards 
established in the FCCS at 4 CFR 102.13. Additional charges will be 
waived when required by the FCCS. In addition, such charges may be 
waived when OPM determines--
    (1) Collection would be against equity and good conscience under the 
standards prescribed in Sec. Sec. 845.303 through 845.305; or
    (2) Waiver would be in the best interest of the United States.
    (c) Collection in installments. (1) Whenever feasible, debts will be 
collected in one lump sum.
    (2) However, installments payments may be effected when--
    (i) The debtor establishes that he or she is financially unable to 
pay in one lump sum; or
    (ii)(A) The benefit payable is insufficient to make collection in 
one lump sum;
    (B) The debtor fails to respond to a demand for full payment; and
    (C) Offset is available.
    (3) The amount of the installment payments will be set in accordance 
with the criteria in 4 CFR 102.11.
    (d) Commencement of collection. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, collection will begin after the time limits for 
requesting further rights stated in Sec. 845.204(a)(6) expire or OPM 
has issued decisions on all timely requests for those rights and the 
Merit Systems Protection Board has acted on any timely appeal of a 
waiver denial, unless failure to make an offset would substantially 
prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt; and the time 
before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the 
completion of the proceedings in Sec. 845.204 or litigation. When 
offset begins without completion of the administrative review process, 
these procedures will be completed promptly, and amounts recovered by 
offset but later found not owed will be refunded promptly.
    (2) The procedures identified in Sec. 845.204 will not be applied 
when the debt is caused by a retroactive adjustment in the periodic rate 
of annuity or any deduction taken from annuity when the adjustment is a 
result of the annuitant's election of different entitlements under law, 
if the adjustment is made within 120 days of the effective

[[Page 357]]

date of the election; or interim estimated payments made before the 
formal determination of entitlement to annuity, if the amount is 
recouped from the total annuity payable on the first day of the month 
following the last advance payment or the date the formal determination 
is made, whichever is later.


<R05>
Sec. 845.206  Collection by administrative offset.

    (a) Offset from retirement payments. A debt may be collected in 
whole or in part from any lump-sum retirement payment or recurring 
annuity payments.
    (b) Offset from other payments--(1) Administrative offset. (i) A 
debt may be offset from other payments due the debtor from other 
agencies in accordance with 4 CFR 102.3 except that offset from back pay 
awarded under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5596 (and 5 CFR 550.801 et 
seq.) will be made in accordance with Sec. 550.805(e)(2) of this 
chapter.
    (ii) In determining whether to collect claims by means of 
administrative offset after the expiration of the 6-year limitation 
provided in 5 U.S.C. 2415, the Director or his or her designee will 
determine the cost effectiveness of leaving a claim unresolved for more 
than 6 years. This decision will be based on such factors as the amount 
of the debt, the cost of collection, and the likelihood of recovering 
the debt.
    (2) Salary offset. When the debtor is an employee, or a member of 
the Armed Forces, OPM may effect collection action by offset of the 
debtor's pay in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550.1101 et seq. 
Due process described in Sec. 845.204 will apply. The questions of fact 
and liability, and entitlements to waiver or compromise determined 
through that process are deemed correct and will not be amended under 
salary offset procedures. When the debtor did not receive a hearing on 
the amount of the offset under Sec. 845.204 and requests such a 
hearing, one will be conducted in accordance with subpart K of part 550 
of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 845.207  Use of consumer reporting agencies.

    (a) Notice. If a debtor's response to the notice described in Sec. 
845.204(a) does not result in payment in full, payment by offset, or 
payment in accordance with a voluntary repayment agreement or other 
repayment schedule acceptable to OPM, and the debtor's rights under 
Sec. 845.204 have been exhausted, OPM may report the debtor to a 
consumer reporting agency. In addition, a debtor's failure to make 
subsequent payments in accordance with a repayment schedule may result 
in a report to a consumer reporting agency. Before making a report to a 
consumer reporting agency, OPM will notify the debtor in writing that--
    (1) The payment is overdue;
    (2) OPM intends, after 60 days, to make a report as described in 
paragraph (b) of this section to a consumer reporting agency;
    (3) The debtor's right to dispute the liability has been exhausted 
under Sec. 845.204; and
    (4) The debtor may suspend OPM action on referral by paying the debt 
in one lump sum or making payments current under a repayment schedule.
    (b) Report. When a debtor's response to the notice described in 
paragraph (a) of this section fails to comply with paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section or the debtor does not respond, and 60 days have elapsed 
since the notice was mailed, OPM may report to a consumer reporting 
agency that an individual is responsible for an unpaid debt and provide 
the following information:
    (1) The individual's name, address, taxpayer identification number, 
and any other information necessary to establish the identity of the 
individual;
    (2) The amount, status, and history of the debt; and
    (3) The fact that the debt arose in connection with the 
administration of FERS or CSRS.
    (c) Subsequent reports. OPM will update its report to the consumer 
reporting agency whenever it has knowledge of events that substantially 
change the status or the amount of the liability.


<R05>
Sec. 845.208  Referral to a collection agency.

    (a) OPM retains the responsibility for resolving disputes, 
compromising claims, referring the debt for litigation, or suspending or 
terminating collection action.

[[Page 358]]

    (b) OPM may refer certain debts to commercial collection agencies 
under the following conditions:
    (1) All processing required by Sec. 845.204 has been completed 
before the debt is released; and
    (2) A contract for collection services has been negotiated.


<R05>
Sec. 845.209  Referral for litigation.

    From time to time and in a manner consistent with the General 
Accounting Office's and the Justice Department's instructions, OPM will 
refer certain overpayments to the Justice Department for litigation. 
Referral for litigation will suspend processing under this subpart.


<R04>
             Subpart C_Standards for Waiver of Overpayments


<R05>
Sec. 845.301  Conditions for waiver.

    Recovery of an overpayment from the Fund may be waived pursuant to 
section 8470(b), of title 5, United States Code, when (a) the annuitant 
is without fault and (b) recovery would be against equity and good 
conscience. When it has been determined that the recipient of an 
overpayment is ineligible for waiver, the individual is nevertheless 
entitled to an adjustment in the recovery schedule if he or she shows 
that it would cause him or her financial hardship to make payment at the 
rate scheduled.


<R05>
Sec. 845.302  Fault.

    A recipient of an overpayment is without fault if he or she 
performed no act of commission or omission that resulted in the 
overpayment. The fact that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) or 
another agency may have been at fault in initiating an overpayment will 
not necessarily relieve the individual from liability.
    (a) Considerations. Pertinent considerations in finding fault are--
    (1) Whether payment resulted from the individual's incorrect but not 
necessarily fraudulent statement, which he or she should have known to 
be incorrect;
    (2) Whether payment resulted from the individual's failure to 
disclose material facts in his or her possession, which he or she should 
have known to be material; or
    (3) Whether he or she accepted a payment that he or she knew or 
should have known to be erroneous.
    (b) Mitigation factors. The individual's age, physical and mental 
condition or the nature of the information supplied to him or her by OPM 
or a Federal agency may mitigate against finding fault if one or more of 
these factors contributed to his or her submission of an incorrect 
statement, a statement that did not disclose material facts in his or 
her possession, or his or her acceptance of an erroneous overpayment.


<R05>
Sec. 845.303  Equity and good conscience.

    Recovery is against equity and good conscience when--
    (a) It would cause financial hardship to the person from whom it is 
sought;
    (b) The recipient of the overpayment can show (regardless of his or 
her financial circumstances) that due to the notice that such payment 
would be made or because of the incorrect payment he or she either has 
relinquished a valuable right or has changed positions for the worse; or
    (c) Recovery would be unconscionable under the circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 845.304  Financial hardship.

    Financial hardship may be deemed to exist in, but not limited to, 
those situations when the annuitant from whom collection is sought needs 
substantially all of his or her current income and liquid assets to meet 
current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities.
    (a) Considerations. Some pertinent considerations in determining 
whether recovery would cause financial hardship are as follows:
    (1) The individual's financial ability to pay at the time collection 
is scheduled to be made.
    (2) Income to other family member(s), if such member's ordinary and 
necessary living expenses are included in expenses reported by the 
annuitant.
    (b) Exemptions. Assets exempt from execution under State law should 
not be considered in determining an individual's ability to repay the 
indebtedness. Rather primary emphasis will be

[[Page 359]]

placed upon the annuitant's liquid assets and current income in making 
such determinations.


<R05>
Sec. 845.305  Ordinary and necessary living expenses.

    An individual's ordinary and necessary living expenses include rent, 
mortgage payments, utilities, maintenance, transportation, food, 
clothing, insurance (life, health, and accident), taxes, installment 
payments, medical expenses, support expenses for which the annuitant is 
legally responsible, and other miscellaneous expenses that the 
individual can establish as being ordinary and necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 845.306  Waiver precluded.

    Waiver of an overpayment cannot be granted when--
    (a) The overpayment was obtained by fraud; or
    (b) The overpayment was made to an estate.


<R05>
Sec. 845.307  Burdens of proof.

    (a) Burden of OPM. The Associate Director must establish by the 
preponderance of the evidence that an overpayment occurred.
    (b) Burden of annuitant. The recipient of an overpayment must 
establish by substantial evidence that he or she is eligible for waiver 
or an adjustment.

<R05>
Sec. 845.405  Creditor agency processing for non-fraud claims.

    (a) Where to submit the debt claim, judgment or notice of debt--(1) 
Creditor agencies that are not the debtor's paying agency. (i) If the 
creditor agency knows that the debtor is employed by the Federal 
Government, it should send the debt claim to the debtor's paying agency 
for collection.
    (ii) If some of the debt is unpaid after the debtor separates from 
the paying agency, the creditor agency should send the debt claim to OPM 
as described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Creditor agencies that are the debtor's paying agency. 
Ordinarily, debts owed the paying agency should be offset under 31 
U.S.C. 3716 from any final payments (salary, accrued annual leave, etc.) 
due the debtor. If a balance is due after offsetting the final payments 
or the debt is discovered after the debtor has been paid, the paying 
agency may send the debt claim to OPM as described in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) Procedures for submitting debt claim, judgment or notice of debt 
to OPM--(1) Debt claims for which the agency has a court judgment. If 
the creditor agency has a court judgment against the debtor specifying 
the amount of the debt to be recovered, the agency should send the debt 
claim and two certified copies of the judgment to OPM.
    (2) Debt claims previously processed under 5 U.S.C. 5514. If the 
creditor agency previously processed the debt claim under 5 U.S.C. 5514, 
it should--
    (i) Notify the debtor that the claim is being sent to OPM to 
complete collection from the Fund; and
    (ii) Send the debt claim to OPM with two copies of the paying 
agency's certification of the amount collected and one copy of the 
notice to the debtor that the claim was sent to OPM.
    (3) Debt claims not processed under 5 U.S.C. 5514, reduced to court 
judgment, or excepted by paragraph (b)(4) of this section. (i) If the 
debt claim was not processed under 5 U.S.C. 5514, reduced to

[[Page 361]]

court judgment or excepted by paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the 
creditor agency must--
    (A) Comply with the procedures required by 4 CFR 102.4 by issuing 
written notice to the debtor of the nature and amount of the debt, the 
agency's intention to collect by offset, the opportunity to obtain 
review within the agency of the determination of indebtedness, and the 
opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the agency to repay 
the debt; and
    (B) Complete the appropriate debt claim.
    (ii) If the debtor does not respond to the creditor agency's notice 
within the allotted time and there is no reason to believe that he or 
she did not receive the notice, the creditor agency may submit the debt 
claim to OPM after certifying that notice was issued and the debtor 
failed to reply.
    (iii) If the debtor responds to the notice by requesting a review 
(or hearing if one is available), the review (or hearing) must be 
completed before the creditor agency submits the debt claim.
    (iv) If the debtor receives the notice and responds by consenting to 
the collection, the creditor agency must send (to OPM) a copy of the 
debtor's consent along with the debt claim.
    (4) Debt claims excepted from procedures described in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section. Creditor agencies must follow specific 
procedures approved by OPM, rather than those described in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, for the collection of--
    (i) Debts due because of the individual's failure to pay health 
benefits premiums while he or she was in nonpay status or while his or 
her salary was not sufficient to cover the cost of premiums;
    (ii) Unpaid Federal taxes to be collected by Internal Revenue 
Service levy;
    (iii) Premiums due because of the annuitant's election of Part B, 
Medicare coverage (retroactive collection limited to 6 months of 
premiums); or
    (iv) Overpaid military retired pay an annuitant elects in writing to 
have withheld from his or her annuity.
    (5) General certification requirements for debt claims. Creditor 
agencies submitting debt claims must certify--
    (i) That the debt is owed to the United States;
    (ii) The amount and reason for the debt and whether additional 
interest accrues;
    (iii) The date the Government's right to collect the debt first 
accrued;
    (iv) That the agency has complied with the applicable statutes, 
regulations, and OPM procedures;
    (v) That if a competent administrative or judicial authority issues 
an order directing OPM to pay a debtor an amount previously paid to the 
agency (regardless of the reasons behind the order), the agency will 
reimburse OPM or pay the debtor directly within 15 days of the date of 
the order.
    Note: OPM may, at its discretion, decline to collect other debt 
claims sent by an agency that does not abide by this certification.
    (vi) If the collection will be in installments, the amount or 
percentage of net annuity in each installment; and
    (vii) If the debtor does not (in writing) consent to the offset, or 
does not (in writing) acknowledge receipt of the required notices and 
procedures, or the creditor agency does not document a judgment offset 
or a previous salary offset, identify the action(s) taken to comply with 
4 CFR 102.3, including any required hearing or review, and give the 
date(s) the action(s) was taken.
    (6) Notice of debt. When a creditor agency cannot send a complete 
debt claim, it should notify OPM of the existence of the debt so that 
the lump-sum will not be paid before the debt claim arrives.
    (i) The notice to OPM must include a statement that the debt is owed 
to the United States, the date the debt first accrued, and the basis for 
and amount of the debt, if known. If the amount of the debt is not 
known, the agency must establish the amount and notify OPM in writing as 
soon as possible after submitting the notice.
    (ii) The creditor agency may either notify OPM by making a notation 
in column 8 [Remarks] under ``Fiscal Record'' on the Individual 
Retirement Record, if the Individual Retirement Record is in its 
possession, or if not, by submitting a separate document identifying the 
debtor by name, giving his or her date of birth, social security

[[Page 362]]

number, and date of separation, if known.
    (c) Time limits for sending records and debt claims to OPM--(1) Time 
limits for submitting debt claims. Unless there is an application for 
refund pending, there is no specific time for submitting a debt claim or 
notice of debt to OPM. Generally, however, agencies must file a debt 
claim before the statute of limitations expires (4 CFR 102.4(c)) or 
before a refund is paid. Time limits are imposed (see Sec. 845.406(a)) 
when the debtor is eligible for a refund and OPM receives his or her 
application requesting payment. In this situation, creditor agencies 
must file a complete debt claim within 120 days (or 180 days if the 
agency requests an extension of time before the refund is paid) of the 
date OPM requests a complete debt claim.
    (2) Time limit for submitting retirement records to OPM. A paying 
agency must send the Individual Retirement Record to OPM no later than 
60 days after the separation, termination, or entrance on duty in a 
position in which the employee is not covered by FERS.


<R05>
Sec. 845.406  OPM processing for non-fraud claims.

    (a) Refunds--incomplete debt claims. (1) If a creditor agency sends 
OPM a notice of debt claim against a refund OPM is processing for 
payment, OPM will withhold the amount of the debt but will not make any 
payment to the creditor agency. OPM will notify the creditor agency that 
the procedures in this subpart and 4 CFR 102.4 must be completed; and a 
debt claim must be completed and returned to OPM within 120 days of the 
date of OPM's notice to the creditor agency. Upon request, OPM will 
grant the creditor agency one extension of up to 60 days if the request 
for extension is received before the lump-sum payment has been made. The 
extension will commence on the day after the 120-day period expires so 
that the total time OPM holds payment of the refund will not exceed 180 
days.
    (2) During the period allotted the creditor agency for sending OPM a 
complete debt claim, OPM will handle the debtor's application for refund 
under section 8424 of title 5, United States Code, in one of two ways:
    (i) If the amount of the debt is known, OPM will notify the debtor 
of the debt claim against his or her lump-sum credit, withhold the 
amount of the debt, and pay the balance to the debtor, if any.
    (ii) If the amount of the debt is not known, OPM will not pay any 
amount to the debtor until the creditor agency certifies the amount of 
the debt, submits a complete debt claim, or the time limit for 
submission of the debt claim expires, whichever comes first.
    (b) Refunds--complete debt claims--(1) OPM receives an application 
from the debtor prior to or at the same time as the agency's debt claim. 
(i) If a refund has been paid, OPM will notify the creditor agency there 
are no funds available for offset. Except in the case of debts due 
because of the employee's failure to pay health benefits premiums while 
he or she is in nonpay status or while his or her salary was not 
sufficient to cover the cost of premiums, creditor agencies should refer 
to the instructions in the FCCS for other measures to recover the 
outstanding debt; however, OPM will retain the debt claim on file in the 
event the debtor is once again employed in a position subject to 
retirement deductions.
    (ii) If a refund is payable and the creditor agency submits a 
complete debt claim in accordance with Sec. 845.405(b) (1), (2), (3), 
or (4), the debt will be collected from the refund and any balance paid 
to the debtor. OPM will send the debtor a copy of the debt claim, 
judgment, consent, or other document, and notify him or her that the 
creditor agency was paid.
    (2) If OPM has not received an application from the debtor when the 
agency's debt claim is received. If a debtor has not filed application 
for a refund, OPM will retain the debt claim for future recovery. OPM 
will make the collection whenever an application is received, provided 
the creditor agency initiated the administrative offset before the 
statute of limitations expired. (See 4 CFR 102.3(b)(3) and 102.4(c).) 
OPM will notify the creditor agency that it does not have an application 
from the debtor so that the agency may take other action to recover the 
debt.

[[Page 363]]

    Note: If the recovery action is successful, the creditor agency must 
notify OPM so it can void the debt claim.
    (3) Future recovery. (i) If OPM receives an application for refund 
within 1 year of the date the agency's debt claim was received and the 
creditor agency does not indicate that interest is accruing on the debt, 
the debt will be processed as stated in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this 
section.
    (ii) If OPM receives an application for refund within 1 year of the 
date the agency's debt claim was received and the creditor agency 
indicates that interest accrues on the debt, when necessary, OPM will 
contact the creditor agency to confirm that the debt is outstanding and 
request submission in writing, of the total additional accrued interest. 
OPM will not make interest computations for creditor agencies.
    (iii) When OPM receives an application for refund more than 1 year 
after the creditor agency's debt claim was received, whether interest 
accrues or not, OPM will contact the creditor agency to see if the debt 
is still outstanding and, when necessary, request an update of the 
interest charges. If the debt is still due, the creditor agency must 
give the debtor an opportunity to establish that his or her changed 
financial circumstances, if any, would make the offset unjust. (See 4 
CFR 102.4(c).) If the creditor agency determines that offset as 
requested in the debt claim would be unjust because of the debtor's 
changed financial circumstances, the agency should permit the debtor to 
offer a satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset. If the agency 
decides to pursue the offset, it must submit to OPM the requested 
information and any new instructions within 60 days of the date of OPM's 
request or the claim may be voided and the balance paid to the 
individual.
    (c) Annuities--incomplete debt claims. (1) If a creditor agency 
sends OPM notice of a debt or an incomplete debt claim against a debtor 
who is receiving an annuity, OPM will not offset the annuity. OPM will 
notify the creditor agency that--
    (i) The procedures in this subpart and 4 CFR 102.4 must be 
completed; and
    (ii) A debt claim must be completed and sent to OPM.
    (2) No time limit will be given for the submission of a debt claim 
against an annuity; however, a debt claim must be received within 10 
years of the date the Government's right to collect first accrued (4 CFR 
102.3(b)(3)).
    (d) Annuities--complete debt claims--(1) General--(i) Notice. When 
OPM receives a complete debt claim and an application for annuity, OPM 
will offset the annuity, pay the creditor agency, and mail the debtor a 
copy of the debt claim along with notice of the payment to the creditor 
agency.
    (ii) Beginning deductions. If OPM already established the debtor's 
annuity payment, deductions will begin with the next available annuity 
payment. If OPM is in the process of establishing the annuity payments, 
deductions will not be taken from advance annuity payments, but will 
begin with the annuity payable on the first day of the month following 
the last advance payment.
    (iii) Updating accrued interest. Once OPM has completed a 
collection, if there are additional accrued interest charges, the 
creditor agency must contact OPM regarding any additional amount due 
within 90 days of the date of the final payment.
    (2) Claims held for future recovery. (i) If OPM receives an 
application for annuity within 1 year of the date the agency's debt 
claim was received, the debt will be processed as stated in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section.
    (ii) If OPM receives an application for annuity more than 1 year 
after the agency's debt claim was submitted, OPM will contact the 
creditor agency to see if the debt is still outstanding. If the debt is 
still due, the creditor agency should permit the debtor to offer a 
satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset if the debtor establishes 
that his or her changed financial circumstances would make the offset 
unjust. (See 4 CFR 102.4(c).) If the agency decides to pursue the 
offset, it must submit the requested information and any new 
instructions about the collection to OPM.
    (e) Limitations on OPM review. In no case will OPM review--
    (1) The merits of a creditor agency's decision regarding 
reconsideration, compromise, or waiver; or

[[Page 364]]

    (2) The creditor agency's decision that a hearing was not required 
in any particular proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 845.407  Installment withholdings.

    (a) When possible, OPM will collect a creditor agency's full claim 
in one payment from the debtor's refund or annuity.
    (b) If collection must be made from an annuity and the debt is 
large, the creditor must generally accept payment in installments. The 
responsibility for establishing and notifying the debtor of the amount 
of the installments belongs to the creditor agency (see Sec. 
845.405(b)(5)). However, OPM will not make an installment deduction for 
more than 50 percent of net annuity, unless a higher percentage is 
needed to satisfy a judgment against a debtor within 3 years or the 
annuitant has consented to the higher amount in writing. All 
correspondence concerning installment deductions received by OPM will be 
referred to the creditor agency for consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 845.408  Special processing for fraud claims.

    When an agency sends a claim indicating fraud, presentation of a 
false claim, misrepresentation by the debtor or any other party 
interested in the claim, or any claim based in whole or part on conduct 
violating the antitrust laws, to the Department of Justice (Justice) for 
possible treatment as a fraud claim (4 CFR 101.3), the following special 
procedures apply.
    (a) Agency processing. If the debtor is separated or separates while 
Justice is reviewing the claim, the paying agency must send the 
Individual Retirement Record to OPM, as required by Sec. 845.405(c)(2). 
The agency where the claim arose must send OPM notice that a claim is 
pending with Justice. (See Sec. 845.405(b)(6) for instructions on 
giving OPM a notice of debt.)
    (b) Department of Justice processing. (1) The Attorney General or a 
designee will decide whether a debt claim sent in by an agency will be 
reserved for collection by Justice as a fraud claim. Upon receiving a 
possible fraud claim to be collected by offset from the Fund, the 
Attorney General or a designee must notify OPM. The notice to OPM must 
contain the following:
    (i) The name, date of birth, and social security number of the 
debtor;
    (ii) The amount of the possible fraud claim, if known;
    (iii) The basis of the possible fraud claim; and
    (iv) A statement that the claim is being considered as a possible 
fraud claim, the collection of which is reserved to Justice.
    (2) When there is a pending refund application, the Attorney General 
or designee must file a complaint seeking a judgment on the claim and 
send a copy of the complaint to OPM; or as provided in 4 CFR 101.3, 
refer the claim to the agency where the claim arose and submit a copy of 
the referral to OPM within 180 days of the date of either notice from 
the agency that a claim is pending with Justice (paragraph (a) of this 
section) or notice from Justice that it has received a possible fraud 
claim (paragraph (b)(1) of this section) whichever is earlier. When the 
claim is referred to the agency where it arose, the agency must begin 
administrative collection action under 4 CFR 102.4 and send a complete 
debt claim to OPM as required in Sec. 845.405.
    (c) OPM processing against refunds. (1) Upon receipt of a notice 
under paragraph (a) or (b)(1) of this section, whichever is earlier, OPM 
will withhold the amount of the debt claim, if known; notify the debtor 
that the amount of the debt will be withheld from the refund for at 
least 180 days from the date of the notice that initiated OPM 
processing; and pay the balance to the debtor. If the amount of the debt 
claim is not known, OPM will notify the debtor that a debt claim may be 
offset against his or her refund and that OPM will not pay any amount 
until either the amount of the debt claim is established, or the time 
limit for filing a complaint in court or submitting the debt claim 
expires, whichever comes first.
    (2) If the Attorney General files a complaint and notifies OPM 
within the applicable 180-day period, OPM will continue to withhold 
payment of the lump-sum credit until there is a final judgment.

[[Page 365]]

    (3) If the Attorney General refers the claim to the agency where the 
claim arose (creditor agency) and notifies OPM within the applicable 
180-day period, OPM will notify the creditor agency that (i) the 
procedures in this subpart and 4 CFR 102.4 must be completed; and (ii) a 
debt claim must be sent to OPM within 120 days of the date of OPM's 
notice to the creditor agency. At the request of the creditor agency, 
one extension of time of not more than 60 days will be granted, as 
provided by Sec. 845.406(a).
    (4) If OPM is not notified that a complaint has been filed or that 
the claim has been referred to the creditor agency within the applicable 
180-day period, OPM will pay the balance of the refund to the debtor.
    (d) OPM processing against annuities. If the debtor has filed an 
annuity claim, OPM will not take action against the annuity. OPM will 
continue to pay the annuity unless and until there is a final judgment 
for the United States or submission of a complete debt claim.
    (e) OPM collection and payment of the debt. (1) If the United States 
obtains a judgment against the debtor for the amount of the debt or the 
creditor agency submits a complete debt claim, OPM will collect and pay 
the debt to the creditor agency as provided in Sec. Sec. 845.406 and 
845.407.
    (2) If the suit or the administrative proceeding results in a 
judgment for the debtor without establishing a debt to the United 
States, OPM will pay the balance of the refund to the debtor upon 
receipt of a certified copy of the judgment or administrative decision.

beginning on the date he or she becomes subject to CSRS.
    (3) An employee who would be subject to CSRS except for the

[52 FR 19235, May 21, 1987, as amended at 57 FR 3714, Jan. 31, 1992; 61 
FR 58459, Nov. 15, 1996; 62 FR 50997, Sept. 30, 1997; 64 FR 15289, Mar. 
31, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 846.202  Condition for making an election.

    (a) An election under Sec. 846.102 of this part may not become 
effective unless the election is made with the written consent of any 
former spouse(s) entitled to benefits under subpart F of part 831 of 
this chapter or part 838 of this chapter. As provided in section 
301(d)(2)(A) of the FERS Act of 1986, this section applies only if OPM 
has been duly notified concerning any qualifying court order and has 
received the documentation required in Sec. 838.211, Sec. 838.721, or 
Sec. 838.1005 of this chapter. This section does not apply with respect 
to a former spouse who has ceased to be so entitled because of 
remarrying before age 55.
    (b) OPM may waive the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section 
upon a showing that the former spouse's whereabouts cannot be 
determined. A request for waiver on this basis must be accompanied by--
    (1) A judicial or administrative determination that the former 
spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined; or
    (2)(i) Affidavits by the employee or Member and two other persons, 
at least one of whom is not related to the employee or Member, attesting 
to the inability to locate the former spouse and stating the efforts 
made to locate the spouse; and
    (ii) Documentary corroboration such as newspaper reports about the 
former spouse's disappearance.
    (c) OPM may waive the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section 
based on exceptional circumstances if the employee or Member presents a 
judicial determination regarding the former spouse that would warrant 
waiver of the consent requirement based on exceptional circumstances.
    (d)(1) OPM shall, upon application of an individual, grant an 
extension for such individual to make an election under Sec. 846.201 of 
this part, if the individual--
    (i) Files an application for the extension with OPM before the end 
of the period during which the individual would otherwise be eligible to 
make the election; and

[[Page 368]]

    (ii) Demonstrates to OPM's satisfaction that the extension is needed 
to secure the modification of a decree of divorce or annulment (or court 
ordered or court-approved property settlement incident to any such 
decree) on file at OPM in order to satisfy the consent requirement under 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) The application for extension is deemed to be filed with OPM on 
the date it is received in the employing office.
    (3) An extension granted under this paragraph expires 6 months after 
the date it was granted. OPM may grant one further extension upon 
application by the individual seeking to make an election of FERS 
coverage.
    (e) An electing individual who has a former spouse who may be 
entitled to benefits as described in paragraph (a) of this section must 
submit with the election either--
    (1) The consent of the former spouse in a form prescribed by OPM,
    (2) A request for an extension as described in paragraph (f) of this 
section,
    (3) A request for a waiver of the consent requirement and the 
documentation to support the request as described in paragraph (d) or 
(e) of this section, or
    (4) A request for a determination as to whether a qualifying court 
order as described in paragraph (a) of this section is on file with OPM.
    (f) The request for waiver or extension described in paragraphs (b), 
(c), and (d) of this section must be in a form prescribed by OPM. The 
employing office must forward the request to OPM promptly.
    (g) If OPM does not have a copy of a qualifying court order in its 
possession, OPM's notice to the agency that it has no qualifying court 
order is deemed to complete the individual's election of FERS, which 
becomes effective with the first pay period after the employing office 
receives OPM's notification.
    (h) If OPM has a copy of a qualifying court order, OPM will notify 
both the individual and the employing agency of its determination 
regarding a request for extension.
    (i) If OPM has a copy of a qualifying court order in its possession 
and grants a waiver of the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, 
OPM will notify both the individual and the employing office of its 
decision. OPM's notice to the employing office is deemed to complete the 
individual's election, which becomes effective with the first pay period 
after the employing office receives OPM's notice that the waiver is 
granted.

[52 FR 19235, May 21, 1987, as amended at 57 FR 33599, July 29, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 846.203  Agency responsibilities.

    (a) Employing offices must distribute the election forms provided by 
OPM to each eligible individual, including all individuals in a nonduty 
status.
    (b) An employing office must obtain documentation of the 
individual's receipt of the election form specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section and retain the documentation permanently in the 
individual's official personnel folder (or the equivalent). Acceptable 
documentation includes--
    (1) A statement of receipt signed by the individual, or
    (2) A signed postal return receipt showing that the election form 
was received at the individual's address.


<R05>
Sec. 846.204  Belated elections and correction of administrative errors.

    (a) Belated elections. On determination by an employing office that 
the FERS transfer handbook issued by OPM was not available to an 
individual in a timely manner or an individual was unable, for cause 
beyond his or her control, to elect FERS coverage within the prescribed 
time limit, the employing office may, within 6 months after the 
expiration of the individual's opportunity to elect FERS coverage under 
Sec. 846.201, accept the individual's election of FERS coverage.
    (b)(1) Correction of administrative errors related to election. 
During the 6-month period after the expiration of an individual's 
opportunity to elect FERS coverage under Sec. 846.201, the employing 
office may make prospective corrections of administrative errors 
regarding an individual's opportunity to elect FERS coverage, including 
failure to provide the election form specified in Sec. 846.203(a) to an 
individual.
    (2)(i) Erroneous FERS coverage for a period of less than 3 years of 
service. For

[[Page 369]]

an employee, separated employee, or retiree whose employing agency 
erroneously determined that the individual was covered by FERS during 
the period under Sec. 846.201 when the individual was eligible to elect 
FERS, and the employing agency should have placed the individual in 
CSRS, CSRS Offset, or Social Security-Only, under conditions that would 
have included an opportunity to elect FERS coverage, and the employee, 
separated employee, or retiree remained in FERS for less than 3 years of 
service, the employee, separated employee, or retiree is deemed to have 
elected FERS coverage and the individual will remain covered by FERS, 
unless the individual declines under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section to be covered by FERS.
    (ii)(A) The employing agency must provide written notice to each 
individual who is deemed to have elected FERS under paragraph (b)(2)(i) 
of this section that the individual may, within 60 days after receiving 
the notice, decline to be deemed to have transferred to FERS.
    (B) If the individual dies during the election period established by 
paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) (A) and (C) of this section, the right of election 
under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section may be exercised by any person 
who would be entitled to receive a current spouse survivor annuity or a 
former spouse survivor annuity under CSRS (or CSRS Offset), if any, if 
the error had not occurred (the election by any one such current or 
former spouse not to have the election of FERS coverage deemed is 
controlling); otherwise, by the individual or individuals entitled to 
receive the lump-sum credit under CSRS (or CSRS Offset) if the error had 
not occurred (the election by any individual entitled to a share of the 
lump-sum credit not to have the election of FERS coverage deemed is 
controlling). The time limit for making an election under this paragraph 
is 60 days after the date of the agency's notice to the individual 
(survivor) of the election right.
    (C) The agency may waive the 60-day time limit under paragraphs 
(b)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section if the individual (if living, 
otherwise the appropriate survivor) exercised due diligence in making 
the election but was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her 
control from making the election within the time limit. An agency 
decision not to waive the time limit under this paragraph must include 
notice to the individual of the individual's right to request OPM to 
reconsider the denial of the waiver of the time limit. OPM's 
reconsideration decision on denial of a waiver of the time limit will 
notify the individual of the right to appeal to the Merit Systems 
Protection Board under chapter II of this title.
    (iii) The employing agency must document the individual's records to

Election of Coverage form (SF 3109) and any additional documentation 
that may be required under Sec. 846.722 (relating to the former spouse 
consent requirement) to the employing office no later than the close of 
business on December 31, 1998.
    (b) Any writing signed by the employee and filed with the employing 
office may be treated as an election for the purpose of establishing the 
date of the election of FERS coverage if the employee intends that 
document to be an election, but the employee (or, if the employee dies 
after filing the election but before completing the SF 3109, the 
survivor) must submit a completed SF 3109 to confirm any such election.


<R05>
Sec. 846.722  Former spouse's consent to an election of FERS coverage.

    (a) Employee actions. (1) If the employee is subject to a qualifying 
court order, the employee must submit to the employing office a 
completed--

the former spouse's consent to the FERS coverage; or
    (ii) SF 3111, Request for Waiver, Extension, or Search, to request a 
waiver of the former spouse consent requirement or to request an 
extension of the time limit for obtaining a former spouse's consent or 
amendment of the court order.
    (2) If the employee states on the SF 3109, the FERS Election of 
Coverage form, that he or she does not know whether he or she is subject 
to a qualifying court order, the employee must submit to the employing 
office a completed SF 3111, Request for Waiver, Extension, or Search, to

spouse consent requirement upon a showing that the former spouse's 
whereabouts cannot be determined. A request for waiver on this basis 
must be accompanied by--

requirement based on exceptional circumstances if the employee presents 
a judicial determination finding that--
    (A) The case before the court involves a Federal employee who is in 
the process of electing FERS coverage and the former spouse of that 
employee;
    (B) The former spouse has been given notice and an opportunity to be 
heard concerning this proceeding;
    (C) The court has considered sections 301 and 302 of the FERS Act, 
Pub. L. 99-335, 100 Stat. 517, and this section as they relate to waiver 
of the former spouse consent requirement for an employee with a former 
spouse to elect FERS coverage; and
    (D) The court finds that exceptional circumstances exist justifying 
waiver of the former spouse's consent.
    (iv) Approval of a waiver. If OPM grants a waiver of the requirement 
of paragraph (a) of this section, OPM will notify both the individual 
and the employing office of its decision. OPM's notice to the employing 
office is deemed to complete the individual's election, which becomes 
effective with the first pay period after the employing office receives 
OPM's notice that the waiver is granted.
    (2) Extension of the time limit to obtain a former spouse's 
consent--(i) First request. If an employee who is ineligible to elect 
FERS coverage solely because of a qualifying court order files, prior to 
January 1, 1999, a completed SF 3111, Request for Waiver, Extension or 
Search, requesting an extension of the time limit to seek an amendment 
of a qualifying court order, OPM is deemed to have approved the 
extension through June 30, 1999.
    (ii) Second request. OPM will grant one extension of the time limit 
to seek an amendment of a qualifying court order to an individual who 
has been granted an extension under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section 
if the individual--
    (A) Files an application for the extension (SF 3109) with the 
employing office before July 1, 1999;
    (B) Has initiated legal proceedings to secure the modification of 
the qualifying court order on file at OPM to satisfy the former spouse 
consent requirement;
    (C) Demonstrates to OPM's satisfaction that the individual has 
exercised due diligence in seeking to obtain the modification; and
    (D) If seeking an extension beyond December 31, 1999, demonstrates 
to OPM's satisfaction that a longer extension is necessary.
    (iii) Expiration date of a second extension. An approved extension 
under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section expires on December 31, 1999, 
unless OPM's decision letter states a later expiration date.
    (3) Search for a qualifying court order. (i) When an employing 
office notifies OPM that it has received an employee's request for a 
determination of whether OPM has a qualifying court order on file, OPM 
will determine whether it has such an order.
    (ii) If OPM does not have a copy of a qualifying court order in its 
possession, OPM's notice to the employing office that it has no 
qualifying court order completes the employee's election of FERS 
coverage and the election becomes effective at the beginning of the 
first pay period after the employing office receives OPM's notification.
    (iii) If OPM has a copy of a qualifying court order, OPM will notify 
both the individual and the employing office that it has a qualifying 
court order and that an extension until June 30, 1999, has been granted.

<R04>
  Subpart F_Additional Employee Costs Under the Retroactive Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 847.601  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of this subpart is to establish the methodology that 
OPM will use to determine--
    (1) The cost of an employee's election under Sec. 847.411 or Sec. 
847.421; and
    (2) The amount by which annuity payments may be affected as a result 
of the election.
    (b) This subpart applies only to CSRS and FERS benefits. The 
Departments of Defense, and the U.S. Coast Guard will issue regulations 
providing methodologies for NAFI's under their jurisdictions.


<R05>
Sec. 847.602  Present value factors.

    (a) OPM publishes the following tables (available at personnel and 
payroll offices):
    (1) One table of present value factors for all CSRS annuities;
    (2) One table of present value factors for FERS annuities that do 
not receive cost-of-living adjustments before the retiree attains age 
62; and
    (3) One table of present value factors for FERS annuities that 
receives cost-of-living adjustments before the retiree attains age 62.
    (b)(1) Each present value factor will equal the amount of money 
(earning interest at an assumed rate) required at the date of 
computation to fund an annuity that starts out at the rate of $1 a month 
and is payable in monthly installments for the annuitant's lifetime 
based on mortality rates for annuitants paid from the Fund; and 
increases each year, assuming a certain rate of inflation.
    (2) Interest, mortality, and inflation rates used in computing the 
present value are those used by the Board of Actuaries of the Civil 
Service Retirement System for valuation of CSRS and FERS, based on 
dynamic assumptions.
    (3) The present value factors are unisex factors obtained by 
averaging distinct present value factors, which take into account 
mortality for retirees and survivors under CSRS and FERS.
    (c)(1) When OPM publishes in the Federal Register notice of normal 
cost percentages under Sec. 841.407 of this chapter, it will also 
publish the CSRS and FERS tables of present value factors for use for 
this part.
    (2) The present value factors will be based on the assumptions used 
to compute the normal cost percentages.
    (3) Changes in the tables of present value factors will be effective 
on the first day of the month in which the changes in the normal cost 
percentages become effective.


<R05>
Sec. 847.603  Date of present value and deficiency determinations.

    (a) For determining the deficiency under Sec. 847.604, OPM will 
determine, under Sec. Sec. 847.605 through 847.607, the present values 
of future retirement benefits (with and without credit for the NAFI 
service) as of the first date on which inclusion of credit for the NAFI 
service will affect the rate of annuity payable.
    (b) Appendix A to this subpart contains a table in which the left 
column is a list of events for which inclusion of credit for the NAFI 
service will affect the rate of annuity payable and the right column 
indicates the date on

[[Page 390]]

which the deficiency will be determined.


<R05>
Sec. 847.604  Methodology for determining deficiency.

    (a) When an event listed in the left column of the table in Appendix 
A to this subpart occurs, OPM will compute the deficiency, as follows:
    (1) As of the date of computation under Sec. 847.603, OPM will 
determine--
    (i) The present value of the annuity including credit for the NAFI 
service under Sec. 847.605;
    (ii) The present value of the annuity without credit for the NAFI 
service under Sec. 847.606 or Sec. 847.607, as applicable; and
    (iii) The amount credited to the employee from a transfer to the 
Fund under subpart E of this part including earnings under Sec. 
847.507.
    (2) OPM will add the amount determined under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) 
and (iii) of this section and subtract that sum from the amount 
determined under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.
    (b) If the amount determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
is greater than zero, the deficiency is equal to that amount.
    (c) If no event listed in the left column of the table in Appendix A 
to this subpart occurs--that is, the additional service credit does not 
cause an increase in an employee annuity or a survivor annuity actually 
paid--or, if the amount determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section is less than or equal to zero, the deficiency equals zero.


<R05>
Sec. 847.605  Methodology for determining the present value of annuity with service credit.

    (a) OPM will determine the present value of the annuity including 
service credit for NAFI service under paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section.
    (b) In cases in which the annuity is payable to a retiree, the 
present value under paragraph (a) of this section equals the monthly 
annuity rate including credit for the NAFI service as of the date of 
computation under Sec. 847.603 times the present value factor for the 
retiree's age on that date.
    (c) In cases in which the annuity is payable to a survivor, the 
present value under paragraph (a) of this section equals the monthly 
annuity rate including credit for the NAFI service as of the date of 
computation under Sec. 847.603 times the present value factor for the 
survivor's age on that date.


<R05>
Sec. 847.606  Methodology for determining the present value of annuity without service credit--credit not needed for title.

    (a) If credit for the NAFI service is not necessary to provide title 
to an annuity payable on the date of computation under Sec. 847.603, 
OPM will determine the present value of the annuity without credit for 
the NAFI service under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
    (b) In cases in which the annuity is payable to a retiree, the 
present value under paragraph (a) of this section equals the monthly 
annuity rate without credit for the NAFI service as of the date of 
computation under Sec. 847.603 times the present value factor for the 
retiree's age on that date.
    (c) In cases in which the annuity is payable to a survivor, the 
present value under paragraph (a) of this section equals the monthly 
annuity rate including credit for the NAFI service as of the date of 
computation under Sec. 847.603 times the present value factor for the 
survivor's age on that date.


<R05>
Sec. 847.607  Methodology for determining the present value of annuity without service credit--credit needed for title.

    (a) If credit for the NAFI service is necessary to provide title to 
an annuity payable on the date of computation under Sec. 847.603, OPM 
will determine the present value of the annuity without credit for the 
NAFI service under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
    (b)(1) In cases in which the annuity is payable to a retiree, the 
present value under paragraph (a) of this section equals the present 
value of the deferred annuity without credit for the NAFI service as of 
the deferred annuity date discounted for interest to that date 
determined under Sec. 847.603.
    (2) The present value of the deferred annuity without credit for the 
NAFI service as of the deferred annuity date

[[Page 391]]

equals the retiree's monthly annuity rate without credit for the NAFI 
service as of the deferred annuity date times the present value factor 
for the retiree's age on that date.
    (3) The present value under paragraph (b)(2) of this section is 
discounted for interest by dividing that amount by a factor equal to the 
value of exponential function in which--
    (i) The base is one plus the assumed interest rate under Sec. 
841.405 of this chapter on the date determined under Sec. 847.603, and
    (ii) The exponent is one-twelfth of the number of months between the 
date determined under Sec. 847.603 and the deferred annuity date.
    (c) In cases in which the annuity is payable to a survivor, the 
present value under paragraph (a) of this section equals zero, that is, 
no survivor annuity would ever become payable without credit for the 
NAFI service.


<R05>
Sec. 847.608  Reduction in annuity due to deficiency.

    Any annuity payable in the case of an employee who has made an 
election under subpart D of this part will include credit for the NAFI 
service. The monthly annuity rate on the date determined under Sec. 
847.603 will be permanently reduced by an amount equal to the amount of 
any deficiency divided by the present value factor for the annuitant's 
age on that date.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Disability annuity with and without credit for NAFI service must be
  computed. If annuity payable under each computation is identical due
  to guaranteed minimum annuity, then deficiency is zero.
\2\ Generally, the date the deficiency is determined will be the
  disability retiree's 62nd birthday. However, if an annuity benefit
  based on the retiree's actual years of service and salary becomes
  payable prior to age 62, the deficiency is computed at that time.
\3\ Deficiency amount could be zero if survivor is eligible for the
  guaranteed minimum annuity amount under both computations.

of the deferred annuity without credit for the NAFI service as of the 
deferred annuity date discounted for interest to that date.
    (b) The present value of the deferred annuity without credit for the 
NAFI service as of the deferred annuity date equals the retiree's 
monthly annuity without credit for the NAFI service as of the deferred 
annuity date times the present value factor for the retiree's age on 
that date.
    (c) The present value under paragraph (b) of this section is 
discounted for interest by dividing that amount by a factor equal to the 
value of the exponential function in which--

    (a) A redetermined annuity will not be subject to a reduction under 
this subpart if, on the date reemployment with the Government ends, the 
retiree qualifies for an immediate retirement without credit for the 
NAFI service.
    (b) A redetermined annuity will be subject to a reduction under this 
subpart if, on the date reemployment with the Government ends, the 
retiree does not qualify for immediate retirement without credit for the

to another individual, corporation, or trustee all ownership of FEGLI 
coverage (except Option C).
    Assignee means the individual, corporation, or trustee to which an 
individual irrevocably transfers ownership of FEGLI coverage (except 
Option C).
    Child, as used in the definition of Family member for Option C 
coverage, means a legitimate child, an adopted child, a stepchild or 
foster child who lives with the employee or former employee in a regular 
parent-child relationship, or a recognized natural child. It does not 
include a stillborn child or a grandchild (unless the grandchild meets 
all the requirements of a foster child). The child must be under age 22 
or, if age 22 or over, must be incapable of self-support because of a 
mental or physical disability which existed before the child reached age 
22.

considered an adult and can receive a benefit payment in his/her name. 
However, if the age of adulthood where the individual has his/her legal 
residence is set at a lower age, the individual is considered an adult 
upon reaching that lower age. Adopted children do not inherit from their 
birth parents under the order of precedence stated in 5 U.S.C. 8705, 
other than as designated beneficiaries, but inherit from their adoptive 
parents. However, a child who is adopted by the spouse of a birth parent

must be issued by a court having jurisdiction over the insured's estate. 
Where the law of the insured's legal residence provides for the 
administration of estates through alternative procedures which do away 
with the need for a court order, this term also means an individual who 
shows that he/she is entitled to receive, or possess, the insured's 
property under the terms of those alternative procedures.

schools or social welfare agencies, which show that with his knowledge 
the insured was named as the father of the child.

definition, such evidence as the child's eligibility as a recognized 
natural child under other State or Federal programs or proof that the 
insured included the child as a dependent child on his income tax 
returns may be considered when attempting to establish paternity.

time limit.
    (e) The reconsideration must take place at or above the level at

                       Subpart D_Cost of Insurance


<R05>
Sec. 870.401  Withholdings and contributions for Basic insurance.

    (a)(1) The cost of Basic insurance is shared between the insured 
individual and the Government. The employee pays two-thirds of the cost, 
and the Government pays one-third.
    (2) When OPM makes any adjustment to the Basic life insurance 
premium, it will issue a public notice in the Federal Register.
    (b)(1) During each pay period in which an insured employee is in pay 
status for any part of the period, the employee's share of the premium 
must be withheld from the employee's biweekly pay. The amount withheld 
from the pay of an employee who is paid on other than a biweekly basis 
must be computed and adjusted to the nearest one-tenth of one cent.
    (2) The amount withheld from the pay of an insured employee whose 
annual pay is paid during a period shorter than 52 work weeks is the 
amount obtained by converting the biweekly rate to an annual rate and 
prorating the annual rate over the number of installments of pay 
regularly paid during the year.
    (3) The amount withheld from the pay of an insured employee whose 
BIA changes during a pay period is based on the BIA in force at the end 
of the pay period.
    (c) For each pay period in which an employee is insured, the 
employing agency must contribute an amount equal to one-half the amount 
withheld from the employee's pay. This agency contribution must come 
from the appropriation or fund that is used for the payment of the 
employee's pay. For an elected official, the contribution must come from 
the appropriation or fund that is available for payment of other 
salaries in the same office.

[[Page 404]]

    (d)(1) For an annuitant or compensationer who elects to continue 
Basic insurance and chooses the maximum reduction of 75 percent after 
age 65 under Sec. 870.702(a)(2), the annuitant's share of the premium 
is withheld monthly and the compensationer's share is withheld every 4 
weeks. These withholdings stop the month after the month in which the 
annuitant or compensationer reaches age 65. There are no withholdings 
from individuals who retired or began receiving compensation before 
January 1, 1990, and who elected the 75 percent reduction. For the 
purpose of this paragraph, an individual who separates from service 
after meeting the requirements for an immediate annuity under 5 U.S.C. 
8412(g) is considered to retire on the day before the annuity begins.
    (2) An annuitant or compensationer who elects to continue Basic 
insurance and chooses either the reduction election of 50 percent or the 
election of no reduction after age 65 under Sec. 870.702(a)(3) or (4) 
pays an additional premium for the 50 percent or no reduction election. 
This additional premium is withheld for each $1,000 of the BIA. At age 
65, the Basic premium will stop, but the annuitant or compensationer 
must continue to pay the additional premium for either the 50 percent or 
the no reduction election.
    (e)(1) For each period in which an annuitant or compensationer is 
insured, OPM must contribute an amount equal to one-half the amount that 
would be withheld under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Exception: for 
USPS employees who become annuitants or compensationers after December 
31, 1989, the Postal Service pays the Government contributions.
    (2) The Government contribution is the same amount whether the 
individual elects a maximum 75 percent reduction, a maximum 50 percent 
reduction, or no reduction.
    (3) The Government contribution stops the month after the month in 
which the individual reaches age 65.
    (f) When an agency withholds less than or none of the proper amount 
of Basic life insurance deductions from an individual's pay, annuity, or 
compensation, the agency must submit an amount equal to the sum of the 
uncollected deduction and any applicable agency contributions required 
under 5 U.S.C. 8708 to OPM for deposit in the Employees' Life Insurance 
Fund.

Sec. 870.402  Withholdings for Optional insurance.

    (a)(1) The insured individual pays the full cost of all Optional 
insurance. There is no Government contribution toward the cost of any 
Optional insurance.
    (2) Optional insurance premiums are based on 5-year age bands 
beginning at age 35. The last age band for Option A is age 60+. The last 
age band for Options B and C is 80+. For the purpose of this subpart, 
effective April 24, 1999, an individual is considered to reach the next 
age band the 1st day of the pay period following the pay period in which 
his/her birthday occurs.
    (3) When OPM makes any adjustment to the Optional life insurance 
premiums, it will issue a public notice in the Federal Register.
    (b) During each pay period in any part of which an insured employee 
is in pay status, the employing agency must withhold the full cost of 
Optional insurance from his/her pay.
    (c)(1) Subject to the provisions for reemployed annuitants in Sec. 
870.707, the full cost of Optional insurance must be withheld from the 
annuity of an annuitant the compensation of a compensationer.
    (2) The withholdings for Option A stop the month after the month in 
which an annuitant or compensationer reaches age 65.
    (3) For an annuitant or compensationer who elects Full Reduction for 
any Option B or Option C multiples under Sec. 870.705, the withholdings 
for those multiples stop the month after the month in which he/she 
reaches age 65.
    (4) For an annuitant or compensationer who elects No Reduction for 
any Option B or Option C multiples, the withholdings for those multiples 
continue, as long as he/she remains insured.
    (d)(1) For Option A and Option C, the amount withheld from pay, 
annuity, or

[[Page 405]]

compensation paid on other than a biweekly basis must be computed and 
adjusted to the nearest cent.
    (2) For Option B, the amount withheld from pay, annuity, or 
compensation paid on other than a biweekly basis must be computed and 
adjusted to the nearest one-tenth of 1 cent.
    (e) If an employee's annual pay is paid during a period shorter than 
52 work weeks, the employing office must determine the amount to 
withhold. To do this, it converts the biweekly cost to an annual cost 
and prorates it over the number of installments of pay regularly paid 
during the year.
    (f) When an agency withholds less than or none of the proper amount 
of Optional life insurance deductions from an individual's pay, annuity, 
or compensation, the agency must submit an amount equal to the 
uncollected deductions required under 5 U.S.C. 8714a, 8714b, and 8714c 
to OPM for deposit in the Employees' Life Insurance Fund.

Sec. 870.403  Withholdings and contributions following a Living Benefit election.

    (a) Withholdings and contributions for Basic insurance for an 
individual who elects a full Living Benefit under subpart K of this part 
stop at the end of the pay period in which the Living Benefit election 
is effective.
    (b) Withholdings and contributions for Basic insurance for an 
employee who elects a partial Living Benefit under subpart K of this 
part are based on the post-election BIA. This reduction in withholdings 
and contributions starts at the end of the pay period in which the 
Living Benefit election is effective.
    (c) Withholdings and contributions for Basic insurance for an 
annuitant or compensationer who elected a partial Living Benefit as an 
employee are based on the post-election BIA.
    (d) There is no change in withholdings for Optional insurance for 
individuals who elect a Living Benefit.

<R05>
Sec. 870.404  Withholdings and contributions provisions that apply to both Basic and Optional insurance.

    (a) Withholdings (and Government contributions, when applicable) are 
based on the amount of insurance in force at the end of the pay period.
    (b) Withholdings are not required for the period between the end of 
the pay period in which an employee separates from service and the date 
his/her annuity or compensation begins.
    (c) No payment is required while an insured employee is in nonpay 
status for up to 12 months. Exception: an employee who is in nonpay 
status while receiving compensation.
    (d) The deposit described in Sec. Sec. 870.401(f) and 870.402(f) 
must be made no later than 60 calendar days after the date the employing 
office determines the amount of the underdeduction that has occurred, 
regardless of whether or when the underdeduction is recovered by the 
agency. The agency must determine whether to waive collection of the 
overpayment of pay, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5584, as implemented by 
4 CFR chapter I, subchapter G. However, if the agency involved is 
excluded from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5584, it may use any applicable 
authority to waive the collection.
    (e) Effective October 21, 1972, when there is an official finding 
that an employee was suspended or fired erroneously, no withholdings are 
made from the back pay. Exception: if death or accidental dismemberment 
occurs during the period between the employee's removal and the finding 
that the agency action was erroneous, premiums are withheld from the 
back pay awarded.
    (f) If an individual's periodic pay, compensation, or annuity isn't 
sufficient to cover the full withholdings, any amount available for life 
insurance withholding must be applied first to Basic insurance, with any 
remainder applied to Optional insurance (first to Option B, then Option 
A, then Option C).

    (a) Since January 1, 1988, annuitants who retired under 5 U.S.C. 
chapter 84

[[Page 406]]

(Federal Employees' Retirement System) have been able to make direct 
premium payments if their annuity became too small to cover the 
premiums. Effective the first pay period beginning on or after October 
30, 1998, all employees, annuitants, and compensationers whose pay, 
annuity, or compensation is insufficient to cover the withholdings can 
make direct premium payments.
    (b)(1) For an individual to be eligible to make direct premium 
payments, the employing office or retirement system must determine that 
the pay, annuity, or compensation, after all other deductions, is 
expected to be insufficient on an ongoing basis, i.e., for the next 6 
months or more.
    (2) This section does not apply to employees in nonpay status. 
Employees in nonpay status are governed by Sec. 870.404(c).
    (c)(1) When the employing office or retirement system determines 
that the pay, annuity, or compensation is insufficient, and will be 
insufficient on an ongoing basis, it must notify the insured individual 
(or the assignee, if the individual has assigned his/her insurance under 
subpart I of this part) in writing and inform him/her of the available 
choices.
    (2) Within 31 days of receiving the notice (45 days for individuals 
living overseas), the insured individual (or assignee) must return the 
notice to the employing office or retirement system, choosing either to 
terminate some or all of the insurance or to make direct premium 
payments. An employee, annuitant, or compensationer is considered to 
receive a mailed notice 5 days after the date of the notice.
    (3) If an individual does not return the notice within the required 
time frames, the employing office or retirement system will terminate 
the insurance.
    (d)(1) Terminated coverage stops at the end of the last pay period 
for which premiums were withheld.
    (2) An individual whose insurance terminates, either by choice or by 
failure to return the notice, gets the 31-day extension of coverage and 
right to convert, as provided in subpart F of this part.
    (3)(i) When an employee's pay again becomes sufficient to allow 
premium withholdings, the employing office will automatically reinstate 
the terminated coverage.
    (ii) An annuitant or compensationer whose coverage terminates cannot 
have the coverage reinstated when the annuity or compensation becomes 
sufficient to cover withholdings.
    (e)(1) Employing offices and retirement systems must establish a 
method for accepting premium payments for insured individuals who choose 
to pay directly.
    (2) Individuals who are paying directly must send the required 
premium payment to the employing office or retirement system for every 
pay period during which coverage continues. The insured individual must 
make the payment after each pay period, according to the schedule 
established by the employing office or retirement system.
    (3)(i) When an employee's pay again becomes sufficient to allow 
premium withholdings, he/she must stop making direct payments. The 
employing office will begin to withhold premiums automatically.
    (ii) An annuitant or compensationer who is making direct premium 
payments must continue to pay directly, even if the annuity or 
compensation becomes sufficient to allow withholdings.
    (f) The employing office or retirement system must submit all direct 
premium payments, along with its regular life insurance premiums, to OPM 
according to procedures set by OPM.
    (g)(1) If an individual on direct pay fails to make the required 
premium payment on time, the employing office or retirement system must 
notify the individual. The individual must make the payment within 15 
days after receiving the notice (45 days if living overseas). An 
individual is considered to receive a mailed notice 5 days after the 
date of the notice.
    (2) If an insured individual fails to make the overdue payment, his/
her insurance cancels. Cancellation is effective at the end of the last 
pay period for which payment was received.
    (3) An individual whose insurance cancels for nonpayment does not 
get the 31-day extension of coverage or the right to convert provided in 
subpart F of this part.

[[Page 407]]

    (4) Coverage that cancels for nonpayment is not reinstated when the 
individual's pay, annuity, or compensation becomes sufficient to allow 
withholdings, except as provided by paragraph (g)(5) of this section.
    (5) If, for reasons beyond his/her control, an insured individual is 
unable to pay within 15 days of receiving the past due notice (45 days 
if living overseas), he/she may request reinstatement of coverage by 
writing to the employing office or retirement system within 30 days from 
the date of cancellation. The individual must provide proof that he/she 
was prevented from paying within the time limit for reasons beyond his/
her control. The employing office or retirement system will decide if 
the individual is eligible for reinstatement of coverage. If the 
employing office or retirement system approves the request, the coverage 
is reinstated back to the date of cancellation, and the individual must 
pay the back premiums.

    (a)(1) When an employee is appointed or transferred to a position in 
which he/she is eligible for insurance, the employee is automatically 
insured for Basic insurance on the day he/she enters on duty in pay 
status, unless, before the end of the first pay period, the employee 
files a waiver of Basic insurance with the employing office or had 
previously filed a waiver which remains in effect.
    (2) An insured employee who moves to another covered position is 
automatically insured on the effective date of the move, unless the 
employee files a waiver of Basic insurance with the new employing office 
before the end of the first pay period in the new position.
    (3) When an employee of the District of Columbia Financial 
Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority elects to be 
considered a Federal employee under section 153 of Pub. L. 104-134 (110 
Stat. 1321), he/she is automatically insured on (i) the date the 
employee enters on duty in pay status with the Authority, or (ii) the 
date the Authority receives the employee's election to be considered a 
Federal employee, whichever is later.
    (b) An employee who returns to pay and duty status after a period of 
more than 12 months of nonpay status is automatically insured at the 
time he/she actually enters on duty in pay status, unless, before the 
end of the first pay period, the employee files a waiver of Basic 
insurance coverage with the employing office or had previously filed a 
waiver which remains in effect.
    (c) For an employee who serves in cooperation with a non-Federal 
agency and who is paid in whole or in part from non-Federal funds, OPM 
sets the effective date. This date must be part of an agreement between 
OPM and the non-Federal agency. The agreement must provide either:
    (1) That the required withholdings and contributions be made from 
Federally controlled funds and deposited into the Employees' Life 
Insurance Fund on a timely basis, or
    (2) That the cooperating non-Federal agency, by written agreement 
with the Federal agency, make the required withholdings and 
contributions from non-Federal funds and transmit that amount to the 
Federal agency for deposit into the Employees' Life Insurance Fund on a 
timely basis.
    (d) If an employee waived Basic insurance on or before February 28, 
1981, the waiver was automatically cancelled effective on the 1st day 
the employee entered on duty in pay status on or after April 1, 1981. 
Basic insurance coverage was automatically effective on the date of the 
waiver's cancellation, unless the employee filed a new waiver of Basic 
insurance with the employing office before the end of the pay period 
during which the coverage became effective.

Sec. 870.502  Basic insurance: Waiver/cancellation of insurance.

    (a) An insured individual may cancel his/her Basic insurance at any 
time by filing a waiver of Basic insurance coverage. An employee files 
with the employing office. An annuitant files with OPM or other office 
that administers his/her retirement system. If still employed, a 
compensationer files with the

[[Page 408]]

employing office, and if not still employed, with OPM. The waiver is 
effective, and the insurance stops, at the end of the pay period in 
which the waiver is properly filed. Exception: an individual who has 
assigned his/her insurance under subpart I of this part cannot cancel 
the insurance.
    (b) An individual who cancels his/her Basic insurance automatically 
cancels all forms of Optional insurance.

    (2) He/she provides satisfactory medical evidence of insurability.
    (c) OFEGLI reviews the Request for Insurance filed by an employee 
who has compiled with paragraph (b) of this section and decides whether 
to approve it. The insurance is effective when, after OFEGLI's approval, 
the employee actually enters on duty in pay status in a position in 
which he/she is eligible for insurance. If the employee doesn't enter on 
duty in pay status within 31 days following the date of OFEGLI's 
approval, the approval is automatically revoked and the employee is not 
insured.
    (d) When an employee who has been separated from service for at 
least 180 days is reinstated on or after April 1, 1981, a previous 
waiver of Basic insurance is automatically cancelled. Unless the 
employee files a new waiver, Basic insurance becomes effective on the 
1st day he/she actually enters on duty in pay status in a position in 
which he/she is eligible for coverage. Exception: for employees who 
waived Basic insurance after February 28, 1981, separated, and returned

    (a)(1) Each employee must elect or waive Option A, Option B, and 
Option C coverage, in a manner designated by OPM, within 31 days after 
becoming eligible unless during earlier employment he/she filed an 
election or waiver which remains in effect. The 31-day time limit for 
Option B or Option C begins on the 1st day after February 28, 1981, on 
which an individual meets the definition of an employee.
    (2) An employee of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility 
and Management Assistance Authority who elects to be considered a 
Federal employee under section 153 of Pub. L. 104-134 (110 Stat. 1321) 
must elect or waive Option A, Option B, and Option C coverage within 31 
days after the later of:
    (i) The date his/her employment with the Authority begins, or
    (ii) The date the Authority receives his/her election to be 
considered a Federal employee.
    (3) Within 6 months after an employee becomes eligible, an employing 
office may determine that the employee was unable, for reasons beyond 
his/her control, to elect any type of Optional insurance within the time 
limit. In this case, the employee must elect or waive that type of 
Optional insurance within 31 days after he/she is notified of the 
determination. The insurance is retroactive to the 1st day of the first 
pay period beginning after the date the individual became eligible or 
after April 1, 1981, whichever is later. The individual must pay the 
full cost of the insurance from that date for the time that he/she is in 
pay status, retired, or receiving compensation and under age 65.
    (b) Any employee who doesn't file a Life Insurance Election with 
his/her employing office, in a manner designated by OPM, specifically 
electing any type of Optional insurance is considered to have waived it 
and does not have that type of Optional insurance.
    (c) For the purpose of having Option A as an employee, an election 
of this insurance filed on or before February 28, 1981, is considered to 
have been cancelled effective at the end of the pay period which 
included March 31, 1981, unless the employee didn't actually enter on 
duty in pay status during the

[[Page 409]]

1st pay period which began on or after April 1, 1981. In that case the 
election is considered to have been cancelled on the first day after the 
end of the next pay period in which the employee actually entered on 
duty in pay status. In order to have Option A as an employee after the 
date of this cancellation, an employee must specifically elect the 
coverage by filing the Life Insurance Election with his/her employing 
office subject to the provisions of Sec. 870.504(a) or Sec. 
870.506(b).
    (d) Optional insurance is effective the 1st day an employee actually 
enters on duty in pay status on or after the day the employing office 
receives the election.
    (e) For an employee whose Optional insurance stopped for a reason 
other than a waiver, the insurance is reinstated on the 1st day he/she 
actually enters on duty in pay status in a position in which he/she 
again becomes eligible.

Sec. 870.505  Optional insurance: Waiver/cancellation of insurance.

    (a) An insured individual may cancel entirely any type of Optional 
insurance, or reduce the number of multiples of his/her Option B 
insurance, at any time by filing a waiver of Optional insurance 
coverage. An employee files with the employing office. An annuitant 
files with OPM or other office that administers his/her retirement 
system. If still employed, a compensationer files with the employing 
office, and if not still employed, with OPM. Exception: an individual 
who has assigned his/her insurance under subpart I of this part cannot 
cancel Option A or Option B coverage.
    (b) A cancellation of Optional insurance becomes effective, and 
Optional insurance stops, at the end of the pay period in which the 
waiver is properly filed. Exception: if Option C is cancelled because 
there are no eligible family members, the effective date is retroactive 
to the end of the pay period in which there stopped being any eligible 
family members.
    (c) A waiver of Optional insurance remains in effect until it is 
cancelled as provided in Sec. 870.506.


<R05>

    (a) When there is a change in family circumstances. (1) An employee 
cannot cancel a waiver of Option A due to a change in family 
circumstances.
    (2) An employee who has waived Option B coverage can elect it, and 
an employee who has fewer than 5 multiples of Option B can increase the 
number of multiples, upon his/her marriage or divorce, upon a spouse's 
death, or upon acquiring an eligible child. Exception: Acquiring a 
foster child does not qualify an employee to elect or increase Option B 
coverage.
    (3) The number of multiples of Option B coverage that an employee 
can obtain or add (which cannot exceed a total of 5) is limited to the 
following:
    (i) For marriage, the number of additional family members (spouse 
and eligible children) acquired with the marriage;
    (ii) For acquisition of children, the number of eligible children 
acquired; and
    (iii) For divorce or death of a spouse, the total number of eligible 
children of the employee.
    (4)(i) An employee who has waived Option C coverage can elect it, 
and an employee who has fewer than 5 multiples of Option C can increase

eligible child. An employee can also elect Option C coverage upon 
divorce or death of a spouse, if the employee has any eligible children.
    (ii) An employee electing or increasing Option C coverage may elect 
any number of multiples, as long as the total number of multiples does 
not exceed 5.
    (5)(i) Except as stated in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, 
the employee must file an election under paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(4) of 
this section with the employing office, in a manner designated by OPM, 
along with proof of the event, no later than 60 days following the date 
of the event that permits the election; the employee may instead file 
the election before the event and provide proof no later than 60 days 
following the event.
    (ii) This 60-day time limit may be extended if the individual is not 
serving

[[Page 410]]

in a covered position on the date of the event or if the individual 
separates from covered service prior to the end of the 60-day time 
limit. This extension cannot exceed the 31-day time limit for electing 
insurance following employment in a covered position or, for an election 
under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the 31-day period following the 
1st day on which the individual becomes eligible to cancel a waiver of 
Basic insurance.
    (iii) An employee making an election under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of 
this section because of acquiring an eligible foster child must file the 
election with the employing office no later than 60 days after 
completing the required certification.
    (iv) Employees who had a change in family circumstances between 
October 30, 1998, and April 23, 1999, had until June 23, 1999, to make 
an election under this section.
    (6)(i) The effective date of Option B insurance elected under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section is the 1st day the employee actually 
enters on duty in pay status on or after the day the employing office 
receives the election.
    (ii) The effective date of Option C coverage elected because of 
marriage, divorce, death of a spouse, or acquiring an eligible child

Coverage elected under paragraph (a)(5)(iv) of this section was 
effective April 24, 1999.
    (iii) The effective date of Option C coverage elected because of 
acquiring a foster child is the date the employing office receives the 
election or the date the employee completes the certification, whichever 
is later.
    (b) When there is no change in family circumstances. (1) An employee 
who has waived Option A or Option B coverage may elect it if:
    (i) At least 1 year has passed since the effective date of the 
waiver, and
    (ii) He/she provides satisfactory medical evidence of insurability.
    (2) An employee who has Option B coverage of fewer than five 
multiples of annual pay may increase the number of multiples if:
    (i) At least 1 year has passed since the effective date of his/her 
last election of fewer than five multiples (including a reduction in the 
number of multiples), and
    (ii) He/she provides satisfactory medical evidence of insurability.
    (iii) The requirement for at least 1 year to have passed since the 
effective date of the last election doesn't apply when an employee 
elected fewer than five multiples because of the limitation under 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (3) A waiver of Option C cannot be cancelled without a change in 
family circumstances, unless authorized during an open enrollment 
period.
    (c) OFEGLI reviews the request filed by an employee who has complied 
with paragraph (b) of this section and decides whether to approve it. 
The Optional insurance is effective when, after OFEGLI's approval, the 
employee actually enters on duty in pay status in a position in which 
he/she is eligible for insurance and files a Life Insurance Election. If 
the employee doesn't enter on duty in pay status within 31 days 
following the date of OFEGLI's approval, the approval is automatically 
revoked and the employee does not have the Optional insurance requested.
    (d) If an employee waived Option A insurance on or before February 
28, 1981, the waiver was automatically cancelled effective on the 1st 
day the employee entered on duty in pay status on or after April 1, 
1981. Option A was effective on the date of the waiver's cancellation, 
if the employee filed an election of Option A during the March 1, 1981, 
through March 31, 1981, open enrollment period. If the employee didn't 
file the election with his/her employing office during the March 1981 
open enrollment period, the employee is considered to have waived Option 
A on March 31, 1981.
    (e) When an employee who has been separated from service for at 
least 180 days is reinstated on or after April 1, 1981, a previous 
waiver of Optional insurance is automatically cancelled, as follows:
    (1) An employee who returned to service between April 1, 1981, and 
December 8, 1983, after a 180-day break in service was permitted to 
elect any form of Optional insurance by applying

[[Page 411]]

to his/her employing office before March 7, 1984.
    (2) An employee who returns to service after December 8, 1983, 
following a 180-day break in service may elect any form of Optional 
insurance by applying to his/her employing office within 31 days after 
reinstatement. Coverage is effective on the 1st day the employee 
actually enters on duty in pay status in a position in which he/she is 
eligible for insurance on or after the date the employing office 
receives the election. If the employee doesn't file a Life Insurance 
Election, in a manner designated by OPM, within the 31-day period, the 
employee gets whatever Optional insurance coverage he/she had 
immediately before separating from Federal service and is considered to 
have waived any other Optional insurance. However, an employee who fails 
to file during the 31-day period due to reasons beyond his/her control 
may enroll belatedly under the conditions stated in Sec. 870.504(a)(3).
    (f) An annuitant or compensationer is not eligible to cancel a 
waiver of any type of Optional insurance or to increase multiples of 
Option B under this section.

<R05>
Sec. 870.507  Open enrollment periods.

    (a) There are no regularly scheduled open enrollment periods for 
life insurance. Open enrollment periods are held only when specifically 
scheduled by OPM.
    (b) During an open enrollment period, unless OPM announces 
otherwise, eligible employees may cancel their existing waivers of Basic 
and/or Optional insurance by electing the insurance in a manner 
designated by OPM.
    (c)(1) OPM sets the effective date for all insurance elected during 
an open enrollment period. The newly elected insurance is effective on 
the 1st day of the first pay period which begins on or after the OPM-
established date and which follows a pay period during which the 
employee was in pay and duty status for at least 32 hours, unless OPM 
announces otherwise.
    (2) A part-time employee must be in pay and duty status for one-half 
the regularly scheduled tour of duty shown on his/her current Standard 
Form 50 for newly elected coverage to become effective, unless OPM 
announces otherwise.
    (3) An employee who has no regularly scheduled tour of duty or who 
is employed on an intermittent basis must be in pay and duty status for 
one-half the hours customarily worked before newly elected coverage can 
become effective, unless OPM announces otherwise. For the purpose of 
this paragraph, employing offices can determine the number of hours 
customarily worked by averaging the number of hours worked in the most 
recent calender year quarter prior to the start of the open enrollment 
period.
    (d) Within 6 months after an open enrollment period ends, an 
employing office may determine that an employee was unable, for reasons 
beyond his/her control, to cancel an existing waiver by electing to be 
insured during the open enrollment period. In this case, if the employee 
wants coverage, he/she must submit an election within 31 days after 
being notified of the determination. Coverage is retroactive to the 
first pay period which begins on or after the effective date set by OPM 
and which follows a pay period during which the employee was in pay and 
duty status for at least 32 hours, unless OPM announces otherwise. If 
the employee doesn't file an election within this 31-day time limit, he/
she will be considered to have waived coverage.


<R05>
Sec. 870.508  Nonpay status.

    (a) An employee who is in nonpay status is entitled to continue life 
insurance for up to 12 months. No premium payments are required, unless 
the employee is receiving compensation.
    (b) If an insured employee who is entitled to free insurance while 
in nonpay status accepts a temporary appointment to a position in which 
he/she would normally be excluded from insurance, the insurance 
continues. The amount of Basic insurance is based on whichever 
position's salary is higher. Withholdings are made from the employee's 
pay in the temporary position.
    (c) If an insured employee goes on leave without pay (LWOP) to serve 
as a

[[Page 412]]

full-time officer or employee of an employee organization, within 60 
days of the start of the LWOP he/she may elect to continue life 
insurance. The insurance continues for the length of the appointment, 
even if the LWOP lasts longer than 12 months. The employee must pay to 
the employing office the full cost of Basic and Optional insurance. 
There is no Government contribution for these employees.
    (d) If an insured employee goes on LWOP while assigned to a State 
government, local government, or institution of higher education, life 
insurance continues for the length of the assignment, even if the LWOP 
lasts longer than 12 months. The employee must pay his/her premiums to 
the Federal agency on a current basis. The agency must continue to pay 
its contribution as long as the employee makes his/her payments.


<R05>
Sec. 870.509  Transfers to international organizations.

    An employee transferred to an international organization may 
continue life insurance coverage as provided in 5 U.S.C. 3582. 
Regulations governing these transfers are in part 352 of this title.

Sec. 870.601  Termination of Basic insurance.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 870.701, the Basic insurance of an 
insured employee stops on the date he/she separates from service, 
subject to a 31-day extension of coverage.
    (b) The Basic insurance of an employee who separates from service 
after meeting the requirement for an immediate annuity under Sec. 
842.204(a)(1) of this title and who postpones receiving the annuity, as 
provided by Sec. 842.204(c) of this title, stops on the date he/she 
separates from service, subject to a 31-day extension of coverage.
    (c) The Basic insurance of an insured employee who moves without a 
break in service to a position in which he/she is excluded from life 
insurance stops on his/her last day in the former position, subject to a 
31-day extension of coverage.
    (d)(1) Except as provided in Sec. 870.701, the Basic insurance of 
an insured employee who is in nonpay status stops on the date the 
employee completes 12 months in nonpay status, subject to a 31-day 
extension of coverage. The 12 months' nonpay status may be broken by 
periods of less than 4 consecutive months in pay status. If an employee 
has at least 4 consecutive months in pay status after a period of nonpay 
status, he/she is entitled to begin the 12 months' continuation of Basic 
insurance again. If an employee has used up his/her 12 months' 
continuation in nonpay status and returns to duty for less than 4 
consecutive months, his/her Basic insurance stops on the 32nd day after 
the last day of the last pay period in pay status.
    (2) For the purpose of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 4 
consecutive months in pay status means any 4-month period during which 
the employee is in pay status for at least part of each pay period.
    (3) For the purpose of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an 
individual who is entitled to benefits under part 353 of this chapter is 
considered to be an employee in nonpay status.
    (e) Except for employees, annuitants, and compensationers who elect 
direct payment as provided in Sec. 870.405 of this part, Basic 
insurance stops, subject to a 31-day extension of coverage, at the end 
of the pay period in which the employing office or retirement system 
determines that an individual's periodic pay, annuity, or compensation, 
after all other deductions, is not enough to cover the full cost of 
Basic insurance.

Sec. 870.602  Termination of Optional insurance.

    (a)(1) The Optional insurance of an insured employee stops when his/
her Basic insurance stops, subject to the same 31-day extension of 
coverage.
    (2) An employee who meets the requirements for portability, as 
provided in subpart L of this part, may elect portability for his/her 
Option B coverage, instead of having it terminate.
    (b) The Optional insurance of an employee who separates from service 
after

[[Page 413]]

meeting the requirement for an immediate annuity under Sec. 
842.204(a)(1) of this title and who postpones receiving the annuity, as 
provided by Sec. 842.204(c) of this title, stops on the date he/she 
separates from service, subject to a 31-day extension of coverage.
    (c)(1) If an insured employee is not eligible to continue Optional 
coverage as an annuitant or compensationer as provided by Sec. 870.701, 
the Optional insurance stops on the date that his/her Basic insurance is 
continued or reinstated under the provisions of Sec. 870.701, subject 
to a 31-day extension of coverage.
    (2) A compensationer who meets the requirements for portability, as 
provided in subpart L of this part, may elect portability for his/her 
Option B coverage, instead of having it terminate.
    (d) If, at the time of an individual's election of Basic insurance 
during receipt of annuity or compensation, he/she elects no Basic life 
insurance as provided by Sec. 870.702(a)(1), the Optional insurance 
stops at the end of the month in which the election is received in OPM, 
subject to a 31-day extension of coverage.
    (e) Except for employees, annuitants, and compensationers who elect 
direct payment as provided in Sec. 870.405 of this part, Optional 
insurance stops, subject to a 31-day extension of coverage, at the end 
of the pay period in which the employing office or retirement system 
determines that an individual's periodic pay, annuity, or compensation, 
after all other deductions, is not enough to cover the full cost of the 
Optional insurance. If an individual has more than one type of Optional 
insurance and his/her pay, annuity, or compensation is sufficient to 
cover some but not all of the insurance, the multiples of Option C 
terminate first, followed by Option A, and then the multiples of Option 
B.

<R05>
Sec. 870.603  Conversion of Basic and Optional insurance.

    (a)(1) When group coverage terminates for any reason other than 
voluntary cancellation, an employee may apply to convert all or any part 
of his/her Basic and Optional insurance to an individual policy; no 
medical examination is required. The premiums for the individual policy 
are based on the employee's age and class of risk. An employee is 
eligible to convert the policy only if he/she doesn't return, within 3 
calendar days from the terminating event, to a position covered under 
the group plan. If insurance has been assigned under subpart I of this 
part, it is the assignee(s), not the employee, who has(have) the right 
to convert.
    (2) The employing agency must notify the employee/assignee(s) of the 
loss of coverage and the right to convert to an individual policy either 
before or immediately after the event causing the loss of coverage.
    (3) The employee/assignee(s) must submit the request for conversion 
information to OFEGLI. It must be postmarked within 31 days following 
the date of the terminating event or within 31 days of the date the 
employee/assignee received the notice of loss of group coverage and 
right to convert, whichever is later.
    (4) An employee/assignee who fails to use his/her conversion right 
within 31 days after receiving notice of the right to convert or within 
31 days of the terminating event, whichever is later, is considered to 
have refused coverage, unless OFEGLI determines the failure was for 
reasons beyond the employee's control, as described in paragraph (a)(5) 
of this section.
    (5) When an agency fails to provide the notification required in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or the employee/assignee fails to 
request conversion information within the time limit set in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section for reasons beyond his/her control, the employee 
may make a belated request by writing to OFEGLI. The employee/assignee 
must make the request within 6 months after becoming eligible to convert 
the insurance. The employee/assignee must show that he/she wasn't 
notified of the loss of coverage and the right to convert and was not 
otherwise aware of it or that he/she was unable to convert to an 
individual policy for reasons beyond his/her control. OFEGLI will 
determine if the employee/assignee is eligible to convert. If the 
request is

[[Page 414]]

approved, the employee must convert within 31 days of that 
determination.
    (b) The individual conversion policy is effective the day after the 
group coverage ends. The employee/assignee must pay the premiums for any 
period retroactive to that date.
    (c) The 31-day extension of coverage provided under this subpart 
does not depend upon timely notification of the right to convert to an 
individual policy. The extension cannot be continued beyond 31 days.


<R04>
                Subpart G_Annuitants and Compensationers


<R05>
Sec. 870.701  Eligibility for life insurance.

    (a) When an insured employee retires, Basic life insurance (but not 
accidental death and dismemberment) continues or is reinstated if he/
she:
    (1) Is entitled to retire on an immediate annuity under a retirement 
system for civilian employees, including the retirement system of a 
nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the Department of Defense or the 
Coast Guard;
    (2) Was insured for the 5 years of service immediately before the 
date the annuity starts, or for the full period(s) of service during 
which he/she was eligible to be insured if less than 5 years; and
    (3) Has not converted to an individual policy as described in Sec. 
870.603. If it is determined that an individual is eligible to continue 
the group coverage as an annuitant after he/she has already converted to 
an individual policy, the group enrollment may be reinstated. If the 
individual wants the group coverage reinstated, the conversion policy 
must be voided, the group policy must be reinstated retroactively, and 
the premiums already paid on the conversion policy must be refunded to 
the individual.
    (b) Following separation or the completion of 12 months' nonpay 
status, a compensationer's Basic life insurance (but not accidental 
death and dismemberment) continues or is reinstated if he/she:
    (1) Has been insured for the 5 years of service immediately before 
the date of entitlement to compensation, or for the full period(s) of 
service during which he/she was eligible to be insured if less than 5 
years; and
    (2) Has not converted to an individual policy as described in Sec. 
870.603. If it is not determined that an individual is eligible to 
continue the group coverage as a compensationer until after he/she has 
converted, the group enrollment may be reinstated. If the individual 
wants the group coverage reinstated, the conversion policy must be 
voided, the group policy must be reinstated retroactively, and the 
premiums already paid on the conversion policy must be refunded to the 
individual.
    (c) An individual who meets the requirements under paragraphs (a) or 
(b) of this section or Sec. 870.706 for continuation or reinstatement 
of life insurance must complete an election, in a manner designated by 
OPM, at the time entitlement is established. For the election to be 
valid, OPM must receive the election before OPM has made a final 
decision on the individual's application for annuity or supplemental 
annuity or an individual's request to continue life insurance as a 
compensationer. If there is no valid election, OPM considers the 
individual to have chosen the option described in paragraph (a)(2) of 
Sec. 870.702.
    (d) If the annuity or compensation of an insured individual is 
terminated, or if the Department of Labor finds that an insured 
compensationer is able to return to duty, his/her Basic life insurance 
held as an annuitant or compensationer stops on the date of the 
termination or finding. There is no 31-day extension of coverage or 
conversion right.
    (e)(1) An annuitant or compensationer who is eligible to continue or 
have reinstated Basic insurance is also eligible to continue or have 
reinstated Optional insurance if he/she meets the same coverage 
requirements for Optional insurance as those stated in paragraph (a) or 
(b) of this section for Basic insurance.
    (2) For the purpose of continuing insurance as an annuitant or 
compensationer, an employee is not considered to have been eligible for 
Option C during any period when the employee had no eligible family 
members.

<R05>
Sec. 870.702  Amount of Basic insurance.

    (a) The amount of Basic insurance an annuitant or compensationer can 
continue is the BIA on the date insurance would otherwise have stopped 
because of the individual's separation from service or completion of 12 
months in nonpay status. The amount of Basic insurance in force is the 
BIA minus any reductions applicable under Sec. 870.703(a).
    (b)(1) For the purpose of paying benefits upon the death of an 
insured individual under age 45 who is retired or receiving 
compensation, the BIA will be multiplied by the appropriate age factor 
shown in Sec. 870.202(c) of this part. Exceptions:
    (i) If the insured individual retired or became insured as a 
compensationer before October 10, 1980, or
    (ii) If the insured individual elected a partial Living Benefit as 
an employee under subpart K of this part.
    (2)(i) For an annuitant or compensationer who elected a partial 
Living Benefit as an employee, the amount of Basic insurance he/she can 
continue is the post-election BIA, as shown in Sec. 870.203(a)(2) of

    (ii) For the purpose of paying benefits upon the death of an insured

Sec. 870.703  Election of Basic insurance.

    (a) Unless he/she has elected a Living Benefit, an individual who 
makes an election under Sec. 870.701(c) must select one of the 
following options:
    (1) Termination of the insurance. The individual's insurance stops 
upon conversion to an individual policy as provided under Sec. 870.603. 
If the individual doesn't convert to an individual policy, insurance 
stops at the end of the month in which OPM or the employing office 
receives the election;
    (2) Continuation or reinstatement of Basic insurance with a maximum 
reduction of 75 percent during retirement. Premiums are withheld from 
annuity or compensation (except as provided under 870.401(d)(1)). The 
amount of Basic Life insurance in force reduces by 2 percent of the BIA 
each month until the maximum reduction is reached. This reduction starts 
at the beginning of the 2nd month after the date the insurance would 
otherwise have stopped or the date of the insured's 65th birthday, 
whichever is later;
    (3) Continuation or reinstatement of Basic insurance with a maximum 
reduction of 50 percent during retirement. Premiums are withheld from 
annuity or compensation. The amount of Basic insurance in force reduces 
by 1 percent of the BIA each month until the maximum reduction is 
reached. This reduction starts at the beginning of the 2nd month after 
the date the insurance would otherwise have stopped or the date of the 
insured's 65th birthday, whichever is later; or
    (4) Continuation or reinstatement of Basic insurance with no 
reduction after age 65. Premiums are withheld from annuity or 
compensation.
    (b)(1) Unless an employee has elected a partial Living Benefit under 
subpart K of this part or an individual has assigned the insurance under 
subpart I of this part, an insured individual may cancel an election 
under paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section at any time. The amount 
of Basic insurance automatically switches to the amount that would have 
been in force if the individual had originally elected the 75 percent 
reduction. This revised amount is effective at the end of the month in 
which OPM receives the request to cancel the previous election.
    (2) If an individual files a waiver of insurance, the coverage stops 
without a 31-day extension of coverage or conversion right. This is 
effective at the end of the month in which OPM receives the waiver.
    (c) Unless he/she chooses to terminate his/her insurance, an 
employee who has elected a partial Living Benefit must choose the no 
reduction election under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. He/she cannot 
later change to the 75 percent reduction.
    (d) If an employee has assigned his/her insurance, he/she cannot 
cancel an election under paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section. 
Only the assignee(s) may cancel this election. Exception: if

[[Page 416]]

the employee elected a partial Living Benefit before assigning the 
remainder of his/her insurance, the assignee(s) cannot cancel the 
election under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

Sec. 870.704  Amount of Option A.

    (a) The amount of Option A coverage an annuitant or compensationer 
can continue is $10,000.
    (b) An annuitant's or compensationer's Option A coverage reduces by 
2 percent of the original amount each month up to a maximum reduction of 
75 percent. This reduction starts at the beginning of the 2nd month 
after the date the insurance would otherwise have stopped or the 
beginning of the 2nd month after the date of the insured's 65th 
birthday, whichever is later.

<R05>
Sec. 870.705  Amount and election of Option B and Option C.

    (a) The number of multiples of Option B and Option C coverage an 
annuitant or compensationer can continue is the highest number of 
multiples in force during the applicable period of service required to 
continue Option B and Option C.
    (b)(1)(i) At the time an employee retires or becomes insured as a 
compensationer, he/she must elect the number of allowable multiples he/
she wishes to continue during retirement or while receiving 
compensation.
    (ii) An employee who elects to continue fewer multiples than the 
number for which he/she is eligible is considered to have cancelled the 
multiples that are not continued.
    (iii) Employees separating for retirement and employees becoming 
insured as compensationers on or after April 24, 1999, must also elect 
either Full Reduction or No Reduction for all of the multiples being 
continued.
    (iv) An employee who does not make a reduction election is 
considered to have chosen Full Reduction.
    (2)(i) Prior to reaching age 65, an annuitant or compensationer can 
change from No Reduction to Full Reduction at any time. Exception: If 
the individual has assigned his/her insurance as provided in subpart I 
of this part, only the assignee can change from No Reduction to Full 
Reduction for the Option B coverage.
    (ii) Prior to reaching age 65, an annuitant or compensationer can 
change from Full Reduction to No Reduction at any time.
    (3)(i) After reaching age 65, an annuitant or compensationer can 
change from No Reduction to Full Reduction at any time. Exception: If 
the individual has assigned his/her insurance as provided in subpart I 
of this part, only the assignee can change from No Reduction to Full 
Reduction for the Option B coverage. If an individual age 65 or over 
changes to Full Reduction, the amount of insurance in force is computed 
as if he/she had elected Full Reduction initially. There is no refund of 
premiums.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, after 
reaching age 65, an annuitant or compensationer cannot change from Full 
Reduction to No Reduction.
    (4)(i) Shortly before an annuitant or compensationer's 65 birthday, 
the retirement system will send a reminder about the election he/she 
made and will offer the individual a chance to change the election. At 
that time, the annuitant or compensationer can choose to have some 
multiples of Option B and Option C reduce and some not reduce.
    (ii) If the individual is already 65 or older at the time of 
retirement or becoming insured as a compensationer, the retirement 
system will send the reminder and give the opportunity to change the 
election as soon as the retirement processing or compensation transfer 
is complete.
    (iii) If the individual assigned his/her insurance as provided in 
subpart I of this part, and if the employee elected No Reduction for 
Option B coverage at the time of retirement or becoming insured as a 
compensationer, the retirement system will send the reminder notice for 
Option B coverage to the assignee.
    (iv) An annuitant or compensationer who wishes to change his/her 
reduction election must return the notice by the end of the month 
following the month in which the individual turns 65, or if

[[Page 417]]

already over age 65, by the end of the 4th month after the date of the 
letter. An annuitant or compensationer who does not return the election 
notice will keep his/her initial election.
    (c)(1) For each multiple of Option B and/or Option C for which an 
individual elects Full Reduction, the coverage reduces by 2 percent of 
the original amount each month. This reduction starts at the beginning 
of the 2nd month after the date the insurance would otherwise have 
stopped or the beginning of the 2nd month after the insured's 65th 
birthday, whichever is later. At 12:00 noon on the day before the 50th 
reduction, the insurance stops, with no extension of coverage or 
conversion right.
    (2) For each multiple of Option B and/or Option C for which an 
individual elects No Reduction, the coverage in force does not reduce. 
After age 65 the annuitant or compensationer continues to pay premiums 
appropriate to his/her age.
    (d)(1) Employees who were already retired or insured as 
compensationers on April 24, 1999, and who had Option B, were given an 
opportunity to make an election for Option B.
    (i) Annuitants and compensationers who were under age 65 were 
notified of the option to elect No Reduction. The retirement system will 
send these individuals an actual election notice before their 65th 
birthday, as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (ii) Annuitants and compensationers who were age 65 or older, and 
who still had some Option B coverage remaining, were given the 
opportunity to stop further reductions. These individuals had until 
October 24, 1999, to make the No Reduction election. The amount of 
Option B coverage retained was the amount in effect on April 24, 1999. 
Those annuitants and compensationers who elected No Reduction were 
required to pay premiums retroactive to April 24, 1999.
    (2) Employees who were already retired or insured as compensationers 
on April 24, 1999, could not elect No Reduction for Option C.

recovers from the disability or because his/her earning capacity 
returns, and whose disability annuity is later restored under 5 U.S.C. 
8337(e) (after December 31, 1983), may elect to resume the Basic 
insurance held immediately before his/her disability annuity terminated. 
OPM must receive the election within 60 days after OPM mails a notice of 
insurance eligibility and an election form.
    (b) An annuitant described in paragraph (a) of this section may

annuity terminated if:
    (1) He/she has made an election under paragraph (a) of this section; 
and
    (2) OPM receives the election within 60 days after OPM mails a 
notice of insurance eligibility and an election form.
    (c) Basic and Optional insurance reinstated under paragraphs (a) and

Sec. 870.707  Reemployed annuitants.

    (a)(1) If an insured annuitant is appointed to a position in which 
he/she is eligible for insurance, the amount of his/her Basic life 
insurance as an annuitant (and any applicable annuity withholdings) is 
suspended on the day before the 1st day in pay status under the 
appointment, unless the reemployed annuitant waives all insurance 
coverage. The Basic insurance benefit payable upon the death of a 
reemployed annuitant who has Basic insurance in force as an employee 
can't be less than the benefit which would have

[[Page 418]]

been payable if the individual hadn't been reemployed.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Basic 
insurance obtained as an employee stops with no 31-day extension of 
coverage or conversion right, on the date reemployment terminates. Any 
suspended Basic insurance (and any applicable annuity withholdings) is 
reinstated on the day following termination of the reemployment.

years of service immediately before separation from reemployment or for 
the full period(s) during which such coverage was available to him/her, 
whichever is less; and
    (3) He/she doesn't convert to nongroup insurance when Basic 
insurance as an employee would otherwise terminate.
    (c) If the Basic insurance obtained during reemployment is continued 
as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any suspended Basic life 
insurance stops, with no 31-day extension of coverage or conversion 
right.
    (d) (1) An annuitant appointed to a position in which he/she is 
eligible for Basic insurance, is also eligible for Optional insurance as 
an employee, unless he/she has on file an uncancelled waiver of Basic or 
Optional insurance.
    (2) If the individual has Option A or C as an annuitant, that 
insurance (and applicable annuity withholdings) is suspended on the day 
before his/her 1st day in pay status under the appointment. Unless he/
she waives Option A or C (or waives Basic insurance), he/she obtains 
Option A or C as an employee.
    (3) If the individual has Option B as an annuitant, that insurance 
(and applicable annuity withholdings) continues as if the individual 
weren't reemployed, unless:
    (i) The individual files with his/her employing office an election 
of Option B, in a manner designated by OPM, within 31 days after the 
date of reemployment. in this case Option B (and applicable annuity 
withholdings) as an annuitant is suspended on the date that Option B as 
an employee becomes effective; or
    (ii) The individual waives Basic insurance.
    (4) The Option B benefit payable upon the death of a reemployed 
annuitant is the amount in effect as an annuitant, unless he/she elected 
to have Option B as an employee.
    (5) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the 
Optional insurance obtained as an employee stops, with no 31-day 
extension or conversion right, on the date reemployment terminates. The 
amount of suspended Optional insurance which remains in force after 
applicable monthly reductions after age 65 (and corresponding 
withholdings) is reinstated on the day after reemployment terminates.
    (e) Optional life insurance obtained during reemployment may be 
continued after the reemployment terminates if the annuitant:
    (1) Qualifies for a supplemental annuity or receives a new 
retirement right;
    (2) Continues his/her Basic life insurance under paragraph (a) (2), 
(3), or (4) of Sec. 870.702; and
    (3) Has had Optional insurance as an employee for at least the 5 
years of service immediately before separation from reemployment or for 
the full period(s) of service during which it was available to him/her, 
whichever is less.
    (f) If Optional insurance obtained during reemployment is continued 
as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, any suspended Optional 
insurance stops, with no 31-day extension of coverage or conversion 
right.
    (g) If a reemployed annuitant waives life insurance as an employee, 
the waiver also cancels his/her life insurance as an annuitant.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, benefits 
are paid according to the order of precedence stated in 5 U.S.C. 
8705(a), as follows:
    (1) To the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries);
    (2) If none, to the widow(er);
    (3) If none, to the child, or children in equal shares, with the 
share of any deceased child going to his/her children;
    (4) If none, to the parents in equal shares or the entire amount to 
the surviving parent;
    (5) If none, to the executor or administrator of the estate;
    (6) If none, to the next of kin according to the laws of the State 
in which the insured individual legally resided.
    (b) If an insured individual provides in a valid designation of 
beneficiary for insurance benefits to be payable to the insured's 
estate, or to the Executor, Administrator, or other representative of 
the insured's estate, or if the benefits would otherwise be payable to 
the duly appointed representative of the insured's estate under the 
order of precedence specified in 5 U.S.C. 8705(a), payment of the 
benefits to the duly appointed representative of the insured's estate 
bars recovery by any other person.
    (c) Option A and B insurance in force on a person on the date of 
his/her death is paid, on receipt of a valid claim, in the same order of 
precedence and under the same conditions as Basic insurance. A 
designation of beneficiary for Basic insurance is also a designation of 
beneficiary for Options A and B, unless the insured individual states 
otherwise in his/her designation.
    (d)(1) If there is a court order in effect naming a specific person 
or persons to receive life insurance benefits upon the death of an 
insured individual, Basic insurance and Option A and Option B insurance 
will be paid to the person or persons named in the court order, instead 
of according to the order of precedence.
    (2) To qualify a person for such payment, a certified copy of the 
court order must be received by the appropriate office on or after July 
22, 1998, and before the death of the insured.
    (3)(i) For employees, the appropriate office is their employing 
agency.
    (ii) For annuitants, the appropriate office is OPM.
    (iii) For compensationers during the first 12 months of nonpay 
status, the appropriate office is their employing agency.
    (iv) For compensationers after separation or the completion of 12 
months in nonpay status, the appropriate office is OPM.
    (v) For employees and former employees who have ported Option B 
coverage, the appropriate office is the Portability Office.
    (4) If, within the applicable time frames, the appropriate office 
receives conflicting court orders entitling different persons to the 
same insurance, benefits will be paid based on whichever court order was 
issued first.
    (e) Upon the death of an insured family member, Option C benefits 
are paid to the employee, annuitant, or compensationer responsible for 
withholdings under Sec. 870.402(a), except as provided in paragraph (f) 
of this section.
    (f) If an employee, annuitant, or compensationer entitled to receive 
Option C benefits dies before the benefits are paid, the Option C 
benefits are paid to the individual(s) entitled to receive Basic life 
insurance benefits under the statutory order of precedence. However, if 
the insurance has been assigned

[[Page 420]]

in accordance with subpart I of this part, any prior designations of 
beneficiary were cancelled; benefits in this instance are paid under the 
statutory order of precedence, starting with the second on the list.

<R05>
Sec. 870.802  Designation of beneficiary.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, if an 
insured individual wants benefits paid differently from the order of 
precedence, he/she must file a designation of beneficiary. A designation 
of beneficiary cannot be filed by anyone other than the insured 
individual. Exception: if the insurance has been assigned under subpart 
I of this part, the insured individual cannot designate a beneficiary; 
only the assignee(s) can designate beneficiaries.
    (b) A designation of beneficiary must be in writing, signed by the 
insured individual, and witnessed and signed by 2 people. The 
appropriate office must receive the designation before the death of the 
insured.
    (1) For employees, the appropriate office is the employing office.
    (2) For annuitants and compensationers, the appropriate office is 
OPM.
    (3) For employees and former employees who have ported Option B 
coverage, the appropriate office is the Portability Office.
    (c) A designation, change, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will 
or any other document not witnessed and filed as required by this 
section has no legal effect with respect to benefits under this chapter.
    (d) A witness to a designation of beneficiary cannot be named as a 
beneficiary.
    (e) Any individual, firm, corporation, or legal entity can be named 
as a beneficiary, except an agency of the Federal or District of 
Columbia Government.
    (f) An insured individual (or an assignee) may change his/her 
beneficiary at any time without the knowledge or consent of the previous 
beneficiary. This right cannot be waived or restricted.
    (g)(1) A designation of beneficiary is automatically cancelled 31 
days after the individual stops being insured. Exception: If the 
individual elects portability for Option B, a valid designation remains 
in effect.
    (2) An assignment under subpart I of this part automatically cancels 
an insured individual's designation of beneficiary.
    (h) An insured individual may provide that a designated beneficiary 
is entitled to the insurance benefits only if the beneficiary survives 
him/her for a specified period of time (not more than 30 days). If the 
beneficiary doesn't survive for the specified period, insurance benefits 
will be paid as if the beneficiary had died before the insured.
    (i)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, if a 
court order has been received in accordance with Sec. 870.801(d), an 
insured individual cannot designate a different beneficiary, unless
    (i) The person(s) named in the court order gives written consent for 
the change, or
    (ii) The court order is modified.
    (2) If a court order has been received in accordance with Sec. 
870.801(d), and the court order applies to only part of the insurance 
benefits, an insured individual can designate a different beneficiary to 
receive the insurance benefits that are not included under the court 
order. If the insured individual does not make a designation for these 
benefits and there is no previous valid designation on file, benefits 
will be paid according to the order of precedence shown in Sec. 
870.801(a).
    (3) If a court order received in accordance with Sec. 870.801(d) is 
subsequently modified without naming a new person to receive the 
benefits, and a certified copy of the modified court order is received 
by the appropriate office before the death of the insured, the insured 
individual can designate a beneficiary. Benefits will be paid according 
to the order of precedence shown in Sec. 870.801(d) if the insured 
individual does not complete a new designation of beneficiary.

Sec. 870.803  Child incapable of self-support.

    (a) When it receives a claim for Option C benefits because of the 
death of a child age 22 or older, OFEGLI determines, based on whatever 
evidence it considers necessary, whether the deceased child was 
incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical disability 
which existed before the child reached age 22.
    (b) If an employee elects Option C under Sec. 870.506(a) (3), and 
the opportunity to elect is based solely on the acquisition of a child 
age 22 or older, the employee must submit to the employing office, at 
the time of making the election, a doctor's certificate stating that the 
child is incapable of self-support because of a physical or mental 
disability which existed before the child reached age 22 and which is 
expected to continue for more than 1 year. The certificate must include 
the name of the child, the type of disability, how long it has existed, 
and its expected future course and duration. The certificate must be 
signed by the doctor and show his/her office address.

                 Subpart I_Assignments of Life Insurance


<R05>
Sec. 870.901  Assignments permitted.

    (a) (1) Section 208 of the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal 
Judgeship Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-353 (98 Stat. 355), effective July 10, 
1984, permits Federal judges to irrevocably assign their FEGLI coverage 
to one or more individuals, corporations, or trustees. Section 4 of Pub. 
L. 103-336 (108 Stat. 2661), effective October 3, 1994, extended this 
right to all Federal employees, annuitants, and compensationers.
    (2) An individual may assign ownership of all life insurance under 
this part, except Option C. If an individual wishing to make an 
assignment owns more than one type of coverage, he/she must assign all 
the insurance; an individual cannot assign only a portion of the 
coverage. Option C cannot be assigned.
    (b) An individual cannot name conditional assignees in case the 
primary assignee dies before the insured individual.
    (c) If the insurance is assigned to two or more individuals, 
corporations, or trustees, the insured individual must specify 
percentage shares, rather than dollar amounts or types of insurance, to 
go to each assignee.
    (d) If an individual who has made an assignment later elects 
increased insurance coverage under Sec. 870.506 or during an open 
enrollment period, the increased coverage is considered included in the 
already existing assignment. The right to increase coverage remains with 
the insured individual, rather than transferring to the assignee.
    (e) An individual who assigns ownership of insurance continues to be 
the insured individual, but the assignee receives those rights of an 
insured individual that are specified in this part.
    (f) Once assigned, the value of the insurance increases or decreases 
automatically as provided by this part. Exception: if the insured 
individual elected a Living Benefit before assigning the remainder of 
his/her insurance, the amount of Basic insurance does not increase or 
decrease.
    (g) An insured individual who has assigned his/her insurance cannot 
elect a Living Benefit; nor can an assignee elect a Living Benefit on 
behalf of the insured individual.
    (h) An insured individual who has elected a Living Benefit under 
subpart K of this part may assign the remainder of his/her insurance. 
The assignment would affect Option A, Option B, and, for an employee who 
elected a partial Living Benefit, Basic insurance.
    (i) A court order can direct that an insured individual make an 
irrevocable assignment to the person(s) named in the court order. For an 
assignment to be effective, the insured individual must follow the 
procedures in Sec. 870.902.

Sec. 870.903  Effective date of assignment.

    An assignment under this subpart is effective on the date the 
employing office receives the properly completed, signed, and witnessed 
assignment form.


<R05>
Sec. 870.904  Amount of insurance.

    The amount of insurance is the amount of the insured individual's 
Basic insurance, plus any Option A and Option B coverage.


<R05>
Sec. 870.905  Withholdings.

    Premium withholdings for assigned insurance are withheld from the 
salary, annuity, or compensation of the insured individual, as provided 
in subpart D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 870.906  Cancellation of insurance.

    (a) The right to cancel (or reduce) insurance transfers to the 
assignee; the insured individual cannot cancel (or reduce) insurance 
after making an assignment.
    (b) The assignee has the right to cancel insurance according to the 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 870,502 and 870.505. When there is more than 
one assignee, all assignees must agree to the cancellation. A 
cancellation of Basic insurance also cancels all Optional insurance.


<R05>
Sec. 870.907  Termination and conversion.

    (a) Assigned insurance terminates under the conditions stated in 
subpart F of this part.
    (b)(1) When an insured individual's insurance terminates, an 
assignee has the right to convert all or part of the group insurance to 
an individual policy on the insured individual. The conditions stated in 
subpart F of this part apply to assignees who elect to convert.
    (2) When there is more than one assignee, each assignee has the 
right to convert all or part of his/her share of the insurance. Any 
assignee who doesn't convert loses all ownership of the insurance.
    (3) When there is more than one assignee, the maximum amount of 
insurance each assignee will be able to convert is determined by the 
dollar amount corresponding to the assignee's share of the total 
insurance. This amount will be rounded up to the next higher thousand, 
if it's not already an even thousand dollar amount.
    (4) Premiums for converted life insurance are based on the insured 
individual's age and class of risk at the time the conversion policy is 
issued.
    (5) The employing office must notify each assignee of the conversion 
right at the time the assigned group insurance terminates.
    (c) An assignment terminates 31 days after the insurance terminates, 
unless the insured individual is reemployed in or returns to a position 
in which he/she is entitled to coverage under this part within 31 days 
after the insurance terminates. Exception: If an employee elects 
portability for Option B coverage, an assignment remains in effect. If 
the individual returns to Federal service, Basic insurance and any 
Option A insurance acquired through returning to service is subject to 
the existing assignment.

<R05>
Sec. 870.908  Annuitants and compensationers.

    (a) If an employee assigns Basic insurance and later becomes 
eligible to continue such insurance coverage as an annuitant or 
compensationer as provided in Sec. 870.701:
    (1) At the time he/she retires or becomes eligible as a 
compensationer, the insured individual may elect unreduced or partially 
reduced insurance coverage as provided in Sec. 870.702(a). This right 
remains with the insured individual and does not transfer to the 
assignee. Exception: if the insured individual elected a partial Living 
Benefit as an employee under subpart K of this

[[Page 423]]

part, he/she can only elect unreduced insurance coverage.
    (2) After the individual has made the election described in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the assignee (or, if more than one, 
all of the assignees acting together) may, at any time, elect to cancel 
the annuitant's or compensationer's election of increased coverage, as 
provided in Sec. 870.702(b). The right to cancel the election transfers 
to the assignee; the annuitant or compensationer cannot cancel the 
election after making an assignment. Exception: if the individual 
elected a partial Living Benefit as an employee under subpart K of this 
part, the assignee(s) cannot cancel the election of unreduced insurance 
coverage.
    (b) When more than one assignee has been named, at the time the 
insured individual becomes eligible to continue coverage as an annuitant 
or compensationer, some assignees may choose to convert their part of 
the insurance, while others may choose to continue the coverage during 
the insured individual's retirement or receipt of compensation. The 
amount of each type of continued insurance is determined by the total 
percentage of the shares of the assignees who choose to continue the 
coverage.
    (c)(1) When an annuitant who has assigned his/her insurance is 
reemployed in a position in which he/she is entitled to life insurance 
coverage, the coverage he/she acquires as a reemployed annuitant is 
subject to the existing assignment.
    (2) The right of a reemployed annuitant to elect Option B coverage 
as an employee rather than as an annuitant under Sec. 870.705(d)(3) 
remains with the insured individual and does not transfer to the 
assignee. Any Option B coverage elected as an employee is subject to the 
existing assignment.


<R05>
Sec. 870.909  Designations and changes of beneficiary.

    (a)(1) An assignment automatically cancels an insured individual's 
prior designation of beneficiary. After making an assignment, an 
individual cannot designate a beneficiary; the right to designate 
beneficiaries transfers to the assignee.
    (2) Each assignee may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to 
receive insurance benefits upon the death of the insured individual and 
may also later change the beneficiaries. An assignee may designate 
himself/herself the primary beneficiary and name another contingent 
beneficiary(ies) to receive insurance benefits if the assignee dies 
before the insured individual.
    (b) Benefits for assigned insurance are paid to the assignee(s) if 
the assignee(s) did not designate a beneficiary.
    (c) Benefits for assigned insurance are paid to an assignee's estate 
if the assignee dies before the insured individual and:
    (1) The assignee (or the assignee's heirs) did not designate a 
beneficiary; or
    (2) The assignee's designated beneficiary dies before the insured 
individual.
    (d) The provisions of Sec. 870.802 apply to designations of 
beneficiary made by assignees.

cannot be requested by a representative acting on the individual's 
behalf.
    (c) An individual who cancels the insurance under this section

    (a) Effective July 25, 1995, an insured individual who is certified 
by his/her doctor as terminally ill, as defined in Sec. 870.101, may 
elect to receive a lump-sum payment of Basic insurance.
    (b) Optional insurance is not available for payment as a Living 
Benefit.
    (c)(1) The effective date of a Living Benefit election is the date 
on which the Living Benefit payment is cashed or deposited. Once an 
election becomes effective, it can't be revoked. No further election of 
Living Benefits can be made.
    (2) If the insured individual dies before cashing or depositing the 
Living Benefit payment, the payment must be returned to OFEGLI.
    (d) If the insured individual has assigned his/her insurance, he/she 
cannot elect a Living Benefit; nor can an assignee elect a Living 
Benefit on behalf of an insured individual.
    (e) If an individual has elected a Living Benefit, he/she may assign 
his/her remaining insurance.


<R05>
Sec. 870.1102  Amount of a Living Benefit.

    (a)(1) An employee may elect to receive either:
    (i) A full Living Benefit, which is all of his/her Basic insurance, 
or

insurance, in a multiple of $1,000.
    (2) An annuitant or compensationer may only elect to receive a full 
Living Benefit.
    (b) The amount of Basic insurance elected as a Living Benefit will 
be reduced by an actuarial amount representing the amount of interest 
lost to the Fund because of the early payment of benefits.
    (c)(1) If an individual elects a full Living Benefit, the post-
election BIA will be 0. If an employee elects a partial Living Benefit, 
the post-election BIA will be the BIA reduced in proportion to the 
amount of Basic insurance elected as a Living Benefit, as prescribed by 
Pub. L. 103-409 (108 Stat. 4231).
    (2) The post-election BIA cannot change after the effective date of 
a Living Benefit election.
    (d)(1) If an employee elects a full Living Benefit, Basic accidental 
death and dismemberment coverage terminates as of the effective date of

    (2) If an employee elects a partial Living Benefit, Basic accidental 
death and dismemberment coverage is reduced to equal the post-election 
BIA.

no one can apply on his/her behalf.
    (2) The insured individual must complete the first part of the 
application and have his/her physician complete the second part. The 
completed application must be submitted directly to OFEGLI.
    (c)(1) OFEGLI reviews the application, obtains certification from 
the insured's employing office regarding the amount of insurance and the 
absence of an assignment, and determines whether the individual meets 
the requirements to elect a Living Benefit.
    (2) If OFEGLI needs additional information, it will contact the 
insured or the insured's physician.
    (3) Under certain circumstances, OFEGLI may require a medical 
examination before making a decision. In these cases, OFEGLI is 
financially responsible for the cost of the medical examination.
    (d)(1) If the application is approved, OFEGLI sends the insured a 
check for

[[Page 426]]

the Living Benefit payment and an explanation of benefits.
    (i) Until the check has been cashed or deposited, the individual may 
change his/her mind about electing a Living Benefit; if this happens, 
the individual must mark the check ``void'' and return it to OFEGLI.
    (ii) Once the insured individual has cashed or deposited the 
payment, the Living Benefit election becomes effective and cannot be 
revoked; OFEGLI then sends explanations of benefits to the insured's 
employing office, so it can make the necessary changes in withholdings 
and deductions.
    (2) If the application is not approved, OFEGLI will notify the 
insured individual and the employing office. The decision is not subject 
to administrative review; however, the individual can submit additional 
medical information or reapply at a later date if future circumstances 
warrant.

             Subpart A_Administration and General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 875.101  Definitions.

    This part is written as if the reader were an applicant or enrollee. 
Accordingly, the terms ``you,'' ``your,'' etc., refer, as appropriate, 
to the applicant or enrollee.
    In this part, the terms annuitant, employee, member of the uniformed 
services, retired member of the uniformed services, and qualified 
relative have the meanings set forth in section 9001 of title 5, United 
States Code, and supplement the following definitions:
    Abbreviated underwriting is a type of underwriting that asks fewer 
questions about your health status than with full underwriting to enable 
the Carrier to determine whether your application for coverage will be 
approved. The Carrier may also require review of your medical records, a 
phone interview, or an in-home interview.
    Actively at work means:
    (1) That as an active workforce member other than a member of the 
uniformed services you meet all of the following conditions:
    (i) You are reporting for work at an approved work location and you 
work at least one-half of your regularly scheduled hours for that day; 
and

[[Page 429]]

    (ii) You are able to perform all the usual and customary duties of 
your employment on your regular work schedule.
    (2) For a member of the uniformed services, that you are on active 
duty and are physically able to perform the duties of your position.
    Carrier means a qualified carrier as defined in section 9001 of 
title 5, United States Code, with which OPM has contracted to provide 
long term care insurance coverage under this section. A Carrier may 
designate 1 or more administrators to perform some of its obligations.
    Eligible individual means an annuitant, active workforce member, 
member of the uniformed services, retired member of the uniformed 
services or qualified relative, as defined in section 9001 of title 5, 
United States Code.
    Enrollee means an eligible individual whose application for coverage 
the Carrier has approved and whose coverage is in effect.
    FLTCIP means the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program.
    Free look means that within 30 days after you receive the Benefit 
Booklet, you may cancel your coverage if you are not satisfied with it 
and receive a refund of any premium you paid. It will be as if the 
coverage was never issued.
    Full underwriting is the more comprehensive type of underwriting 
under the FLTCIP, which requires that you answer many questions about 
your health status to enable the Carrier to determine whether your 
application for coverage will be approved. The Carrier may also require 
review of your medical records, a phone interview, or an in-home 
interview.
    Stepparent means any person, other than your mother or father, who 
is currently married to one of your parents, or, if one of your parents 
is dead, a person who was married to that parent at the time of that 
parent's death.
    Underwriting requirements means the information about your current 
health status and history and other information that you must provide to 
the Carrier with your application for coverage to enable the Carrier to 
determine your insurability.
    Workforce member means a Federal civilian or Postal employee, member 
of the uniformed services, Federal annuitant, retired member of the 
uniformed services, or member of any other eligible group, as defined in 
section 9001 of title 5, United States Code. An active workforce member 
is one who is currently employed or is on active duty.

<R05>
Sec. 875.102  Where do I send benefit claims?

    You must submit your benefit claims to the FLTCIP Carrier or its 
designee.


<R05>
Sec. 875.103  Do I need to authorize release of my medical records when I file a claim?

    Yes, if you file a claim for benefits, the Carrier needs to have a 
valid authorization from you to release your medical records.


<R05>
Sec. 875.104  What are the steps required to resolve a dispute involving benefit eligibility or payment of a claim?

    (a) If you dispute the Carrier's denial of your eligibility for 
benefits or your claim for payment of benefits, you must first send a 
written request for reconsideration to the Carrier no later than 60 days 
from the date of its decision.
    (b) The Carrier must provide you with written notice of its review 
decision no later than 60 days after the date it receives your 
reconsideration request.
    (c) If the Carrier upholds its denial (or does not respond within 60 
days), you have the right to appeal its reconsideration decision 
directly to the Carrier. You must make this appeal in writing within 60 
days from the date of the Carrier's notice upholding its decision. You 
will be notified of the decision on your appeal in writing no later than 
60 days from receipt of your appeal request.
    (d) If a denial of your eligibility for benefits or a denial of your 
claim is upheld upon appeal due to the evaluation of your medical 
condition/functional capacity, the Carrier will inform you that you may 
request that an independent third party, mutually agreed to by OPM and 
the Carrier, review the decision. You must make this request

[[Page 430]]

in writing within 60 days from the date of the notice informing you of 
the appeal decision. The independent third party must notify you in 
writing of its decision no later than 60 days from the Carrier's or its 
designee's receipt of your request for appeal to the third party. This 
is the final administrative remedy available to you. The decision of the 
independent third party is final and binding on the Carrier.
    (e) You may seek judicial review of the final administrative denial 
of a claim. Such action may not be brought prior to exhaustion of the 
administrative process provided in this section. To pursue such judicial 
review, you must bring legal action against the Carrier in an 
appropriate United States district court within 2 years from the date of 
the final decision. You may not sue OPM, the independent reviewer, or 
any other entity. If you prevail in court, your recovery is limited to 
the amount of benefits payable under your benefit booklet and schedule 
of benefits.

proof of insurance. You will also get a copy of your approved 
application for coverage.


<R05>

60-day period, you may submit an application within 60 days after your 
employing office advises you of that determination. Similarly, your 
employing office may make this determination if your spouse is unable to 
submit an application during the same time period for a cause beyond

Sec. 875.207  What happens if I am in nonpay status during an open season?

    (a) If you return to a pay status from nonpay status during the open

pursuant to the open season underwriting requirements for Federal 
civilian or Postal employees and members of the uniformed services.
    (b) If you return to pay status from nonpay status after the open 
season, you have 60 days from the date of your return to apply for

    You may not apply as a qualified relative if the workforce member on 
whom you are basing your qualified relative status died prior to the

as the spouse of a deceased workforce member. In this case, your adult 
children and your current spouse are also considered to be qualified

to inform the Carrier that you are no longer eligible.
    (b) In two instances, you will continue to be eligible for coverage 
even if you lose your status as part of an eligible group after you 
submit an application for coverage, but before your coverage becomes 
effective. The two instances are:
    (1) When you are involuntarily separated from Federal civilian 
service (except for misconduct) or from the uniformed services (except

Carrier will either reimburse you or reduce a future premium payment(s) 
by the amount of the overpayment.
    (c) If you die while you have coverage, any premiums paid for the

work at least 1 day during the calendar week immediately before the week 
which contains your coverage effective date for your coverage to become

will issue you a revised effective date, which will be the 1st day of 
the next month. You also must meet the actively at work requirement for 
any revised effective date for coverage to become effective, or you will 
be issued another revised effective date in the same manner.

<R05>
Sec. 875.405  If I marry, may my new spouse apply for coverage?

    (a)(1) If you are a Federal civilian or Postal employee or member of 
the uniformed services and you have married, your spouse is eligible to 
submit an application for coverage under this section within 60 days 
from the date of your marriage, and will be subject to the underwriting 
requirements in force for the spouses of civilian employees and members 
of the uniformed services during the most recent open season. You, 
however, are not eligible for abbreviated underwriting because of your 
marriage. You may apply for coverage along with your spouse, but full 
underwriting will be required for you.
    (2) After 60 days, your spouse may still apply for coverage but will 
be subject to full underwriting. Your new qualified relatives (such as 
parents-in-law) may apply for coverage with full underwriting at any 
time following the marriage.
    (b) The new spouse and other qualified relatives of an annuitant or 
retired member of the uniformed services may apply for coverage with 
full underwriting at any time following the marriage.


<R05>
Sec. 875.406  May I change my coverage?

    (a) You may make the following changes to your coverage:

[[Page 435]]

    (1) You may apply to increase your coverage at any time. Full 
underwriting is required, except when an open season allows abbreviated 
underwriting.
    (2) If you increase your coverage by adding to your daily benefit 
amount, the premiums for the additional coverage will be based on your 
age, prevailing premium rates, and coverage rules in effect at the time 
you purchase the additional coverage.
    (3) For other types of coverage increases, your entire premium will 
be based on your age, prevailing premium rates, and coverage rules in 
effect at the time you purchase the increased coverage. Any increase in 
coverage will take effect on the 1st day of the month following the date 
the Carrier approves your request for an increase.
    (b) You may decrease your coverage at any time, although any 
decrease will be subject to coverage rules at the time of the decrease. 
Decreased coverage takes effect on the 1st day of the month after the 
Carrier receives your request. You will not receive any refund of 
premiums paid for coverage you held before the decrease; however, your 
subsequent premiums will be reduced based on your new, lower level of 
coverage. The Carrier will refund or credit any portion of premium paid 
in advance for the period following the date on which you decrease your 
coverage.
    (c) You may cancel your coverage at any time.
    (1) If you cancel during the free look period, your premiums will be 
refunded to you.
    (2) If you cancel your coverage at any time other than during the 
free look period, cancellation will take effect on your requested 
cancellation date or at the end of the period covered by your last 
premium payment, whichever occurs first. You will not receive any refund 
of premiums paid, other than any premiums paid in advance for the period 
following the effective date of your cancellation of coverage, and you 
will not have to pay any more premiums unless you owed retroactive 
premiums.


<R05>
Sec. 875.407  Who makes insurability decisions?

    The Carrier determines the insurability of all applicants. The 
Carrier's decision may not be appealed to OPM.


<R05>
Sec. 875.408  What is the significance of incontestability?

    (a) Incontestability means coverage issued based on an erroneous 
application may remain in effect. Such coverage will not remain in 
effect, and your claim may be denied, under any of the following 
conditions:
    (1) If your coverage has been in force for less than 6 months, the 
Carrier may void your coverage or deny a claim upon a showing that 
information on your signed application that was material to your 
approval for coverage is different than what is shown in your medical 
records.
    (2) If your coverage has been in force for at least 6 months but 
less than 2 years, the Carrier may void your coverage or deny a claim 
upon a showing that information on your signed application that was 
material to your approval for coverage is different than what is shown 
in your medical records, and pertains to the condition for which 
benefits are sought.
    (3) After your coverage has been in effect for 2 years, the Carrier 
may void your coverage only upon a showing that you knowingly and 
intentionally made a false or misleading statement or omitted 
information in your signed application for coverage regarding your 
health status.
    (b) Your coverage can be contested at any time when the Carrier 
finds that you were not an eligible individual at the time you applied 
and were approved for coverage.
    (c) If the Carrier voids coverage after it has paid benefits, it 
cannot recover the benefits already paid.
    (d) Incontestability does not apply when you have not paid your 
premiums on a timely basis.


<R05>
Sec. 875.409  Must I provide an authorization to release medical information?

    You must provide the Carrier with an authorization to release 
medical information when requested. The Carrier may deny a claim for 
benefits or void your coverage if the Carrier does not

[[Page 436]]

receive an authorization to release medical information within 3 weeks 
after its request (4 weeks for those outside the United States).


<R05>
Sec. 875.410  May I continue my coverage when I leave Federal or military service?

    If you are a Federal civilian or Postal employee or member of the 
uniformed services, your coverage will automatically continue when you 
leave active service, as long as the Carrier continues to receive the 
required premium when due. However, once you leave active service, you 
are no longer eligible for any abbreviated underwriting provided during 
any future open season.


<R05>
Sec. 875.411  May I continue my coverage when I am no longer a qualified relative?

    If you are already enrolled as a qualified relative, you may 
continue your FLTCIP coverage if you subsequently lose qualified 
relative status (such as upon divorce), as long as the Carrier receives 
the required premium when due.


<R05>
Sec. 875.412  When will my coverage terminate?

    Your coverage will terminate on the earliest of the following dates:
    (a) The date you specify to the Carrier that you wish your coverage 
to end;
    (b) The date of your death;
    (c) The end of the period covered by your last premium payment if 
you do not pay the required premiums when due, after a grace period of 
30 days; or
    (d) The date you have exhausted your maximum lifetime benefit. 
(However, in this event, care coordination services will continue.)


<R05>
Sec. 875.413  Is it possible to have coverage reinstated?

    (a) Under certain circumstances, your coverage can be reinstated. 
The Carrier will reinstate your coverage if it receives proof 
satisfactory to it, within 6 months from the termination date, that you 
suffered from a cognitive impairment or loss of functional capacity, 
before the grace period ended, that caused you to miss making premium 
payments. In that event, you will not be required to submit to 
underwriting. Your coverage will be reinstated retroactively to the 
termination date but you must pay back premiums for that period. The 
premium will be the same as it was prior to termination.
    (b) If your coverage has terminated because you did not pay premiums 
or because you requested cancellation, the Carrier may reinstate your 
coverage within 12 months from the termination date at your request. You 
will be required to reapply based on full underwriting, and the Carrier 
will determine whether you are still insurable. If you are insurable, 
your coverage will be reinstated retroactively to the termination date 
and you must pay back premiums for that period. The premium will be the 
same as it was prior to termination.


<R05>
Sec. 875.414  Will benefits be coordinated with other coverage?

    Yes, benefits will be coordinated with other plans, following the 
coordination of benefits (COB) guidelines set by the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners. The total benefits from all 
plans that pay a long term care benefit to you should not exceed the 
actual costs you incur. The other plans that are considered for COB 
purposes include government programs, group medical benefits, and other 
employer-sponsored long term care insurance plans. Medicaid, individual 
insurance policies, and association group insurance policies are not 
taken into consideration under this provision.

<R04>
                          Subpart B_Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 880.201  Purpose and scope.

    This subpart establishes the procedures that OPM will use to--
    (a) Determine that an individual is a missing annuitant;
    (b) Suspend payment of annuity to a missing annuitant;
    (c) Notify individuals affected by such a suspension of payments; 
and
    (d) Determine that a missing annuitant has died.


<R05>
Sec. 880.202  Referral to Associate Director.

    Any OPM office that receives information concerning the possibility 
that an annuitant might have disappeared will notify the Associate 
Director.


<R05>
Sec. 880.203  Missing annuitant status and suspension of annuity.

    (a) Upon receipt of information concerning the possibility that an 
annuitant has disappeared, the Associate Director will conduct such 
inquiry as he or she determines to be necessary to determine whether the 
annuitant is alive and whether the annuitant's whereabouts can be 
determined.
    (b) If during an inquiry under paragraph (a) of this section, or 
upon subsequent receipt of additional information, the Associate 
Director finds substantial evidence (as defined in Sec. 1201.56(c)(1) 
of this title) to believe that an annuitant is either not alive or that 
the annuitant's whereabouts cannot be determined, the annuitant acquires 
the status of missing annuitant. The Associate Director will then--
    (1) Suspend payments to the missing annuitant; and
    (2) Notify individuals who may be able to qualify for payments under 
Sec. 880.302 that--
    (i) OPM has suspended the annuity payments to the missing annuitant;
    (ii) Payment may be made under Sec. 880.302, including the amount 
available for payment, how that amount was determined, and the 
documentation required (if any) to qualify for such payments; and
    (iii) In response to an inquiry from any person seeking CSRS, FERS, 
FEHBP, or FEGLI benefits, OPM will provide information about 
documentation necessary to establish a claim for such benefits.


<R05>
Sec. 880.204  Restoration of annuity.

    (a) If the missing annuitant's whereabouts are determined, and he or 
she is alive and--
    (1) Competent, OPM will resume payments to the annuitant and pay 
retroactive annuity for the period in missing status less any payment 
made to the family during that period; or
    (2) Incompetent, OPM will resume payments to a representative payee 
under section 8345(e) or section 8466(c) of title 5, United States Code, 
and pay retroactive annuity for the period in missing status less any 
payment made to the family during that period.
    (b) If the missing annuitant's whereabouts cannot be determined, 
missing annuitant status continues until an authorized institution 
determines that the missing annuitant is dead. (See Sec. 880.205.)


<R05>
Sec. 880.205  Determinations of death.

    OPM does not make findings of presumed death. A claimant for CSRS, 
FERS, or FEGLI death benefits (other than payments under Sec. 880.302) 
or an individual seeking an adjustment of accounts under Sec. 880.207 
must submit a death certificate or other legal certification of death 
issued by an authorized institution.

[[Page 439]]


<R05>
Sec. 880.206  Date of death.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, for the 
purpose of benefits administered by OPM, the date of death of a missing 
annuitant who has been determined to be dead by an authorized 
institution is the date of disappearance as determined by the Associate 
Director.
    (b) For the purpose of determining whether a claim is untimely under 
any statute of limitations applicable to CSRS, FERS or FEGLI benefits 
(section 8345(i)(2), section 8466(b), or section 8705(b) through (d) of 
title 5, United States Code), the time between the date of disappearance 
and the date on which the authorized institution issues its decision 
that the missing annuitant is dead is excluded.


<R05>
Sec. 880.207  Adjustment of accounts after finding of death.

    After a missing annuitant is determined to be dead under Sec. 
880.205, OPM will review the case to determine whether additional 
benefits are payable or excess insurance premiums have been withheld.


<R04>
                   Subpart C_Continuation of Benefits


<R05>
Sec. 880.301  Purpose.

    This subpart establishes OPM's policy concerning the availability 
and amount of CSRS and FERS annuity payments and the continuation of 
FEHBP and FEGLI coverage and premiums while an annuitant is classified 
as a missing annuitant.


<R05>
Sec. 880.302  Payments of CSRS or FERS benefits.

    (a) OPM will pay an amount equal to the survivor annuity that would 
be payable as CSRS or FERS survivor annuity to an account in a financial 
institution designated (under electronic funds transfer regulations in 
part 209 or part 210 of Title 31, Code of Federal Regulations) by an 
individual who, if the missing annuitant were dead, would be entitled to 
receive payment of a survivor annuity.
    (b) If more than one individual would qualify for survivor annuity 
payments in the event of the missing annuitant's death, OPM will make 
separate payments in the same manner as if the missing annuitant were 
dead.


<R05>
Sec. 880.303  FEHBP coverage.

    (a) If the missing annuitant had a family enrollment, the enrollment 
will be transferred to the eligible family members under Sec. 
890.303(c) of this chapter. If there is only one eligible family member, 
the enrollment will be changed to a self-only enrollment under Sec. 
890.306(r) of this chapter. The changes will be effective the first day 
of the pay period following the date of disappearance.
    (b) If the missing annuitant was covered by a self only enrollment 
or if there is no eligible family member remaining, the enrollment 
terminates at midnight of the last day of the pay period in which he or 
she disappeared, subject to the temporary extension of coverage for 
conversion.
    (c) If the missing annuitant is found to be alive, the coverage held 
before the disappearance is reinstated effective with the pay period 
during which the annuitant is found, unless the annuitant, or the 
annuitant's representative, requests that the enrollment be restored 
retroactively to the pay period in which the disappearance occurred.


<R05>
Sec. 880.304  FEGLI coverage.

    (a) FEGLI premiums will not be collected during periods when an 
annuitant is a missing annuitant.
    (b)(1) If the annuity of a missing annuitant is restored under Sec. 
880.204(a), OPM will deduct the amount of FEGLI premiums attributable to 
the period when the annuitant was a missing annuitant from any 
adjustment payment due the annuitant under Sec. 880.204(a).
    (2) If a missing annuitant is determined to be dead under Sec. 
880.205, FEGLI premiums and benefits will be computed using the date of 
death established under Sec. 880.206(a).

    Immediate annuity means an annuity which begins to accrue not later 
than 1 month after the date enrollment under a health benefits plan 
would cease for an employee or member of family if he were not entitled 
to continue enrollment as an annuitant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
an annuity which commences on the birth of the posthumous child of an 
employee or annuitant is an immediate annuity. For an individual who 
separates from service upon meeting the requirements for an annuity 
under Sec. 842.204(a)(1) of this chapter, immediate annuity includes an 
annuity for which the commencing date is postponed under Sec. 
842.204(c).

that section applies and the regular pay period for employees not 
covered by that section. Pay period, as it relates to a former spouse or 
annuitant who is not actively receiving an annuity, including surviving 
spouses receiving a basic employee death benefit, and enrollees 
temporarily continuing coverage under subpart K of this part, means any 
regular pay period for employees of the agency to which jurisdiction and 
responsibility for health benefits actions for the enrollee have been 
delegated as provided under the definition of ``employing office'' in 
this section. Pay period for annuitants in active receipt of annuity 
means the period for which a single installment of annuity is 
customarily paid.
    Reconsideration means the final level of administrative review of an 
employing office's initial decision to determine if the employing office 
correctly applied the law and regulations.
    Underdeduction means a failure to withhold the required amount of 
health benefits contributions from an individual's pay, annuity, or 
compensation. This definition includes both nondeductions (when none of 
the required amounts was withheld) and partial deductions (when only 
part of the required amount was withheld). Though FEHB contributions are 
required to cover a period of nonpay status, the nonpayment of 
contributions during such period does not result in an underdeduction.
    (b) Whenever, in this part, a period of time is stated as a number 
of days or a number of days from an event, the period is computed in 
calendar days, excluding the day of the event. Whenever, in this part, a 
period of time is defined by beginning and ending dates, the period 
includes the beginning and ending dates.

Sec. 890.104  Initial decision and reconsideration on enrollment.

    (a) Who may file. Except as provided under Sec. 890.1112, an 
individual may request an agency or retirement system to reconsider an 
initial decision of its employing office denying coverage or change of 
enrollment.
    (b) Initial employing office decision. An employing office's 
decision is considered an initial decision as used in paragraph (a) of 
this section when rendered by the employing office in writing and 
stating the right to an independent level of review (reconsideration) by 
the agency or retirement system. However, an initial decision rendered 
at the highest level of review available within OPM is not subject to 
reconsideration.

[[Page 447]]

    (c) Reconsideration. (1) A request for reconsideration must be made 
in writing, must include the claimant's name, address, date of birth, 
Social Security number, name of carrier, reason(s) for the request, and, 
if applicable, retirement claim number.
    (2) The reconsideration review must be an independent review 
designated at or above the level at which the initial decision was 
rendered.
    (d) Time limit. A request for reconsideration of an initial decision 
must be filed within 30 calendar days from the date of the written 
decision stating the right to a reconsideration. The time limit on 
filing may be extended when the individual shows that he or she was not 
notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he 
or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from 
making the request within the time limit. An agency or retirement system 
decision in response to a request for reconsideration of an employing 
office's decision is a final decision as described in paragraph (e) of 
this section.
    (e) Final decision. After reconsideration, the agency or retirement 
system must issue a final decision, which must be in writing and must 
fully set forth the findings and conclusions.

<R05>
Sec. 890.105  Filing claims for payment or service.

    (a) General. (1) Each health benefits carrier resolves claims filed 
under the plan. All health benefits claims must be submitted initially 
to the carrier of the covered individual's health benefits plan. If the 
carrier denies a claim (or a portion of a claim), the covered individual 
may ask the carrier to reconsider its denial. If the carrier affirms its 
denial or fails to respond as required by paragraph (c) of this section, 
the covered individual may ask OPM to review the claim. A covered 
individual must exhaust both the carrier and OPM review processes 
specified in this section before seeking judicial review of the denied 
claim.
    (2) This section applies to covered individuals and to other 
individuals or entities who are acting on the behalf of a covered 
individual and who have the covered individual's specific written 
consent to pursue payment of the disputed claim.
    (b) Time limits for reconsidering a claim. (1) The covered 
individual has 6 months from the date of the notice to the covered 
individual that a claim (or a portion of a claim) was denied by the 
carrier in which to submit a written request for reconsideration to the 
carrier. The time limit for requesting reconsideration may be extended 
when the covered individual shows that he or she was prevented by 
circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within 
the time limit.
    (2) The carrier has 30 days after the date of receipt of a timely-
filed request for reconsideration to:
    (i) Affirm the denial in writing to the covered individual;
    (ii) Pay the bill or provide the service; or
    (iii) Request from the covered individual or provider additional 
information needed to make a decision on the claim. The carrier must 
simultaneously notify the covered individual of the information 
requested if it requests additional information from a provider. The 
carrier has 30 days after the date the information is received to affirm 
the denial in writing to the covered individual or pay the bill or 
provide the service. The carrier must make its decision based on the 
evidence it has if the covered individual or provider does not respond 
within 60 days after the date of the carrier's notice requesting 
additional information. The carrier must then send written notice to the 
covered individual of its decision on the claim. The covered individual 
may request OPM review as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section 
if the carrier fails to act within the time limit set forth in this 
paragraph (b)(2)(iii).
    (3) The covered individual may write to OPM and request that OPM 
review the carrier's decision if the carrier either affirms its denial 
of a claim or fails to respond to a covered individual's written request 
for reconsideration within the time limit set forth in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section. The covered individual must submit the request for OPM 
review within the time limit specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.

[[Page 448]]

    (4) The carrier may extend the time limit for a covered individual's 
submission of additional information to the carrier when the covered 
individual shows he or she was not notified of the time limit or was 
prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from submitting the 
additional information.
    (c) Information required to process requests for reconsideration. 
(1) The covered individual must put the request to the carrier to 
reconsider a claim in writing and give the reasons, in terms of 
applicable brochure provisions, that the denied claim should have been 
approved.
    (2) If the carrier needs additional information from the covered 
individual to make a decision, it must:
    (i) Specifically identify the information needed;
    (ii) State the reason the information is required to make a decision 
on the claim;
    (iii) Specify the time limit (60 days after the date of the 
carrier's request) for submitting the information; and
    (iv) State the consequences of failure to respond within the time 
limit specified, as set out in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (d) Carrier determinations. The carrier must provide written notice 
to the covered individual of its determination. If the carrier affirms 
the initial denial, the notice must inform the covered individual of:
    (1) The specific and detailed reasons for the denial;
    (2) The covered individual's right to request a review by OPM; and
    (3) The requirement that requests for OPM review must be received 
within 90 days after the date of the carrier's denial notice and include 
a copy of the denial notice as well as documents to support the covered 
individual's position.
    (e) OPM review. (1) If the covered individual seeks further review 
of the denied claim, the covered individual must make a request to OPM 
to review the carrier's decision. Such a request to OPM must be made:
    (i) Within 90 days after the date of the carrier's notice to the 
covered individual that the denial was affirmed;
    (ii) If the carrier fails to respond to the covered individual as 
provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, within 120 days after the 
date of the covered individual's timely request for reconsideration by 
the carrier; or
    (iii) Within 120 days after the date the carrier requests additional 
information from the covered individual, or the date the covered 
individual is notified that the carrier is requesting additional 
information from a provider. OPM may extend the time limit for a covered 
individual's request for OPM review when the covered individual shows he 
or she was not notified of the time limit or was prevented by 
circumstances beyond his or her control from submitting the request for 
OPM review within the time limit.
    (2) In reviewing a claim denied by the carrier, OPM may:
    (i) Request that the covered individual submit additional 
information;
    (ii) Obtain an advisory opinion from an independent physician;
    (iii) Obtain any other information as may in its judgment be 
required to make a determination; or
    (iv) Make its decision based solely on the information the covered 
individual provided with his or her request for review.
    (3) When OPM requests information from the carrier, the carrier must 
release the information within 30 days after the date of OPM's written 
request unless a different time limit is specified by OPM in its 
request.
    (4) Within 90 days after receipt of the request for review, OPM will 
either:
    (i) Give a written notice of its decision to the covered individual 
and the carrier; or
    (ii) Notify the individual of the status of the review. If OPM does 
not receive requested evidence within 15 days after expiration of the 
applicable time limit in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, OPM may make 
its decision based solely on information available to it at that time 
and give a written notice of its decision to the covered individual and 
to the carrier.
    (5) OPM, upon its own motion, may reopen its review if it receives 
evidence that was unavailable at the time of its original decision.

    For the purpose of making findings of fact and to the extent that

Sec. 890.107  Court review.

    (a) A suit to compel enrollment under Sec. 890.102 must be brought 
against the employing office that made the enrollment decision.
    (b) A suit to review the legality of OPM's regulations under this 
part must be brought against the Office of Personnel Management.
    (c) Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) carriers resolve FEHB 
claims under authority of Federal statute (5 U.S.C. chapter 89). A 
covered individual may seek judicial review of OPM's final action on the 
denial of a health benefits claim. A legal action to review final action 
by OPM involving such denial of health benefits must be brought against 
OPM and not against the carrier or carrier's subcontractors. The 
recovery in such a suit shall be limited to a court order directing OPM 
to require the carrier to pay the amount of benefits in dispute.
    (d) An action under paragraph (c) of this section to recover on a 
claim for health benefits:
    (1) May not be brought prior to exhaustion of the administrative 
remedies provided in Sec. 890.105;
    (2) May not be brought later than December 31 of the 3rd year after 
the year in which the care or service was provided; and
    (3) Will be limited to the record that was before OPM when it 
rendered its decision affirming the carrier's denial of benefits.

Sec. 890.108  Waiver of requirements for continued coverage during retirement.

    (a) OPM may waive the eligibility requirements under 5 U.S.C. 
8905(b) for health benefits coverage as an annuitant in the case of an 
individual who fails to satisfy such requirements if OPM, in its sole 
discretion, determines that, because of exceptional circumstances, it 
would be against equity and good conscience not to allow such individual 
to be enrolled as an annuitant in a health benefits plan under this 
part.
    (b) OPM may grant a waiver as described in paragraph (a) of this 
section to an annuitant in rare and unusual circumstances if the 
annuitant shows by the preponderance of the evidence that--
    (1) There is evidence demonstrating that the individual intended to 
be covered as an annuitant;
    (2) The circumstance(s) that prevented the completion of the 
requirements of 5 U.S.C. 8905(b) was (were) essentially outside the 
individual's control; and
    (3) The individual exercised due diligence in protecting the right 
to coverage as an annuitant.
    (c) OPM will not grant a waiver solely because--
    (1) An individual's retirement is based on disability or an 
involuntary separation; or
    (2) An individual was misadvised (or not advised) by his or her 
employing office regarding the requirements for continuation of health 
benefits coverage into retirement.

Sec. 890.109  Exclusion of certain periods of eligibility when determining continued coverage during retirement.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, periods 
during which temporary employees are eligible under 5 U.S.C. 8906a to 
receive health benefits by enrolling and paying the full subscription 
charge, but are not eligible to participate in a retirement system, are 
not considered when determining eligibility for continued coverage 
during retirement. For the purpose of continuing coverage during 
retirement, an employee is considered to

have enrolled at his or her first opportunity if the employee registered 
to be enrolled when he or she received a permanent appointment entitling 
him or her to participate in a retirement system and to receive the 
Government contribution toward the health benefits premium payments.
    (b) A temporary employee eligible under 5 U.S.C. 8906a may continue 
enrollment as a compensationer if he or she has been enrolled or covered 
as a family member under another enrollment under this part for:
    (1) The 5 years of service immediately preceding the commencement of 
his or her monthly compensation; or
    (2) During all periods of service since his or her first opportunity 
to enroll, if less than 5 years. For the purpose of this paragraph, an 
employee is considered to have enrolled at his or her first opportunity 
if the employee registered to be enrolled when he or she first became 
eligible under 5 U.S.C. 8906a.

surrogate on a quarterly basis the names of the individuals who are 
enrolled in the carrier's plan in a format and containing such 
information as required by OPM.
    (b) The carrier must compare the data provided with its own 
enrollment records. When the carrier finds in its total enrollment 
records individuals whose names do not appear in the report from the 
employing office of record, the carrier must request the employing 
office to provide the documentation necessary to resolve the 
discrepancy.

                     Subpart B_Health Benefits Plans


<R05>
Sec. 890.201  Minimum standards for health benefits plans.

    (a) To qualify for approval by OPM, a health benefits plan shall 
meet the following standards. Once approved, a health benefits plan 
shall continue to meet the minimum standards. Failure on the part of the 
carrier's plan to meet the standards is cause for OPM's withdrawal of 
approval of the plan in accordance with 5 CFR 890.204. A health benefits 
plan shall:
    (1) Comply with chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, and this 
part, as amended from time to time.
    (2) Accept the enrollment, in accordance with this part, and without 
regard to age, race, sex, health status, or hazardous nature of 
employment, of each eligible employee, annuitant, former spouse, former 
employee, or child, except that a plan that is sponsored or underwritten 
by an employee organization may not accept the enrollment of a person 
who is not a member of the organization, but it may not limit membership 
in the organization on account of the prohibited factors (age, race, 
sex, health status, or hazardous nature of employment). The carrier may 
terminate the enrollment of an enrollee other than a survivor annuitant, 
a former spouse continuing coverage under Sec. 890.803, or person 
continuing coverage under Sec. 890.1103(a) (2) or (3), in a health 
benefits plan sponsored or underwritten by an employee organization on 
account of termination of membership in the organization. A carrier that 
wants to terminate the enrollment of an enrollee under this paragraph 
may do so by notifying the employing office in writing, with a copy of 
the notice to the enrollee. The termination is effective at the end of 
the pay period in which the employing office receives the notice. A 
comprehensive medical plan need not enroll an employee, annuitant, 
former employee, former spouse, or child residing outside the geographic 
areas specified by the plan.
    (3) Provide health benefits for each enrollee and covered family 
member wherever they may be.
    (4) Provide for conversion to a contract for health benefits 
regularly offered by the carrier, or an appropriate affiliate, for group 
conversion purposes, which must be guaranteed renewable, subject to such 
amendments as apply to all contracts of this class, except that it may 
be canceled for fraud, overinsurance, or nonpayment of periodic charges. 
A carrier must permit conversion within the time allowed by the 
temporary extension of coverage

[[Page 451]]

provided under Sec. 890.401 for each enrollee and covered family member 
entitled to convert. When an employing office gives an enrollee written 
notice of his or her privilege of conversion, the carrier must permit 
conversion at any time before 31 days after the date of notice or 91 
days after the enrollment is terminated, whichever is earlier. Belated 
conversion opportunities as provided in Sec. 890.401(c) must also be 
permitted by the carrier. When OPM requests an extension of time for 
conversion because of delayed determination of ineligibility for 
immediate annuity, the carrier must permit conversion until the date 
specified by OPM in its request for extension. On conversion, the 
contract becomes effective as of the day following the last day of the 
temporary extension, and the enrollee or covered family member, as the 
case may be, must pay the entire cost thereof directly to the carrier. 
The nongroup contract may not deny or delay any benefit covered by the 
contract for a person converting from a plan approved under this part 
except to the extent that benefits are continued under the health 
benefits plan from which he or she converts.
    (5) Provide that each enrollee receive an identification card or 
cards or other evidence of enrollment.
    (6) Provide a standard rate structure which contains, for each 
option, one standard individual rate, and one standard family rate.
    (7) Maintain statistical records regarding the plan, separately from 
those of any other activities conducted or benefits offered by the 
carrier sponsoring or underwriting the plan.
    (8) Provide for a special reserve for the plan. The carrier shall 
account for amounts retained by it as reserves for the plan separately 
from reserves maintained by it for other plans. The carrier shall invest 
the special reserve and income derived from the investment of the 
special reserve shall be credited to the special reserve. If the 
contract is terminated or approval of the plan is withdrawn, the carrier 
shall return the special reserve to the Employees Health Benefits Fund. 
However, in the case of a comprehensive medical plan, the carrier, 
without regard to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, shall 
follow such financial procedures as are mutually agreed on by the 
carrier and OPM.
    (9) Provide for continued enrollment to the end of the current pay 
period, or termination date, if earlier, of each enrollee enrolled at 
the effective date of termination of a contract. The carrier is entitled 
to subscription charges for this continued enrollment.
    (10) Provide that any covered expenses incurred from January 1 to 
the effective date of an open season change count toward the losing 
carrier's prior year deductible. If the prior year deductible or family 
limit on deductibles of the losing carrier had previously been met, the 
enrolled individual (and eligible family members) shall be eligible for 
reimbursement by the losing carrier for covered expenses incurred during 
the current year. Reimbursement of covered expenses shall apply only to 
covered expenses incurred from January 1 to the effective date of the 
open season change. This section shall not apply to any other 
permissible changes made during a contract year.
    (11) Except where OPM determines otherwise, have 300 or more 
employees and annuitants, exclusive of family members, enrolled in the 
plan at some time during the preceding two contract terms.
    (b) To be qualified to be approved by OPM and, once approved, to 
continue to be approved, a health benefits plan shall not:
    (1) Deny a covered person a benefit provided by the plan for a 
service performed on or after the effective date of coverage solely 
because of a preexisting physical or mental condition.
    (2) Require a waiting period for any covered person for benefits 
which it provides.
    (3) Have more than two options and a high deductible health plan (26 
U.S.C. 223(c)(2)(A).
    (4) Have an initiation, service, enrollment, or other fee or charge 
in addition to the rate charged for the plan, except that a 
comprehensive medical plan may impose an additional charge to be paid 
directly by the enrollee for certain medical supplies and services, if

[[Page 452]]

the supplies and services on which additional charges are imposed are 
clearly set forth in advance and are applicable to all enrollees. This 
subparagraph does not apply to charges for membership in employee 
organizations sponsoring or underwriting plans.
    (5) Paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section do not preclude a plan 
offering benefits for dentistry or cosmetic surgery, or both, limited to 
conditions arising after the effective date of coverage.
    (c) The Director or his or her designee will determine whether to 
propose withdrawal of approval of the plan and hold a hearing based on 
the seriousness of the carrier's actions and its proposed method to 
effect corrective action.

[57 FR 14324, Apr. 20, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 890.203  Application for approval of, and proposal of amendments to, health benefit plans.

    (a) New plan applications. (1) The Director of OPM shall consider 
applications to participate in the FEHB Program from comprehensive 
medical plans (CMP's) at his or her discretion. CMP's are automatically 
invited to submit applications annually to participate in the FEHB 
Program unless otherwise notified by OPM. If the Director should 
determine that it is not beneficial to the enrollees and the Program to 
consider applications for a specific contract year, OPM will publish a 
notice with a 60 day comment period in the Federal Register no less than 
7 months prior to the date applications would be due for the specific 
contract year for which applications will not be accepted.
    (2) When applications are considered, CMP's should apply for 
approval by writing to the Office of Personnel Management, Washington, 
DC 20415. Application letters must be accompanied by any descriptive 
material, financial data, or other documentation required by OPM. Plans 
must submit the letter and attachments in the OPM-specified format by 
January 31, or another date specified by OPM, of the year preceding the 
contract year for which applications are being accepted. Plans must 
submit evidence demonstrating they meet all requirements for approval by 
March 31 of the year preceding the contract year for which applications 
are being accepted. Plans that miss either deadline cannot be considered 
for participation in the next contract year. All newly approved plans 
must submit benefit and rate proposals to OPM by May 31 of the year 
preceding the contract year for which applications are being accepted in 
order to be considered for participation in that contract year. OPM may 
make counter-proposals at any time.
    (3) OPM may approve such comprehensive medical plans as, in the 
judgment of OPM, may be in the best interest of enrollees in the 
Program. In addition to specific requirements set forth in 5 U.S.C. 
chapter 89, in chapter 1 and other relevant portions of title 48 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations, and in other sections of this part, to be 
approved, an applicant plan must actually be delivering medical care at 
the time of application; must be in compliance with applicable State 
licensing and operating requirements; must not be a Federal, State, 
local, or territorial governmental entity; and must not be debarred, 
suspended, or ineligible to participate in Government contracting or 
subcontracting for any reason, including fraudulent health care 
practices in other Federal health care programs.
    (4) Applications must identify those individuals who have the legal 
authority and responsibility to enter into and guarantee contracts. The 
applications will be reviewed for evidence of substantial compliance 
with the following standards:
    (i) Health plan management: Stable management with experience 
pertinent to the prepaid health care provider industry; sufficient 
operating experience

[[Page 453]]

to enable OPM to realistically evaluate the plan's past and expected 
future performance;
    (ii) Marketing: A rate of enrollment that ensures equalization of 
income and expenses within projected timeframes and sufficient 
subscriber income to operate within budget thereafter; enrollment 
dispersed among groups such that there is not a concentration of 
enrollment with one or a few groups so that the loss of one or more 
contracts by the carrier would not jeopardize its financial viability; 
feasible projections of future enrollment and employer distribution, as 
well as the potential enrollment area for marketing purposes;
    (iii) Health care delivery system: A health care delivery system 
providing reasonable access to and choice of quality primary and 
specialty medical care throughout the service area; specifically, in the 
individual practice setting, contractual arrangements for the services 
of a significant number of primary care and specialty physicians in the 
service area; and in the group practice setting, compliance with 5 
U.S.C. 8903(4)(A) preferably demonstrated by full-time providers 
specializing in internal medicine, family practice, pediatrics, and 
obstetrics/gynecology; and
    (iv) Financial condition: Establishment of firm budget projections 
and demonstrated success in meeting or exceeding those projections on a 
regular basis; evidence of the ability to sustain operation in the 
future and to meet obligations under the contract OPM might enter into 
with the plan; clearly specified committed funding to see the plan to an 
expected break-even point including a sufficient amount for unexpected 
contingencies; adequate current and projected funding, such as estimated 
premium income or commitment from a financially sound and acceptable 
parent organization or a mature stable entity outside the plan; 
insolvency protection, such as stop-loss reinsurance services and 
agreements with all plan providers that they will hold members harmless 
if, for any reason, the plan is unable to pay its providers.
    (5) A comprehensive medical plan that has been certified either as a 
qualified Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) or as a qualified 
Competitive Medical Plan by the Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS) at the time of application to OPM, and whose qualification status 
is not under investigation by HHS, will need to submit only an 
abbreviated application to OPM. The extent of the data and documentation 
to be submitted by a plan so qualified by HHS, as well as by a non-
qualified plan, for a particular review cycle may be obtained by writing 
directly to the Office of Insurance Programs, Retirement and Insurance 
Service, Office of Personnel Management, Washington, DC 20415.
    (b) Participating plans. Changes in rates and benefits for approved 
health benefits plans shall be considered at the discretion of the 
Director of OPM. If the Director of OPM determines that it is beneficial 
to enrollees and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program to invite 
health plan benefit and/or rate changes for a given contract period, a 
``call letter'' shall be issued to the carrier approximately 9 months 
prior to the expiration of the current contract period. Any proposal for 
change shall be in writing, specifically describe the change proposed, 
and be signed by an authorized official of the carrier. OPM will review 
any requested proposal for change and will notify the carrier of its 
decision to accept or reject the change. OPM may make a counter proposal 
or at any time propose changes on its own motion. Benefits changes and 
rate proposals, when requested by OPM, shall be submitted not less than 
7 months before the expiration of the then current contract period, 
unless the Director of OPM determines that a later date is acceptable. 
The negotiation period shall begin approximately 7 months before the 
expiration of the current contract period, and OPM shall seek to 
complete all benefit and rate negotiations no later than 4 months 
preceding the contract period to which they will apply. If OPM and the 
carrier do not reach agreement by this date, either party may give 
written notice of

[[Page 454]]

nonrenewal in accordance with Sec. 890.205 of this part.

Sec. 890.204  Withdrawal of approval of health benefits plans or carriers.

    (a) The Director may withdraw approval of a health benefits plan or 
carrier if the standards at Sec. 890.201 of this part and 48 CFR 
subpart 1609.70 are not met. Such action carries with it the right to a 
hearing as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (1) Before withdrawing approval, the Director or his or her 
representative shall notify the carrier of the plan, by certified mail, 
that OPM intends to withdraw approval of the health benefits plan and/or 
carrier. The notice shall set forth the reasons why approval is to be 
withdrawn. The carrier is entitled to reply in writing within 15 
calendar days after its receipt of the notice, stating the reasons why 
approval should not be withdrawn.
    (2) On receipt of the reply, or in the absence of a timely reply, 
the Director or representative shall set a date, time, and place for a 
hearing. The carrier shall be notified by certified mail at least 15 
calendar days in advance of the hearing. The hearing officer shall be 
the Director, or a representative designated by the Director, who shall 
not otherwise have been a party to the initial administrative decision 
to issue a letter of intent to withdraw the plan's or carrier's 
approval. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing unless it is 
waived in writing by the carrier. The carrier is entitled to appear by 
representative and present oral or documentary evidence, including 
rebuttal evidence, in opposition to the proposed action.
    (i) A transcribed record shall be kept of the hearing and shall be 
the exclusive record of the proceeding.
    (ii) After the hearing is held, or after OPM's receipt of the 
carrier's written waiver of the hearing, the Director shall make a 
decision on the record, taking into consideration any recommendation 
submitted by the hearing officer, and send it to the carrier by 
certified mail. A decision of the Director shall be considered a final 
decision for the purposes of this section. The Director, or his or her 
representative, may set a future effective date for withdrawal of 
approval.
    (3) The Director, or his or her representative, may give written 
notice of non-renewal of the contract of a carrier whose plan does not 
meet the minimum enrollee requirement in Sec. 890.201(a)(11). However, 
the Director may defer withdrawing approval of a plan not meeting the 
requirement in Sec. 890.201(a)(11) of this part when, in the judgment 
of OPM, the carrier shows good cause. The Director or representative may 
authorize a plan with fewer than 300 employees or annuitants to remain 
in the FEHB Program when he or she determines, in his or her discretion, 
that it is in the best interest of the Program (e.g., when the plan is 
the only plan available to enrollees in a rural area).
    (b) During a current contract term, the Director, in his or her 
discretion, may reinstate approval of a plan or carrier under this 
section on a finding that the reasons for withdrawing approval no longer 
exist.

<R05>
Sec. 890.205  Nonrenewal of contracts of health benefits plans.

    (a) Either OPM or the carrier may terminate a contract by giving a 
written notice of nonrenewal which includes an indication of the reason 
for the intended action.
    (b) Where termination by notice of intent not to renew is made by 
OPM, the carrier contesting that notice may request that OPM review the 
proposed decision. Such review shall be conducted by the Director or a 
representative designated by the Director, who shall not otherwise have 
been a party to the initial decision to issue a notice of intent not to 
renew. A request for such review, which may include a request that a 
representative of the carrier appear personally before OPM, shall be in 
writing. That request must be received within 10 calendar days of

[[Page 455]]

the carrier's receipt of the notice of intent not to renew. Such request 
shall include a detailed statement as to why the carrier disagrees with 
OPM's notice of nonrenewal and shall be accompanied by appropriate 
supporting documentation. Where a carrier has requested review under 
this section, the final decision by OPM not to renew a health benefits 
contract shall be communicated to the carrier in writing not more than 
30 days after OPM's receipt of the carrier's request for review, unless 
a later date is mutually agreed upon.
    (c) In the absence of a timely request for review as set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section, OPM's notice of intent not to renew will 
become final without further notification.

<R05>
Sec. 890.301  Opportunities for employees who are not participants in premium conversion to enroll or change enrollment; effective dates.

    (a) Initial opportunity to enroll. An employee who becomes eligible 
may elect to enroll or not to enroll within 60 days after becoming 
eligible.
    (b) Effective date--generally. Except as otherwise provided, an 
enrollment or change of enrollment takes effect on the first day of the 
first pay period that begins after the date the employing office 
receives an appropriate request to enroll or change the enrollment and 
that follows a pay period during any part of which the employee is in 
pay status.
    (c) Belated enrollment. When an employing office determines that an 
employee was unable, for cause beyond his or her control, to enroll or 
change the enrollment within the time limits prescribed by this section, 
the employee may enroll or change the enrollment within 60 days after 
the employing office advises the employee of its determination.
    (d) Enrollment by proxy. Subject to the discretion of the employing 
office, an employee's representative, having written authorization to do 
so, may enroll or change the enrollment for the employee.
    (e) Change to self only. (1) Subject to two exceptions, an employee 
may change the enrollment from self and family to self only at any time. 
Exceptions:
    (i) An employee participating in health insurance premium conversion 
may change to self only during an open season or because of and 
consistent with a qualifying life event as defined in Part 892 of this 
chapter.
    (ii) An employee who is subject to a court or administrative order 
as discussed in Sec. 890.301(g)(3) may not make this change as long as 
the court or administrative order is still in effect and the employee 
has at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible 
under the FEHB Program, unless the employee provides documentation to 
the agency that he or she has other coverage for the child(ren).
    (2) A change of enrollment to self only takes effect on the first 
day of the first pay period that begins after the date the employing 
office receives an appropriate request to change the enrollment, except 
that at the request of the employee and upon a showing satisfactory to 
the employing office that there was no family member eligible for 
coverage by the family enrollment, the employing office may make the 
change effective on the first day of the pay period following the one in 
which there was no family member.
    (f) Open season. (1) An open season will be held each year from the 
Monday of the second full workweek in November through the Monday of the 
second full workweek in December.
    (2) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management may modify 
the dates specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section or hold 
additional open seasons.
    (3) With one exception, during an open season, an eligible employee 
may enroll and an enrolled employee may change his or her existing 
enrollment from self only to self and family, may change from one plan 
or option to another, or may make any combination of these changes. 
Exception: An employee who is subject to a court or administrative order 
as discussed in Sec. 890.301(g)(3) may not cancel his or her 
enrollment, change to self only, or change to a comprehensive medical

[[Page 456]]

plan that does not serve the area where his or her child or children 
live as long as the court or administrative order is still in effect and 
the employee has at least one child identified in the order who is still 
eligible under the FEHB Program, unless the employee provides 
documentation to the agency that he or she has other coverage for the 
child(ren).
    (4)(i) An open season new enrollment takes effect on the first day 
of the first pay period that begins in the next following year and which 
follows a pay period during any part of which the employee is in a pay 
status.
    (ii) An open season change of enrollment takes effect on the first 
day of the first pay period which begins in January of the next 
following year.
    (5) When a belated open season enrollment or change of enrollment is 
accepted by the employing office under paragraph (c) of this section, it 
takes effect as required by paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
    (g) Change in family status. (1) An eligible employee may enroll and 
an enrolled employee may change the enrollment from self only to self 
and family, from one plan or option to another, or make any combination 
of these changes when the employee's family status changes, including a 
change in marital status or any other change in family status. The 
employee must enroll or change the enrollment within the period 
beginning 31 days before the date of the change in family status, and 
ending 60 days after the date of the change in family status.
    (2) An enrollment or change of enrollment made in conjunction with 
the birth of a child, or the addition of a child as a new family member 
in some other manner, takes effect on the first day of the pay period in 
which the child is born or becomes an eligible family member.
    (3)(i) If an employing office receives a court or administrative 
order on or after October 30, 2000, requiring an employee to provide 
health benefits for his or her child or children, the employing office 
will determine if the employee has a self and family enrollment in a 
health benefits plan that provides full benefits in the area where the 
child or children live. If the employee does not have the required 
enrollment, the agency must notify him or her that it has received the 
court or administrative order and give the employee until the end of the 
following pay period to change his or her enrollment or provide 
documentation to the employing office that he or she has other coverage 
for the child or children. If the employee does not comply within these 
time frames, the employing office must enroll the employee involuntarily 
as stated in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) If the employee is not enrolled or does not enroll, the agency 
must enroll him or her for self and family coverage in the option that 
provides the lower level of coverage in the Service Benefit Plan. If the 
employee has a self only enrollment, the employing office must change 
the enrollment to self and family in the same option and plan, as long 
as the plan provides full benefits in the area where the child or 
children live. If the employee is enrolled in a comprehensive medical 
plan that does not serve the area in which the child or children live, 
the employing office must change the enrollment to self and family in 
the option that provides the lower level of coverage in the Service 
Benefit Plan.
    (4) Subject to two exceptions, the effective date of an involuntary 
enrollment under paragraph (g)(3) of this section is the 1st day of the 
pay period that begins after the date the employing office completes the 
enrollment request. Exceptions:
    (i) If the court or administrative order requires an earlier 
effective date, the effective date will be the 1st day of the pay period 
that includes that date. Effective dates may not be retroactive to a 
date more than 2 years earlier, or prior to October 30, 2000.
    (ii) If after an involuntary enrollment becomes effective and the 
employing office finds that circumstances beyond the employee's control 
prevented him or her from enrolling or changing the enrollment within 
the time limits in this section, the employee may change the enrollment 
prospectively within 60 days after the employing office advises the 
employee of its finding.

[[Page 457]]

    (h) Change in employment status. An eligible employee may enroll and 
an enrolled employee may change the enrollment from self only to self 
and family, from one plan or option to another, or make any combination 
of these changes when the employee's employment status changes. Except 
as otherwise provided, an employee must enroll or change the enrollment 
within 60 days after the change in employment status. Employment status 
changes include, but are not limited to--
    (1) A return to pay status following loss of coverage under either--
    (i) Section 890.304(a)(1)(v) due to the expiration of 365 days in 
leave without pay (LWOP) status, or
    (ii) Section 890.502(b)(5) due to the termination of coverage during 
LWOP status.
    (2) Reemployment after a break in service of more than 3 days.
    (3) Restoration to a civilian position after serving in the 
uniformed services under conditions that entitle him or her to benefits 
under part 353 of this chapter, or similar authority.
    (4) A change from a temporary appointment in which the employee is 
eligible to enroll under 5 U.S.C. 8906a, which requires payment of the 
full premium with no Government contribution, to an appointment that 
entitles the employee to receive the Government contribution.
    (5) Separation from Federal employment when the employee or the 
employee's spouse is pregnant and the employee supplies medical 
documentation of the pregnancy. An employee who enrolls or changes the 
enrollment under this paragraph (h)(5) must do so during his or her 
final pay period. The effective date of an enrollment or a change of 
enrollment under this paragraph (h)(5) is the first day of the pay 
period which the employing office receives an appropriate request to 
enroll or change the enrollment.
    (6) A transfer from a post of duty within a State of the United 
States or the District of Columbia to a post of duty outside a State of 
the United States or the District of Columbia, or the reverse. An 
employee who enrolls or changes the enrollment under this paragraph 
(h)(6) must do so within the period beginning 31 days before leaving the 
old post of duty and ending 60 days after arriving at the new post of 
duty.
    (7) A change, without a break in service or after a separation of 3 
days or less, to part-time career employment as defined in 5 U.S.C. 
3401(2) and 5 CFR part 340, subpart B, or a change from such part-time 
career employment to full-time employment that entitles the employee to 
the full Government contribution.
    (i) Loss of coverage under this part or under another group 
insurance plan. An eligible employee may enroll and an enrolled employee 
may change the enrollment from self only to self and family, from one 
plan or option to another, or make any combination of these changes when 
the employee or an eligible family member of the employee loses coverage 
under this part or another group health benefits plan. Except as 
otherwise provided, an employee must enroll or change the enrollment 
within the period beginning 31 days before the date of loss of coverage, 
and ending 60 days after the date of loss of coverage. Losses of 
coverage include, but are not limited to--
    (1) Loss of coverage under another FEHB enrollment due to the 
termination, cancellation, or a change to self only, of the covering 
enrollment.
    (2) Loss of coverage under another federally-sponsored health 
benefits program.
    (3) Loss of coverage due to the termination of membership in an 
employee organization sponsoring or underwriting an FEHB plan.
    (4) Loss of coverage due to the discontinuance of an FEHB plan in 
whole or in part. For an employee who loses coverage under this 
paragraph (i)(4):
    (i) If the discontinuance is at the end of a contract year, the 
employee must change the enrollment during the open season, unless OPM 
establishes a different time. If the discontinuance is at a time other 
than the end of the contract year, OPM must establish a time and 
effective date for the employee to change the enrollment.
    (ii) If the whole plan is discontinued, an employee who does not 
change the enrollment within the time set is considered to have canceled 
the plan in which enrolled.

[[Page 458]]

    (iii) If one option of a plan that has two options is discontinued, 
an employee who does not change the enrollment is considered to be 
enrolled in the remaining option of the plan.
    (5) Loss of coverage under the Medicaid program or similar State-
sponsored program of medical assistance for the needy.
    (6) Loss of coverage under a non-Federal health plan because an 
employee moves out of the commuting area to accept another position and 
the employee's non-federally employed spouse terminates employment to 
accompany the employee. An employee may enroll or change the enrollment 
within the period beginning 31 days before the date the employee leaves 
employment in the old commuting area and ending 180 days after entry on 
duty at place of employment in the new commuting area.
    (7) Loss of coverage under a non-Federal health plan.
    (j) Move from comprehensive medical plan's area. An employee in a 
comprehensive medical plan who moves or becomes employed outside the 
geographic area from which the plan accepts enrollments, or if already 
outside this area, moves or becomes employed further from this area, may 
change the enrollment upon notifying the employing office of the move or 
change of place of employment. Similarly, an employee whose covered 
family member moves outside the geographic area from which the plan 
accepts enrollments, or if already outside this area, moves further from 
this area, may change the enrollment upon notifying the employing office 
of the family member's move. The change of enrollment takes effect on 
the first day of the pay period that begins after the employing office 
receives an appropriate request.
    (k) On becoming eligible for Medicare. An employee may change the 
enrollment from one plan or option to another at any time beginning on 
the 30th day before becoming eligible for coverage under title XVIII of 
the Social Security Act (Medicare). A change of enrollment based on 
becoming eligible for Medicare may be made only once.
    (l) Salary of temporary employee insufficient to pay withholdings. 
If the salary of a temporary employee eligible under 5 U.S.C. 8906a is 
not sufficient to pay the withholdings for the plan in which the 
employee is enrolled, the employing office shall notify the employee of 
the plans available at a cost that does not exceed the employee's 
salary. The employee may enroll in another plan whose cost is no greater 
than his or her salary within 60 days after receiving such notification 
from the employing office. The change of enrollment takes effect 
immediately upon termination of the prior enrollment.

<R05>
Sec. 890.302  Coverage of family members.

    (a)(1) An enrollment for self and family includes all family members 
who are eligible to be covered by the enrollment. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (a) (2), (3), and (4) of this section, no employee, former 
employee, annuitant, child, or former spouse may enroll or be covered as 
a family member if he or she is covered under another person's self and 
family enrollment in the FEHB Program.
    (2) Dual enrollment--spouse. (i) To protect the interests of the 
children, an employee or annuitant may enroll in his or her own right in 
a self and family enrollment even though his or her spouse also has a 
self and family enrollment. Generally, such dual enrollments are 
permitted only where two employees or annuitants are married, each with 
children from prior marriages who do not live with them, or are legally 
separated, with each spouse retaining custody of his or her own children 
by a prior marriage. To ensure that no person receives benefits under 
more than one enrollment, each enrollee must tell the insurance carrier 
which family members are covered under his or her enrollment. These 
individuals are not covered under the other enrollment.
    (ii) To protect the interests of legally separated Federal 
employees, annuitants and their children, a legally separated employee 
or annuitant may enroll in his or her own right in a self

[[Page 459]]

only or self and family enrollment even though his or her spouse also 
has a self and family enrollment. To ensure that no person receives 
benefits under more than one enrollment, each enrollee must tell the 
insurance carrier which family members are covered under his or her 
enrollment. These individuals are not covered under the other 
enrollment.
    (3) Dual enrollment--child. (i) When natural parents are divorced or 
legally separated and children are included as family members under the 
enrollment of both natural parents or of a natural parent and a step-
parent, the children are entitled to receive benefits under only one 
enrollment. Each enrollee must notify his or her insurance carrier of 
the name(s) of the child(ren) to be covered under his or her enrollment 
that are not named under the other enrollment.
    (ii) When an employee who is under age 22 and covered under a 
parent's self and family enrollment becomes the parent of a child, the 
employee may elect to enroll for self and family coverage. Because the 
employee is entitled to receive benefits under only one enrollment, each 
enrollee must notify his or her insurance carrier of the names of the 
persons to be covered under his or her enrollment that are not named 
under the other enrollment.
    (4) Dual enrollment--spouse and child. Where a situation such as 
that in paragraph (a)(2) of this section occurs (that is, two employees 
or annuitants are married, but each has children from prior marriages 
who do not live with them) and there are also children who are the issue 
of the marriage, an employee or annuitant may enroll in his or her own 
right in a self and family enrollment even though his or her spouse also 
has a self and family enrollment. Because no person is entitled to 
receive benefits under more than one enrollment, each enrollee must 
notify his or her insurance carrier of the names of the family members 
to be covered under his or her enrollment that are not covered under the 
other enrollment.
    (b) Proof of dependency. (1) A child is considered to be dependent 
on an enrolled employee or annuitant or a former employee or child 
enrolled under Sec. 890.1103 of this part if he or she is:
    (i) A legitimate child;
    (ii) An adopted child;
    (iii) A stepchild, foster child, or recognized natural child who 
lives with the enrollee in a regular parent-child relationship.
    (iv) A recognized natural child for whom a judicial determination of 
support has been obtained; or
    (v) A recognized natural child to whose support the enrollee makes 
regular and substantial contributions.
    (2) The following are examples of proof of regular and substantial 
support. More than one of the following proofs may be required to show 
support of a recognized natural child who does not live with the 
enrollee in a regular parent-child relationship and for whom a judicial 
determination of support has not been obtained.
    (i) Evidence of eligibility as a dependent child for benefits under 
other State or Federal programs;
    (ii) Proof of inclusion of the child as a dependent on the 
enrollee's income tax returns;
    (iii) Canceled checks, money orders, or receipts for periodic 
payments from the enrollee for or on behalf of the child.
    (iv) Evidence of goods or services which show regular and 
substantial contributions of considerable value;
    (v) Any other evidence which OPM shall find to be sufficient proof 
of support or of paternity or maternity.
    (c) Exceptions. Coverage as a family member may be denied:
    (1) If evidence shows that the enrollee did not recognize the child 
as his or her own, despite a willingness to support the child, or
    (2) If evidence calls the child's paternity or maternity into doubt, 
despite the enrollee's recognition and support of the child.
    (d) Child incapable of self-support. When an individual enrolls for 
a family that includes a child who has become 22 years of age and is 
incapable of self-support, the employing office must require such 
enrollee to submit a physician's certificate verifying the child's 
disability. The certificate must--
    (1) State that the child is incapable of self-support because of a 
physical or

[[Page 460]]

mental disability that existed before the child became 22 years of age 
and that can be expected to continue for more than 1 year;
    (2) Include a statement of the name of the child, the nature of the 
disability, the period of time it has existed, and its probable future 
course and duration; and,
    (3) Be signed by the physician and show the physician's office 
address. The employing office must require the enrollee to submit the 
certificate on or before the date the child becomes 22 years of age. 
However, the employing office may accept otherwise satisfactory evidence 
of incapacity that is not timely filed.
    (e) Renewal of certificates of incapacity. The employing office must 
require an enrollee who has submitted a certificate of incapacity to 
renew that certificate on the expiration of the minimum period of 
disability certified.
    (f) Determination of incapacity. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(f)(2) of this section, the employing office shall make determinations 
of incapacity.
    (2) Either the employing office or the carrier may make a 
determination of incapacity if a medical condition, as specified by OPM, 
exists that would cause a child to be incapable of self-support during 
adulthood.
    (g) Meaning of unmarried. A child who has never married or whose 
marriage has been annulled, or a child who is divorced or widowed is 
considered to be unmarried.

<R05>
Sec. 890.303  Continuation of enrollment.

    (a) On transfer or retirement. (1) Except as otherwise provided by 
this part, the enrollment of an employee or annuitant eligible to 
continue enrollment continues without change when he or she moves from 
one employing office to another, without a break in service of more than 
3 days, whether the personnel action is designated as a transfer or not.
    (2) In order for an employee to continue an enrollment as an 
annuitant, he or she must meet the participation requirements set forth 
at 8905(b) of title 5, United States Code, for continuing an enrollment 
as an annuitant as of the commencing date of his or her annuity or 
monthly compensation.
    (3) For the purpose of this part, an employee is considered to have 
enrolled at his or her first opportunity if the employee enrolled during 
the first of the periods set forth in Sec. 890.301 in which he or she 
was eligible to enroll or was covered at that time by the enrollment of 
another employee or annuitant, or whose enrollment was effective not 
later than December 31, 1964.
    (4) Enrollment or eligibility for enrollment under subparts H or K 
of this part of an individual who is not an employee eligible for 
coverage under other provisions of this part is not considered in 
determining whether a retiring employee has met the participation 
requirements of Sec. 8905(b) of title 5, U.S. Code. Coverage under 
subparts H or K of this part of an individual who is an employee 
eligible for coverage under other provisions of this part may be 
considered in determining whether a retiring employee has met the 
participation requirements.
    (b) Change of enrolled employees to certain excluded positions. 
Employees and annuitants enrolled under this part who move, without a 
break in service or after a separation of 3 days or less, to an 
employment in which they are excluded by Sec. 890.102(c), continue to 
be enrolled unless excluded by paragraphs (c) (4), (5), (6), or (7) of 
Sec. 890.102.
    (c) On death. The enrollment of a deceased employee or annuitant who 
is enrolled for self and family (as opposed to self only) is transferred 
automatically to his or her eligible survivor annuitants. The enrollment 
is considered to be that of (1) the survivor annuitant from whose 
annuity all or the greatest portion of the withholding for health 
benefits is made or (2) the surviving spouse entitled to a basic 
employee death benefit. The enrollment covers members of the family of 
the deceased employee or annuitant. In those instances in which the 
annuity is split

[[Page 461]]

among surviving family members, multiple enrollments are allowed. A 
remarried spouse is not a member of the family of the deceased employee 
or annuitant unless annuity under section 8341 or 8442 of title 5, 
United States Code, continues after remarriage.
    (d)(1) Survivor annuitants. If an employee who is entitled to health 
benefits coverage as a survivor annuitant elects to enroll or to 
continue to be enrolled under his eligibility as an employee, and is 
thereafter separated without entitlement to continued enrollment based 
on his own service, he is entitled to reinstatement of his employee-
acquired enrollment on application to his retirement office. 
Reinstatement is effective immediately after termination of his 
employee-acquired enrollment if the application is received by the 
retirement office within 60 days of separation; otherwise reinstatement 
is effective on the first day of the first pay period after receipt of 
the application. The retirement office shall withhold from the annuity 
that the former employee receives as a survivor annuitant, the amounts 
necessary to pay his share of the cost of the enrollment.
    (2) Employee becomes a survivor annuitant. (i) If an employee who is 
entitled to health benefits coverage as a survivor annuitant elects to 
enroll or to continue to be enrolled under his or her eligibility as an 
employee, and is thereafter separated without entitlement to continued 
enrollment based on his or her own service, the employee is entitled to 
reinstatement of the enrollment as a survivor annuitant on application 
to the retirement office. Reinstatement as a survivor annuitant is 
effective on the day after the termination date of the employee-acquired 
enrollment if the application is received by the retirement office 
within 60 days of separation; otherwise, reinstatement is effective on 
the first day of the first pay period after receipt of the application. 
The retirement office shall withhold from the annuity that the former 
employee receives as a survivor annuitant the amounts necessary to pay 
the health benefits premium.
    (ii) If the surviving spouse of a deceased employee or annuitant is 
enrolled as an employee with a self and family enrollment (or, if both 
the decedent and the surviving spouse were enrolled in a self only 
enrollment) at the time the surviving spouse becomes a survivor 
annuitant and the surviving spouse is thereafter separated without 
entitlement to continued enrollment as a retiree, the surviving spouse 
is entitled to enroll as a survivor annuitant. The change from coverage 
as an employee to coverage as a survivor annuitant must be made with 30 
days of separation from service.
    (iii) Except for an employee who meets the definition of former 
spouse under 5 U.S.C. 8901(10) based on an individual's deferred annuity 
under 5 U.S.C. 8341(h) or 8445(f), the employee survivor of an annuitant 
receiving deferred retirement benefits is not eligible for FEHB Program 
enrollment as a survivor annuitant and therefore may not enroll as a 
survivor annuitant based on coverage obtained as an employee.
    (3) Insurance interest survivor annuity. A current spouse who is an 
insurable interest beneficiary under Sec. 831.606(b) or Sec. 
842.605(b) of this title is eligible to continue health benefits 
enrollment as an insurable interest survivor annuitant so long as he or 
she was covered as a family member at the time of the annuitant's death. 
This entitlement applies even if the spouse is eligible for continued 
enrollment as a survivor annuitant under another section of 5 CFR parts 
831 or 843. To prevent dual coverage, the spouse must be covered under 
only one health benefits enrollment under this part.
    (e) In nonpay status. (1) Except as otherwise provided by law, the 
enrollment of an employee continues while he/she is in nonpay status for 
up to 365 days. The 365 days' nonpay status may be continuous or broken 
by periods of less than 4 consecutive months in pay status. If an 
employee has at least 4 consecutive months in pay status after a period 
of nonpay status he/she is entitled to begin the 365 days' continuation 
of enrollment anew. For the purposes of this paragraph, 4 consecutive 
months in pay status means any 4-month period during which the employee 
is in pay status for at least part of each pay period.

[[Page 462]]

    (2) However, in the case of an employee who is employed under an OPM 
approved career-related work-study program under Schedule B of at least 
one year's duration and who is expected to be in a pay status during not 
less than one-third of the total period of time from the date of the 
first appointment to the completion of the work-study program, his/her 
enrollment continues while he/she is in nonpay status so long as he/she 
is participating in the work-study program.

    (f) [Reserved]

    (g) Former spouse entitled to coverage as employee or member of 
family. An individual entitled to health benefits as a former spouse who 
also has or becomes entitled to health benefits coverage as a Federal 
employee or as a family member under another enrollment under this part 
may defer or suspend coverage as a former spouse and continue his or her 
coverage as an employee or family member. The former spouse must have 
established entitlement to the health benefits coverage under Sec. 
890.803 of this part and filed all required documents with the employing 
office responsible for maintaining the former spouse enrollment within 
the time limits specified in Sec. 890.805 of this part. The employing 
office shall note in the former spouse's file that the former spouse 
health benefits enrollment is being deferred or suspended until coverage 
as a Federal employee or as a family member ends. Upon loss of coverage 
as a Federal employee or as a family member, the individual is entitled 
to enroll or resume the enrollment as a former spouse, provided he or 
she remains eligible as such. A former spouse who enrolls because he or 
she lost coverage under another enrollment under this part for a reason 
other than cancellation must meet the requirements of Sec. 
890.301(g)(2). A former spouse who enrolls because he or she lost 
coverage under another enrollment under this part as a result of 
cancellation of the covering enrollment must meet the requirements of 
Sec. 890.301(g)(4).

    (h) Temporary continuation of coverage. Certain former employees who 
lose coverage because of a separation from Federal service, certain 
children who lose coverage because they cease to meet the requirements 
for coverage as children, and certain former spouses who lose coverage 
because their marriage to the enrollee ends and who are not eligible for 
coverage under subpart H of this part may elect temporary continuation 
of coverage under the provisions of subpart K of this part.

    (i) Service in the uniformed services. The enrollment of an 
individual who separates to enter the uniformed services under 
conditions that entitle him or her to benefits under part 353 of this 
chapter, or similar authority, may continue for the 18-month period 
beginning on the date that the absence to serve in the uniformed 
services begins, provided that the individual continues to be entitled 
to benefits under part 353 of this chapter, or similar authority. The 
enrollment of an employee who enters on military furlough or is placed 
in nonpay status to serve in the uniformed services may continue for the 
18-month period beginning on the date that the absence to serve in the 
uniformed service begins, provided that the employee continues to be 
entitled to benefits under part 353 of this chapter, or similar 
authority. An employee in nonpay status is entitled to continued 
coverage under paragraph (e) of this section if the employee's 
entitlement to benefits under part 353 of this chapter, or similar 
authority, ends before the expiration of 365 days in nonpay status. The 
enrollment of an employee who met the requirements of chapter 43 of 
title 38, United States Code, on October 13, 1994, may continue for the 
18-month period beginning on the date that the absence to serve in the 
uniformed services began, provided that the employee continues to be 
entitled to continued coverage under part 353 of this chapter, or 
similar authority. If the enrollment of such an employee had terminated 
due to the expiration of 365 days in nonpay status or because of the 
employee's separation from service, it may be reinstated for the 
remainder of the 18-month period beginning on the date that the absence 
to service in the uniformed service

[[Page 463]]

began, provided that the employee continues to be entitled to continued 
coverage under part 353 of this chapter, or similar authority.

Sec. 890.304  Termination of enrollment.

    (a) Employees. (1) An employee's enrollment terminates, subject to 
the temporary extension of coverage for conversion, at midnight of the 
earliest of the following dates:
    (i) The last day of the pay period in which he/she is separated from 
the service other than by retirement under conditions entitling him/her 
to continue his/her enrollment.
    (ii) The last day of the pay period in which he or she separates 
after meeting the requirements for an immediate annuity under Sec. 
842.204(a)(1) of this chapter, but postpones receipt of annuity as 
provided by Sec. 842.204(c).
    (iii) The last day of the pay period in which his employment status 
changes so that he is excluded from enrollment.
    (iv) The last day of the pay period in which he dies, unless he 
leaves a member of the family entitled to continue enrollment as a 
survivor annuitant.
    (v) The last day of the pay period which includes the day on which 
the continuation of enrollment under Sec. 890.303(e) expires, or, if 
he/she is not entitled to any further continuation because he/she has 
not had 4 consecutive months of pay status since exhausting his/her 365 
days' continuation of coverage in nonpay status, the last day of his/her 
last pay period in pay status.
    (vi) The day he or she is separated, furloughed, or placed on leave 
of absence to serve in the uniformed services under conditions entitling 
him or her to benefits under part 353 of this chapter, or similar 
authority, for the purpose of performing duty not limited to 30 days or 
less, provided the employee elects in writing to have the enrollment so 
terminated.
    (vii) For an employee who separates to serve in the uniformed 
services under conditions entitling him or her to benefits under part 
353 of this chapter, or similar authority, for the purpose of performing 
duty not limited to 30 days or less, the date that is 18 months after 
the date that the absence to serve in the uniformed services began or 
the date entitlement to benefits under part 353 of this chapter, or 
similar authority, ends, whichever is earlier, unless the enrollment is 
terminated under paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this section.
    (viii) For an employee who is furloughed or placed on leave of 
absence under conditions entitling him or her to benefits under part 353 
of this chapter, or similar authority, the date that is 18 months after 
the date that the absence to serve in the uniformed services began or 
the date entitlement to benefits under part 353 of this chapter, or 
similar authority, ends, whichever is earlier, but not earlier than the 
date the enrollment would otherwise terminate under paragraph (a)(1)(v) 
of this section.
    (2) If the pay of a temporary employee eligible under 5 U.S.C. 8906a 
is insufficient to pay the withholdings for the plan in which the 
employee is enrolled, and the employee does not, or cannot, elect a plan 
under Sec. 890.301(l) at a cost to him or her not in excess of the pay, 
the employing office must terminate the employee's enrollment effective 
as of the end of the last period for which withholding was made. Each 
temporary employee whose enrollment is so terminated is entitled to a 
31-day extension of coverage for conversion.
    (b) Annuitants. (1) If the annuity of an annuitant is insufficient 
to pay the withholdings for the plan in which the annuitant is enrolled, 
the annuitant may elect one of the two opportunities offered under Sec. 
890.306(q) of this part (electing a plan with a withholding not in 
excess of the annuity; or, paying premiums directly to the retirement 
system in accordance with Sec. 890.502(f) of this part). The retirement 
system will send two notices to the annuitant, including one by 
certified mail return receipt requested. Continuation of coverage rests 
upon electing direct payment or new coverage within 15 days

[[Page 464]]

(45 days for annuitants residing overseas) after receipt of the final 
notice. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the 
enrollment of an individual who fails to make an election within the 
specified time frame will be terminated. An annuitant whose enrollment 
is terminated because of failure to make an election may not reenroll or 
reinstate coverage, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section. Each annuitant whose enrollment is so terminated is entitled to 
a 31-day extension of coverage for conversion.
    (2) If the individual was prevented by circumstances beyond his or 
her control from making an election within the time limit after receipt 
of the final notice, he or she may request reinstatement of coverage by 
writing to the retirement system. The retirement system will determine 
if the individual is eligible for reinstatement of coverage; and, when 
the determination is affirmative, the individual's coverage may be 
reinstated retroactively to the date of termination or prospectively. If 
the determination is negative, the individual may request 
reconsideration of the decision from OPM.
    (3) If the annuitant does not make an election under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section and is enrolled in the high option of a plan that 
has two options, the annuitant is deemed to have elected enrollment in 
the standard option of the same plan unless the annuity is insufficient 
to pay the withholdings for the standard option.
    (4) An annuitant's enrollment terminates, subject to the temporary 
extension of coverage for conversion, at midnight of the last day of the 
pay period in which he dies, unless he leaves a member of the family 
entitled to continue enrollment as a survivor annuitant, or, if his 
enrollment is not terminated by death, at midnight of the earliest of 
the following dates:
    (i) The last day of the last pay period for which he is entitled to 
annuity, unless he is eligible for continued enrollment as an employee 
in which case his enrollment continues without change.
    (ii) The last day of the pay period in which his title to 
compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5, United States 
Code, terminates, or in which he is held by the Secretary of Labor to be 
able to return to duty, unless he is eligible for continued enrollment 
as an employee or as an annuitant under a retirement system for civilian 
employees in which case his enrollment continues without change.
    (iii) The day he enters on active duty in a uniformed service for 
the purpose of performing duty not limited to 30 days or less, provided 
the annuitant elects, in writing, to terminate the enrollment.
    (iv) The last day of the month preceding the month in which a 
survivor annuitant in receipt of basic employee death benefits under 5 
U.S.C. 8442(b)(1)(A) remarries before attaining age 55.
    (c) Coverage of family members. The coverage of a family member of 
an enrollee terminates, subject to the temporary extension of coverage 
for conversion, at midnight of the earlier of the following dates:
    (1) The day on which he or she ceases to be a family member;
    (2) The day the enrollee ceases to be enrolled, unless the family 
member is entitled, as a survivor annuitant, to continued enrollment, or 
is entitled to continued coverage under the enrollment of another.
    (d) Cancellation or suspension. (1)(i) An employee who participates 
in health insurance premium conversion as provided in part 892 of this 
chapter may cancel his or her enrollment only during an open season or 
because of and consistent with a qualifying life event defined in Sec. 
892.101 of this chapter.
    (ii) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (d)(iii) of this 
section, an enrollee who does not participate in premium conversion may 
cancel his or her enrollment at any time by filing an appropriate 
request with the employing office. The cancellation is effective at the 
end of the last day of the pay period in which the employing office 
receives the appropriate request canceling the enrollment.
    (iii) An employee who is subject to a court or administrative order 
as discussed in Sec. 890.301(g)(3), or an annuitant who was subject to 
such a court or administrative order at the time of his or her 
retirement, may not cancel or suspend his or her enrollment as long as 
the court or administrative order is

[[Page 465]]

still in effect and the enrollee has at least one child identified in 
the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, unless the 
employee or annuitant provides documentation to the agency that he or 
she has other coverage for the child or children.
    (2) An annuitant or survivor annuitant may suspend enrollment in 
FEHB for the purpose of enrolling in a Medicare-sponsored plan under 
sections 1833, 1876, or 1851 of the Social Security Act, or to enroll in 
the Medicaid program or a similar State-sponsored program of medical 
assistance for the needy, or to use Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or TRICARE 
(including coverage provided by the Uniformed Services Family Health 
Plan) or TRICARE-for-Life instead of FEHB coverage. To suspend FEHB 
coverage, documentation of eligibility for coverage under the non-FEHB 
program must be submitted to the retirement system. If the documentation 
is received within the period beginning 31 days before and ending 31 
days after the effective date of the enrollment in the Medicare-
sponsored plan, or the Medicaid or similar program, or within 31 days 
before or after the day designated by the annuitant or survivor 
annuitant as the day he or she wants to suspend FEHB coverage to use 
Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or TRICARE (including the Uniformed Services 
Family Health Plan) or TRICARE-for-Life instead of FEHB coverage, then 
suspension will be effective at the end of the day before the effective 
date of the enrollment or the end of the day before the day designated. 
Otherwise, the suspension is effective the first day of the first pay 
period that begins after the date the retirement system receives the 
documentation.
    (3) The enrollee and covered family members are not entitled to the 
temporary extension of coverage for conversion or to convert to an 
individual contract for health benefits.
    (e) Temporary continuation of coverage. Employees and family members 
are entitled to temporary continuation of coverage only as provided 
under subpart K of this part.

Sec. 890.305  Reinstatement of enrollment after military service.

    (a) The enrollment of an employee or annuitant whose enrollment was 
terminated under Sec. 890.304(a)(1)(vi), (vii), or (viii) or Sec. 
890.304(b)(4)(iii) is automatically reinstated on the day the employee 
is restored to a civilian position under the provisions of part 353 of 
this chapter, or similar authority, or on the day the annuitant is 
separated from the uniformed services, as the case may be.
    (b) An employee whose employing office terminates his or her 
enrollment because his or her order to enter on duty in a uniformed 
service is for a period longer than 30 days, and who retires on an 
immediate annuity from his or her Federal civilian position while on 
such duty, may reinstate his or her enrollment by asking to do so within 
60 days after retirement. In the absence of such a request, the 
retirement system automatically reinstates the enrollment on the day the 
person separates from the uniformed service. For the retirement system 
to reinstate the enrollment, the individual must have been covered under 
this part since his or her first opportunity or for the 5 years of 
civilian service (excluding the period of uniformed service) immediately 
preceding the civilian retirement, whichever is shorter.

Sec. 890.306  When can annuitants or survivor annuitants change enrollment or reenroll and what are the effective dates?

    (a) Requirements to continue coverage. (1) To be eligible to 
continue coverage in a plan under this part, a former employee in 
receipt of an annuity must meet the statutory requirements under 5 
U.S.C. 8905(b) of having retired on an immediate annuity and having been 
covered by a plan under this part for the 5 years of service immediately 
before retirement, or if less than 5 years, for all service since his or 
her first opportunity to enroll, unless OPM waives the requirement under 
Sec. 890.108.
    (2) To be eligible to continue coverage in a plan under this part, a 
survivor annuitant must be covered as a family member when the employee 
or annuitant dies.
    (b) Effective date--generally. Except as otherwise provided, an 
annuitant's change of enrollment takes effect on the first day of the 
first pay period that begins after the date the employing office 
receives an appropriate request to change the enrollment.
    (c) Belated enrollment. When an employing office determines that an 
annuitant was unable, for cause beyond his or her control, to continue 
coverage by enrolling in his or her own name or change the enrollment 
within the time limits prescribed by this section, the annuitant may do 
so within 60 days after the employing office advises the annuitant of 
its determination.
    (d) Enrollment by proxy. Subject to the discretion of the employing 
office, an annuitant's representative, having written authorization to 
do so, may continue the annuitant's coverage by enrolling in the 
annuitant's own name, or change the enrollment for the annuitant.
    (e) Enrollment change to self only. (1) With one exception, an 
annuitant may change the enrollment from self and family to self only at 
any time. Exception: An annuitant who, as an employee, was subject to a 
court or administrative order as discussed in Sec. 890.301(g)(3) at the 
time he or she retired may not change to self only after retirement as 
long as the court or administrative order is still in effect and the 
annuitant has at least one child identified in the order who is still 
eligible under the FEHB Program, unless the annuitant provides 
documentation to the retirement system that he or she has other coverage 
for the child or children.
    (2) A change of enrollment to self only takes effect on the first 
day of the first pay period that begins after the date the employing 
office receives an appropriate request to change the enrollment, except 
that at the request of the annuitant and upon a showing satisfactory to 
the employing office that there was no family member eligible for 
coverage under the family enrollment, the employing office may make the 
change effective on the first day of the pay period following the one in 
which there was no family member.
    (f) Open season. (1) During an open season as provided by Sec. 
890.301(f)--
    (i) With one exception, an enrolled annuitant may change the 
enrollment from self only to self and family, may change from one plan 
or option to another, or may make any combination of these changes. 
Exception: An annuitant who, as an employee, was subject to a court or 
administrative order as discussed in Sec. 890.301(g)(3) at the time he 
or she retired may not cancel or suspend his or her enrollment, change 
to self only, or change to a comprehensive medical plan that does not 
serve the area where his or her children live after retirement as long 
as the court or administrative order is still in effect and the 
annuitant has at least one child identified in the order who is still 
eligible under the FEHB Program, unless the annuitant provides 
documentation to the retirement system that he or she has other coverage 
for the child or children.
    (ii) An annuitant or survivor annuitant who suspended enrollment 
under this part to enroll in a Medicare-sponsored plan under sections 
1833, 1876, or 1851 of the Social Security Act, or to enroll in a 
Medicaid or similar State-sponsored program of medical assistance for 
the needy, or to use Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or TRICARE (including the 
Uniformed Services Family Health Plan) or TRICARE-for-Life coverage 
instead of FEHB coverage, may reenroll.

[[Page 467]]

    (2) An open season reenrollment or change of enrollment takes effect 
on the first day of the first pay period that begins in January of the 
next following year.
    (3) When a belated open season reenrollment or change of enrollment 
is accepted by the employing office under paragraph (c) of this section, 
it takes effect as required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (g) Change in family status. (1) An enrolled former employee in 
receipt of an annuity may change the enrollment from self only to self 
and family, from one plan or option to another, or make any combination 
of these changes when the annuitant's family status changes, including a 
change in martial status or any other change in family status. In the 
case of an enrolled survivor annuitant, a change in family status based 
on additional family members occurs only if the additional family 
members are family members of the deceased employee or annuitant. The 
annuitant must change the enrollment within the period beginning 31 days 
before the date of the change in family status, and ending 60 days after 
the date of the change in family status.
    (2) A change of enrollment made in conjunction with the birth of a 
child, or the addition of a child as a new family member in some other 
manner, takes effect on the first day of the pay period in which the 
child is born or becomes an eligible family member.
    (h) Reenrollment of annuitants or survivor annuitants who suspended 
enrollment to enroll in a Medicare-sponsored plan, or a Medicaid or 
similar State-sponsored program; or to use Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or 
TRICARE (including the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan) or 
TRICARE-for-Life coverage instead of FEHB coverage.
    (1) An annuitant or survivor annuitant who had been enrolled (or was 
eligible to enroll) for coverage under this part and suspended the 
enrollment for the purpose of enrolling in a Medicare sponsored plan 
under sections 1833, 1876, or 1851 of the Social Security Act, or to 
enroll in the Medicaid program or a similar State-sponsored program of 
medical assistance for the needy, or to use Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or 
TRICARE (including the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan) or 
TRICARE-for-Life coverage instead of the FEHB Program (as provided by 
Sec. 890.304(d)), and who subsequently involuntarily loses coverage 
under one of these programs, may immediately reenroll in any available 
FEHB plan under this part at any time beginning 31 days before and 
ending 60 days after the loss of coverage. A reenrollment under this 
paragraph (h) of this section takes effect on the date following the 
effective date of the loss of coverage as shown on the documentation 
from the non-FEHB coverage. If the request to reenroll is not received 
by the retirement system within the time period specified, the annuitant 
must wait until the next available Open Season to reenroll.
    (2) An annuitant or survivor annuitant who suspended enrollment in 
the FEHB Program to enroll in a Medicare sponsored plan or the Medicaid 
or similar State-sponsored program of medical assistance for the needy, 
or to use Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or TRICARE (including the Uniformed 
Services Family Health Plan) or TRICARE-for-Life, but now wants to 
reenroll in the FEHB Program for any reason other than an involuntary 
loss of coverage, may do so during the next available Open Season (as 
provided by paragraph (f) of this section).
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Annuitants who apply for postponed minimum retirement age plus 
10 years of service (MRA plus 10) annuity. (1) A former employee who 
meets the requirements for an immediate annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8412(g) 
and for continuation of coverage under 5 U.S.C. 8905(b) at the time of 
separation, and whose enrollment is terminated under Sec. 
890.304(a)(1)(ii) may enroll in a health benefits plan under this part 
within 60 days after OPM mails the former employee a notice of 
eligibility. If such former employee dies before the end of this 60-day 
election period, a survivor who is entitled to a survivor annuity may 
enroll in a health benefits plan under this part within 60 days after 
OPM mails the survivor a notice of eligibility.
    (2) The former employee's enrollment takes effect on the first day 
of the month following the month in which

[[Page 468]]

OPM receives the appropriate request or on the commencing date of 
annuity, whichever is later. A survivor's enrollment takes effect on the 
first day of the month following the month in which OPM receives the 
appropriate request.
    (k) Restoration of annuity or compensation payments. (1) A 
disability annuitant who was enrolled in a health benefits plan under 
this part immediately before his or her disability annuity was 
terminated because of restoration to earning capacity or recovery from 
disability, and whose disability annuity is restored under 5 U.S.C. 
8337(e) after December 31, 1983, or 8455(b), may enroll in a health 
benefits plan under this part within 60 days after OPM mails a notice of 
insurance eligibility. The enrollment takes effect on the first day of 
the month after the date OPM receives the appropriate request.
    (2) An annuitant who was enrolled in a health benefits plan under 
this part immediately before his or her compensation was terminated 
because OWCP determined that he or she had recovered from the job-
related injury or disease, and whose compensation is restored due to a 
recurrence of disability, may enroll in a health benefits plan under 
this part within 60 days after OWCP mails a notice of insurance 
eligibility. The enrollment takes effect on the first day of the pay 
period after the date OWCP receives the appropriate request.
    (3) A surviving spouse who was covered by a health benefits 
enrollment under this part immediately before his or her survivor 
annuity was terminated because of remarriage, and whose survivor annuity 
is later restored, may enroll in a health benefits plan under this part 
within 60 days after OPM mails a notice of eligibility. The enrollment 
takes effect on either--
    (i) The first day of the month after the date OPM receives the 
appropriate request; or
    (ii) The date of restoration of the survivor annuity or October 1, 
1976, whichever is later.
    (4) A surviving child who was covered by a health benefits 
enrollment under this part immediately before his or her survivor 
annuity was terminated because he or she ceased being a student, and 
whose survivor annuity is later restored, may enroll in a health 
benefits plan under this part within 60 days after OPM mails a notice of 
eligibility. The enrollment takes effect on the first day of the month 
after the date OPM receives the appropriate request or the date of 
restoration of the survivor annuity, whichever is later.
    (5) A surviving child who was covered by a health benefits 
enrollment under this part immediately before his or her survivor 
annuity was terminated because he or she married, and whose survivor 
annuity is later restored because the marriage ended, may enroll in a 
health benefits plan under this part within 60 days after OPM mails a 
notice of eligibility. The enrollment takes effect on the first day of 
the month after the date OPM receives the appropriate request or the 
date of restoration of the survivor annuity, whichever is later.
    (6) A surviving spouse who received a basic employee death benefit 
under 5 U.S.C. 8442(b)(1)(A) and who was covered by a health benefits 
enrollment under this part immediately before remarriage prior to age 
55, may enroll in a health benefits plan under this part upon 
termination of the remarriage. The survivor must provide OPM with a 
certified copy of the notice of death or the court order terminating the 
marriage. The surviving spouse must enroll within 60 days after OPM 
mails a notice of eligibility. The enrollment takes effect on the first 
day of the month after the date OPM receives the appropriate request and 
the notice of death or court order terminating the remarriage.
    (l) Loss of coverage under this part or under another group 
insurance plan. An annuitant who meets the requirements of paragraph (a) 
of this section, and who is not enrolled but is covered by another 
enrollment under this part may continue coverage by enrolling in his or 
her own name when the annuitant loses coverage under the other 
enrollment under this part. An enrolled annuitant may change the 
enrollment from self only to self and family, from one plan or option to 
another, or make any combination of these changes when the annuitant or 
an eligible family

[[Page 469]]

member of the annuitant loses coverage under this part or under another 
group health benefits plan. Except as otherwise provided, an annuitant 
must enroll or change the enrollment within the period beginning 31 days 
before the date of loss of coverage and ending 60 days after the date of 
loss of coverage. Losses of coverage include, but are not limited to--
    (1) Loss of coverage under another FEHB enrollment due to the 
termination, cancellation, or a change to self only, of the covering 
enrollment;
    (2) Loss of coverage under another federally-sponsored health 
benefits program;
    (3) Loss of coverage due to the termination of membership in an 
employee organization sponsoring or underwriting an FEHB plan;
    (4) Loss of coverage due to the discontinuance of an FEHB plan in 
whole or in part. For an annuitant who loses coverage under this 
paragraph (l)(4)--
    (i) If the discontinuance is at the end of a contract year, the 
annuitant must change the enrollment during the open season, unless OPM 
establishes a different time. If the discontinuance is at a time other 
than the end of the contract year, OPM must establish a time and 
effective date for the annuitant to change the enrollment;
    (ii) If a plan discontinues all of its existing options, an 
annuitant who does not change his or her enrollment is deemed to have 
enrolled in the option of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit 
Plan that OPM determines most closely approximates the terminated plan, 
except when the annuity is insufficient to pay the withholdings, then 
paragraph (q) of this section applies.
    (iii) If a plan has two options, and one option of the plan is 
discontinued, an annuitant who does not change the enrollment is 
considered to be enrolled in the remaining option of the plan, except 
when the annuity is insufficient to pay the withholdings, then paragraph 
(q) of this section applies.
    (iv) After an involuntary enrollment under paragraph (l)(4)(ii) or 
(iii) of this section becomes effective, the annuitant may change the 
enrollment to the other option of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service 
Benefit Plan or to another health plan of his or her choice 
retroactively within 90-days after OPM advises the annuitant of the new 
enrollment;
    (5) Loss of coverage under the Medicaid program or similar State-
sponsored program of medical assistance for the needy.
    (6) Loss of coverage under a non-Federal health plan.
    (m) Move from comprehensive medical plan's area. An annuitant in a 
comprehensive medical plan who moves or becomes employed outside the 
geographic area from which the plan accepts enrollments, or, if already 
outside this area, moves or becomes employed further from this area, may 
change the enrollment upon notifying the employing office of the move or 
change of place of employment. Similarly, an annuitant whose covered 
family member moves outside the geographic area from which the plan 
accepts enrollments, or if already outside this area, moves further from 
this area, may change the enrollment upon notifying the employing office 
of the family member's move. The change of enrollment takes effect on 
the first day of the pay period that begins after the employing office 
receives an appropriate request.
    (n) Overseas post of duty. An annuitant may change the enrollment 
from self only to self and family, from one plan or option to another, 
or make any combination of these changes within 60 days after the 
retirement or death of the employee on whose service title to annuity is 
based, if the employee was stationed at a post of duty outside a State 
of the United States or the District of Columbia at the time of 
retirement or death.
    (o) On return from a uniformed service. An enrolled annuitant who 
enters on duty in a uniformed service for 31 days or more may change the 
enrollment within 60 days after separation from the uniformed service.
    (p) On becoming eligible for Medicare. An annuitant may change the 
enrollment from one plan or option to another at any time beginning on 
the 30th day before becoming eligible for coverage under title XVIII of 
the Social Security Act (Medicare). A change

[[Page 470]]

of enrollment based on becoming eligible for Medicare may be made only 
once.
    (q) Annuity insufficient to pay withholdings. (1) If an annuity is 
insufficient to pay the withholdings for the plan that the annuitant is 
enrolled in, the retirement system must provide the annuitant with 
information regarding the available plans and written notification of 
the opportunity to either--
    (i) Pay the premium directly to the retirement system in accordance 
with Sec. 890.502(d); or
    (ii) Enroll in any plan in which the annuitant's share of the 
premium is less than the amount of annuity. If the annuitant elects to 
change to a lower cost enrollment, the change takes effect immediately 
upon loss of coverage under the prior enrollment. The exemptions from 
debt collection procedures that are provided under Sec. 831.1305(d)(2) 
and Sec. 845.205(d)(2) of this chapter apply to elections under this 
paragraph (q)(1)(ii).
    (2) If the annuitant is enrolled in the high option of a plan that 
has two options, and does not change the enrollment to a plan in which 
the annuitant's share of the premium is less than the amount of annuity 
or does not elect to pay premiums directly, the annuitant is deemed to 
have enrolled in the standard option of the same plan, unless the 
annuity is insufficient to pay the withholdings for the standard option.
    (3) An annuitant whose enrollment was terminated because the amount 
of annuity was insufficient to cover the enrollee's share of the premium 
may apply to be reinstated in any available plan or option.
    (4) An annuitant who can show evidence that he or she previously 
changed to a lower cost option, plan, or to a self-only enrollment prior 
to May 29, 1990, because the annuity was insufficient to cover the 
withholdings for the plan in which he or she was enrolled, may apply to 
change the enrollment to any available plan or option in which the 
enrollee's share of the total premium exceeds his or her monthly 
annuity.
    (5) The effective date of the reinstatement of enrollment of an 
annuitant whose enrollment was terminated, or the change of enrollment 
of an annuitant who previously changed enrollment because his or her 
annuity was insufficient to cover the annuitant's share of the total 
premium, and who elects to pay premiums directly to the retirement 
system in accordance with Sec. 890.502(f) is either--
    (i) The first day of the first pay period that begins after the 
appropriate request is received by the retirement system; or,
    (ii) The later of the date the enrollment was terminated or changed, 
or May 29, 1990.
    (6) Retroactive reinstatement or change of enrollment is contingent 
upon payment of appropriate contributions retroactive to the effective 
date of the reinstatement or the change of enrollment. For the purpose 
of this paragraph (q)(6), a previous cancellation of enrollment because 
of insufficient annuity to cover the full amount of the withholdings is 
deemed to be a termination of enrollment.
    (r) Sole survivor. When an employee or annuitant enrolled for self 
and family dies, leaving a survivor annuitant who is entitled to 
continue the enrollment, and it is apparent from available records that 
the survivor annuitant is the sole survivor entitled to continue the 
enrollment, the office of the retirement system which is acting as 
employing office must change the enrollment from self and family to self 
only, effective on the commencing date of the survivor annuity. On 
request of the survivor annuitant made within 31 days after the first 
installment of annuity is paid, the office of the retirement system 
which is acting as employing office must rescind the action retroactive 
to the effective date of the change to self only, with corresponding 
adjustment in withholdings and contributions.
    (s) Election between survivor annuities. A surviving spouse, 
irrespective of whether his or her survivor annuity continued or was 
terminated upon remarriage, who was covered by an enrollment under this 
part immediately before the remarriage, may elect to continue an 
enrollment under this part acquired as a dependent by virtue of the 
remarriage or to enroll in his or

[[Page 471]]

her own right (by virtue of entitlement to the original survivor 
annuity) in any plan or option under this part within 60 days after the 
termination of the remarriage and entitlement to a survivor annuity.

<R05>
Sec. 890.307  Waiver or suspension of annuity or compensation.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (f) of this section, 
when annuity or compensation is entirely waived or suspended, the 
annuitant's enrollment continues for not more than 3 months (not more 
than 12 weeks for annuitants whose compensation under subchapter I of 
chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code, is paid each 4 weeks). If the 
waiver or suspension continues beyond this period, the employing office 
will notify the annuitant in writing that the employing office will 
terminate the enrollment effective at the end of the period, subject to 
the temporary extension of coverage for conversion, unless the annuitant 
elects to make payment of the premium directly to the employing office 
during the period of waiver. If the annuitant elects to have the 
enrollment terminated, the employing office automatically reinstates the 
enrollment on a prospective basis when the annuitant again receives 
payment of annuity or compensation. The employing office will make the 
withholding for the period of waiver or suspension during which 
enrollment was continued (i.e., 3 months or less).
    (b) If the annuitant elects to pay premiums directly, he or she must 
send to the employing office his or her share of the subscription charge 
for the enrollment for every pay period during which the enrollment 
continues, exclusive of the 31-day temporary extension of coverage for 
conversion provided in Sec. 890.401. The annuitant must pay after each 
pay period he or she is covered in accordance with a schedule 
established by the employing office. If the employing office does not 
receive payment by the date due, the employing office must notify the 
annuitant in writing that continuation of coverage depends upon payment 
being made within 15 days (45 days for annuitants residing overseas) 
after receipt of the notice. If no further payments are made, the 
employing office terminates the enrollment 60 days after the date of the 
notice (90 days for annuitants residing overseas). The employing office 
automatically reinstates enrollment on a prospective basis when payment 
of annuity or compensation resumes.
    (c) If the annuitant is prevented by circumstances beyond his or her 
control from paying within 15 days after receipt of the notice, he or 
she may request reinstatement of coverage by writing to the employing 
office. The annuitant must file the request within 30 calendar days from 
the date of termination, and must include supporting documentation. The 
employing office will determine if the annuitant is eligible for 
reinstatement of coverage; and, when the determination is affirmative, 
reinstate the coverage of the annuitant retroactive to the date of 
termination. If the determination is negative, the annuitant may request 
a review of the decision as provided in Sec. 890.104.
    (d) Termination of enrollment for failure to pay premiums within the 
time frame established in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section 
is retroactive to the end of the last pay period for which the employing 
office timely received payment.
    (e) The employing office will submit all direct premium payments 
along with its regular health benefits premiums to OPM in accordance 
with procedures established by OPM.
    (f) If suspension of annuity or compensation is because of 
reemployment, the reemploying office must make the withholding currently 
and enrollment continues during reemployment.

Sec. 890.308  Disenrollment.

    (a)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a carrier that 
cannot reconcile its record of an individual's enrollment with agency 
enrollment records or does not receive documentation necessary to 
resolve the discrepancy from the employing office within 31 days of a 
request must provide written notice to the individual that the

[[Page 472]]

employing office of record does not show him or her as enrolled in the 
carrier's plan and that he or she will be disenrolled 31 calendar days 
after the date of the notice unless the enrollee provides appropriate 
documentation to resolve the discrepancy. Appropriate documentation 
includes, but is not limited to, a copy of the Standard Form 2809 (basic 
enrollment document) (or a letter confirming an electronic transaction), 
the Standard Form 2810 transferring the enrollment into the gaining 
employing office (or the equivalent electronic submission), copies of 
earnings and leave statements or annuity statements showing withholdings 
for the health benefits plan, or a document or other credible 
information from the enrollee's employing office stating that the 
individual is entitled to continued enrollment in the plan and that the 
premiums are being paid. After receiving documentation from the 
enrollee, the carrier must notify both the enrollee and the employing 
office of record of their decision on the information.
    (2) If the carrier does not receive documentation required under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section within the specified time frame, the 
carrier should disenroll the individual, without further notice.
    (3) The enrollee may request his or her employing office to 
reconsider the carrier's decision to disenroll the individual. The 
request for reconsideration must be made in writing and must include the 
enrollee's name, address, Social Security Number or other personal 
identification number, name of carrier, reason(s) for the request, and, 
if applicable, retirement claim number. The employing office must notify 
the carrier when a request for reconsideration of the decision to 
disenroll the individual is made.
    (4) A request for reconsideration of the carrier's decision must be 
filed within 60 calendar days after the date of the carrier's 
disenrollment notice. The time limit on filing may be extended when the 
individual shows that he or she was not notified of the time limit and 
was not otherwise aware of it, or that he or she was prevented by 
circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within 
the time limit.
    (5) After reconsideration, the employing office must issue a written 
notice of its final decision to the individual and notify the carrier of 
the decision. The notice must fully set forth the findings and 
conclusions on which the decision was based. If upon reconsideration the 
employing office determines the individual is entitled to continued 
enrollment in the plan, the disenrollment under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section is void and coverage is reinstated retroactively.
    (6) If, at any time after the disenrollment has occurred, the 
employing office or OPM determines that another section of this part 
applies to the individual's enrollment or the carrier discovers or 
receives appropriate documentation showing that another section of this 
part applies to the individual's enrollment, the disenrollment under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section is void and coverage is reinstated 
retroactively.
    (b) When a carrier receives, from any reliable source, information 
of the death of an enrollee with a self only enrollment, the carrier may 
take action to disenroll the individual on the date set forth in Sec. 
890.304(a)(1)(iv) or Sec. 890.304(b)(4), as appropriate. When the date 
of death is unknown, the carrier may take action to disenroll the 
individual on the date which is the last day of the pay period in which 
information of the death is received. Reliable sources include, but are 
not limited to, claims for hospital or physician costs incurred at time 
of death and correspondence returned from the Postal Service noting that 
the addressee is deceased. If, at any time after the disenrollment has 
occurred, the employing office or OPM determines that another section of 
this part applies to the individual's enrollment or the carrier 
discovers or receives appropriate documentation showing that another 
section of this part applies to the individual's enrollment, the 
disenrollment under this paragraph (b) is void and coverage is 
reinstated retroactively.
    (c)(1) When a child survivor annuitant covered under a self only 
enrollment reaches age 22, the carrier may take action to disenroll the 
individual

[[Page 473]]

effective with the date set forth in Sec. 890.304(c)(1) unless records 
with the carrier indicate that the child is incapable of self support 
due to a physical or mental disability. The carrier must provide the 
enrollee with a written notice of disenrollment prescribed or approved 
by OPM prior to the date set forth in Sec. 890.304(c)(1).
    (2) The child survivor annuitant may request the retirement system 
to reconsider the carrier's decision to disenroll the individual. The 
request for reconsideration must be made in writing and include the 
enrollee's name, address, Social Security Number or other identifier, 
name of carrier, reason(s) for the request, and the survivor annuity 
claim number. The retirement system must notify the carrier when a 
request for reconsideration of the carrier's decision to disenroll the 
individual is made.
    (3) A request for reconsideration of the carrier's decision must be 
filed with the retirement system within 60 calendar days from the date 
of the carrier's disenrollment notice. The time limit on filing may be 
extended when the individual shows that he or she was not notified of 
the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he or she was 
prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the 
request within the time limit.
    (4) After reconsideration, the retirement system must issue a 
written notice of its final decision to the child survivor annuitant and 
notify the carrier of the decision. The notice must fully set forth the 
findings and conclusions on which the decision was based. If upon 
reconsideration the retirement system determines that he or she is 
entitled to continued enrollment in the plan, the disenrollment under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section is void and coverage is reinstated 
retroactively.
    (5) If, at any time after the disenrollment has occurred, the 
employing office or OPM determines that another provision of this part 
applies to the individual's enrollment or the carrier discovers or 
receives appropriate documentation showing that another section of this 
part applies to the individual's enrollment, the disenrollment under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section is void and coverage is reinstated 
retroactively.
    (d) When an enrollee notifies the carrier that he or she has 
separated from Federal employment and is no longer eligible for 
enrollment, the carrier must disenroll the individual on the last day of 
the pay period in which the separation occurred, if known, otherwise the 
carrier must disenroll the employee on the date the employee provides as 
the date of separation. The carrier must provide the enrollee with a 
written notice of disenrollment prescribed or approved by OPM.

<R04>
        Subpart D_Temporary Extension of Coverage and Conversion


<R05>
Sec. 890.401  Temporary extension of coverage and conversion.

    (a) Thirty-one day extension and conversion. (1) An enrollee whose 
enrollment is terminated other than by cancellation of the enrollment or 
discontinuance of the plan, in whole or part, and a covered family 
member whose coverage is terminated other than by cancellation of the 
enrollment or discontinuance of the plan, in whole or in part, is 
entitled to a 31-day extension of coverage for self alone or self and 
family, as the case may be, without contributions by the enrollee or the 
Government, during which period he or she is entitled to exercise the 
right of conversion provided for by this part. The 31-day extension of 
coverage and the right of conversion for any person ends on the 
effective date of a new enrollment under this part covering the person.
    (2) Termination of an enrollment under this subpart for failure to 
pay premiums is considered a cancellation of the enrollment for the 
purposes of this section.
    (b) Continuation of benefits. (1) Any person who has been granted a 
31-day extension of coverage in accordance with paragraph (a) of this 
section and who is confined in a hospital or other institution for care 
or treatment on the 31st day of the temporary extension is entitled to 
continuation of the

[[Page 474]]

benefits of the plan during the continuance of the confinement but not 
beyond the 60th day after the end of the temporary extension.
    (2) Except when a plan is discontinued in whole or in part or the 
Associate Director for Retirement and Insurance orders an enrollment 
change, a person whose enrollment has been changed from one plan to 
another, or from one option of a plan to the other option of that plan, 
and who is confined to a hospital or other institution for care or 
treatment on the last day of enrollment under the prior plan or option, 
is entitled to continuation of the benefits of the prior plan or option 
during the continuance of the confinement. Continuation of benefits 
shall not extend beyond the 91st day after the last day of enrollment in 
the prior plan or option. The plan or option to which enrollment has 
been changed shall not pay benefits with respect to that person while he 
or she is entitled to any inpatient benefits under the prior plan or 
option. The gaining plan or option shall begin coverage according to the 
limits of its FEHB Program contract on the day after the day all 
inpatient benefits have been exhausted under the prior plan or option or 
the 92nd day after the last day of enrollment in the prior plan or 
option, whichever is earlier. For the purposes of this paragraph, 
``exhausted'' means paid or provided to the maximum benefit available 
under the contract.
    (3) Exception. The limit on the number of confinement days allowed 
to be covered under the continuation of benefits specified by paragraph 
(b)(2) of this subpart does not apply to confinements in a hospital or 
other institution when the charges and benefit payments for the services 
provided are covered by the limit specified in subpart I of this part. 
In these cases, the benefits continue until the end of the confinement.
    (c)(1) The employing agency must notify the enrollee of the 
termination of the enrollment and of the right to convert to an 
individual policy within 60 days after the date the enrollment 
terminates.
    (2) The individual whose enrollment terminates must request 
conversion information from the losing carrier within 31 days of the 
date of the agency notice of the termination of the enrollment and of 
the right to convert.
    (3) When an agency fails to provide the notification required in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section within 60 days of the date the 
enrollment terminates, or the individual fails for other reasons beyond 
his or her control to request conversion as required in paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section, he or she may request conversion to an individual 
policy by writing directly to the carrier. Such a request must be filed 
within 6 months after the individual became eligible to convert his or 
her group coverage and must be accompanied by verification of 
termination of the enrollment; e.g., an SF 50, showing the individual's 
separation from the service. In addition, the individual must show that 
he or she was not notified of the termination of the enrollment and of 
the right to convert, and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he or 
she was unable, for cause beyond his or her control, to convert. The 
carrier will determine if the individual is eligible to convert; and 
when the determination is affirmative, the individual may convert within 
31 days of the determination. If the determination by the carrier is 
negative, the individual may request a review of the carrier's 
determination from OPM.
    (4) When an individual converts his or her coverage anytime after 
the group coverage has ended, the individual plan coverage is 
retroactive to the day following the day the temporary extension of 
group coverage ended. The individual must pay the premiums due for the 
retroactive period.
    (5) An individual who fails to exercise his or her rights to convert 
to an individual policy within 31 days after receiving notice of the 
right to convert from the carrier is deemed to have declined the right 
to convert unless the carrier, or, upon review, OPM determines the 
failure was for cause beyond his or her control.

                Subpart E_Contributions and Withholdings


<R05>
Sec. 890.501  Government contributions.

    (a) The Government contribution toward subscription charges under 
all health benefits plans, for each enrolled employee who is paid 
biweekly, is the amount provided in section 8906 of title 5, United 
States Code, plus 4 percent of that amount.
    (b) In accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8906(a) which take 
effect with the contract year that begins in January 1999, OPM will 
determine the amounts representing the weighted average of subscription 
charges in effect for each contract year, for self only enrollments and 
for self and family enrollments, as follows:
    (1) The determination of the weighted average of subscription 
charges will only include those health benefits plans which are 
continuing FEHB Program participation from one contract year to the 
next.
    (i) If OPM and the carrier for a plan that will continue 
participation have closed negotiations on rates for the upcoming 
contract year by September 1 of the current contract year, i.e., the 
determination year, OPM will use the plan's negotiated subscription 
charges for the upcoming contract year in the determination of the 
weighted average of subscription charges.
    (ii) If OPM and the carrier for a plan that applied to continue 
participation have not closed rate negotiations for the upcoming 
contract year by September 1 of the determination year, OPM will make a 
deemed adjustment to such plan's subscription charges for the current 
contract year for purposes of counting eligible enrollees of the plan in 
the determination of weighted average charges for the upcoming contract 
year. The deemed adjustment will equal any increase or decrease OPM 
finds in its determination of the weighted average of subscription 
charges for the upcoming contract year for all plans with which OPM has 
closed rates on September 1 of the determination year.
    (iii) There will be no subsequent adjustment in the weighted average 
charges applicable to the upcoming contract year to reflect rate 
negotiations closed after September 1 of the determination year.
    (2) Except as otherwise specified in paragraphs (b)(2) (i) and 
(b)(2)(ii) of this section, the weight OPM gives to each subscription 
charge for purposes of determining the weighted average of subscription 
charges for the upcoming contract year will be proportionate to the 
number of individuals who, as of March 31 of the determination year, are 
enrolled in the plan or benefits option to which such charge applies and 
are eligible for a Government health benefits contribution in the 
upcoming contract year.
    (i) When a subscription charge for an upcoming contract year applies 
to a plan that is the result of a merger of two or more plans which 
contract separately with OPM during the determination year, or applies 
to a plan which will cease to offer two benefits options, OPM will 
combine the self only enrollments and the self and family enrollments 
from the merging plans, or from a plan's two benefits options, for 
purposes of weighting subscription charges in effect for the successor 
plan for the upcoming contract year.
    (ii) When a comprehensive medical plan (CMP) varies subscription 
charges for different portions of the plan's service area and the plan's 
contract for the upcoming contract year will reconfigure geographic 
areas associated with subscription charges, so that there will not be a 
direct correlation between enrollment in the determination year and 
rating areas for the upcoming contract year, OPM will estimate what 
portion of the plan's enrollees on March 31 of the determination year 
will be subject to each of the plan's subscription rates for the 
upcoming contract year.
    (3) After OPM weights each subscription charge as provided in 
paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(2)(i), and (b)(2)(ii) of this section, OPM will 
compute the total of subscription charges associated with self only 
enrollments, and the total of subscription charges associated with self 
and family enrollments. OPM will divide each subscription charge total 
by the total number of enrollments such amount represents to obtain the 
program-wide weighted average subscription charges for self only and for

[[Page 476]]

self and family enrollments, respectively.
    (c) The Government contribution for annuitants and for employees who 
are not paid biweekly is a percentage of that fixed by paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section proportionate to the length of the pay period, 
rounding fractions of a cent to the nearest cent.
    (d) The Government contribution for employees whose annual pay is 
paid during a period shorter than 52 workweeks is determined on an 
annual basis and prorated over the number of installments of pay 
regularly paid during the year.
    (e) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, 
the employing office must make a contribution for an employee for each 
pay period during which the enrollment continues.
    (f) Temporary employees enrolled under 5 U.S.C. 8906a must pay the 
full subscription charge including the Government contribution. 
Employees with provisional appointments under Sec. 316.403 of this 
chapter are not considered to be enrolled under 5 U.S.C. 8906a for the 
purposes of this paragraph.
    (g) The Government contribution for an employee who enters the 
uniformed services and whose enrollment continues under Sec. 890.303(i) 
ceases after 365 days in nonpay status.

<R05>
Sec. 890.502  Employee withholdings and contributions.

    (a) Employee and annuitant withholdings and contributions. (1) 
Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (g) of this section, an 
employee or annuitant is responsible for payment of the employee or 
annuitant share of the cost of enrollment for every pay period during 
which the enrollment continues. An employee or annuitant incurs an 
indebtedness due the United States in the amount of the proper employee 
or annuitant withholding required for each pay period that health 
benefits withholdings or direct premium payments are not made but during 
which the enrollment continues.
    (2) An individual is not required to pay withholdings for the period 
between the end of the pay period in which he or she separates from 
service and the commencing date of an immediate annuity, if later.
    (3) Temporary employees who are eligible to enroll under 5 U.S.C. 
8906a must pay the full subscription charges including both the employee 
share and the Government contribution. Employees with provisional 
appointments under Sec. 316.403 are not considered eligible for 
coverage under 5 U.S.C. 8906a for the purpose of this paragraph (a)(3).
    (4) The employing office must determine the withholding for 
employees whose annual pay is paid during a period shorter than 52 
workweeks on an annual basis and prorate the withholding over the number 
of installments of pay regularly paid during the year.
    (5) The employing office must make the withholding required from 
enrolled survivor annuitants in the following order. First, withhold 
from the annuity of a surviving spouse, if any. If that annuity is less 
than the withholding required, the employing office must make the 
withholding to the extent necessary from the annuity of the children, if 
any, in the following order. First, withhold from the annuity of the 
youngest child, and if necessary, then from the annuity of the next 
older child, in succession, until the withholding is satisfied.
    (6) Surviving spouses in receipt of a basic employee death benefit 
under 5 U.S.C. 8442(b)(1)(A) and annuitants whose health benefits 
premiums exceed the amount of their annuities may pay their portion of 
the health benefits premium directly to the retirement system acting as 
their employing office in accordance with procedures set out in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Procedures when employee enters LWOP status or pay is 
insufficient to cover premium. As soon as the employing office is aware 
of an employee whose premium payments cannot be made because the 
employee will be entering or has entered leave without pay status, (or 
any other type of nonpay status, except periods of nonpay resulting from 
a lapse of appropriations), or the employee's pay is insufficient to

[[Page 477]]

cover the premiums, the employing office must inform the employee of the 
available health benefits options.
    (1) The employing office must provide the employee written notice of 
the options and consequences as described in paragraphs (b)(2) (i) and 
(ii) of this section. If the employing office cannot give the notice 
required by this paragraph (b)(1) to the employee directly, it must send 
the notice by first class mail. A notice that is mailed is deemed to be 
received 5 days after the date of the notice.
    (2) The employee must elect in writing either to continue health 
benefits coverage or terminate it. Exception: An employee who is subject 
to a court or administrative order as discussed in Sec. 890.301(g)(3) 
may not elect to terminate his or her enrollment as long as the court/
administrative order is still in effect and the employee has at least 
one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB 
Program, unless the employee provides documentation that he or she has 
other coverage for the child or children. The employee may continue his 
or her health benefits coverage by choosing one of the options listed in 
this paragraph (b)(2) and returning the signed form to the employing 
office within 31 days from the day he or she receives the notice (45 
days for an employee residing overseas). When an employee mails the 
signed form, the date of the postmark is deemed to be the date the 
notice is returned to the employing office. If an employee elects to 
continue coverage, he or she must elect in writing either to--
    (i) Agree to pay the premium directly to the agency on a current 
basis. The employee must agree that if he or she does not pay the 
premiums, upon returning to employment or upon pay becoming sufficient 
to cover the premiums, the employing office will deduct, in addition to 
the current pay period's premiums, an amount equal to the premiums for a 
pay period during which the employee was in LWOP status. The employing 
office will continue using this method to deduct the accrued unpaid 
premiums from salary until the debt is recovered in full. The employee 
must also agree that if he or she does not return to work or the 
employing office cannot recover the debt in full from salary, the 
employing office may recover the debt from whatever other sources it 
normally has available for recovery of a debt to the United States, or
    (ii) Agree upon returning to employment or upon pay becoming 
sufficient to cover the premiums, the employing office will deduct, in 
addition to the current pay period's premiums, an amount equal to the 
premiums for a pay period during which the employee was in LWOP status. 
The employing office will continue using this method to deduct the 
accrued unpaid premiums from salary until the debt is recovered in full. 
The employee must also agree that if he or she does not return to work 
or the employing office cannot recover the debt in full from salary, the 
employing office may recover the debt from whatever other sources it 
normally has available for recovery of a debt to the United States.
    (3) Except as provided under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, if 
the employee does not return the signed form within 31 days after the 
day he or she receives the notice (45 days for employees residing 
overseas) the employing office terminates the enrollment according to 
paragraph (b)(5) of this section. The employing office must give the 
employee written notification of the termination.
    (4)(i) If the employee is prevented by circumstances beyond his or 
her control from returning a signed form to the employing office within 
the time frame under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, he or she may 
request reinstatement of coverage by writing to the employing office. 
The employee must describe the circumstances that prevented timely 
notice and file the request within 30 calendar days from the date the 
employing office gives the employee notification of the termination. The 
employing office determines if the employee is eligible for 
reinstatement of coverage. If the determination is affirmative, the 
employing office reinstates the coverage of the employee retroactive to 
the date of termination. If the determination is negative, the employee 
may request a review of the decision from the employing agency as 
provided under Sec. 890.104.

[[Page 478]]

    (ii) If the employee is subject to a court or administrative order 
as discussed in Sec. 890.301(g)(3), the coverage may not terminate. If 
the employee does not return the signed form, the coverage will continue 
and the employee will incur a debt to the Government as discussed in 
paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (5) Terminations of enrollment under paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of 
this section are retroactive to the end of the last pay period in which 
the premium was withheld from pay. The employee and covered family 
members, if any, are entitled to the temporary extension of coverage for 
conversion and may convert to an individual contract for health 
benefits. An employee whose coverage is terminated may enroll upon his 
or her return to duty in a pay status in a position in which the 
employee is eligible for coverage under this part.
    (c) Procedures when an agency underwithholds. (1) An agency that 
withholds less than the proper health benefits contributions from an 
individual's pay, annuity, or compensation must submit an amount equal 
to the sum of the uncollected contributions and any applicable agency 
contributions required under section 8906 of title 5, United States 
Code, to OPM for deposit in the Employees Health Benefits Fund.
    (2) The agency must make the deposit to OPM described in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section as soon as possible, but no later than 60 
calendar days after the date the employing office determines the amount 
of the underdeduction that has occurred, regardless of whether or when 
the agency recovers the underdeduction. A subsequent agency 
determination whether to waive collection of the overpayment of pay 
caused by failure to properly withhold employee health benefits 
contributions shall be made in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5584 as 
implemented by 4 CFR chapter I, subchapter G, unless the agency involved 
is excluded from application of 5 U.S.C. 5584, in which case any 
applicable authority to waive the collection may be used.
    (d) Direct premium payments for annuitants. (1) If an annuity, 
excluding an annuity under Subchapter III of Chapter 84 (Thrift Savings 
Plan), is too low to cover the health benefits premium due or if a 
surviving spouse receives a basic employee death benefit, the retirement 
system must provide information to the annuitant or surviving spouse 
regarding the available plans and notify him or her in writing of the 
opportunity to either: enroll in any plan in which the enrollee's share 
of the premium is not in excess of the annuity; or make payment of the 
premium directly to the retirement system.
    (2) The retirement system must establish a method for accepting 
direct payment for health benefits premiums from surviving spouses who 
have received or are currently receiving basic employee death benefits 
as well as from annuitants whose annuities are too low to cover their 
health premiums. The annuitant or surviving spouse must continue to make 
direct payment of the health benefits premium even if the annuity 
increases to the extent that it covers the premium.
    (3) The annuitant or surviving spouse must pay to the retirement 
system his or her share of the premium for the enrollment for every pay 
period during which the enrollment continues, exclusive of the 31-day 
temporary extension of coverage for conversion provided in Sec. 
890.401. The annuitant or surviving spouse must pay after each pay 
period in which he or she is covered in accordance with a schedule 
established by the retirement system. If the retirement system does not 
receive payment by the date due, the retirement system must notify the 
annuitant or surviving spouse in writing that continuation of coverage 
depends upon payment being made within 15 days (45 days for annuitants 
or surviving spouses residing overseas) after receipt of the notice. If 
no subsequent payments are made, the retirement system terminates the 
enrollment 60 days (90 days for annuitants or surviving spouses residing 
overseas) after the date of the notice. An annuitant or surviving spouse 
whose enrollment terminates because of nonpayment of premium may not 
reenroll or reinstate coverage, except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) 
of this section.
    (4) If the annuitant or surviving spouse is prevented by 
circumstances

[[Page 479]]

beyond his or her control from paying within 15 days after receipt of 
the notice, he or she may request reinstatement of coverage by writing 
to the retirement system. The annuitant or surviving spouse must 
describe the circumstances that prevented timely notice and file the 
request within 30 calendar days from the date of termination. The 
retirement system determines whether the surviving spouse or annuitant 
is eligible for reinstatement of coverage. If the determination is 
affirmative, the retirement system reinstates the coverage of the 
surviving spouse or annuitant retroactive to the date of termination. If 
the determination is negative, the surviving spouse or annuitant may 
request a review of the decision from the retirement system as provided 
under Sec. 890.104.
    (5) Termination of enrollment for failure to pay premiums within the 
time frame established in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section is retroactive to the end of the last pay period for which 
payment has been timely received.
    (6) The retirement system will submit all direct premium payments 
along with its regular health benefits premiums to OPM in accordance 
with procedures established by that office.
    (e) Direct payment of premiums during periods of LWOP status in 
excess of 365 days. (1) An employee who is granted leave without pay 
under subpart L of part 630 of this chapter which exceeds the 365 of 
continued coverage under section 890.303(e) must pay the employee 
contributions directly to the employing office on a current basis.
    (2) Payment must be made after the pay period in which the employee 
is covered in accordance with a schedule established by the employing 
office. If the employing office does not receive the payment by the date 
due, the employing office must notify the employee in writing that 
continuation of coverage depends upon payment being made within 15 days 
(45 days for employees residing overseas) after receipt of the notice. 
If no subsequent payments are made, the employing office terminates the 
enrollment 60 days (90 days for enrollees residing overseas) after the 
date of the notice.
    (3) If the enrollee was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her 
control from making payment within the timeframe specified in paragraph 
(e)(2) of this section he or she may request reinstatement of the 
coverage by writing to the employing office. The employee must file the 
request within 30 calendar days from the date of termination and must 
include supporting documentation.
    (4) The employing office determines whether the employee is eligible 
for reinstatement of coverage. If the determination is affirmative, the 
employing office reinstates the coverage of the employee retroactive to 
the date of termination. If the determination is negative, the employee 
may request a review of the decision from the employing agency as 
provided under Sec. 890.104.
    (5) An employee whose coverage is terminated under paragraph (e)(2) 
of this section may register to enroll upon his or her return to duty in 
a pay status in a position in which the employee is eligible for 
coverage under this part.
    (f) Uniformed services. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) 
of this section, an employee whose coverage continues under Sec. 
890.303(i) is responsible for payment of the employee share of the cost 
of enrollment for every pay period for which the enrollment continues 
for the first 365 days of continued coverage as set forth under 
paragraph (b) of this section. For coverage that continues after 365 
days in nonpay status, the employee must pay, on a current basis, the 
full subscription charge, including both the employee and Government 
shares, plus an additional 2 percent of the full subscription charge.
    (2) Payment of the employee's share of the cost of enrollment is 
waived for the first 365 days of continued coverage in the case of an 
employee whose coverage continues under Sec. 890.303(e) following 
furlough or placement on leave of absence under the provisions of part 
353 of this chapter, or similar authority, or under Sec. 890.303(i) if 
the employee was ordered to active duty before September 1, 1995, under 
section 12301, 12304, 12306, 12307, or 688 of title 10,

<R05>
Sec. 890.503  Reserves.

    (a) The enrollment charge consists of the rate approved by OPM for 
payment to the plan for each enrollee, plus 4 percent, of which one part 
is for an administrative reserve and 3 parts are for a contingency 
reserve for the plan.
    (b) The administrative reserve is credited with the one one-hundred-
and-fourth of the enrollment charge set aside for the administrative 
reserve. The administrative reserve is available for payment of 
administrative expenses of OPM incurred under this part, and for such 
other purposes as may be authorized by law.
    (c)(1) Contingency reserve. The contingency reserve for each plan is 
credited with--
    (i) The three one-hundred-and-fourths of the enrollment charge set 
aside for the contingency reserve from the enrollment charges for 
employees and annuitants enrolled for that plan;
    (ii) Amounts transferred in accordance with law from other 
contingency reserves and the administrative reserve;
    (iii) Income from investment of the reserve;
    (iv) Its proportionate share of the income from investment of the 
administrative reserve; and
    (v) Any return of reserves of the plan.
    (2) Contingency reserve minimum balance. The preferred minimum 
balance for the contingency reserve for community-rated plans is 1 
month's subscription charges at the average recurring monthly rate paid 
from the Employees Health Benefits Fund for the plan during the most 
recent contract period. The preferred minimum balance for the 
contingency reserve for experience-rated plans is 1\1/2\ times an amount 
equal to the sum of an average month's paid claims plus an average 
month's administrative expenses and retentions, as determined under 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Amounts in excess of the preferred 
minimum balance for a contingency reserve account may be used with 
respect to the plan from which the reserve derives: To defray increases 
in future rates; to increase plan benefits, or to reduce contributions 
of eligible subscribers and the Government under the program through 
devices such as temporary suspension of, or reduction in, required 
contributions or a refund of contributions to eligible subscribers and 
the Government.
    (3) OPM/carrier reserve transfers. The target level for total 
reserves of an experience-rated plan is 3\1/2\ times an amount equal to 
the sum of an average month's paid claims plus an average month's 
administrative expenses and retentions. Reserves include funds set aside 
for incurred-but-unpaid benefit claims and the ``special'' reserve 
representing the cumulative difference between income to the plan 
(subscription income plus interest on investments) and plan expenses 
(benefit costs plus administrative expenses and retentions). Included as 
carrier reserves is the balance in the letter of credit (LOC) account 
maintained by OPM for the plan. For the purposes of this section, an 
average month's paid claims is one-sixth of the total claims paid during 
the last 6 months of the most recent contract period, and an average 
month's administrative expenses and retentions is one-twelfth of the 
administrative expenses and retentions for the most recent contract 
period.
    (i) When, as of the end of a contract period, the total of all the 
reserves for an experience-rated plan is less than the target level 
described in the first four sentences of paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, the carrier is entitled to payment from the contingency 
reserve. Such contingency reserve payment shall equal the lesser of: An 
amount equal to the difference between the target level for the plan's 
reserves and the total of the reserves for the plan, or an amount equal 
to the excess, if any, of the contingency reserve over the preferred 
minimum balance. OMP must authorize this payment promptly after 
accepting the accounting statement for

[[Page 481]]

the contract period. The contingency reserve payment so authorized will 
be made available to the carrier's LOC account.
    (ii) When, as of the end of a contract period, the total of all 
reserves of an experience-rated plan amounts to more than the plan's 
target level, the excess over the plan's target level must be credited 
to the contingency reserve maintained by OPM for the plan. OPM will 
withdraw the excess amount from the plan's LOC account, based on 
reporting in the annual accounting statement for the year, no sooner 
than May 1, of the following year. If the accounting statement is not 
filed by the time limit specified in the plan's contract with OPM, OPM 
will estimate the amount of the excess reserves and may withdraw that 
amount from the plan's LOC account, or begin the process of offsetting 
that amount from subscription payments, no sooner than May 1. The amount 
withdrawn from the plan's LOC account, or offset from subscription 
payments, will be credited to that plan's contingency reserve.
    (4) OPM may, by agreement with the carrier, approve community rating 
for a comprehensive plan. If the contingency reserve of the carrier of a 
community-rated plan exceeds the preferred minimum balance, as described 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the carrier may request OPM to pay 
to the plan a portion of the reserve not greater than the excess of the 
contingency reserve over the preferred minimum balance. The carrier 
shall state the reason for the request. OPM will decide whether to allow 
the request in whole or in part and will advise the plan of its 
decision.
    (5) Special contingency reserve transfers. In addition to those 
amounts, if any, paid under paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(4) of this 
section, OPM may authorize such other payments from the contingency 
reserve as in the judgment of OPM may be in the best interest of 
employees and annuitants enrolled in the program. A carrier for a plan 
may apply to OPM at any time for a payment from the contingency reserve 
when the carrier has good cause, such as unexpected claims experience 
and variations from expected community rates. In the administration of 
this part, OPM will accord a high priority to deciding whether to allow 
requests under this paragraph in whole or in part and will promptly 
advise the carrier of its decision. Amounts paid from the contingency 
reserve under paragraphs (c)(2) through (5) of this section shall be 
reported as subscription income in the year in which paid. By agreement 
with the carrier and where good cause exists, OPM may accept payment 
from carrier reserves for credit to the contingency reserve in an amount 
and under conditions other than those specified in paragraph (c) of this 
section. For carriers funded by LOC, the returned amount will be 
withdrawn from the plan's LOC account.

to the surviving plans.

Sec. 890.803  Who may enroll.

    (a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, a former 
spouse is eligible to enroll in a health benefits plan under this part 
provided that--
    (1) The former spouse whose marriage to an employee, employee 
annuitant, or a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or Foreign

and the employee, former employee or employee annuitant, provided such 
child is not otherwise covered by a health plan under this part. An 
unmarried dependent child must be under age 22 or incapable of self-
support because of a mental or physical disability existing before age 
22. No person may be covered by two enrollments.
    (b) Proof of dependency. (1) A child is considered to be dependent 
on the former spouse or the employee, former

denied--
    (1) If evidence shows that the former spouse, employee, former 
employee, or annuitant did not recognize the child as his or her own, 
despite a willingness to support the child; or
    (2) If evidence calls the child's paternity or maternity into doubt, 
despite the former spouse's employee's, former employee's, or employee 
annuitant's recognition and support of the child.
    (d) Child incapable of self-support. When a former spouse enrolls 
for a family enrollment which includes a child who has become 22 years 
of age and is incapable of self-support, the employing office shall 
determine such child's eligibility in accordance with Sec. 890.302(d), 
(e), and (f).
    (e) Meaning of unmarried child. A child, under age 22 or incapable 
of self-support, who has never married or whose marriage has been

available FEHB plan under this part at any time beginning 31 days before 
and ending 60 days after the loss of coverage. A reenrollment under this

by the employing office or retirement system within the time period 
specified, the former spouse must wait until the next available Open

Season (as provided by paragraph (f) of this section).
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Loss of coverage under this part or under another group

under another enrollment under this part or under another group health 
benefits plan. Except as otherwise provided, the former spouse must 
change the enrollment within the period beginning 31 days before the

outside this area, moves or becomes employed further from this area, may 
change the enrollment upon notifying the employing office of the move or 
change of place of employment. Similarly, a former spouse whose covered 
family member moves outside the geographic area from which the plan 
accepts enrollments, or if already outside this area, moves further from 
this area, may change the enrollment upon notifying the employing office 
of the family member's move. The change of enrollment takes effect on

becoming eligible for Medicare may be made only once.
    (m) Annuity insufficient to pay withholdings. (1) If the annuity of 
a former spouse is insufficient to pay the full subscription charge for 
the plan in which he or she is enrolled, the retirement system must 
provide the former spouse with information regarding the available plans 
and written notification of the opportunity to either--
    (i) Pay the premium directly to the retirement system in accordance 
with Sec. 890.808(d); or
    (ii) Enroll in any plan with a full premium that is less than the 
amount of annuity. If the former spouse elects to change to a lower cost 
enrollment, the change takes effect immediately upon loss of coverage 
under the prior enrollment.
    (2) If the former spouse is enrolled in the high option of a plan 
that has two options, and does not elect a plan with a full premium that 
is less than the annuity or does not elect to pay premiums directly, he 
or she is deemed to have enrolled in the standard option of the same 
plan unless the annuity is insufficient to pay the full subscription 
charge for the standard option.
    (3) A former spouse who is enrolled in a plan with only one option, 
who fails to make the election required by this paragraph (m)(3) will be 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 890.807(c).

Sec. 890.807  When do enrollments terminate, cancel or suspend?

    (a)(1) Except for former spouses meeting the requirements in Sec.

[[Page 488]]

have known that (1) the employee on whose service benefits are based 
left Federal service before establishing title to an immediate or 
deferred annuity; or (2) the separated employee on whose service the 
benefits are based died before the requirements for deferred annuity had 
been met. In such cases, the right of conversion may be exercised up to 
31 days after the employing office's notice of termination. The former 
spouse must pay the full premium (employee's and Government's share) 
during the extended period, exclusive of the 31-day period following the

plan in which the former spouse is enrolled, the former spouse may elect 
one of the two opportunities offered under Sec. 890.806(m) (electing a 
plan with a full subscription charge that is less than the annuity; or 
paying premiums directly to the retirement system in accordance with 
Sec. 890.808(d)). Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section the enrollment of a former spouse who fails to make an election 
within the specified time frame will be terminated.
    (2) If the individual was prevented by circumstances beyond his or 
her control from making an election within the time limit after receipt 
of the final notice, he or she may request reinstatement of coverage by 
writing to the retirement system. The retirement system will determine 
if the individual is eligible for reinstatement of coverage; and, when 
the determination is affirmative, the individual's coverage may be 
reinstated retroactively to the date of termination or prospectively. If 
the determination is negative, the individual may request 
reconsideration of the decision from OPM.

family member is entitled as a survivor annuitant to continued 
enrollment or is entitled to continued coverage under the enrollment of 
another.
    (e) Cancellation. (1) A former spouse may cancel his or her 
enrollment at any time by filing an appropriate request with the 
employing office. The cancellation takes effect on the last day of the 
pay period in which the appropriate request cancelling the enrollment is 
received by the employing office.
    (2) A former spouse may suspend enrollment in FEHB for the purpose 
of enrolling in a Medicare sponsored plan under sections 1833, 1876, or 
1851 of the Social Security Act, or to enroll in the Medicaid program or 
a similar State-sponsored program of medical assistance for the needy, 
or to use Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or TRICARE (including the Uniformed 
Services Family Health Plan) or TRICARE-for-Life coverage instead of 
FEHB coverage. To suspend FEHB coverage, documentation of eligibility 
for coverage under the non-FEHB Program must be submitted to the 
employing office or retirement system. If the documentation is received 
within the period beginning

[[Page 489]]

31 days before and ending 31 days after the effective date of the 
enrollment in the Medicare sponsored plan, or the Medicaid or similar 
program, or within 31 days before or after the day designated by the 
former spouse as the day he or she wants to suspend FEHB coverage to use

before the effective date of the enrollment or the end of the day before 
the day designated. Otherwise, the suspension is effective the first day 
of the first pay period that begins after the date the employing office 
or retirement system receives the documentation.
    (3) The former spouse and family members, if any, are not entitled 
to the temporary extension of coverage for conversion or to convert to 
an individual contract for health benefits.
    (4) A former spouse who cancels his or her enrollment for any reason 
may not later reenroll in the FEHB Program.

Sec. 890.808  Employing office responsibilities.

    (a) Application for benefits. The former spouse's application for 
health benefits may be in the form of a Standard Form 2809, letter, or 
written statement to the employing office. Former spouses applying for 
benefits under Sec. 890.803(a)(3)(iv) of this part must also include 
with their application a request for waiver of the application time 
limitation in accordance with Sec. 890.805(b) of this part. Former 
spouses applying for benefits under Sec. 890.803(a)(3)(v) of this part 
must also include with their application a request for waiver of the 
application time limitation in accordance with Sec. 890.805(c) of this 
part.
    (b) Administration of the enrollment process. (1) The employing

them for an eligibility determination, and collecting premium payments. 
The method will include procedures for verifying the eligibility 
requirements under Sec. 890.803(a) (1) and (2) of this part. The 
employing office must obtain OPM, Foreign Service Retirement and 
Disability System (FSRDS), or CIA Retirement and Disability System 
(CIARDS) documentation that the former spouse meets the additional 
requirement under Sec. 890.803(a)(3) (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of 
this part. A request for the retirement system's determination whether a 
court order is a qualifying court order for health benefits enrollment 
under this subpart must be accompanied by the documentation specified in 
Sec. 838.221, Sec. 838.721, or Sec. 838.1005 of this chapter.
    (2) The employing office will send the former spouse notice, in 
writing, of its decision. When an employing office informs a former 
spouse of his or her eligibility to enroll, it will identify the 
documents on which it based its decision and will include a premium 
payment schedule and statement of the requirements for continued 
enrollment under Sec. 890.803. If the former spouse does not qualify 
for health benefits coverage, the employing office must give the former 
spouse a reconsideration right under Sec. 890.104. Reconsideration 
requests from former spouses applying for benefits under Sec. 
890.803(a)(3)(iv) of this part must be directed to the Office of 
Personnel, Retirement Division, Central Intelligence Agency, Washington, 
DC 20505. Reconsideration requests from former spouses applying for 
benefits under Sec. 890.803(a)(3)(v) of this part must be directed to 
the Department of State, Retirement Division, Washington, DC 20520.
    (3) The agency employing office will maintain a health benefits file 
for the former spouse as a file separate from the personnel records of 
the employee or former employee. The retirement system acting as 
employing office for the former spouse may file the former spouse health 
benefits records in with the annuitant's retirement records.

[[Page 490]]

    (4) The former spouse will be required to certify that he or she 
meets the requirements listed in Sec. 890.803 and that he or she will 
notify the employing office within 31 days of an event that results in 
failure to meet one or more of the requirements.
    (c) Qualifying court order. Subject to a 31-day extension period for 
conversion, the duration of health benefits coverage will coincide with 
any period specified in the qualifying court order providing for an 
annuity. A court order not meeting the requirements under part 838 of 
this chapter will not be used to establish or continue entitlement to a 
former spouse's health benefits coverage.
    (d) Premium payments. (1) The former spouse must remit to the 
employing office the full subscription charge for the enrollment for 
every pay period during which the enrollment continues, exclusive of the 
31-day temporary extension of coverage for conversion provided in 
Sec. Sec. 890.401 and 890.807(a)(2). Payment must be made after the pay 
period in which the former spouse is covered in accordance with a 
schedule established by the employing office (see definition of pay 
period under Sec. 890.101(a)). If the employing office does not receive 
payment by the due date the employing office must notify the former 
spouse in writing that continuation of coverage depends upon payment 
being made within 15 days (45 days for enrollees residing overseas) 
after receipt of the notice. If no subsequent payments are made, the 
employing office terminates the enrollment 60 days (90 days for 
enrollees residing overseas) after the date of the notice. Termination 
for nonpayment of premium is considered a voluntary cancellation under 
Sec. 890.807(d). A former spouse whose enrollment is terminated because 
of nonpayment of premium may not reenroll or reinstate coverage except 
as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (2) If the individual was prevented by circumstances beyond his or 
her control from making payment within 15 days after receipt of the 
notice, he or she may request reinstatement of coverage by writing to 
the employing office. Such a request must be filed within 30 calendar 
days from the date of termination and must be accompanied by 
verification that the individual was prevented by circumstances beyond 
his or her control from paying within the time limit. The employing 
office will determine if the individual is eligible for reinstatement of 
coverage; and, when the determination is affirmative, the individual's 
coverage may be reinstated retroactively to the date of termination. If 
the determination is negative, the individual may request a review of 
the decision from the employing agency as provided under Sec. 890.104.
    (3) The employing office will submit all premium payments collected 
from former spouses along with its regular health benefits payments to 
OPM in accordance with procedures established by that Office.
    (e) Withholding from annuity. The retirement system acting as 
employing office for a former spouse will establish a method for 
withholding the full subscription charge from the former spouse's 
annuity check. When the annuity is insufficient to cover the full 
subscription charge, the retirement system will follow the procedures 
specified in Sec. 890.806(l).

                          Mandatory Debarments


<R05>
Sec. 890.1004  Bases for mandatory debarments.

    (a) Debarment required. OPM shall debar a provider who is described 
by any category of offense set forth in 5 U.S.C. 8902a(b).
    (b) Direct involvement with an OPM program unnecessary. The conduct 
underlying the basis for a provider's mandatory debarment need not have 
involved an FEHBP covered individual or transaction, or any other OPM 
program.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1005  Time limits for OPM to initiate mandatory debarments.

    OPM shall send a provider a written notice of a proposed mandatory 
debarment within 6 years of the event that forms the basis for the 
debarment. If the basis for the proposed debarment is a conviction, the 
notice shall be sent within 6 years of the date of the conviction. If 
the basis is another agency's suspension, debarment, or exclusion, the 
OPM notice shall be sent within 6 years of the effective date of the 
other agency's action.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1006  Notice of proposed mandatory debarment.

    (a) Written notice. OPM shall inform a provider of his proposed 
debarment by written notice sent not less than 30 days prior to the 
proposed effective date.
    (b) Contents of the notice. The notice shall contain information 
indicating the:
    (1) Effective date of the debarment;
    (2) Minimum length of the debarment;
    (3) Basis for the debarment;
    (4) Provisions of law and regulation authorizing the debarment;
    (5) Effect of the debarment;
    (6) Provider's right to contest the debarment to the debarring 
official;
    (7) Provider's right to request OPM to reduce the length of 
debarment, if it exceeds the minimum period required by law or this 
subpart; and
    (8) Procedures the provider shall be required to follow to apply for 
reinstatement at the end of his period of debarment, and to seek a 
waiver of the debarment on the basis that he is the sole health care 
provider or the sole source of essential specialized services in a 
community.
    (c) Methods of sending notice. OPM shall send the notice of proposed 
debarment and the final decision notice (if a contest is filed) to the 
provider's last known address by first class mail, or, at OPM's option, 
by express delivery service.
    (d) Delivery to attorney, agent, or representatives. (1) If OPM 
proposes to

[[Page 495]]

debar an individual health care provider, it may send the notice of 
proposed debarment directly to the provider or to any other person 
designated by the provider to act as a representative in debarment 
proceedings.
    (2) In the case of a health care provider that is an entity, OPM 
shall deem notice sent to any owner, partner, director, officer, 
registered agent for service of process, attorney, or managing employee 
as constituting notice to the entity.
    (e) Presumed timeframes for receipt of notice. OPM computes 
timeframes associated with the delivery notices described in paragraph 
(c) of this section so that:
    (1) When OPM sends notice by a method that provides a confirmation 
of receipt, OPM deems that the provider received the notice at the time 
indicated in the confirmation; and
    (2) When OPM sends notice by a method that does not provide a 
confirmation of receipt, OPM deems that the provider received the notice 
5 business days after it was sent.
    (f) Procedures if notice cannot be delivered. (1) If OPM learns that 
a notice was undeliverable as addressed or routed, OPM shall make 
reasonable efforts to obtain a current and accurate address, and to 
resend the notice to that address, or it shall use alternative methods 
of sending the notice, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If a notice cannot be delivered after reasonable followup 
efforts as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, OPM shall 
presume that the provider received notice 5 days after the latest date 
on which a notice was sent.
    (g) Use of electronic means to transmit notice. [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 890.1007  Minimum length of mandatory debarments.

    (a) Debarment based on a conviction. The statutory minimum period of 
debarment for a mandatory debarment based on a conviction is 3 years.
    (b) Debarment based on another agency's action. A debarment based on 
another Federal agency's debarment, suspension, or exclusion remains in 
effect until the originating agency terminates its sanction.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1008  Mandatory debarment for longer than the minimum length.

    (a) Aggravating factors. OPM may debar a provider for longer than 
the 3-year minimum period for mandatory debarments if aggravating 
factors are associated with the basis for the debarment. The factors OPM 
considers to be aggravating are:
    (1) Whether the FEHBP incurred a financial loss as the result of the 
acts underlying the conviction, or similar acts that were not 
adjudicated, and the level of such loss. In determining the amount of 
financial loss, OPM shall not consider any amounts of restitution that a 
provider may have paid;
    (2) Whether the sentence imposed by the court included 
incarceration;
    (3) Whether the underlying offense(s), or similar acts not 
adjudicated, occurred repeatedly over a period of time, and whether 
there is evidence that the offense(s) was planned in advance;
    (4) Whether the provider has a prior record of criminal, civil, or 
administrative adjudication of related offenses or similar acts; or
    (5) Whether the actions underlying the conviction, or similar acts 
that were not adjudicated, adversely affected the physical, mental, or 
financial well-being of one or more covered individuals or other 
persons.
    (b) Mitigating factors. If the aggravating factors justify a 
debarment longer than the 3 year minimum period for mandatory 
debarments, OPM shall also consider whether mitigating factors may 
justify reducing the debarment period to not less than 3 years. The 
factors that OPM considers to be mitigating are:
    (1) Whether the conviction(s) on which the debarment is based 
consist entirely or primarily of misdemeanor offenses;
    (2) Whether court records, including associated sentencing reports, 
contain an official determination that the provider had a physical, 
mental, or emotional condition before or during the commission of the 
offenses underlying the conviction that reduced his level of 
culpability; or
    (3) Whether the provider's cooperation with Federal and/or State 
investigative officials resulted in criminal

[[Page 496]]

convictions, civil recoveries, or administrative actions against other 
individuals, or served as the basis for identifying program weaknesses. 
Restitution made by the provider for funds wrongfully, improperly, or 
illegally received from Federal or State programs may also be considered 
as a mitigating circumstance.
    (c) Maximum period of debarment. There is no limit on the maximum 
period of a mandatory debarment based on a conviction.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1009  Contesting proposed mandatory debarments.

    (a) Contesting the debarment. Within 30 days after receiving OPM's 
notice of proposed mandatory debarment, a provider may submit 
information, documents, and written arguments in opposition to the 
proposed debarment. OPM's notice shall contain specific information 
about where and how to submit this material. If a timely contest is not 
filed, the proposed debarment shall become effective as stated in the 
notice, without further action by OPM.
    (b) Requesting a reduction of the debarment period. If OPM proposes 
a mandatory debarment for a period longer than the 3-year minimum 
required by 5 U.S.C. 8902a(g)(3), the provider may request a reduction 
of the debarment period to not less than 3 years, without contesting the 
debarment itself.
    (c) Personal appearance before the debarring official. In addition 
to providing written material, the provider may appear before the 
debarring official personally or through a representative to present 
oral arguments in support of his contest. OPM's notice shall contain 
specific information about arranging an in-person presentation.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1010  Debarring official's decision of contest.

    (a) Prior adjudication is dispositive. Evidence indicating that a 
provider was formally adjudicated for a violation of any type set forth 
in 5 U.S.C. 8902a(b) fully satisfies the standard of proof for a 
mandatory debarment.
    (b) Debarring official's decision. The debarring official shall 
issue a written decision, based on the entire administrative record, 
within 30 days after the record closes to receipt of information. The 
debarring official may extend this decision period for good cause.
    (c) No further administrative proceedings. The debarring official's 
decisions regarding mandatory debarment and the period of debarment are 
final and are not subject to further administrative review.

                          Permissive Debarments


<R05>
Sec. 890.1011  Bases for permissive debarments.

    (a) Licensure actions. OPM may debar a health care provider to whom 
the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8902a(c)(1) apply. OPM may take this action 
even if the provider retains current and valid professional licensure in 
another State(s).
    (b) Ownership or control interests. OPM may debar a health care 
provider based on ownership or control of or by a debarred provider, as 
set forth in 5 U.S.C. 8902a(c)(2) and (3).
    (c) False, deceptive, or wrongful claims practices. OPM may debar a 
provider who commits claims-related violations as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 
8902a(c)(4) and (5) and 5 U.S.C. 8902a(d)(1) and (2).
    (d) Failure to furnish required information. OPM may debar a 
provider who knowingly fails to provide information requested by an 
FEHBP carrier or OPM, as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 8902a(d)(3).


<R05>
Sec. 890.1012  Time limits for OPM to initiate permissive debarments.

    (a) Licensure cases. If the basis for the proposed debarment is a 
licensure action, OPM shall send the provider a notice of proposed 
debarment within 6 years of the effective date of the State licensing 
authority's revocation, suspension, restriction, or nonrenewal action, 
or the date on which the provider surrendered his license to the State 
authority.
    (b) Ownership or control. If the basis for the proposed debarment is 
ownership or control of an entity by a sanctioned person, or ownership 
or control of a sanctioned entity by a person who knew or should have 
known of the basis for the entity's sanction, OPM shall send a notice of 
proposed debarment within 6 years of the effective date of the sanction 
on which the proposed debarment is based.

[[Page 497]]

    (c) False, deceptive, or wrongful claims practices. If the basis for 
the proposed debarment involves a claim filed with a FEHBP carrier, OPM 
shall send the provider a notice of proposed debarment within 6 years of 
the date he presented the claim for payment to the covered person's 
FEHBP carrier.
    (d) Failure to furnish requested information. If the basis for the 
proposed debarment involves a provider's failure to furnish information 
requested by OPM or an FEHBP carrier, OPM shall send the notice of 
proposed debarment within 6 years of the date on which the carrier or 
OPM requested the provider to furnish the information in question.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1013  Deciding whether to propose a permissive debarment.

    (a) Review factors. The factors OPM shall consider in deciding 
whether to propose a provider's debarment under a permissive debarment 
authority are:
    (1) The nature of any claims involved in the basis for the proposed 
debarment and the circumstances under which they were presented to FEHBP 
carriers;
    (2) The improper conduct involved in the basis for the proposed 
debarment, and the provider's degree of culpability and history of prior 
offenses;
    (3) The extent to which the provider poses or may pose a risk to the 
health and safety of FEHBP-covered individuals or to the integrity of 
FEHBP transactions; and
    (4) Other factors specifically relevant to the provider's debarment 
that shall be considered in the interests of fairness.
    (b) Absence of a factor. The absence of a factor shall be considered 
neutral, and shall have no effect on OPM's decision.
    (c) Specialized review in certain cases. In determining whether to 
propose debarment under 5 U.S.C 8902a(c)(4) for providing items or 
services substantially in excess of the needs of a covered individual or 
for providing items or services that fail to meet professionally-
recognized quality standards, OPM shall obtain the input of trained 
reviewers, based on written medical protocols developed by physicians. 
If OPM cannot reach a decision on this basis, it shall consult with a 
physician in an appropriate specialty area.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1014  Notice of proposed permissive debarment.

    Notice of a proposed permissive debarment shall contain the 
information set forth in Sec. 890.1006.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1015  Minimum and maximum length of permissive debarments.

    (a) No mandatory minimum or upper limit on length of permissive 
debarment. There is neither a mandatory minimum debarment period nor a 
limitation on the maximum length of a debarment under any permissive 
debarment authority.
    (b) Debarring official's process in setting period of permissive 
debarment. The debarring official shall set the period of each debarment 
issued under a permissive debarment authority after considering the 
factors set forth in Sec. 890.1016 and the factors set forth in the 
applicable section from among Sec. Sec. 890.1017 through 890.1021.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1016  Aggravating and mitigating factors used to determine the length of permissive debarments.

    (a) Aggravating factors. The presence of aggravating circumstances 
may support an OPM determination to increase the length of a debarment 
beyond the nominal periods set forth in Sec. Sec. 890.1017 through 
890.1021. The factors that OPM considers as aggravating are:
    (1) Whether the provider's actions underlying the basis for the 
debarment, or similar acts, had an adverse impact on the physical or 
mental health or well-being of one or more FEHBP-covered individuals or 
other persons.
    (2) Whether the provider has a documented history of prior criminal 
wrongdoing; civil violations related to health care items or services; 
improper conduct; or administrative violations addressed by a Federal or 
State agency. OPM may consider matters involving violence, patient 
abuse, drug abuse, or controlled substances convictions or violations to 
be particularly serious.
    (3) Whether the provider's actions underlying the basis for the 
debarment, or similar acts, resulted in financial

[[Page 498]]

loss to the FEHBP, FEHBP-covered individuals, or other persons. In 
determining whether, or to what extent, a financial loss occurred, OPM 
shall not consider any amounts of restitution that the provider may have 
paid.
    (4) Whether the provider's false, wrongful, or improper claims to 
FEHBP carriers were numerous, submitted over a prolonged period of time, 
or part of an on-going pattern of wrongful acts.
    (5) Whether the provider was specifically aware of or directly 
responsible for the acts constituting the basis for the debarment.
    (6) Whether the provider attempted to obstruct, hinder, or impede 
official inquiries into the wrongful conduct underlying the debarment.
    (b) Mitigating factors. The presence of mitigating circumstances may 
support an OPM determination to shorten the length of a debarment below 
the nominal periods set forth in Sec. Sec. 890.1017 through 890.1021, 
respectively. The factors that OPM considers as mitigating are:
    (1) Whether the provider's cooperation with Federal, State, or local 
authorities resulted in criminal convictions, civil recoveries, or 
administrative actions against other violators, or served as the basis 
for official determinations of program weaknesses or vulnerabilities. 
Restitution that the provider made for funds wrongfully, improperly, or 
illegally received from Federal or State programs may also be considered 
as a mitigating factor.
    (2) Whether official records of judicial proceedings or the 
proceedings of State licensing authorities contain a formal 
determination that the provider had a physical, mental, or emotional 
condition that reduced his level of culpability before or during the 
period in which he committed the violations in question.
    (c) Absence of factors. The absence of aggravating or mitigating 
factors shall have no effect to either increase or lower the nominal 
period of debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1017  Determining length of debarment based on revocation or suspension of a provider's professional licensure.

    (a) Indefinite term of debarment. Subject to the exceptions set 
forth in paragraph (b) of this section, debarment under 5 U.S.C. 
8902a(c)(1) shall be for an indefinite period coinciding with the period 
during which the provider's license is revoked, suspended, restricted, 
surrendered, or otherwise not in effect in the State whose action formed 
the basis for OPM's debarment.
    (b) Aggravating circumstances. If any of the aggravating 
circumstances set forth in Sec. 890.1016 apply, OPM may debar the 
provider for an additional period beyond the duration of the licensure 
revocation or suspension.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1018  Determining length of debarment for an entity owned or controlled by a sanctioned provider.

    OPM shall determine the length of debarments of entities under 5 
U.S.C. 8902a(c)(2) based on the type of violation committed by the 
person with an ownership or control interest. The types of violations 
actionable under this provision are:
    (a) Owner/controller's debarment. The debarment of an entity based 
on debarment of an individual with an ownership or control interest 
shall be for a period concurrent with the individual's debarment. If any 
aggravating or mitigating circumstances set forth in Sec. 890.1016 
apply solely to the entity and were not considered in setting the period 
of the individual's debarment, OPM may debar the entity for a period 
longer or shorter than the individual's debarment.
    (b) Owner/controller's conviction. The debarment of an entity based 
on the criminal conviction of a person with an ownership or control 
interest for an offense listed in 5 U.S.C. 8902a(b)(1)-(4) shall be for 
a period of not less than 3 years, subject to adjustment for any 
aggravating or mitigating circumstances set forth in Sec. 890.1016 
applying solely to the entity.
    (c) Owner/controller's civil monetary penalty. The debarment of an 
entity based on a civil monetary penalty imposed on a person with an 
ownership or

[[Page 499]]

control interest, shall be for a period of not less than 3 years, 
subject to adjustment for any aggravating or mitigating circumstances 
set forth in Sec. 890.1016 applying solely to the entity.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1019  Determining length of debarment based on ownership or control of a sanctioned entity.

    OPM shall determine the length of debarments of individual providers 
under 5 U.S.C. 8902a(c)(3) based on the type of violation committed by 
the sanctioned entity owned or controlled by the person with an 
ownership or control interest. The types of violations actionable under 
this provision are:
    (a) Entity's debarment. If a provider's debarment is based on his 
ownership or control of a debarred entity, the debarment shall be 
concurrent with the entity's debarment. If any of the aggravating or 
mitigating circumstances identified in Sec. 890.1016 applies directly 
to the provider that owns or controls the debarred entity and was not 
considered in setting the period of the entity's debarment, OPM may 
debar the provider for a period longer or shorter, respectively, than 
the entity's debarment.
    (b) Entity's conviction. If a provider's debarment is based on the 
criminal conviction of an entity he owns or controls for an offense 
listed in 5 U.S.C. 8902a(b)(1)-(4), OPM shall debar the provider for a 
period of no less than 3 years, subject to adjustment for any 
aggravating or mitigating circumstances identified in Sec. 890.1016 
that apply to the provider as an individual.
    (c) Entity's civil monetary penalty. If a provider's debarment is 
based on a civil monetary penalty imposed on an entity he owns or 
controls, OPM shall debar him for 3 years, subject to adjustment on the 
basis of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances listed in Sec. 
890.1016 that apply to the provider as an individual.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1020  Determining length of debarment based on false, wrongful, or deceptive claims.

    Debarments under 5 U.S.C. 8902a(c)(4) and (5) and 5 U.S.C. 
8902a(d)(1) and (2) shall be for a period of 3 years, subject to 
adjustment based on the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in 
Sec. 890.1016.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1021  Determining length of debarment based on failure to furnish information needed to resolve claims.

    Debarments under 5 U.S.C. 8902a(d)(3) shall be for a period of 3 
years, subject to adjustment based on the aggravating and mitigating 
factors listed in Sec. 890.1016.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1022  Contesting proposed permissive debarments.

    (a) Right to contest a proposed debarment. A provider proposed for 
debarment under a permissive debarment authority may challenge the 
debarment by filing a written contest with the debarring official during 
the 30-day notice period indicated in the notice of proposed debarment. 
In the absence of a timely contest, the debarment shall become effective 
as stated in the notice, without further action by OPM.
    (b) Challenging the length of a proposed debarment. A provider may 
contest the length of the proposed debarment, while not challenging the 
debarment itself, or may contest both the length of a debarment and the 
debarment itself in the same contest.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1023  Information considered in deciding a contest.

    (a) Documents and oral and written arguments. A provider may submit 
documents and written arguments in opposition to the proposed debarment 
and/or the length of the proposed debarment, and may appear personally 
or through a representative before the debarring official to provide 
other relevant information.
    (b) Specific factual basis for contesting the proposed debarment. A 
provider's oral and written arguments shall identify the specific facts 
that contradict the basis for the proposed debarment as stated in the 
notice of proposed debarment. A general or unsupported denial of the 
basis for debarment does not raise a genuine dispute over facts material 
to the debarment, and the debarring official shall not give such a 
denial any probative weight.
    (c) Mandatory disclosures. Regardless of the basis for the contest, 
providers

[[Page 500]]

are required to disclose certain types of background information, in 
addition to any other information submitted during the contest. Failure 
to provide such information completely and accurately may be a basis for 
OPM to initiate further legal or administrative action against the 
provider. The specific items of information that shall be furnished to 
OPM are:
    (1) Any existing, proposed, or prior exclusion, debarment, penalty, 
or other sanction imposed on the provider by a Federal, State, or local 
government agency, including any administrative agreement that purports 
to affect only a single agency;
    (2) Any criminal or civil legal proceeding not referenced in the 
notice of proposed debarment that arose from facts relevant to the basis 
for debarment stated in the notice; and
    (3) Any entity in which the provider has a control interest, as that 
term is defined in Sec. 890.1003.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1024  Standard and burden of proof for deciding contests.

    OPM shall demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence in the 
administrative record as a whole, that a provider has committed a 
sanctionable violation.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1025  Cases where additional fact-finding is not required.

    In each contest, the debarring official shall determine whether a 
further fact-finding proceeding is required in addition to presentation 
of arguments, documents, and information. An additional fact-finding 
proceeding is not required when:
    (a) Prior adjudication. The proposed debarment is based on facts 
determined in a prior due process adjudication. Examples of prior due 
process proceedings include, but are not limited to, the adjudication 
procedures associated with:
    (1) Licensure revocation, suspension, restriction, or nonrenewal by 
a State licensing authority;
    (2) Debarment, exclusion, suspension, civil monetary penalties, or 
similar legal or administrative adjudications by Federal, State, or 
local agencies;
    (3) A criminal conviction or civil judgment; or
    (4) An action by a provider that constitutes a waiver of his right 
to a due process adjudication, such as surrender of professional license 
during the pendency of a disciplinary hearing, entering a guilty plea or 
confession of judgment in a judicial proceeding, or signing a settlement 
agreement stipulating facts that constitute a sanctionable violation.
    (b) Material facts not in dispute. The provider's contest does not 
identify a bona fide dispute concerning facts material to the basis for 
the proposed debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1026  Procedures if a fact-finding proceeding is not required.

    (a) Debarring official's procedures. If a fact-finding proceeding is 
not required, the debarring official shall issue a final decision of a 
provider's contest within 30 days after the record closes for submitting 
evidence, arguments, and information as part of the contest. The 
debarring official may extend this timeframe for good cause.
    (b) No further administrative review available. There are no further 
OPM administrative proceedings after the presiding official's final 
decision. A provider adversely affected by the decision may appeal under 
5 U.S.C. 8902a(h)(2) to the appropriate U.S. district court.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1027  Cases where an additional fact-finding proceeding is required.

    (a) Criteria for holding fact-finding proceeding. The debarring 
official shall request another OPM official (``presiding official'') to 
hold an additional fact-finding proceeding if:
    (1) Facts material to the proposed debarment have not been 
adjudicated in a prior due process proceeding; and
    (2) These facts are genuinely in dispute, based on the entire 
administrative record available to the debarring official.
    (b) Qualification to serve as presiding official. The presiding 
official is designated by the OPM Director or another OPM official 
authorized by the Director to make such designations. The presiding 
official shall be a senior official who is qualified to conduct informal 
adjudicative proceedings and who has had no previous contact with the 
proposed debarment or the contest.

[[Page 501]]

    (c) Effect on contest. The debarring official shall defer a final 
decision on the contest pending the results of the fact-finding 
proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1028  Conducting a fact-finding proceeding.

    (a) Informal proceeding. The presiding official may conduct the 
fact-finding proceedings as informally as practicable, consistent with 
principles of fundamental fairness. Formal rules of evidence or 
procedure do not apply to these proceedings.
    (b) Proceeding limited to disputed material facts. The presiding 
official shall consider only the genuinely disputed facts identified by 
the debarring official as material to the basis for the debarment. 
Matters that have been previously adjudicated or that are not in bona 
fide dispute within the administrative record shall not be considered by 
presiding official.
    (c) Provider's right to present information, evidence, and 
arguments. A provider may appear before the presiding official with 
counsel, submit oral and written arguments and documentary evidence, 
present witnesses on his own behalf, question any witnesses testifying 
in support of the debarment, and challenge the accuracy of any other 
evidence that the agency offers as a basis for the debarment.
    (d) Record of proceedings. The presiding official shall make an 
audio recording of the proceedings and shall provide a copy to the 
provider at no charge. If the provider wishes to have a transcribed 
record, OPM shall arrange for production of one which may be purchased 
at cost.
    (e) Presiding official's findings. The presiding official shall 
resolve all of the disputed facts identified by the debarring official, 
on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence contained within the 
entire administrative record. The presiding official shall issue a 
written report of all findings of fact to the debarring official within 
30 days after the record of the fact-finding proceeding closes.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1029  Deciding a contest after a fact-finding proceeding.

    (a) Findings shall be accepted. The debarring official shall accept 
the presiding official's findings of fact, unless they are arbitrary, 
capricious, or clearly erroneous. If the debarring official concludes 
that the factual findings are not acceptable, they may be remanded to 
the presiding official for additional proceedings in accordance with 
Sec. 890.1028.
    (b) Timeframe for final decision. The debarring official shall issue 
a final written decision on a contest within 30 days after receiving the 
presiding official's findings. The debarring official may extend this 
decision period for good cause.
    (c) Debarring official's final decision. (1) The debarring official 
shall observe the evidentiary standards and burdens of proof stated in 
Sec. 890.1024 in reaching a final decision.
    (2) In any case where a final decision is made to debar a provider, 
the debarring official has the discretion to set the period of 
debarment, subject to the factors identified in Sec. Sec. 890.1016 
through 1021.
    (3) The debarring official has the discretion to decide not to 
impose debarment in any case involving a permissive debarment authority.
    (d) No further administrative proceedings. No further administrative 
proceedings shall be conducted after the debarring official's final 
decision in a contest involving an additional fact-finding hearing. A 
provider adversely affected by the debarring official's final decision 
in a contested case may appeal under 5 U.S.C. 8902a(h)(2) to the 
appropriate U. S. district court.

                               Suspension


<R05>
Sec. 890.1030  Effect of a suspension.

    (a) Temporary action pending formal proceedings. Suspension is a 
temporary action pending completion of an investigation or ensuing 
criminal, civil, or administrative proceedings.
    (b) Immediate effect. Suspension is effective immediately upon the 
suspending official's decision, without prior notice to the provider.
    (c) Effect equivalent to debarment. The effect of a suspension is 
the same as the effect of a debarment. A suspended provider may not 
receive payment

[[Page 502]]

from FEHBP funds for items or services furnished to FEHBP-covered 
persons while suspended.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1031  Grounds for suspension.

    (a) Basis for suspension. OPM may suspend a provider if:
    (1) OPM obtains reliable evidence indicating that one of the grounds 
for suspension listed in paragraph (b) of this section applies to the 
provider; and
    (2) The suspending official determines under paragraph (c) of this 
section that immediate action to suspend the provider is necessary to 
protect the health and safety of persons covered by FEHBP.
    (b) Grounds for suspension. Evidence constituting grounds for a 
suspension may include, but is not limited to:
    (1) Indictment or conviction of a provider for a criminal offense 
that is a basis for mandatory debarment under this subpart;
    (2) Indictment or conviction of a provider for a criminal offense 
that reflects a risk to the health, safety, or well-being of FEHBP-
covered individuals;
    (3) Other credible evidence indicating, in the judgment of the 
suspending official, that a provider has committed a violation that 
would warrant debarment under this subpart. This may include, but is not 
limited to:
    (i) Civil judgments;
    (ii) Notice that a Federal, State, or local government agency has 
debarred, suspended, or excluded a provider from participating in a 
program or revoked or declined to renew a professional license; or
    (iii) Other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies 
that determine factual or legal matters.
    (c) Determining need for immediate action. Suspension is intended to 
protect the public interest, including the health and safety of covered 
individuals or the integrity of FEHBP funds. The suspending official has 
wide discretion to decide whether to suspend a provider. A specific 
finding of immediacy or necessity is not required to issue a suspension. 
The suspending official may draw reasonable inferences from the nature 
of the alleged misconduct and from a provider's actual or potential 
transactions with the FEHBP.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1032  Length of suspension.

    (a) Initial period. The initial term of all suspensions shall be an 
indefinite period not to exceed 12 months.
    (b) Formal legal proceedings not initiated. If formal legal or 
administrative proceedings have not begun against a provider within 12 
months after the effective date of his suspension, the suspending 
official may:
    (1) Terminate the suspension; or
    (2) If requested by the Department of Justice, the cognizant United 
States Attorney's Office, or other responsible Federal, State, or local 
prosecuting official, extend the suspension for an additional period, 
not to exceed 6 months.
    (c) Formal proceedings initiated. If formal criminal, civil, or 
administrative proceedings are initiated against a suspended provider, 
the suspension may continue indefinitely, pending the outcome of those 
proceedings.
    (d) Terminating the suspension. The suspending official may 
terminate a suspension at any time, and shall terminate it after 18 
months, unless formal proceedings have begun within that period.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1033  Notice of suspension.

    (a) Written notice. OPM shall send written notice of suspension 
according to the procedures and methods described in Sec. 890.1006(c)-
(f).
    (b) Contents of notice. The suspension notice shall contain 
information indicating that:
    (1) The provider has been suspended, effective on the date of the 
notice;
    (2) The initial period of the suspension;
    (3) The basis for the suspension;
    (4) The provisions of law and regulation authorizing the suspension;
    (5) The effect of the suspension; and
    (6) The provider's rights to contest the suspension.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1034  Counting a period of suspension as part of a subsequent debarment.

    The debarring official may consider the provider's contiguous period 
of suspension when determining the length of a debarment.

[[Page 503]]


<R05>
Sec. 890.1035  Provider contests of suspensions.

    (a) Filing a contest of the suspension. A provider may challenge a 
suspension by filing a contest, in writing, with the suspending official 
not later than 30 days after receiving notice of suspension. The 
suspension shall remain in effect during the contest, unless rescinded 
by the suspending official.
    (b) Informal proceeding. The suspending official shall use informal, 
flexible procedures to conduct the contest. Formal rules of evidence and 
procedure do not apply to this proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1036  Information considered in deciding a contest.

    (a) Presenting information and arguments to the suspending official. 
A provider may submit documents and written arguments in opposition to 
the suspension, and may appear personally, or through a representative, 
before the suspending official to provide any other relevant 
information.
    (b) Specific factual basis for contesting the suspension. The 
provider shall identify specific facts that contradict the basis for the 
suspension as stated in the suspension notice. A general denial of the 
basis for suspension does not raise a genuine dispute over facts 
material to the suspension, and the suspending official shall not give 
such a denial any probative weight.
    (c) Mandatory disclosures. Any provider contesting a suspension 
shall disclose the items of information set forth in Sec. 890.1023(c). 
Failure to provide such information completely and accurately may be a 
basis for OPM to initiate further legal or administrative action against 
the provider.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1037  Cases where additional fact-finding is not required.

    The suspending official may decide a contest without an additional 
fact-finding process if:
    (a) Previously adjudicated facts. The suspension is based on an 
indictment or on facts determined by a prior adjudication in which the 
provider was afforded due process rights. Examples of due process 
proceedings include, but are not limited to, the adjudication procedures 
associated with licensure revocation, suspension, restriction, or 
nonrenewal by a State licensing authority; similar administrative 
adjudications by Federal, State, or local agencies; a criminal 
conviction or civil judgment; or an action by the provider that 
constitutes a waiver of his right to a due process adjudication, such as 
surrender of professional licensure during the pendency of a 
disciplinary hearing, entering a guilty plea or confession of judgment 
in a judicial proceeding, or signing a settlement agreement stipulating 
facts that constitute a sanctionable violation. Neither the existence of 
the prior adjudication nor any of the underlying circumstances are 
considered to be subject to genuine factual dispute as part of the 
suspension proceeding.
    (b) Advisory by law enforcement officials. OPM is advised by the 
Department of Justice, the appropriate U.S. Attorney's Office, a State 
attorney general's office, or a State or local prosecutor's office that 
proceedings before a presiding official would prejudice the substantial 
interests of the Government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings 
based on the same facts as the suspension.
    (c) No bona fide dispute of material facts. The information, 
arguments, and documents submitted to the suspending official do not 
establish that there is a bona fide factual dispute regarding facts 
material to the suspension.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1038  Deciding a contest without additional fact-finding.

    (a) Written decision. The suspending official shall issue a written 
decision on the contest within 30 days after the record closes for 
submitting evidence, arguments, and information. The suspending official 
may extend this timeframe for good cause.
    (b) No further administrative review available. The suspending 
official's decision is final and is not subject to further 
administrative review.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1039  Cases where additional fact-finding is required.

    (a) Criteria for holding fact-finding proceeding. The debarring 
official shall request another OPM official (``presiding official'') to 
hold an additional fact-finding proceeding if:

[[Page 504]]

    (1) Facts material to the suspension have not been adjudicated in a 
prior due process proceeding; and
    (2) These facts are genuinely in dispute, based on the entire 
administrative record available to the debarring official.
    (b) Qualification to serve as presiding official. The presiding 
official is designated by the OPM Director or another OPM official 
authorized by the Director to make such designations. The presiding 
official shall be a senior official who is qualified to conduct informal 
adjudicative proceedings and who has had no previous contact with the 
suspension or the contest.
    (c) Effect on contest. The suspending official shall defer a final 
decision on the contest pending the results of the fact-finding 
proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1040  Conducting a fact-finding proceeding.

    (a) Informal proceeding. The presiding official may conduct the 
fact-finding proceedings as informally as practicable, consistent with 
principles of fundamental fairness. Specific rules of evidence or 
procedure do not apply to these proceedings.
    (b) Proceeding limited to disputed material facts. The presiding 
official shall consider only the genuinely disputed facts identified by 
the suspending official as relevant to the basis for the suspension. 
Matters that have been previously adjudicated or which are not in bona 
fide dispute within the record shall not be considered by the presiding 
official.
    (c) Right to present information, evidence, and arguments. A 
provider may appear before the presiding official with counsel, submit 
oral and written arguments and documentary evidence, present witnesses, 
question any witnesses testifying in support of the suspension, and 
challenge the accuracy of any other evidence that the agency offers as a 
basis for the suspension.
    (d) Record of proceedings. The presiding official shall make an 
audio recording of the proceedings and shall provide a copy to the 
provider at no charge. If the provider wishes to have a transcribed 
record, OPM shall arrange for production of one which may be purchased 
at cost.
    (e) Presiding official's findings. The presiding official shall 
resolve all of the disputed facts identified by the suspending official, 
on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence in the entire 
administrative record. Within 30 days after the record of the proceeding 
closes, the presiding official shall issue a written report of all 
findings of fact to the suspending official.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1041  Deciding a contest after a fact-finding proceeding.

    (a) Presiding official's findings shall be accepted. The suspending 
official shall accept the presiding official's findings, unless they are 
arbitrary, capricious, or clearly erroneous.
    (b) Suspending official's decision. Within 30 days after receiving 
the presiding official's report, the suspending official shall issue a 
final written decision that either sustains, modifies, or terminates the 
suspension. The suspending official may extend this period for good 
cause.
    (c) Effect on subsequent debarment or suspension proceedings. A 
decision by the suspending official to modify or terminate a suspension 
shall not prevent OPM from subsequently debarring the same provider, or 
any other Federal agency from either suspending or debarring the 
provider, based on the same facts.

                           Effect of Debarment


<R05>
Sec. 890.1042  Effective dates of debarments.

    (a) Minimum notice period. A debarment shall take effect not sooner 
than 30 days after the date of OPM's notice of proposed debarment, 
unless the debarring official specifically determines that the health or 
safety of covered individuals or the integrity of the FEHBP warrants an 
earlier effective date. In such a situation, the notice shall 
specifically inform the provider that the debarring official decided to 
shorten or eliminate the 30-day notice period.
    (b) Uncontested debarments. If a provider does not file a contest 
within the 30-day notice period, the proposed debarment shall take 
effect on the date stated in the notice of proposed debarment, without 
further procedures, actions, or notice by OPM.

[[Page 505]]

    (c) Contested debarments and requests for reducing the period of 
debarment. If a provider files a contest within the 30-day notice 
period, the proposed debarment shall not go into effect until the 
debarring official issues a final written decision, unless the health or 
safety of covered individuals or the integrity of the FEHBP requires the 
debarment to be effective while the contest is pending.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1043  Effect of debarment on a provider.

    (a) FEHBP payments prohibited. A debarred provider is not eligible 
to receive payment, directly or indirectly, from FEHBP funds for items 
or services furnished to a covered individual on or after the effective 
date of the debarment. Also, a provider shall not accept an assignment 
of a claim for items or services furnished to a covered individual 
during the period of debarment. These restrictions shall remain in 
effect until the provider is reinstated by OPM.
    (b) Governmentwide effect. Debarment precludes a provider from 
participating in all other Federal agencies' procurement and 
nonprocurement programs and activities, as required by section 2455 of 
the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-355). 
Other agencies may grant a waiver or exception under their own 
regulations, to permit a provider to participate in their programs, 
notwithstanding the OPM debarment.
    (c) Civil or criminal liability. A provider may be subject to civil 
monetary penalties under this subpart or criminal liability under other 
Federal statutes for knowingly filing claims, causing claims to be 
filed, or accepting payment from FEHBP carriers for items or services 
furnished to a covered individual during a period of debarment .

    Notifying Outside Parties About Debarment and Suspension Actions


<R05>
Sec. 890.1044  Entities notified of OPM-issued debarments and suspensions.

    When OPM debars or suspends a provider under this subpart, OPM shall 
notify:
    (a) All FEHBP carriers;
    (b) The General Services Administration, for publication in the 
comprehensive Governmentwide list of Federal agency exclusions;
    (c) Other Federal agencies that administer health care or health 
benefits programs; and
    (d) State and local agencies, authorities, boards, or other 
organizations with health care licensing or certification 
responsibilities.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1045  Informing persons covered by FEHBP about debarment or suspension of their provider.

    FEHBP carriers are required to notify covered individuals who have 
obtained items or services from a debarred or suspended provider within 
one year of the date of the debarment or suspension of:
    (a) The existence of the provider's debarment or suspension;
    (b) The minimum period remaining in the provider's period of 
debarment; and
    (c) The requirement that OPM terminate the debarment or suspension 
before FEHBP funds can be paid for items or services the provider 
furnishes to covered individuals.

                 Exceptions to the Effect of Debarments


<R05>
Sec. 890.1046  Effect of debarment or suspension on payments for services furnished in emergency situations.

    A debarred or suspended health care provider may receive FEHBP funds 
paid for items or services furnished on an emergency basis if the FEHBP 
carrier serving the covered individual determines that:
    (a) The provider's treatment was essential to the health and safety 
of the covered individual; and
    (b) No other source of equivalent treatment was reasonably 
available.

[69 FR 9920, Mar. 3, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 890.1047  Special rules for institutional providers.

    (a) Covered individual admitted before debarment or suspension. If a 
covered

[[Page 506]]

person is admitted as an inpatient before the effective date of an 
institutional provider's debarment or suspension, that provider may 
continue to receive payment of FEHBP funds for inpatient institutional 
services until the covered person is released or transferred, unless the 
debarring or suspending official terminates payments under paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (b) Health and safety of covered individuals. If the debarring or 
suspending official determines that the health and safety of covered 
persons would be at risk if they remain in a debarred or suspended 
institution, OPM may terminate FEHBP payments at any time.
    (c) Notice of payment limitations. If OPM limits any payment under 
paragraph (b) of this section, it must immediately send written notice 
of its action to the institutional provider.
    (d) Finality of debarring or suspending official's decision. The 
debarring or suspending official's decision to limit or deny payments 
under paragraph (b) of this section is not subject to administrative 
review or reconsideration.

[69 FR 9920, Mar. 3, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 890.1048  Waiver of debarment for a provider that is the sole source of health care services in a community.

    (a) Application required. A provider may apply for a limited waiver 
of debarment at any time after receiving OPM's notice of proposed 
debarment. Suspended providers are not eligible to request a waiver of 
suspension.
    (b) Criteria for granting waiver. To receive a waiver, a provider 
shall clearly demonstrate that:
    (1) The provider is the sole community provider or the sole source 
of essential specialized services in a community;
    (2) A limited waiver of debarment would be in the best interests of 
covered individuals in the defined service area;
    (3) There are reasonable assurances that the actions which formed 
the basis for the debarment shall not recur; and
    (4) There is no basis under this subpart for continuing the 
debarment.
    (c) Waiver applies only in the defined service area. A limited 
waiver applies only to items or services provided within the defined 
service area where a provider is the sole community provider or sole 
source of essential specialized services.
    (d) Governmentwide effect continues. A limited waiver applies only 
to a provider's FEHBP transactions. Even if OPM waives a debarment for 
FEHBP purposes, the governmentwide effect under section 2455 of the 
Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-355) continues 
for all other Federal agencies' procurement and nonprocurement programs 
and activities.
    (e) Waiver rescinded if circumstances change. OPM shall rescind the 
limited waiver when any of its underlying bases no longer apply. If OPM 
rescinds the limited waiver, the provider's debarment shall resume full 
effect for all FEHBP transactions. Events warranting rescission include, 
but are not limited to:
    (1) The provider ceases to furnish items or services in the defined 
service area;
    (2) Another provider begins to furnish equivalent items or services 
in the defined service area, so that the provider who received a waiver 
is no longer the sole provider or sole source; or
    (3) The actions that formed the basis for the provider's debarment, 
or similar acts, recur.
    (f) Effect on period of debarment. The minimum period of debarment 
is established when the debarment is initially imposed. A subsequent 
decision to grant, deny, or rescind a limited waiver shall not change 
that period.
    (g) Application is necessary for reinstatement. A provider who has 
received a limited waiver shall apply for reinstatement at the end of 
the debarment period, even if a limited waiver is in effect when the 
debarment expires.
    (h) Finality of debarring official's decision. The debarring 
official's decision to grant or deny a limited waiver is final and not 
subject to further administrative review or reconsideration.

              Special Exceptions To Protect Covered Persons


<R05>
Sec. 890.1049  Claims for non-emergency items or services furnished by a debarred or suspended provider.

    (a) Covered individual unaware of debarment or suspension. FEHBP 
funds may be paid for items or services furnished by a debarred or 
suspended provider if, at the time the items or services were furnished, 
the covered individual did not know, and could not reasonably be 
expected to have known, that the provider was debarred or suspended. 
This provision is intended solely to protect the interests of FEHBP-
covered persons who obtain services from a debarred or suspended 
provider in good faith and without knowledge that the provider has been 
sanctioned. It does not authorize debarred or suspended providers to 
submit claims for payment to FEHBP carriers.
    (b) Notice sent by carrier. When paying a claim under the authority 
of paragraph (a) of this section, an FEHBP carrier must send a written 
notice to the covered individual, stating:
    (1) That the provider is debarred or suspended and is prohibited 
from receiving payment of FEHBP funds for items or services furnished 
after the effective date of the debarment or suspension;
    (2) That claims may not be paid for items or services furnished by 
the debarred or suspended provider after the covered individual is 
informed of the debarment or suspension;
    (3) That the current claim is being paid as a legally-authorized 
exception to the effect of the debarment or suspension in order to 
protect covered individuals who obtain items or services without 
knowledge of their provider's debarment or suspension;
    (4) That FEHBP carriers are required to deny payment of any claim 
for items or services rendered by a debarred or suspended provider 15 
days or longer after the date of the notice described in paragraph (b) 
of this section, unless the covered individual had no knowledge of the 
provider's debarment or suspension when the items or services were 
rendered;
    (5) The minimum period remaining in the provider's debarment or 
suspension; and
    (6) That FEHBP funds cannot otherwise be paid to the provider until 
OPM terminates the debarment or suspension.

[69 FR 9920, Mar. 3, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 890.1050  Exception to a provider's debarment for an individual enrollee.

    (a) Request by a covered individual. Any individual enrolled in 
FEHBP may submit a request through their FEHBP carrier for continued 
payment of items or services furnished by a debarred provider to any 
person covered under the enrollment. Requests shall not be accepted for 
continued payments to suspended providers.
    (b) OPM action on the request. OPM shall consider the recommendation 
of the FEHBP carrier before acting on the request. To be approved, the 
request shall demonstrate that:
    (1) Interrupting an existing, ongoing course of treatment by the 
provider would have a detrimental effect on the covered individual's 
health or safety; or
    (2) The covered individual does not have access to an alternative 
source of the same or equivalent health care items or services within a 
reasonably accessible service area.
    (c) Scope of the exception. An approved exception applies only to 
the covered individual(s) who requested it, or on whose behalf it was 
requested. The governmentwide effect of the provider's debarment under 
section 2455 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (Pub. L. 103-
355) is not altered by an exception.
    (d) Provider requests not allowed. OPM shall not consider an 
exception request submitted by a provider on behalf of a covered 
individual.
    (e) Debarring official's decision is final. The debarring official's 
decision on an exception request is not subject to further 
administrative review or reconsideration.

                              Reinstatement


<R05>
Sec. 890.1051  Applying for reinstatement when period of debarment expires.

    (a) Application required. Reinstatement is not automatic when the 
minimum period of a provider's debarment expires. The provider shall 
apply in writing to OPM, supplying specific information about the 
reinstatement criteria outlined in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Reinstatement date. A debarred provider may submit a 
reinstatement application not earlier than 60 days before the nominal 
expiration date of the debarment. However, in no case shall OPM 
reinstate a provider before the minimum period of debarment expires.
    (c) Reinstatement criteria. To be approved, the provider's 
reinstatement application shall clearly demonstrate that:
    (1) There are reasonable assurances that the actions resulting in 
the provider's debarment have not recurred and will not recur;
    (2) There is no basis under this subpart for continuing the 
provider's debarment; and
    (3) There is no pending criminal, civil, or administrative action 
that would subject the provider to debarment by OPM.
    (d) Written notice of OPM action. OPM shall inform the provider in 
writing of its decision regarding the reinstatement application.
    (e) Limitation on reapplication. If OPM denies a provider's 
reinstatement application, the provider is not eligible to reapply for 1 
year after the date of the denial.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1052  Reinstatements without application.

    OPM shall reinstate a provider without a reinstatement application 
if:
    (a) Conviction reversed. The conviction on which the provider's 
debarment was based is reversed or vacated by a final decision of the 
highest appeals court with jurisdiction over the case; and the 
prosecutorial authority with jurisdiction over the case has declined to 
retry it, or the deadline for retrial has expired without action by the 
prosecutor.
    (b) Sanction terminated. A sanction imposed by another Federal 
agency, on which the debarment was based, is terminated by that agency.
    (c) Court order. A Federal court orders OPM to stay, rescind, or 
terminate a provider's debarment.
    (d) Written notice. When reinstating a provider without an 
application, OPM shall send the provider written notice of the basis and 
effective date of his reinstatement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 890.1054  Agencies and entities to be notified of reinstatements.

    OPM shall inform the FEHBP carriers, Government agencies and other 
organizations that were originally notified of a provider's debarment 
when a provider is reinstated under Sec. 890.1051 or Sec. 890.1052.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1055  Contesting a denial of reinstatement.

    (a) Obtaining reconsideration of the initial decision. A provider 
may contest OPM's decision to deny a reinstatement application by 
submitting documents and written arguments to the debarring official 
within 30 days of receiving the notice described in Sec. 890.1051(d). 
In addition, the provider

[[Page 509]]

may request to appear in person to present oral arguments to the 
debarring official. The provider may be accompanied by counsel when 
making a personal appearance.
    (b) Debarring official's final decision on reinstatement. The 
debarring official shall issue a final written decision, based on the 
entire administrative record, within 30 days after the record closes to 
receipt of information. The debarring official may extend the decision 
period for good cause.
    (c) Finality of debarring official's decision. The debarring 
official's final decision regarding a provider's reinstatement is not 
subject to further administrative review or reconsideration.

           Civil Monetary Penalties and Financial Assessments

    Source: 69 FR 9921, Mar. 3, 2004, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1060  Purpose and scope of civil monetary penalties and assessments.

    (a) Civil monetary penalty. A civil monetary penalty is an amount 
that OPM may impose on a health care provider who commits one of the 
violations listed in Sec. 890.1061. Penalties are intended to protect 
the integrity of FEHBP by deterring repeat violations by the same 
provider and by reducing the likelihood of future violations by other 
providers.
    (b) Assessment. An assessment is an amount that OPM may impose on a 
provider, calculated by reference to the claims involved in the 
underlying violations. Assessments are intended to recognize monetary 
losses, costs, and damages sustained by OPM as the result of a 
provider's violations.
    (c) Definitions. In Sec. Sec. 890.1060 through 890.1072:
    Penalty means civil monetary penalty; and
    Penalties and assessments may connote the singular or plural forms 
of either of those terms, and may represent either the conjunctive or 
disjunctive sense.
    (d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. In addition to 
imposing penalties and assessments, OPM may concurrently debar or 
suspend a provider from participating in the FEHBP on the basis of the 
same violations.
    (e) Relationship to other penalties provided by law. The penalties, 
assessments, debarment, and suspension imposed by OPM are in addition to 
any other penalties that may be prescribed by law or regulation 
administered by an agency of the Federal Government or any State.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1061  Bases for penalties and assessments.

    (a) Improper claims. OPM may impose penalties and assessments on a 
provider if a claim presented by that provider for payment from FEHBP 
funds meets the criteria set forth in 5 U.S.C. 8902a(d)(1).
    (b) False or misleading statements. OPM may impose penalties and 
assessments on a provider who makes a false statement or 
misrepresentation as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 8902a(d)(2).
    (c) Failing to provide claims-related information. OPM may impose 
penalties and assessments on a provider who knowingly fails to provide 
claims-related information as otherwise required by law.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1062  Deciding whether to impose penalties and assessments.

    (a) Authority of debarring official. The debarring official has 
discretionary authority to impose penalties and assessments in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8902a and this subpart.
    (b) Factors to be considered. In deciding whether to impose 
penalties and assessments against a provider that has committed one of 
the violations identified in Sec. 890.1061, OPM must consider:
    (1) The number and frequency of the provider's violations;
    (2) The period of time over which the violations were committed;
    (3) The provider's culpability for the specific conduct underlying 
the violations;
    (4) The nature of any claims involved in the violations and the 
circumstances under which the claims were presented to FEHBP carriers;
    (5) The provider's history of prior offenses or improper conduct, 
including any actions that could have constituted a basis for a 
suspension, debarment, penalty, or assessment by any Federal or State 
agency, whether or not any sanction was actually imposed;

[[Page 510]]

    (6) The monetary amount of any damages, losses, and costs, as 
described in Sec. 890.1064(c), attributable to the provider's 
violations; and
    (7) Such other factors as justice may require.
    (c) Additional factors when penalty or assessment is based on 
provisions of Sec. 890.1061(b) or (c). In the case of violations 
involving false or misleading statements or the failure to provide 
claims-related information, OPM must also consider:
    (1) The nature and circumstances of the provider's failure to 
properly report information; and
    (2) The materiality and significance of the false statements or 
misrepresentations the provider made or caused to be made, or the 
information that the provider knowingly did not report.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1063  Maximum amounts of penalties and assessments.

    OPM may impose penalties and assessments in amounts not to exceed 
those set forth in U.S.C. 8902a(d).


<R05>
Sec. 890.1064  Determining the amounts of penalties and assessments to be imposed on a provider.

    (a) Authority of debarring official. The debarring official has 
discretionary authority to set the amounts of penalties and assessments 
in accordance with law and this subpart.
    (b) Factors considered in determining amounts of penalties and 
assessments. In determining the amounts of penalties and assessments to 
impose on a provider, the debarring official must consider:
    (1) The Government's interests in being fully compensated for all 
damages, losses, and costs associated with the provider's violations, 
including:
    (i) Amounts wrongfully paid from FEHBP funds as the result of the 
provider's violations and interest on those amounts, at rates determined 
by the Department of the Treasury;
    (ii) All costs incurred by OPM in investigating a provider's 
sanctionable misconduct; and
    (iii) All costs incurred in OPM's administrative review of the case, 
including every phase of the administrative sanctions processes 
described by this subpart;
    (2) The Government's interests in deterring future misconduct by 
health care providers;
    (3) The provider's personal financial situation, or, in the case of 
an entity, the entity's financial situation;
    (4) All of the factors set forth in Sec. 890.1062(b) and (c); and
    (5) The presence of aggravating or less serious circumstances, as 
described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(7) of this section.
    (c) Aggravated and less serious circumstances. The presence of 
aggravating circumstances may cause OPM to impose penalties and 
assessments at a higher level within the authorized range, while less 
serious violations may warrant sanctions of relatively lower amounts. 
Paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(7) of this section provide examples of 
aggravated and less serious violations. These examples are illustrative 
only, and are not intended to represent an exhaustive list of all 
possible types of violations.
    (1) The existence of many separate violations, or of violations 
committed over an extended period of time, constitutes an aggravating 
circumstance. OPM may consider conduct involving a small number of 
violations, committed either infrequently or within a brief period of 
time, to be less serious.
    (2) Violations for which a provider had direct knowledge of the 
material facts (for example, submitting claims that the provider knew to 
contain false, inaccurate, or misleading information), or for which the 
provider did not cooperate with OPM's or an FEHBP carrier's 
investigations, constitute aggravating circumstances. OPM may consider 
violations where the provider did not have direct knowledge of the 
material facts, or in which the provider cooperated with post-violation 
investigative efforts, to be less serious.
    (3) Violations resulting in substantial damages, losses, and costs 
to OPM, the FEHBP, or FEHBP-covered persons constitute aggravating 
circumstances. Violations producing a small or negligible overall 
financial impact may be considered to be less serious.
    (4) A pattern of conduct reflecting numerous improper claims, high-
dollar

[[Page 511]]

false claims, or improper claims involving several types of items or 
services constitutes aggravating circumstances. OPM may consider a small 
number of improper claims for relatively low dollar amounts to be less 
serious.
    (5) Every violation involving any harm, or the risk of harm, to the 
health and safety of an FEHBP enrollee, must be considered an 
aggravating circumstance.
    (6) Any prior violation described in Sec. 890.1062(b)(5) 
constitutes an aggravating circumstance. OPM may consider repeated or 
multiple prior violations to represent an especially serious form of 
aggravating circumstances.
    (7) OPM may consider other circumstances or actions to be 
aggravating or less serious within the context of an individual case, as 
the interests of justice require.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1065  Deciding whether to suspend or debar a provider in a case that also involves penalties and assessments.

    In a case where both penalties and assessments and debarment are 
proposed concurrently, OPM must decide the proposed debarment under the 
same criteria and procedures as if it had been proposed separately from 
penalties and assessments.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1066  Notice of proposed penalties and assessments.

    (a) Written notice. OPM must inform a provider of proposed penalties 
and assessments by written notice, sent via certified mail with return 
receipt requested, to the provider's last known street or post office 
address. OPM may, at its discretion, use an express service that 
furnishes a verification of delivery instead of postal mail.
    (b) Statutory limitations period. OPM must send the notice to the 
provider within 6 years of the date on which the claim underlying the 
proposed penalties and assessments was presented to an FEHBP carrier. If 
the proposed penalties and assessments do not involve a claim presented 
for payment, OPM must send the notice within 6 years of the date of the 
actions on which the proposed penalties and assessments are based.
    (c) Contents of the notice. OPM's notice must contain, at a minimum:
    (1) The statement that OPM proposes to impose penalties and/or 
assessments against the provider;
    (2) Identification of the actions, conduct, and claims that comprise 
the basis for the proposed penalties and assessments;
    (3) The amount of the proposed penalties and assessments, and an 
explanation of how OPM determined those amounts;
    (4) The statutory and regulatory bases for the proposed penalties 
and assessments; and
    (5) Instructions for responding to the notice, including specific 
explanations regarding:
    (i) The provider's right to contest the imposition and/or amounts of 
penalties and assessments before they are formally imposed; and
    (ii) OPM's right, if the provider does not contest the proposed 
penalties and assessments within 30 days of the date he receives the 
notice, to implement them immediately without further administrative 
appeal or recourse.
    (d) Proposing debarment in the same notice. OPM may propose a 
provider's debarment in the same notice that also proposes penalties and 
assessments. In this case, the notice must also provide the elements of 
information required to appear in a notice of proposed debarment under 
Sec. 890.1006(b).
    (e) Procedures if the notice cannot be delivered. OPM must apply the 
provisions of Sec. 890.1006(f) if the notice of proposed penalties and 
assessments cannot be delivered as originally addressed.
    (f) Sending notice by electronic means. [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 890.1067  Provider contests of proposed penalties and assessments.

    (a) Contesting proposed sanctions. A provider may formally contest 
the proposed penalties and assessments by sending a written notice to 
the debarring official within 30 days after receiving the notice 
described in Sec. 890.1066. The debarring official must apply the 
administrative procedures set forth in Sec. Sec. 890.1069 and 890.1070 
to decide the contest.
    (b) Contesting debarments and financial sanctions concurrently. If 
OPM proposes

[[Page 512]]

debarment and penalties and assessments in the same notice, the provider 
may contest both the debarment and the financial sanctions in the same 
proceeding. If the provider pursues a combined contest, the requirements 
set forth in Sec. Sec. 890.1022 through 890.1024, as well as this 
section, apply.
    (c) Settling or compromising proposed sanctions. The debarring 
official may settle or compromise proposed sanctions at any time before 
issuing a final decision under Sec. 890.1070.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1068  Effect of not contesting proposed penalties and assessments.

    (a) Proposed sanctions may be implemented immediately. In the 
absence of a timely response by a provider as required in the notice 
described in Sec. 890.1066, the debarring official may issue a final 
decision implementing the proposed financial sanctions immediately, 
without further procedures.
    (b) Debarring official sends notice after implementing sanctions. 
Immediately upon issuing a final decision under paragraph (a), the 
debarring official must send the provider written notice, via certified 
return receipt mail or express delivery service, stating:
    (1) The amount of penalties and assessments imposed;
    (2) The date on which they were imposed; and
    (3) The means by which the provider may pay the penalties and 
assessments.
    (c) No appeal rights. A provider may not pursue a further 
administrative or judicial appeal of the debarring official's final 
decision implementing any sanctions if a timely contest was not filed in 
response to OPM's notice under Sec. 890.1066.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1069  Information the debarring official must consider in deciding a
provider's contest of proposed penalties and assessments.

    (a) Documentary material and written arguments. As part of a 
provider's contest, the provider must furnish a written statement of 
reasons why the proposed penalties and assessments should not be imposed 
and/or why the amounts proposed are excessive.
    (b) Mandatory disclosures. In addition to any other information 
submitted during the contest, the provider must inform the debarring 
official in writing of:
    (1) Any existing, proposed, or prior exclusion, debarment, penalty, 
assessment, or other sanction that was imposed by a Federal, State, or 
local government agency, including any administrative agreement that 
purports to affect only a single agency; and
    (2) Any current or prior criminal or civil legal proceeding that was 
based on the same facts as the penalties and assessments proposed by 
OPM.
    (c) In-person appearance. A provider may request a personal 
appearance (in person, by telephone conference, or through a 
representative) to provide testimony and oral arguments to the debarring 
official.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1070  Deciding contests of proposed penalties and assessments.

    (a) Debarring official reviews entire administrative record. After 
the provider submits the information and evidence authorized or required 
by Sec. 890.1069, the debarring official shall review the entire 
official record to determine if the contest can be decided without 
additional administrative proceedings, or if an evidentiary hearing is 
required to resolve disputed material facts.
    (b) Previously determined facts. Any facts relating to the basis for 
the proposed penalties and assessments that were determined in prior due 
process proceedings are binding on the debarring official in deciding 
the contest. ``Prior due process proceedings'' are those set forth in 
Sec. 890.1025(a)(1) through (4).
    (c) Deciding the contest without further proceedings. To decide the 
contest without further administrative proceedings, the debarring 
official must determine that:
    (1) The preponderance of the evidence in the administrative record 
as a whole demonstrates that the provider committed a sanctionable 
violation described in Sec. 890.1061; and
    (2) The evidentiary record contains no bona fide dispute of any fact 
material to the proposed financial sanction. A ``material fact'' is a 
fact essential to determining whether a provider committed a 
sanctionable violation for

[[Page 513]]

which penalties and assessments may be imposed.
    (d) Final decision without further proceedings. If the debarring 
official determines that paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section 
both apply, a final decision may be issued, imposing financial sanctions 
in amounts not exceeding those proposed in the notice to the provider 
described in Sec. 890.1066.
    (e) Insufficient evidence. If the debarring official determines that 
a preponderance of the evidence does not demonstrate that the provider 
committed a sanctionable violation described in Sec. 890.1061, the 
notice of proposed sanctions described in Sec. 890.1066 must be 
withdrawn.
    (f) Disputed material facts. If the debarring official determines 
that the administrative record contains a bona fide dispute about any 
fact material to the proposed sanction, he must refer the case for a 
fact-finding hearing to resolve the disputed fact or facts. The 
provisions of Sec. 890.1027(b) and (c), 890.1028, and 890.1029(a) and 
(b) will govern such a hearing.
    (g) Final decision after fact-finding hearing. After receiving the 
report of the fact-finding hearing, the debarring official must apply 
the provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section to reach 
a final decision on the provider's contest.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1071  Further appeal rights after final decision to impose penalties and assessments.

    If the debarring official's final decision imposes any penalties and 
assessments, the affected provider may appeal it to the appropriate 
United States district court under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
8902a(h)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 890.1072  Collecting penalties and assessments.

    (a) Agreed-upon payment schedule. At the time OPM imposes penalties 
and assessments, or the amounts are settled or compromised, the provider 
must be afforded the opportunity to arrange an agreed-upon payment 
schedule.
    (b) No agreed-upon payment schedule. In the absence of an agreed-
upon payment schedule, OPM must collect penalties and assessments under 
its regular procedures for resolving debts owed to the Employees Health 
Benefits Fund.
    (c) Offsets. As part of its debt collection efforts, OPM may request 
other Federal agencies to offset the penalties and assessments against 
amounts that the agencies may owe to the provider, including Federal 
income tax refunds.
    (d) Civil lawsuit. If necessary to obtain payment of penalties and 
assessments, the United States may file a civil lawsuit as set forth in 
5 U.S.C. 8902(i).
    (e) Crediting payments. OPM must deposit payments of penalties and 
assessments into the Employees Health Benefits Fund.

misconduct has been made.
    Qualifying event means any of the following events that qualify an 
individual for temporary continuation of coverage under subpart K of 
this part:
    (1) A separation from Government service.

from Federal service under any circumstances except an involuntary 
separation for gross misconduct.
    (2) Individuals whose coverage as children under the family

890.803(a) (1) or (3) of this part or the documentation requirements of 
Sec. 890.806(a) of this part, including former spouses who lose 
eligibility under subpart H within 36 months after termination of the 
marriage because they ceased meeting the requirement of Sec. 890.803(a) 
(1) or (3) of this part.
    (b) An individual who is otherwise eligible for benefits under this 
part (excluding the temporary extension of coverage and conversion 
privilege set forth in subpart D of this part) is not entitled to 
continued coverage under this subpart.

rights under this subpart no later than 30 days after the end of the 
temporary extension of coverage provided under Sec. 890.401.

information about temporary continuation of coverage. The written notice 
must include the child's name and address and the date of the 
terminating event.
    (2) If the notice described in paragraph (b)(1) is received by the 
employing office within 60 days after the date on which the child ceased 
meeting the requirements for being considered an unmarried dependent 
child, the employing office must notify the child of his or her rights 
under this subpart within 14 days after receiving the notice.
    (3) This paragraph does not preclude the employing office from 
notifying the child of his or her rights based on oral or written 
notification by the child, another family member, or any other source 
that the child no longer meets the requirements for being considered an 
unmarried dependent child.
    (c)(1) In the case of a former spouse who is eligible to elect 
temporary continuation of coverage under Sec. 890.1103(a)(3), the 
employee or the former spouse may, within 60 days after the termination 
of the marriage or the loss of coverage under subpart H of this part,

information about temporary continuation of coverage. The notice must 
include the name and address of the former spouse and the date of the 
terminating event.

rights under this subpart within 14 days after receiving the notice 
described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) If the employing office cannot give the notice required by this 
section to the employee, child, or former spouse directly, it must send 
the notice by first class mail. A notice that is mailed is deemed to be 
received 5 days after the date of the notice.

    (iii) If the employee, annuitant, or former spouse notified the 
employing office of the termination of the marriage within the time 
period specified in Sec. 890.1104(c)(1), the date the former spouse 
received the notice from the employing office described in Sec. 
890.1104(c)(2). If the employee, annuitant, or former spouse did not

claims, to the same extent and effect as though no break in coverage 
occurred.

Sec. 890.1108  Opportunities to change enrollment; effective dates.

    (a) Effective date--generally. Except as otherwise provided, a 
change of enrollment takes effect on the first day of the first pay 
period that begins after the date the employing office receives an 
appropriate request to change the enrollment.
    (b) Belated change of enrollment. When an employing office 
determines that an enrollee was unable, for cause beyond his or her 
control, to change the enrollment within the time limits prescribed by 
this section, the enrollee may do so within 60 days after the employing 
office advises the enrollee of its determination.
    (c) Change of enrollment by proxy. Subject to the discretion of the 
employing office, an enrollee's representative, having written 
authorization to do so, may change the enrollment for the enrollee.
    (d) Change to self only. (1) An enrollee may change the enrollment 
from self and family to self only at any time.
    (2) A change of enrollment to self only takes effect on the first 
day of the first pay period that begins after the date the employing 
office receives an appropriate request to change the enrollment, except 
that at the request of the enrollee and upon a showing satisfactory to 
the employing office that there was no family member eligible

[[Page 517]]

for coverage under the family enrollment, the employing office may make 
the change effective on the first day of the pay period following the 
one in which there was no family member.
    (e) Open season. (1) During an open season as provided by Sec. 
890.301(f), an enrollee (except for a former spouse who is eligible for 
continued coverage under Sec. 890.1103(a)(3)) may change the enrollment 
from self only to self and family, from one plan or option to another, 
or make any combination of these changes. A former spouse who is 
eligible for continued coverage under Sec. 890.1103(a)(3) may change 
from one plan or option to another, but may not change from self only to 
self and family unless the individual to be covered under the family 
enrollment qualifies as a family member under Sec. 890.1106(a)(2).
    (2) An open season change of enrollment takes effect on the first 
day of the first pay period that begins in January of the next following 
year.
    (3) When a belated open season change of enrollment is accepted by 
the employing office under paragraph (b) of this section, it takes 
effect as required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (f) Change in family status. (1) Except for a former spouse, an 
enrollee may change the enrollment from self only to self and family, 
from one plan or option to another, or make any combination of these 
changes when the enrollee's family status changes, including a change in 
marital status or any other change in family status. The enrollee must 
change the enrollment within the period beginning 31 days before the 
date of the change in family status, and ending 60 days after the date 
of the change in family status.
    (2) A former spouse who is covered under this section may change the 
enrollment from self only to self and family, from one plan or option to 
another, or make any combination of these changes within the period 
beginning 31 days before and ending 60 days after the birth or 
acquisition of a child who qualifies as a covered family member under 
Sec. 890.1106(a)(2).
    (3) A change of enrollment made in conjunction with the birth of a 
child, or the addition of a child as a new family member in some other 
manner, takes effect on the first day of the pay period in which the 
child is born or becomes an eligible family member.
    (g) Reenrollment of individuals who lose other coverage under this 
part. An individual whose continued coverage under this section 
terminates because of the provisions of Sec. 890.1110(a)(3) 
(termination due to other coverage under another provision of this part) 
may reenroll if the coverage that terminated the enrollment under this 
part ends, but not later than the expiration of the period described in 
Sec. 890.1107. Coverage does not extend beyond the expiration of the 
period described in Sec. 890.1107. The effective date of the 
reenrollment is the day following the termination of the coverage 
described in Sec. 890.1110(a)(3).
    (h) Loss of coverage under this part or under another group 
insurance plan. An enrollee may change the enrollment from self only to 
self and family, from one plan or option to another, or make any 
combination of these changes when the enrollee loses coverage under this 
part or a qualified family member of the enrollee loses coverage under 
this part or under another group health benefits plan. Except as 
otherwise provided, an enrollee must change the enrollment within the 
period beginning 31 days before the date of loss of coverage and ending 
60 days after the date of loss of coverage. Losses of coverage include, 
but are not limited to--
    (1) Loss of coverage under another FEHB enrollment due to the 
termination, cancellation, or change to self only, of the covering 
enrollment.
    (2) Loss of coverage under another federally-sponsored health 
benefits program.
    (3) Loss of coverage due to the termination of membership in an 
employee organization sponsoring or underwriting an FEHB plan.
    (4) Loss of coverage due to the discontinuance of an FEHB plan, in 
whole or in part. For an enrollee who loses coverage under this 
paragraph (h)(4)--
    (i) If the discontinuance is at the end of a contract year, the 
enrollee must change the enrollment during the open season, unless OPM 
establishes a different time. If the discontinuance is at

[[Page 518]]

a time other than the end of the contract year, OPM must establish a 
time and effective date for the enrollee to change the enrollment.
    (ii) If the whole plan is discontinued, an enrollee who does not 
change the enrollment within the time set is considered to have 
cancelled the plan in which enrolled.
    (iii) If a plan has two options, and one option of the plan is 
discontinued, an enrollee who does not change the enrollment is 
considered to be enrolled in the remaining option of the plan.
    (5) Loss of coverage under the Medicaid program or similar State-
sponsored program of medical assistance for the needy.
    (6) Loss of coverage under a non-Federal health plan.
    (i) Move from comprehensive medical plan's area. An enrollee in a 
comprehensive medical plan who moves or becomes employed outside the 
geographic area from which the plan accepts enrollments, or, if already 
outside this area, moves or becomes employed further from this area, may 
change the enrollment upon notifying the employing office of the move or 
change of place of employment. Similarly, an enrollee whose covered 
family member moves outside the geographic area from which the plan 
accepts enrollments, or if already outside this area, moves further from 
this area, may change the enrollment upon notifying the employing office 
of the family member's move. The change of enrollment takes effect on 
the first day of the pay period that begins after the employing office 
receives an appropriate request.
    (j) On becoming eligible for Medicare. An enrollee may change the 
enrollment from one plan or option to another at any time beginning on 
the 30th day before becoming eligible for coverage under title XVIII of 
the Social Security Act (Medicare). A change of enrollment based on 
becoming eligible for Medicare may be made only once.

Sec. 890.1109  Premium payments.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
enrollee must pay the full enrollment charge as determined under Sec. 
890.503(a), including both the Government contributions and employee 
withholdings, plus the administrative charge described under Sec. 
890.1113, for every pay period during which the enrollment continues, 
exclusive of the 31-day temporary extension of coverage for conversion 
provided under Sec. 890.401 of this part.
    (b) If the enrollee is not covered under this subpart for the full 
pay period, he or she pays the premium charge for only the days actually 
covered. The daily premium rate is an amount equal to the monthly rate 
(including the administrative charge) multiplied by 12 and divided by 
365.
    (c) The enrollee must make the payment after the pay period during 
which he or she is covered in accordance with a schedule established by 
the employing office. If the employing office does not receive the 
payment by the date due, the employing office must notify the enrollee 
in writing that continuation of coverage depends upon payment being made 
within 15 days (45 days for enrollees residing overseas) after receipt 
of the notice. If no subsequent payments are made, the employing office 
terminates the enrollment 60 days (90 days for enrollees residing 
overseas) after the date of the notice. An enrollee whose coverage 
terminates because of nonpayment may not reenroll or reinstate coverage 
except as provided under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d)(1) If the enrollee was prevented by circumstances beyond his or 
her control from making payment within the timeframe specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section, he or she may request reinstatement of 
coverage by writing to the employing office. The request must be filed 
within 30 calendar days from the date of termination and must be 
accompanied by verification that the enrollee was prevented by 
circumstances beyond his or her control from paying within the time 
limit.
    (2) The employing office determines whether the individual is 
eligible for reinstatement of coverage. If the determination is 
affirmative, coverage is reinstated retroactively to the date of 
termination. If the determination is negative, the individual may 
request a

any, are not entitled to the temporary extension of coverage for 
conversion or to convert to an individual contract for health benefits.
    (c) Cancellation. An enrollee may cancel his or her enrollment as 
provided under Sec. 890.304(d) of this part.

Sec. 890.1111  Employing office responsibilities.

    (a) Providing information to employees. Employing offices are 
responsible for providing employees who are eligible to enroll under 
this part with literature developed by OPM that sets forth their rights 
under this subpart. This literature must be distributed to employees 
prior to each open season occurring under Sec. 890.301.
    (b) Administration of the enrollment process. The employing office 
must establish procedures for notifying the former employee, child, or 
former spouse about his or her eligibility to enroll, including what 
documents are needed to determine eligibility, and for accepting 
enrollment registrations.
    (c) Collecting premiums. (1) Collection of the contributions is the 
responsibility of the employing office of the employee or annuitant at 
the time of the qualifying event.
    (2) The employing office must submit all premium payments collected 
from enrollees along with its regular health benefits payments to OPM in 
accordance with procedures established by that Office.
    (d) Health benefits file. The employing office must maintain a 
health benefits file for the enrollee as a file separate from the 
personnel records of the employee or former employee. This file may be

<R05>
Sec. 890.1112  Denial of continuation of coverage due to involuntary 
separation for gross misconduct.

    (a) Notice of denial. (1) When an employing office determines that 
the offense for which an employee is being removed constitutes gross 
misconduct for the purpose of this subpart, the employing office must 
notify the employee in writing of its intention to deny temporary 
continuation of coverage. The notice must set forth the reason for the 
denial and give the employee a reasonable amount of time to respond. The 
notice must be made no later than the date of separation.
    (2) If the employee is being removed under the authority of part 752 
of this chapter (or other law, Executive Order, or regulation that 
prescribes procedures for removing employees because of misconduct), the 
notification requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be 
combined with the notification requirement of such authority.
    (b) Employee's response. (1) The employee must be allowed a 
reasonable time for response, but not less than 7 days. The employee may 
respond orally

[[Page 520]]

or in writing and is entitled to be represented by an attorney or other 
representative.
    (2) The agency must designate an official to hear the employee's 
oral answer who has the authority either to make or recommend a final 
decision on the denial. The right to answer orally does not include the 
right to a formal hearing with examination of witnesses.
    (c) Final decision. If the employee responds to the notice of 
denial, the employing office must issue a final decision in writing that 
fully sets forth its findings and conclusions. The agency's decision is 
not subject to reconsideration by OPM.
    (d) Resignation in lieu of involuntary separation. If an employee 
resigns after receiving the employing office's notification of intent to 
separate the employee involuntarily but before the scheduled separation 
date, his or her separation is considered involuntary for the purpose of 
this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1113  The administrative charge.

    (a) OPM has determined that the administrative charge as provided 
under 5 U.S.C. 8905a(d)(1)(A)(ii) is 2 percent of the enrollment charge 
described in Sec. 890.503(a).
    (b) It is OPM's responsibility to establish procedures for receiving 
the administrative payment into the Employees Health Benefits Fund and 
for making this amount available to the employing office.

Sec. 890.1205  Change in type of enrollment.

    (a) Individuals covered under this subpart or eligible survivors 
enrolled under this subpart may change from self only to self and family 
coverage if they acquire an eligible family member. The change may be 
made at the written request of the enrollee at any time after the family 
member is acquired. A change in enrollment under this paragraph becomes 
effective on the 1st day of the pay period after the pay period during 
which the request is received by the U.S. Department of State, except

is lost and it becomes effective on the 1st day of the pay period after 
the pay period during which the request is received by the U.S. 
Department of State.

which it is received by the U.S. Department of State.
    (b) An individual who cancels his or her coverage under this section 
cannot reacquire coverage unless the U.S. Department of State determines 
that it would be against equity and good conscience not to allow the 
individual to be enrolled.
    (c) A cancellation of coverage must be made by the enrolled 
individual and cannot be made by a representative acting on the 
individual's behalf.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1207  Termination of coverage.

                      Program Demonstration Project

    Source: 65 FR 35260, June 2, 2000, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1301  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to implement section 721 of the 
National Defense Authorization Act for 1999, Public Law 105-261. This 
section amended chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, and chapter 
89 of title 5, United States Code, to establish a demonstration project 
under which certain Medicare and other eligible Department of Defense 
(DoD) beneficiaries can enroll in health benefit plans offered under the 
Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program in certain geographic 
areas. The legislation was signed into law on October 17, 1998. The 
demonstration project will run for a period of three years. The 
legislation requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and DoD to 
jointly produce and submit two reports to Congress designed to assess 
the viability of expanding access to the FEHB Program to certain 
Medicare and other eligible DoD beneficiaries permanently. OPM is 
authorizing certain differences from regular FEHB Program practices in 
order to ensure the successful implementation of the demonstration 
project. This regulation authorizes those differences.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1302  Duration.

    The demonstration project will run from January 1, 2000, through 
December 31, 2002.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1303  Eligibility.

    (a) To enroll in the demonstration project, an individual must live 
within one of the demonstration areas and meet the definition of an 
eligible beneficiary in 10 U.S.C. 1108(b). An eligible beneficiary under 
this subpart is--
    (1) A member or former member of the uniformed services described in 
section 1074(b) of title 10, United States Code, who is entitled to 
hospital insurance benefits under part A of title

[[Page 523]]

XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395c et seq.);
    (2) An individual who is an unremarried former spouse of a member or 
former member described in section 1072(2)(F) or section 1072(2)(G) of 
title 10, United States Code;
    (3) An individual who is--
    (i) A dependent of a deceased member or former member described in 
section 1076(b) or 1076(a)(2)(B) of title 10, United States Code, or of 
a member who died while on active duty for a period of more than 30 
days; and
    (ii) A ``member of family'' as defined in section 8901(5) of title 
5, United States Code; or
    (4) An individual who is--
    (i) A dependent of a living member or former member described in 
section 1076(b)(1) of title 10, United States Code, who is entitled to 
hospital insurance benefits under part A of title XVIII of the Social 
Security Act, regardless of the member's or former member's eligibility 
for such hospital insurance benefits; and
    (ii) A ``member of family'' as defined in section 8901(5) of title 
5, United States Code.
    (b) An eligible beneficiary may enroll in an FEHB plan under chapter 
89 of title 5, United States Code, for self-only coverage or for self 
and family coverage. A self and family enrollment will include coverage 
of a dependent of the military member or former member who meets the 
definition of a ``member of family'' in section 8901(5) of title 5, 
United States Code. A self and family enrollment will not cover a person 
related to the eligible beneficiary that does not qualify as a ``member 
of family'' (as defined in section 8901(5) of title 5, United States 
Code) of the military member or former member.
    (c) A person eligible for coverage under this subpart shall not be 
required to satisfy any eligibility criteria specified in chapter 89 of 
title 5, United States Code, or in other subparts of this part (except 
as provided in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (b) of this section) as a 
condition for enrollment in health benefit plans offered through the 
FEHB Program under the demonstration project.
    (d) When determining whether an individual is a ``member of family'' 
under section 8901(5) of title 5, United States Code, for purposes of 
paragraph (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section, a DoD member or former 
member described in section 1076(b) or 1076(a)(2)(B) of title 10, United 
States Code, shall be deemed to be an employee under chapter 89 of title 
5, United States Code. The sole purpose for deeming these members or 
former members of the uniformed services employees under chapter 89 of 
title 5, United States Code, is to determine which of their dependents 
can enroll as eligible beneficiaries in the demonstration project.
    (e) A person who is eligible to enroll in the FEHB Program as an 
employee as defined in section 8901(1) of title 5, United States Code, 
is not eligible to enroll in an FEHB plan under the demonstration 
project.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1304  Enrollment.

    (a) Open Season for eligible beneficiaries will be held concurrent 
with the Open Season for regular FEHB enrollees. Open Seasons will be 
held in the years 1999, 2000 and 2001. Eligible beneficiaries will be 
able to enroll for coverage, change enrollment tiers (e.g., self-only or 
self and family), or change health benefit plans or plan options during 
these periods.
    (b) Enrolled eligible beneficiaries are required to pay associate 
membership dues if they enroll in open employee organization sponsored 
plans that are participating in the demonstration project.
    (c) DoD will deny enrollment of eligible beneficiaries when the 
total number of eligible beneficiaries and family members enrolled in 
the demonstration project reaches 66,000.
    (d) Eligible beneficiaries can enroll only in health plans offered 
by health benefit carriers who are participating in the demonstration 
project.
    (e) Eligible beneficiaries and family members enrolled in the 
demonstration project are not eligible to obtain services from military 
medical treatment facilities or to enroll in a health care plan under 
the TRICARE Program.
    (f) An eligible beneficiary enrolled in an FEHB plan under the 
demonstration project may change health benefits

[[Page 524]]

plans and coverage in the same manner as any other FEHB Program 
enrollee, except as provided for in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1305  Termination and cancellation.

    (a) If an enrolled eligible beneficiary moves out of a demonstration 
area, the enrollment of the eligible beneficiary and all family members 
will be terminated. If an enrolled eligible beneficiary moves to an area 
located within a demonstration area, he or she will continue to be 
eligible to participate in the demonstration project. If the eligible 
beneficiary was enrolled prior to the move in an HMO that does not serve 
the new demonstration area, the eligible beneficiary will have an 
opportunity to select a new health plan offered by a carrier 
participating in the demonstration project in the new area. If the 
eligible beneficiary was enrolled in a fee-for-service plan prior to the 
move and moves to another area that is within an existing demonstration 
area, the eligible beneficiary can maintain his or her current coverage.
    (b) If an enrolled eligible beneficiary disenrolls, cancels, or 
terminates enrollment for any reason, he or she will not be eligible to 
reenroll in the demonstration project. Once coverage ends, eligible 
beneficiaries and all family members have the right to resume all of the 
benefits to which they are entitled to under title 10 of the United 
States Code. Medicare-covered eligible beneficiaries and their eligible 
family members who had Medigap policies prior to their enrollment in the 
demonstration project are entitled to reinstate that coverage under the 
conditions stated in section 1108(l) of title 10, United States Code.
    (c) Eligible beneficiaries and their family members are eligible for 
Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) under the conditions and for 
the durations described in subpart K or until the end of the 
demonstration project, whichever occurs first. The effective date of TCC 
for eligible beneficiaries or their eligible family members will be the 
day after other coverage under this subpart ends. Eligible beneficiaries 
or their eligible family members selecting TCC must enroll in a health 
plan offered by a carrier participating in the demonstration project. If 
an eligible beneficiary or eligible family member enrolled in DoD TCC 
moves from a demonstration project area, coverage ends. DoD TCC 
enrollees will be responsible for paying the entire DoD premium rate 
(OPM's approved net-to-carrier DoD rate plus 4 percent for contingency 
and administration reserves) plus 2 percent of this premium rate for 
administration of the program. DoD will make arrangements to collect 
premiums plus the 2 percent administrative charge from eligible 
beneficiaries and forward them to OPM's Employees Health Benefits Fund. 
OPM will establish procedures for receiving the 2 percent administrative 
payment into the Employees Health Benefits Fund and making this amount 
available to DoD for administration of the program.
    (d) Enrolled eligible beneficiaries are not eligible for the 
temporary extension of coverage and conversion opportunities described 
in subpart D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1306  Government premium contributions.

    The Secretary of Defense is responsible for the government 
contribution for enrolled eligible beneficiaries and family members. The 
government contribution toward demonstration project premium rates will 
be determined in accordance with subpart E of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 890.1307  Data collection.

    Each carrier will compile, maintain, and when requested by OPM or 
DoD, report data on its plan's experience necessary to produce reports 
containing the following information and analysis:
    (a) The number of eligible beneficiaries who elect to participate in 
the demonstration project.
    (b) The number of eligible beneficiaries who elected to participate 
in the demonstration project and did not have Medicare Part B coverage 
before electing to participate.
    (c) The costs of health benefits charges and the costs (direct and 
indirect) of administering the benefits and services provided to 
eligible beneficiaries who elect to participate in the demonstration 
project as compared to

[[Page 525]]

similarly situated enrollees in the FEHB Program.

<R05>
Sec. 891.104  Responsibilities of retirement offices.

    (a) The Office of Worker's Compensation Program is responsible only 
for retired employees who are receiving compensation from the Office and 
is responsible even though the retired employee has retired under 
another retirement office from which he/she is not currently receiving 
annuity. If the retired employee is currently receiving annuity from 
another retirement office, that retirement office, rather than the 
Office of Worker's Compensation Program, will have the responsibilities 
imposed on retirement offices by this part for that retired employee.
    (b) Retirement offices are responsible, in accordance with 
regulations and instructions issued by OPM, for withholding from the 
annuity or compensation of each retired employee within the jurisdiction 
of the retirement office who elects to subscribe to the uniform plan 
his/her share of the cost, for forwarding the amount withheld to the 
Retired Federal Employees Health Benefits Fund, and for reporting to OPM 
amounts required for Government contribution for these retired 
employees.
    (c) Retirement offices are responsible, in accordance with 
regulations and instructions issued by OPM, for reporting to OPM amounts 
required for Government contributions to retired employees within the 
jurisdiction of the retirement office who have elected to receive a 
Government contribution toward the cost of a private health benefits 
plan, and for paying the Government contributions to these retired 
employees.
    (d) Retirement offices are responsible for advising retired 
employees within the jurisdiction of the retirement office of the rights 
and obligations of retired employees under this part.
    (e) When one or more of the family members is a child 19 years of 
age or older who is incapable of self-support because of mental or 
physical disability which existed before the child became 19 years of 
age, the appropriate retirement office shall obtain the necessary 
evidence and make a determination of incapacity.
    (f) Retirement offices are responsible, in accordance with 
regulations and instructions issued by OPM, for verifying continuing 
eligibility of retired employees to receive Government contributions.


<R05>
Sec. 891.105  Correction of errors.

    OPM may order correction of administrative errors at any time upon a 
showing satisfactory to OPM that it would be against equity and good 
conscience not to do so.

[45 FR 23637, Apr. 8, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 891.106  Reconsideration.

    (a) Who may file. A retired employee may request OPM to reconsider 
its initial decision that he/she is not eligible to make an election or 
to receive a Government contribution under the

[[Page 529]]

part or that he/she may not enroll another individual as a family 
member.
    (b) Initial OPM decision. An OPM decision shall be considered an 
initial decision as used in Sec. 891.106(a) of this part, when rendered 
by OPM in writing and stating the right to reconsideration. However, a 
decision initially rendered at the highest level of review available 
within OPM will not be subject to reconsideration.
    (c) Reconsideration. A request for reconsideration must be made in 
writing, must include the claimant's name, address, date of birth, claim 
number, if appropriate, and reasons for the request.
    (d) Time limit. A request for reconsideration of an initial OPM 
decision must be filed within 30 calendar days from the date of OPM's 
initial decision. OPM may extend the time limit on filing when the 
individual shows that he/she was not notified of the time limit and was 
not otherwise aware of it, or that he/she was prevented by circumstances 
beyond his/her control from making the request within the time limit.
    (e) Final decision. After reconsideration, OPM shall issue a final 
decision which shall be in writing and shall fully set forth the 
findings and conclusions of OPM.

[45 FR 23637, Apr. 8, 1980]


<R04>
                Subpart B_Election and Change of Election


<R05>
Sec. 891.201  Election.

    (a) The original period for election by each eligible retired 
employee was during the months of March and April 1961. Failure to elect 
when eligible to do so is deemed an election not to participate in the 
program unless the failure is determined by the retirement office to be 
for cause beyond the control of the retired employee. In any case in 
which annuity or compensation is being paid to a payee in behalf of a 
retired employee, the payee shall make the election for the retired 
employee.
    (b) (1) A retired employee may elect to participate in the program 
for self alone or for self and family.
    (2) Survivors, if actually or constructively living in the same 
household, have only one right of election among them. The election 
shall be made by the payee. The fact that one payee is receiving annuity 
or compensation for all members of the family is prima facie evidence 
that they are living in the same household. The existence of more than 
one payee is prima facie evidence that each payee and the survivors in 
whose behalf the payee is receiving annuity or compensation constitute a 
separate household, and each payee may elect for the survivors in whose 
behalf he is receiving annuity or compensation, but where a family is 
receiving annuity or compensation through more than one payee, one 
payee, with the consent of the other payees, may elect for the whole 
family.
    (3) A retired employee may not be covered under more than one 
election.
    (4) A retired employee who is entitled to more than one annuity or 
to compensation and annuity is entitled to only one election.
    (c) Each retired employee who elects to receive a Government 
contribution toward the cost of a private health benefits plan shall 
file with his election a certificate of the carrier, on the form 
prescribed by OPM for the purpose, that he is a subscriber to a health 
benefits plan. OPM, or the appropriate retirement office, at any time 
may require that a retired employee renew the certificate, or may take 
such other action as it considers desirable to verify the continuing 
eligibility of the retired employee to receive a Government 
contribution. The appropriate retirement office may suspend the 
Government contribution when there is a reasonable doubt of the retired 
employee's continuing eligibility to receive the Government 
contribution.
    (d) In the discretion of the retirement office, a representative of 
the retired employee having a written authorization to do so may elect 
for him.
    (e) A person who was not eligible, during the months of March and 
April 1961, to elect to subscribe to the uniform plan or to receive a 
Government contribution toward the cost of a private health benefits 
plan, may apply to the appropriate retirement office when he becomes 
eligible. If the retirement office determines that he is eligible, it 
shall notify the retired employee that

[[Page 530]]

he is eligible to make an election in accordance with paragraphs (a) to 
(d) of this section within 60 days of the date of the notice. If the 
retirement office determines that a retired employee was unable, for 
cause beyond his control, to make an election within the time limits 
prescribed by this section, it shall notify the retired employee that he 
is eligible to make an election in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) 
of this section within 60 days of the date of the notice. Elections made 
under this paragraph are effective, for a retired employee receiving 
annuity and a survivor receiving compensation, on the first day of the 
third month following the month in which the retirement office receives 
the election. Withholdings and contributions are effective for months 
beginning on and after the first day of the second month following the 
month in which the retirement office receives the election. For any 
other retired employee receiving compensation, changes of election made 
under this paragraph are effective on the first day of the third 4-week 
period following the 4-week period in which the Bureau of Employees' 
Compensation receives the election, and withholdings and contributions 
are effective beginning with the second 4-week period following receipt 
of the election. This paragraph does not apply to retired employees who 
have been, at any time, covered by the election of another under this 
part.
    (f) Retired employees and survivors who, on January 1, 1973, were 
enrolled for either basic coverage only or major medical coverage only 
of the Uniform Plan are, effective January 1, 1973, automatically 
enrolled in basic plus major medical coverage of the Uniform Plan.

[33 FR 12516, Sept. 4, 1968, as amended at 37 FR 20845, Dec. 20, 1972]


<R05>

                  Subpart C_Suspension and Termination


<R05>
Sec. 891.301  Suspension and termination.

    (a) When used in this section, ``month'' includes the 4-week period 
for which a retired employee (other than a survivor) receives 
compensation.
    (b) When compensation is entirely suspended or annuity is entirely 
waived or suspended, Government contributions are suspended. If the 
election is to subscribe to the uniform plan, and the annuity or 
compensation is suspended, or the annuity is waived to the extent that 
the retired employee's share of the cost cannot be withheld, 
withholdings and Government contributions are suspended, but the 
subscription continues.
    (c) If the waiver or suspension covers 3 months or less, Government 
contributions and withholdings for the period of waiver or suspension 
shall be made when annuity payment is resumed. If the waiver or 
suspension covers more than 3 months, the retired employee's election is 
terminated effective at the end of the third month of waiver or 
suspension. A terminated election is renewed when annuity or 
compensation payment is resumed. When a terminated election is renewed 
pursuant to this paragraph, withholdings and Government contributions 
shall be made for the first 3 months of the waiver or suspension. 
Withholdings and Government contributions shall be made for annuity or 
compensation accruing after the election is renewed.
    (d) If title of a retired employee to annuity or compensation is 
terminated, his eligibility under this part is terminated.
    (e) If the eligibility of a retired employee is terminated and other 
members of the same family continue to be eligible under this part, the 
election of the former retired employee continues for the remainder of 
the family unless and until changed in accordance with Sec. 891.202.

enroll for self-only in the uniform plan.
    (3) Each month, an amount equal to twice the current monthly premium 
paid by an individual for supplementary medical insurance under title 
XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare) for such month shall be paid

retirement office, for each retired employee or survivor who:
    (i) Is in receipt of an annuity for such month;

    (4) Each month, an amount equal to twice the current monthly premium 
paid by an individual for supplementary medical insurance under title 
XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare) for such month shall be 
contributed, by the Office of Personnel Management, for each retired 
employee or survivor who is in receipt of annuity and who has elected to 
enroll for self and family in the uniform plan.
    (b) For retired employees and survivors receiving compensation. (1) 
For each retired employee or survivor who is in receipt of compensation 
and who meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, 
other than the requirement of being in receipt of an annuity, the Office 
of Personnel Management shall contribute, through the Office of Workers' 
Compensation Programs, an amount equal to 93\1/3\ percent of the current 
monthly premium paid by an individual for supplementary medical 
insurance under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare) 
rounded to the nearest cent, counting one-half cent and over as a whole 
cent, for each 4-week period in which payment of such compensation is

individual for supplementary medical insurance under title XVIII of the 
Social Security Act (Medicare) rounded to the nearest cent, counting

compensation is made.
    (4) For each retired employee or survivor who is receiving 
compensation and has elected to enroll for self and family in the 
uniform plan, the Office of Personnel Management shall contribute, 
during each 4-week period in which payment of such compensation

[[Page 533]]

is made, an amount equal to 186\2/3\ percent of the current monthly 
premium paid by an individual for supplementary insurance under title 
XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare) rounded to the nearest cent, 
counting one-half cent and over as a whole cent.
    (5) If the current monthly rate for supplementary medical insurance 
under Medicare changes to a new rate within a 4-week period in which 
compensation is paid, the amount to be contributed for that 4-week 
period will be a prorated amount determined by:
    (i) Multiplying the number of days in the 4-week pay period 
occurring at the former monthly rate (the rate in effect at the 
beginning of the pay period) by the former rate for a 4-week pay period;
    (ii) Multiplying the number of days in the 4-week pay period 
occurring at the new rate (the rate in effect at the end of the 4-week 
pay period) by the new 4-week rate;
    (iii) Adding the products of paragraphs (b)(5) (i) and (ii) of this 
section; and
    (iv) Dividing the sum by 28 and rounding to the nearest cent,

of annuity or compensation for the month or pay period immediately 
preceding the month or pay period for which the Government contribution 
is due.

may withhold from his or her annuity or compensation his or her share of 
the cost of the plan, as provided by this part.

Health Benefits Fund two percent of the total Government contribution

<R05>
Sec. 892.102  What is premium conversion and how does it work?

    Premium conversion is a method of reducing your taxable income by 
the amount of your contribution to your FEHB insurance premium. If you 
are a participant in the premium conversion plan, Section 125 of the 
Internal Revenue Code allows you to reduce your salary (through an 
employer allotment) and provide that portion of your salary back to your 
employer. Instead of being paid to you as taxable income, this allotted 
amount is used to purchase your FEHB insurance for you. The effect is 
that your taxable income is reduced. Because taxable income is reduced, 
the amount of tax you pay is reduced. You save on Federal income tax, 
Social Security and Medicare tax and in most States and localities, 
State and local income taxes.


<R05>
Sec. 892.103  What can I do if I disagree with my agency's decision about my pre-or post-tax election?

    You may use the reconsideration procedure set out at Sec. Sec. 
890.104 of this chapter to request an agency to reconsider its initial 
decision affecting your participation in the premium conversion plan.


<R04>
                 Subpart B_Eligibility and Participation


<R05>
Sec. 892.201  Who is covered by the premium conversion plan?

    (a) All employees in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government 
who are participating in the FEHB Program (as described in 5 U.S.C. 
8901), and whose pay is issued by an agency of the Executive Branch of 
the Federal Government, are automatically covered by the premium 
conversion plan. Certain reemployed annuitants may be considered 
employees for purposes of premium conversion, as described in subpart D 
of this part.
    (b) Employees of organizations that have established a premium 
conversion plan under separate authority prior to October 2000 may not 
participate in the premium conversion plan described here because they 
are already covered by their employing agency's plan.
    (c) Individuals enrolled in FEHB who are not employees of the 
Executive Branch of the Federal government or are not employees of the 
Federal government, will be covered by the premium conversion plan if 
their employer signs an adoption agreement that is accepted by OPM.
    (d) Individuals enrolled in FEHB who are appointed by an agency in 
the Executive Branch, but whose pay is not issued by that agency, will 
be covered by the premium conversion plan if the entity that makes their 
FEHB contribution signs an adoption agreement that is accepted by OPM.
    (e) Individuals may waive premium conversion by filing a waiver form 
with their employer in accordance with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 892.202  Are retirees eligible for the premium conversion plan?

    No, only current employees who are enrolled in the FEHB Program are 
covered by the premium conversion plan. Former employees are not 
eligible. If you are a reemployed annuitant, see subpart D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 892.203  When will my premium conversion begin?

    If you are newly employed or newly eligible for FEHB in a covered 
Executive Branch agency (as described in Sec. 892.201(a)), your salary 
reduction (through a Federal allotment) and pre-tax benefit will be 
effective on the 1st day of the first pay period beginning on or after 
your employing agency receives your enrollment.

[68 FR 56528, Oct. 1, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 892.204  How do I waive participation in premium conversion before the benefit first becomes effective?

    You must file a waiver form by the date set by your employing 
office, but not later than the day before the effective date of 
coverage. The waiver form is available from your employing office.


<R05>
Sec. 892.205  May I waive participation in premium conversion after the initial implementation?

    Yes, but the opportunity to waive premium conversion is limited. You 
may waive premium conversion:
    (a) During the annual FEHB open season. The effective date of the 
waiver

[[Page 537]]

will be the first day of the first pay period that begins in the 
following calendar year;
    (b) At the same time as you sign up for FEHB when first hired or 
hired as a reemployed annuitant. Employees who leave Federal service and 
are rehired after a three-day break in service or in a different 
calendar year also may waive;
    (c) In conjunction with a change in FEHB enrollment, on account of 
and consistent with a qualifying life event (see Sec. 892.101); or
    (d) When you have a qualifying life event and the waiver is on 
account of and consistent with that qualifying life event (even if you 
do not change your FEHB enrollment). You have 60 days after the 
qualifying life event to file a waiver with your employer. The waiver is 
effective on the first day of the pay period following the date your 
employer receives the waiver.


<R05>
Sec. 892.206  Can I cancel my waiver and participate in premium conversion?

    Yes, you may cancel a waiver and participate in premium conversion 
if:
    (a) You have a qualifying life event; the change in FEHB coverage is 
consistent with the qualifying life event; and you complete an election 
form to participate in premium conversion within 60 days after the 
qualifying life event; or
    (b) You cancel your waiver during an open season, including an 
extended open season authorized by OPM.


<R05>
Sec. 892.207  Can I make changes to my FEHB enrollment while I am participating in premium conversion?

    (a) Subject to the exceptions described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section, you can make changes to your FEHB enrollment for the same 
reasons and with the same effective dates listed in Sec. 890.301 of 
this chapter.
    (b) However, if you are participating in premium conversion there 
are two exceptions: you must have a qualifying life event to change from 
self and family enrollment to self only enrollment or to drop FEHB 
coverage entirely. (See Sec. 892.209 and Sec. 892.210.) Your change in 
enrollment must be consistent with and correspond to your qualifying 
life event as described in Sec. 892.101. These limitations apply only 
to changes you may wish to make outside open season.
    (c) If you are subject to a court or administrative order as 
discussed in Sec. 890.301(g)(3) of this chapter, your employing agency 
can limit a change to your enrollment as long as the court or 
administrative order is still in effect and you have at least one child 
identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, 
unless you provide documentation to your agency that you have other 
coverage for your child or children. See also Sec. 892.208 and Sec. 
892.209.

[69 FR 56929, Sept. 23, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 892.208  Can I change my enrollment from self and family to self only at any time?

    If you are participating in premium conversion you may change your 
FEHB enrollment from self and family to self only under either of the 
following circumstances:
    (a) During the annual open season. A change to self only made during 
the annual open season takes effect on the 1st day of the first pay 
period that begins in the next year.
    (b) Within 60 days after you have a qualifying life event. A change 
to self only made because of a qualifying life event takes effect on the 
first day of the first pay period that begins after the date your 
employing office receives your appropriate request. Your change in 
enrollment must be consistent with and correspond to your qualifying 
life event. For example, if you get divorced and have no dependent 
children, changing to self only would be consistent with that qualifying 
life event. If both you and your spouse are Federal employees, and your 
youngest dependent turns age 22, changing from a self and family to two 
self only enrollments would be consistent and appropriate for that 
event.
    (c) If you are subject to a court or administrative order as 
discussed in Sec. 890.301(g)(3) of this chapter, you may not change 
your enrollment to self only as long as the court or administrative 
order is still in effect and you have at least one child identified in 
the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, unless you 
provide documentation to your agency that

[[Page 538]]

you have other coverage for your child or children. See also Sec. 
892.207 and Sec. 892.209.

[68 FR 56528, Oct. 1, 2003, as amended at 69 FR 56929, Sept. 23, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 892.209  Can I cancel FEHB coverage at any time?

    If you are participating in premium conversion you may cancel your 
FEHB coverage:
    (a) During the annual open season. A cancellation made during the 
annual open season is effective at midnight of the day before the first 
day of the first pay period that begins in the next year.
    (b) Within 60 days after you have a qualifying life event. A 
cancellation made because of a qualifying life event takes effect at 
midnight of the last day of the pay period in which your employing 
office receives your appropriate request to cancel your enrollment. Your 
cancellation of coverage must be consistent with and correspond to your 
qualifying life event. For example, if you get married and you gain 
other insurance coverage because your spouse's employer provides health 
insurance for your spouse and you, then canceling FEHB coverage would be 
consistent with that qualifying life event. If you add an eligible 
family member, canceling coverage would generally not be consistent with 
that qualifying life event.
    (c) If you are subject to a court or administrative order as 
discussed in Sec. 890.301(g)(3) of this chapter, you may not cancel 
your coverage as long as the court or administrative order is still in 
effect and you have at least one child identified in the order who is 
still eligible under the FEHB Program, unless you provide documentation 
to your agency that you have other coverage for your child or children.

[65 FR 44646, July 19, 2000, as amended at 68 FR 56525 and 56528, Oct. 
1, 2003; 69 FR 56929, Sept. 23, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 892.210  Does premium conversion change the effective date of an FEHB enrollment,
change in enrollment, or cancellation of enrollment?

    No. If you are participating in premium conversion, the effective 
date of an FEHB enrollment, change in enrollment, or cancellation of 
enrollment is the same effective date as provided in Sec. 890.301 of 
this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 892.211  What options are available to me if I go on a period of 
leave without pay (LWOP) or other types of non-pay status?

    (a) Your commencement of a period of LWOP is a qualifying life event 
as described in Sec. 892.101. You may change your premium conversion 
election (waive if you now participate, or participate if you now 
waive).
    (b)(1) You may continue your FEHB coverage by agreeing in advance of 
LWOP to one of the payment options described in paragraph (b)(2), 
(b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section.
    (2) Pre-pay. Prior to commencement of your LWOP you may allot 
through payroll deduction the amount that will be due for your share of 
your FEHB premium during your LWOP period, if your employing agency, at 
its discretion, allows you to do so. Contributions under the pre-pay 
option may be made through premium conversion on a pre-tax basis. 
Alternatively, you may pre-pay premiums for the LWOP period on an after-
tax basis.
    (3) Direct pay. Under the direct pay option, you may pay your share 
of your FEHB premium on the same schedule of payments that would be made 
if you were not on LWOP, as described in Sec. 890.502(b) of this 
chapter. You must make the premium payments directly to your employing 
agency. The payments you make under the direct pay option are not 
subject to premium conversion, and are made on an after-tax basis.
    (4) Catch-up. Under the catch-up option, you must agree in advance 
of the LWOP period that: you will continue FEHB coverage while on LWOP; 
your employer will advance your share of your FEHB premium during your 
LWOP period; and you will repay the advanced amounts when you return 
from LWOP. (Described in Sec. 890.502(b) of this chapter.) Your catch-
up contributions may be made through premium conversion.
    (5) If you remain in FEHB upon your return from LWOP, your catch-up 
premiums and current premiums will be paid at the same time.

[[Page 539]]

    (c) Your return from LWOP constitutes a qualifying life event as 
described in Sec. 892.101. You may change your premium conversion 
election (waive if you now participate, or participate if you now 
waive). The election you choose upon return from LWOP will apply to your 
current as well as your catch-up premiums.

                Subpart C_Contributions and Withholdings


<R05>
Sec. 892.301  How do I pay my premium?

    As a participant in premium conversion, instead of having your 
premium withheld from after-tax salary, your salary will be reduced 
(through a Federal allotment) by the amount equal to your FEHB premium, 
which you will allot to your agency. The allotment from salary satisfies 
the FEHB premium payment requirement of 5 U.S.C. 8906. Your employer is 
authorized to accept this allotment under Sec. 550.311(a)(7) and Sec. 
550.312 of this chapter or, for employers not subject to those 
regulations, a similar mechanism. Your agency will use the allotment to 
pay your share of your FEHB premium. This will reduce your taxable 
income as described in Sec. 892.102.

[65 FR 44646, July 19, 2000, as amended at 71 FR 66828, Nov. 17, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 892.302  Will the Government contribution continue?

    Yes, your employer will still pay the same share of your premium as 
provided in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act, and Sec. 890.501 
of this chapter. Employee allotments do not count toward the 
Government's statutory maximum contribution.


<R05>
Sec. 892.303  Can I pay my premiums directly by check under the premium conversion plan?

    No, your employer must take your contribution to your FEHB premium 
from your salary to qualify for pre-tax treatment.


<R04>
         Subpart D_Reemployed Annuitants and Survivor Annuitants


<R05>
Sec. 892.401  Am I eligible for premium conversion if I retire and then come back to work for the Federal Government?

    (a) If you are a retired individual enrolled in FEHB who is 
receiving an annuity and you are reemployed in a position that conveys 
FEHB eligibility and is covered by the premium conversion plan, you are 
automatically covered by premium conversion, unless you waive 
participation as described in Sec. 892.205.
    (b)(1) If you do not waive premium conversion, your FEHB coverage 
will be transferred to your employing agency, and your employing agency 
will assume responsibility for contributing the Government share of your 
FEHB coverage. Your coverage, including what FEHB plans you are eligible 
to enroll in, will be based on your status as an active employee and 
your employing agency will deduct your premiums from your salary.
    (2) If you elect to waive participation in premium conversion, you 
will keep your FEHB coverage as an annuitant, but your contributions 
towards your FEHB premiums will be made on an after-tax basis. Your 
employing agency must receive your waiver no later than 60 days after 
the date you return to Federal employment. A waiver will be effective at 
the beginning of the first pay period after your employer receives it.
    (c) If you did not carry FEHB into retirement and you are reemployed 
as an employee in a position covered by the premium conversion plan, you 
may enroll in the FEHB Program as a new employee as described in Sec. 
890.301 of this chapter. Upon enrolling in FEHB, you are automatically 
covered by the premium conversion plan, unless you waive participation 
as described in Sec. 892.205.
    (d) Your status as an annuitant under the retirement regulations and 
your right to continue FEHB as an annuitant following your period of 
reemployment is unaffected.

[65 FR 44646, July 19, 2000, as amended at 68 FR 56529, Oct. 1, 2003]

[[Page 540]]


<R05>
Sec. 892.402  I am a survivor annuitant as well as an active Federal employee; 
am I eligible for premium conversion?

    (a) If you are a survivor annuitant enrolled in FEHB who is 
receiving an annuity and you are employed in a position that conveys 
FEHB eligibility and is covered by the premium conversion plan, you are 
eligible to participate in premium conversion.
    (b)(1) If you wish to participate in premium conversion, you must 
notify your employing agency. Your employing agency will transfer in 
your FEHB coverage from the retirement system, and your employing agency 
will assume responsibility for contributing the government share of your 
FEHB coverage. Your coverage, including what FEHB plans you are eligible 
to enroll in, will be based on your status as an active employee and 
your employing agency will deduct your premiums from your salary.
    (2) If you do not notify your employing agency that you wish to 
participate in premium conversion, you will keep your FEHB coverage as a 
survivor annuitant, but your contributions towards your FEHB premiums 
will be made on an after-tax basis. Your status as an annuitant under 
the retirement regulations and your right to continue FEHB as a survivor 
annuitant following your period of employment is unaffected.

<R05>
Sec. 900.401  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to effectuate the provisions of title 
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereafter referred to as title VI) 
to the end that a person in the United States shall not, on the ground 
of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, 
be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination 
under a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from 
OPM.


<R05>
Sec. 900.402  Application of this subpart.

    (a) This subpart applies to each program for which Federal financial 
assistance is authorized under a law administered by OPM, including the 
federally assisted programs listed in appendix A to this subpart. It 
also applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal 
financial assistance extended under a program after the effective date 
of this subpart pursuant to an application approved before that 
effective date. This subpart does not apply to:
    (1) Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty 
contracts;
    (2) Money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended 
under a program before the effective date of this subpart, except when 
the assistance was subject to the title VI regulations of an agency 
whose responsibilities are now exercised by OPM;
    (3) Assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary 
under a program; or
    (4) Employment practices, under a program, of an employer, 
employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described 
in Sec. 900.404(c).

The fact that a program is not listed in appendix A to this subpart does 
not mean, if title VI is otherwise applicable, that the program is not 
covered. Other programs under statutes now in force or hereinafter 
enacted may be added to appendix A to this subpart.
    (b) In a program receiving Federal financial assistance in the form, 
or for the acquisition, of real property or an interest in real 
property, to the extent that rights to space on, over, or under that 
property are included as part of the program receiving that assistance, 
the nondiscrimination requirement of this subpart extends to a facility 
located wholly or in part in that space.


<R05>
Sec. 900.403  Definitions.

    Unless the context requires otherwise, in this subpart:
    (a) Applicant means a person who submits an application, request, or 
plan required to be approved by OPM, or by a primary recipient, as a 
condition to eligibility for Federal financial assistance, and 
application means that application, request, or plan.
    (b) Facility includes all or any part of structures, equipment, or 
other real or personal property or interests therein, and the provision 
of facilities includes the construction, expansion, renovation, 
remodeling, alteration, or acquisition of facilities.
    (c) Federal financial assistance includes:
    (1) Grants and loans of Federal funds;
    (2) The grant or donation of Federal property and interests in 
property;
    (3) The detail of Federal personnel;
    (4) The sale and lease of, and the permission to use (on other than 
a casual or transient basis), Federal property or any interest in the 
property without consideration or at a nominal consideration, or at a 
consideration which is reduced for the purpose of assisting the 
recipient, or in recognition of the public interest to be served by the 
sale or lease to the recipient; and
    (5) A Federal agreement, arrangement, or other contract which has as 
one of its purposes the provision of assistance.
    (d) Primary recipient means a recipient that is authorized or 
required to extend Federal financial assistance to another recipient for 
the purpose of carrying out a program.
    (e) Program includes a program, project, or activity for the 
provision of services, financial aid, or other benefits to individuals 
(including education or training or other services whether provided 
through employees of the recipient of Federal financial assistance or 
provided by others through contracts or other arrangements with the

[[Page 542]]

recipient, and including work opportunities), or for the provision of 
facilities for furnishing services, financial aid, or other benefits to 
individuals. The services, financial aid, or other benefits provided 
under a program receiving Federal financial assistance are deemed to 
include a service, financial aid, or other benefits provided with the 
aid of Federal financial assistance or with the aid of any non-Federal 
funds, property, or other resources required to be expended or made 
available for the program to meet the matching requirements or other 
conditions which must be met in order to receive the Federal financial 
assistance, and to include services, financial aid, or other benefits 
provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal 
financial assistance or non-Federal resources.
    (f) Recipient may mean any State, the District of Columbia, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, a territory or possession of the United 
States, or any political subdivision thereof, or instrumentality 
thereof, any public or private agency, institution, or organization, or 
other entity, or any individual in any State, the District of Columbia, 
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or territory or possession of the 
United States, to whom Federal financial assistance is extended, 
directly or through another recipient, for any program, including any 
successor, assignee, or transferee thereof, but the term does not 
include any ultimate beneficiary under a program.
    (g) Director means the Director of the Office of Personnel 
Management, or any person to whom he has delegated his authority in the 
matter concerned.


<R05>
Sec. 900.404  Discrimination prohibited.

    (a) General. A person in the United States shall not, on the ground 
of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be 
denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination 
under, a program to which this subpart applies.
    (b) Specific discriminatory actions prohibited. (1) A recipient 
under a program to which this subpart applies may not, directly or 
through contractual or other arrangements, on the ground of race, color, 
or national origin--
    (i) Deny a person a service, financial aid, or other benefit 
provided under the program;
    (ii) Provide a service, financial aid, or other benefit to a person 
which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that 
provided to others under the program;
    (iii) Subject a person to segregation or separate treatment in any 
matter related to his receipt of a service, financial aid, or other 
benefit under the program;
    (iv) Restrict a person in any way in the enjoyment of an advantage 
or privilege enjoyed by others receiving a service, financial aid, or 
other benefit under the program;
    (v) Treat a person differently from others in determining whether he 
satisfies an admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership, or 
other requirement or condition which persons must meet in order to be 
provided a service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the 
program; or
    (vi) Deny a person an opportunity to participate in the program 
through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an 
opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under 
the program.
    (2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial 
aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under a 
program or the class of persons to whom, or the situations in which, the 
services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided 
under a program, or the class of persons to be afforded an opportunity 
to participate in a program, may not, directly or through contractual or 
other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which 
have the effect of subjecting persons to discrimination because of their 
race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or 
substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program 
with respect to individuals of a particular race, color, or national 
origin.
    (3) As used in this section, the services, financial aid, or other 
benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance 
include a service, financial aid, or other benefit

[[Page 543]]

provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal 
financial assistance.
    (4) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination 
in this paragraph does not limit the generality of the prohibition in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (5) Examples demonstrating the application of the provisions of this 
section to certain programs receiving Federal financial assistance from 
OPM are contained in appendix C of this subpart.
    (6) (i) In administering a program regarding which the recipient had 
previously discriminated against persons on the ground of race, color, 
or national origin, the recipient shall take affirmative action to 
overcome the effects of prior discrimination.
    (ii) Even in the absence of prior discrimination a recipient in 
administering a program shall take affirmative action as required by OPM 
to overcome the effect of conditions which resulted in limiting 
participation by persons of a particular race, color, or national 
origin.
    (iii) Any affirmative action under this paragraph shall be 
consistent with the principles stated in the Intergovernmental Personnel 
Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1909.
    (c) Employment practices. (1) When a primary objective of a program 
of Federal financial assistance to which this subpart applies is to 
provide employment, a recipient or other party subject to this subpart 
shall not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, 
subject a person to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or 
national origin in its employment practices under the program (including 
recruitment or recruitment advertising, hiring, firing, upgrading, 
promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, rates of pay, or 
other forms of compensation or benefits, selection for training or 
apprenticeship, use of facilities, and treatment of employees). A 
recipient shall take affirmative action to insure that applicants are 
employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to 
race, color, or national origin. The requirements applicable to 
construction employment under a program are those specified in or 
pursuant to Part III of Executive Order 11246 or any Executive order 
which supersedes it.
    (2) Federal financial assistance to programs under laws funded or 
administered by OPM which have as a primary objective the providing of 
employment include those set forth in appendix B to this subpart.
    (3) In regard to Federal financial assistance which does not have 
providing employment as a primary objective, the provisions of paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section apply to the employment practices of the 
recipient if discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national 
origin in the employment practices tends, on the ground of race, color, 
or national origin, to exclude persons from participation in, to deny 
them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under, the 
program receiving Federal financial assistance. The provisions of 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply to the extent necessary to assure 
equality of opportunity to and nondiscriminatory treatment of 
beneficiaries.
    (d) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient 
or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of 
excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting 
them to discrimination under, a program to which this subpart applies, 
on the ground of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or 
effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishments of 
the objectives of title VI or this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 900.405  Assurances required.

    (a) General. (1) An application for Federal financial assistance to 
carry out a program to which this subpart applies, except a program to 
which paragraph (d) of this section applies, and every application for 
Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition 
to its approval and the extension of Federal financial assistance 
pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by, assurances 
that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in 
compliance with the requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart. 
Every program of Federal financial assistance

[[Page 544]]

shall require the submission of these assurances. In the case where the 
Federal financial assistance is to provide or is in the form of personal 
property, or real property or interest therein or structures thereon, 
the assurances shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a 
subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the 
property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial 
assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of 
similar services or benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains 
ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. In other 
cases, the assurances obligate the recipient for the period during which 
the Federal financial assistance is extended to the program. In the case 
where the assistance is sought for the construction of a facility or 
part of a facility, the assurances shall extend to the entire facility 
and to the facilities operated in connection therewith. OPM shall 
specify the form of the foregoing assurances for each program, and the 
extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, 
contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and 
other participants in the program. The assurances shall include 
provisions which give the United States the right to seek judicial 
enforcement.
    (2) When Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a 
transfer of real property, structures, or improvements thereon, or 
interest therein, from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting 
or recording the transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land 
assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property 
is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is 
extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar 
services or benefits. When no transfer of property or interest therein 
from the Federal Government is involved, but property is acquired or 
improved under a program of Federal financial assistance, the recipient 
shall agree to include a covenant in any subsequent transfer of the 
property. When the property is obtained from the Federal Government, the 
covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be 
reserved by OPM to revert title to the property in the event of a breach 
of the covenant where, in the discretion of OPM, such a condition and 
right of reverter is appropriate to the program under which the real 
property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In 
the event a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or 
otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing 
construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on property 
for the purposes for which the property was transferred, OPM may agree, 
on request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish the 
financing, and on conditions as he deems appropriate, to subordinate a 
right of reversion to the lien of a mortgage or other encumbrance.
    (b) Assurances from government agencies. In the case of an 
application from a department, agency, or office of a State or local 
government for Federal financial assistance for a specified purpose, the 
assurance required by this section shall extend to any other department, 
agency, or office of the same governmental unit if the policies of the 
other department, agency, or office will substantially affect the 
project for which Federal financial assistance is requested. That 
requirement may be waived by the responsible OPM official if the 
applicant establishes, to the satisfaction of the responsible OPM 
official, that the practices in other agencies or parts or programs of 
the governmental unit will in no way affect (1) its practices in the 
program for which Federal financial assistance is sought, or (2) the 
beneficiaries of or participants in or persons affected by the program, 
or (3) full compliance with this subpart as respects the program.
    (c) Assurance from academic and other institutions. (1) In the case 
of an application for Federal financial assistance by an academic 
institution, the assurance required by this section extends to admission 
practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of 
students.
    (2) The assurance required by an academic institution, detention or 
correctional facility, or any other institution or facility, relating to 
the institution's practices with respect to admission or

[[Page 545]]

other treatment of individuals as students, patients, wards, inmates, 
persons subject to control, or clients of the institution or facility or 
to the opportunity to participate in the provision of services, 
disposition, treatment, or benefits to these individuals, is applicable 
to the entire institution or facility unless the applicant establishes, 
to the satisfaction of the responsible OPM official, that the practices 
in designated parts or programs of the institution or facility will in 
no way affect its practices in the program of the institution or 
facility for which Federal financial assistance is sought, or the 
beneficiaries of or participants in the program. If the assistance 
sought is for the construction of a facility or part of a facility, the 
assurance shall extend to the entire facility and to facilities operated 
in connection therewith.
    (d) Continuing State programs. Every application by a State or a 
State agency to carry out a program involving continuing Federal 
financial assistance to which this subpart applies (including the 
programs listed in appendix A to this subpart) shall as a condition to 
its approval and the extension of Federal financial assistance pursuant 
to the application (1) contain or be accompanied by a statement that the 
program is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in 
compliance with the requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart, 
and (2) provide or be accompanied by provision for methods of 
administration for the program as are found by OPM to give reasonable 
guarantee that the applicant and all recipients of Federal financial 
assistance under the program will comply with the requirements imposed 
by or pursuant to this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 900.406  Compliance information.

    (a) Cooperation and assistance. OPM, to the fullest extent 
practicable, shall seek the cooperation of recipients in obtaining 
compliance with this subpart and shall provide assistance and guidance 
to recipients to help them comply voluntarily with this subpart.
    (b) Compliance reports. Each recipient shall keep records and submit 
to OPM timely, complete, and accurate compliance reports at the times, 
and in the form and containing the information OPM may determine 
necessary to enable it to ascertain whether the recipient has complied 
or is complying with this subpart. In the case of a program under which 
a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to other 
recipients, the other recipients shall also submit compliance reports to 
the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary 
recipient to carry out its obligations under this subpart.
    (c) Access to sources of information. Each recipient shall permit 
access by OPM during normal business hours to its books, records, 
accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be 
pertinent to ascertain compliance with this subpart. When information 
required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of another 
agency, institution, or person and this agency, institution, or person 
fails or refuses to furnish this information, the recipient shall so 
certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to 
obtain the information.
    (d) Information to beneficiaries and participants. Each recipient 
shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other 
interested persons the information regarding the provisions of this 
subpart and its applicability to the program under which the recipient 
received Federal financial assistance, and make this information 
available to them in the manner, as OPM finds necessary, to apprise the 
persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by title 
VI and this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 900.407  Conduct of investigations.

    (a) Periodic compliance reviews. OPM may from time to time review 
the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with 
this subpart.
    (b) Complaints. Any person who believes himself or any specific 
class of persons to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by this 
subpart may by himself or by a representative file with the Director, 
Office of Personnel Management a written complaint. A complaint shall be 
filed not later than 90 days after the date of the alleged 
discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by OPM.

[[Page 546]]

    (c) Investigations. OPM will make a prompt investigation whenever a 
compliance review, report, complaint, or other information indicates a 
possible failure to comply with this subpart. The investigation will 
include, when appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and 
policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible 
noncompliance with this subpart occurred, and other factors relevant to 
a determination as to whether the recipient has failed to comply with 
this subpart.
    (d) Resolution of matters. (1) If an investigation pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this 
subpart, OPM will so inform the recipient and the matter will be 
resolved by voluntary means whenever possible. If it has been determined 
that the matter cannot be resolved by voluntary means, action will be 
taken as provided for in Sec. 900.408.
    (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, OPM will so inform, in writing, the 
recipient and the complainant, if any.
    (e) Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited. A recipient or 
other person shall not intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate 
against an individual for the purpose of interfering with a right or 
privilege secured by section 601 of title VI or this subpart, or because 
he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any 
manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subpart. 
The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential; except to the 
extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this subpart, including 
the conduct of an investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising 
thereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 900.408  Procedure for effecting compliance.

    (a) General. (1) If there appears to be a failure or threatened 
failure to comply with this subpart, and if the noncompliance or 
threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, 
compliance with this subpart may be effected by the suspension or 
termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial 
assistance or by other means authorized by law.
    (2) Other means may include, but are not limited to, (i) a reference 
to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate 
proceedings be brought to enforce the rights of the United States under 
a law of the United States (including other titles of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964), or an assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (ii) 
an applicable proceeding under State or local law.
    (b) Noncompliance with Sec. 900.405. If an applicant fails or 
refuses to furnish an assurance required under Sec. 900.405 or 
otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or 
pursuant to that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in 
accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. OPM 
shall not be required to provide assistance in that case during the 
pendency of the administrative proceedings under this paragraph. 
Subject, however, to Sec. 900.412, OPM shall continue assistance during 
the pendency of the proceedings where the assistance is due and payable 
pursuant to an application approved prior to the effective date of this 
subpart.
    (c) Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal 
financial assistance. An order suspending, terminating, or refusing to 
grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall not become 
effective until--
    (1) OPM has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to 
comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by informal 
voluntary means;
    (2) There has been an express finding on the record, after 
opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to 
comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this subpart;
    (3) The action has been approved by the Office of Personnel 
Management pursuant to Sec. 900.410(e); and
    (4) The expiration of 30 days after the Director, Office of 
Personnel Management has filed with the committee of the House and the 
committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program 
involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for 
the action.

An action to suspend or terminate or refuse to grant or to continue 
Federal financial assistance shall be limited to

[[Page 547]]

the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or 
recipient as to whom a finding has been made and shall be limited in its 
effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which the 
noncompliance has been so found.
    (d) Other means authorized by law. An action to effect compliance 
with title VI by other means authorized by law shall not be taken by OPM 
until--
    (1) OPM has determined that compliance cannot be secured by 
voluntary means;
    (2) The recipient or other person has been notified of its failure 
to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance; and
    (3) The expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of a notice 
to the recipient or person. During this period of at least 10 days, 
additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other 
person to comply with the regulation and to take corrective action as 
may be appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 900.409  Hearings.

    (a) Opportunity for hearing. When an opportunity for a hearing is 
required by Sec. 900.408(c), reasonable notice shall be given by 
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected 
applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or 
recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision 
under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the 
matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either 
(1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of notice within 
which the applicant or recipient may request of OPM that the matter be 
scheduled for hearing or (2) advise the applicant or recipient that the 
matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated time and 
place. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and subject to 
change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time 
and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing 
and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure 
of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph 
or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set is deemed to be 
a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of title VI and 
Sec. 900.408(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of 
the information as is available.
    (b) Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at the offices 
of OPM in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by OPM unless it determines 
that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of OPM requires 
that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before the 
Director of Office of Personnel Management, or at his/her discretion, 
before a hearing examiner appointed in accordance with section 3105 of 
title 5, United States Code, or detailed under section 3344 of title 5, 
United States Code.
    (c) Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the 
applicant or recipient and OPM have the right to be represented by 
counsel.
    (d) Procedures, evidence, and record. (1) The hearing, decision, and 
an administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 
sections 554 through 557 of title 5, United States Code, and in 
accordance with the rules of procedure as are proper (and not 
inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, 
giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of 
this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, 
requests for findings, and other related matters. Both OPM and the 
applicant or recipient are entitled to introduce relevant evidence on 
the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the 
officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.
    (2) Technical rules of evidence do not apply to hearings conducted 
pursuant to this subpart, but rules or principles designed to assure 
production of the most credible evidence available and to subject 
testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where determined 
reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing 
officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious 
evidence. Documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record 
shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be 
given to refute

[[Page 548]]

facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript 
shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance 
thereof is stipulated for the record. Decisions shall be based on the 
hearing record and written findings shall be made.
    (e) Consolidated or joint hearings. In cases in which the same or 
related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this subpart 
with respect to two or more programs to which this subpart applies, or 
noncompliance with this subpart and the regulations of one or more other 
Federal departments or agencies issued under title VI, OPM may, by 
agreement with the other departments or agencies, when applicable, 
provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the 
application to these hearings of rules or procedures not inconsistent 
with this subpart. Final decisions in these cases, insofar as this 
regulation is concerned, shall be made in accordance with Sec. 900.410.


<R05>
Sec. 900.410  Decisions and notices.

    (a) Procedure on decisions by hearing examiner. If the hearing is 
held by a hearing examiner, the hearing examiner shall either make an 
initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record 
including his recommended findings and proposed decision to the Director 
of Office of Personnel Management, for a final decision, and a copy of 
the initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant 
or recipient. When the initial decision is made by the hearing examiner, 
the applicant or recipient may, within 30 days after the mailing of a 
notice of initial decision, file with the Director of Office of 
Personnel Management his exceptions to the initial decision, with his 
reasons therefore. In the absence of exceptions, the Director, Office of 
Personnel Management may, on his/her own motion, within 45 days after 
the initial decision, serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that 
he/she will review the decision. On the filing of the exceptions or of 
notice of review, the Director, Office of Personnel Management shall 
review the initial decision and issue his/her own decision thereon 
including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a 
notice of review the initial decision, subject to paragraph (e) of this 
section, shall constitute the final decision of OPM.
    (b) Decisions on record or review by the Office of Personnel 
Management. When a record is certified to the Office of Personnel 
Management for decision or the Office of Personnel Management reviews 
the decision of a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section, or when the Office of Personnel Management conducts the 
hearing, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable 
opportunity to file with it briefs or other written statements of the 
recipient's contentions, and a written copy of the final decision of the 
Office of Personnel Management will be sent to the applicant or 
recipient and to the complainant, if any.
    (c) Decisions on record where a hearing is waived. When a hearing is 
waived pursuant to Sec. 900.409, a decision shall be made by the Office 
of Personnel Management on the record and a written copy of the decision 
shall be sent to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if 
any.
    (d) Rulings required. Each decision of a hearing examiner or the 
Office of Personnel Management shall set forth a ruling on each finding, 
conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement 
or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart with which it is 
found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.
    (e) Approval by OPM. A final decision by an official of OPM other 
than by the Director, which provides for the suspension or termination 
of, or the refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, or 
the imposition of any other sanction available under this subpart or 
title VI, shall promptly be transmitted to the Director, Office of 
Personnel Management, who may approve the decision, vacate it, or remit 
or mitigate a sanction imposed.
    (f) Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension 
or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial 
assistance, in whole or in part, under the program involved, and may 
contain the terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent 
with and will effectuate the purposes of title VI and this subpart,

[[Page 549]]

including provisions designed to assure that Federal financial 
assistance will not thereafter be extended under the programs to the 
applicant or recipient determined by the decision to be in default in 
its performance of an assurance given by it under this subpart, or to 
have otherwise failed to comply with this subpart, unless and until it 
corrects its noncompliance and satisfies OPM that it will fully comply 
with this subpart.
    (g) Post termination proceedings. (1) An applicant or recipient 
adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this 
section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal 
financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of the 
order for eligibility, or if it brings itself into compliance with this 
subpart and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with 
this subpart.
    (2) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered 
pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the 
Director, Office of Personnel Management to restore fully its 
eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. A request shall be 
supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met 
the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the Director, 
Office of Personnel Management determines that those requirements have 
been satisfied, he/she shall restore the eligibility.
    (3) If OPM denies a request, the applicant or recipient may submit a 
request for hearing in writing, specifying why it believes OPM is in 
error. The applicant or recipient shall be given an expeditious hearing, 
with a decision on the record in accordance with the rules or procedures 
issued by OPM. The applicant or recipient shall be restored to 
eligibility if it proves at the hearing that it satisfied the 
requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings 
under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order 
issued under paragraph (f) of this section remain in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 900.411  Judicial review.

    Action taken pursuant to section 602 of title VI is subject to 
judicial review as provided in section 603 of title VI.


<R05>
Sec. 900.412  Effect on other regulations, forms, and instructions.

    (a) Effect on other regulations. Regulations, orders, or like 
directions issued before the effective date of this subpart by OPM which 
impose requirements designed to prohibit discrimination against 
individuals on the ground of race, color, or national origin under a 
program to which this subpart applies, and which authorizes the 
suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal 
financial assistance to an applicant for or recipient of assistance 
under a program for failure to comply with the requirements, are 
superseded to the extent that discrimination is prohibited by this 
subpart, except that nothing in this subpart relieves a person of an 
obligation assumed or imposed under a superseded regulation, order, 
instruction, or like direction, before the effective date of this 
subpart. This subpart does not supersede any of the following (including 
future amendments thereof): (1) Executive Order 11246 (3 CFR, 1965 
Supp.) and regulations issued thereunder or (2) any other orders, 
regulations, or instructions, insofar as these orders, regulations, or 
instructions prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color, or 
national origin in a program or situation to which this subpart is 
inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other ground.
    (b) Forms and instructions. OPM shall issue and promptly make 
available to all interested persons forms and detailed instructions and 
procedures for effectuating this subpart as applied to programs to which 
this subpart applies, and for which it is responsible.
    (c) Supervision and coordination. The Director, Office of Personnel 
Management may from time to time assign to officials of OPM, or to 
officials of other departments or agencies of the Government with the 
consent of the departments or agencies, responsibilities in connection 
with the effectuation of the purposes of title VI and this subpart 
(other than responsibilities for final decision as provided in Sec. 
900.410), including the achievement of effective coordination and 
maximum uniformity within OPM and within the executive branch in the 
application of title VI and this subpart to similar programs

[[Page 550]]

and in similar situations. An action taken, determination made, or 
requirement imposed by an official of another department or agency 
acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this paragraph 
shall have the same effect as though the action had been taken by OPM.

    Appendix A to Subpart D--Activities to Which This Subpart Applies

not provide facilities for training with the purpose or effect of 
separating employees on the ground of race, color, or national origin.

Subpart E [Reserved]


<R04>
   Subpart F_Standards for a Merit System of Personnel Administration

    Authority: 42 U.S.C. 4728, 4763; E.O. 11589, 3 CFR part 557 (1971-
1975 Compilation).

    Source: 48 FR 9210, Mar. 4, 1983, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 900.601  Purpose.

    (a) The purpose of these regulations is to implement provisions of 
title II of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970, as amended, 
relating to Federally required merit personnel systems in State and 
local agencies, in a manner that recognizes fully the rights, powers, 
and responsibilities of State and local governments and encourages 
innovation and allows for diversity among State and local governments in 
the design, execution, and management of their systems of personnel 
administration, as provided by that Act.
    (b) Certain Federal grant programs require, as a condition of 
eligibility, that State and local agencies that receive grants establish 
merit personnel systems for their personnel engaged in administration of 
the grant-aided program. These merit personnel systems are in some cases 
required by specific Federal grant statutes and in other cases are 
required by regulations of the Federal grantor agencies. Title II of the 
Act gives the U.S. Office of Personnel Management authority to prescribe 
standards for these Federally required merit personnel systems.


<R05>
Sec. 900.602  Applicability.

    (a) Sections 900.603-604 apply to those State and local governments 
that are required to operate merit personnel systems as a condition of 
eligibility for Federal assistance or participation in an 
intergovernmental program. Merit personnel systems are required for 
State and local personnel engaged in the administration of assistance 
and other intergovernmental programs, irrespective of the source of 
funds for their salaries, where Federal laws or regulations require the 
establishment and maintenance of such systems. A reasonable number of 
positions, however, may be exempted from merit personnel system 
coverage.
    (b) Section 900.605 applies to Federal agencies that operate Federal 
assistance or intergovernmental programs.

[[Page 551]]


<R05>
Sec. 900.603  Standards for a merit system of personnel administration.

    The quality of public service can be improved by the development of 
systems of personnel administration consistent with such merit 
principles as--
    (a) Recruiting, selecting, and advancing employees on the basis of 
their relative ability, knowledge, and skills, including open 
consideration of qualified applicants for initial appointment.
    (b) Providing equitable and adequate compensation.
    (c) Training employees, as needed, to assure high quality 
performance.
    (d) Retaining employees on the basis of the adequacy of their 
performance, correcting inadequate performance, and separating employees 
whose inadequate performance cannot be corrected.
    (e) Assuring fair treatment of applicants and employees in all 
aspects of personnel administration without regard to political 
affiliation, race, color, national origin, sex, religious creed, age or 
handicap and with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional 
rights as citizens. This ``fair treatment'' principle includes 
compliance with the Federal equal employment opportunity and 
nondiscrimination laws.
    (f) Assuring that employees are protected against coercion for 
partisan political purposes and are prohibited from using their official 
authority for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of 
an election or a nomination for office.


<R05>
Sec. 900.604  Compliance.

    (a) Certification by Chief Executives. (1) Certification of 
agreement by a chief executive of a State or local jurisdiction to 
maintain a system of personnel administration in conformance with these 
Standards satisfies any applicable Federal merit personnel requirements 
of the Federal assistance or other programs to which personnel standards 
on a merit basis are applicable.
    (2) Chief executives will maintain these certifications and make 
them available to the Office of Personnel Management.
    (3) In the absence of certification by the chief executive, 
compliance with the Standards may be certified by the heads of those 
State and local agencies that are required to have merit personnel 
systems as a condition of Federal assistance or other intergovernmental 
programs.
    (b) Resolution of Compliance Issues. (1) Chief executives of State 
and local jurisdictions operating covered programs are responsible for 
supervising compliance by personnel systems in their jurisdictions with 
the Standards. They shall resolve all questions regarding compliance by 
personnel systems in their jurisdictions with the Standards. Findings 
and supporting documentation with regard to specific compliance issues 
shall be maintained by the chief executive, or a personal designee, and 
shall be forwarded, on request, to the Office of Personnel Management.
    (2) The merit principles apply to systems of personnel 
administration. The Intergovernmental Personnel Act does not authorize 
OPM to exercise any authority, direction or control over the selection, 
assignment, advancement, retention, compensation, or other personnel 
action with respect to any individual State or local employee.
    (3) When a chief executive requests the assistance of the Office of 
Personnel Management, the Office will provide consultation and technical 
advice to aid the State or local government in complying with the 
Standards.
    (4) The Office of Personnel Management will advise Federal agencies 
on application of the Standards in resolving compliance issues and will 
recommend actions to carry out the purposes of the Intergovernmental

<R05>
Sec. 900.705  Program accessibility.

this subpart applies.
    (b) A recipient shall operate each program or activity so that the 
program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible 
to and usable by handicapped persons. This

[[Page 555]]

paragraph does not necessarily require a recipient to make each of its 
existing facilities or every part of an existing facility accessible to 
and usable by handicapped persons. Where structural changes are 
necessary to make programs or activities in existing facilities 
accessible, such changes shall be made as soon as practicable, but in no 
event later than three years after the effective date of the regulation.
    (c) A recipient may comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of 
this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment 
of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to 
beneficiaries, home visits, alteration of facilities or any other 
methods that result in making its program or activity accessible to 
handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make structural 
changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in 
achieving compliance with this section.
    (d) New facilities shall be designed and constructed to be readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. Alterations to existing 
facilities shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be designed and 
constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped 
persons.
    (e) In the event that structural changes to facilities are necessary 
to meet the requirements of this section, a recipient shall develop 
within 12 months of the effective date of this subpart a transition plan 
setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The plan 
shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including 
handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons.
    (f)(1) Effective as of August 23, 1990. Design, construction, or 
alteration of buildings in conformance with sections 3-8 of the Uniform 
Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) (appendix A to 41 CFR subpart 
101-19.6) shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this 
section with respect to those buildings. Departures from particular 
technical and scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods 
are permitted where substantially equivalent or greater access to and 
usability of the building is provided.
    (2) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall 
be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical 
rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not 
require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the 
employment or residence therein of persons with physical handicaps.
    (3) This section does not require recipients to make building 
alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without 
removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.

<R05>
Sec. 900.706  Employment practices.

    (a) General. (1) No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis 
of handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under a 
program or activity that receives or benefits from Federal financial 
assistance from OPM.
    (2) A recipient shall make all decisions concerning employment under 
any program or activity to which this subpart applies in a manner which 
ensures that discrimination on the basis of handicap does not occur and 
may not limit, segregate, or classify applicants or employees in any way 
that adversely affects their opportunities or status because of 
handicap.
    (3) The prohibition against discrimination in employment applies to 
the following activities:
    (i) Recruitment, advertising, and the processing of applications for 
employment;
    (ii) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, award of tenure, demotion, 
transfer, layoff, termination, right of return from layoff, and 
rehiring;
    (iii) Rates of pay or any other form of compensation and changes in 
compensation;
    (iv) Job assignments, job classifications, organizational 
structures, position descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority 
lists;
    (v) Leaves of absence, sick leave, or any other leave;

[[Page 556]]

    (vi) Fringe benefits available by virtue of employment, whether or 
not administered by the recipient;
    (vii) Selection and financial support for training, including 
apprenticeship, professional meetings, conferences, and other related 
activities, and selection for leaves of absence to pursue training;
    (viii) Employer sponsored activities, including social or 
recreational programs; and
    (ix) Any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.
    (4) A recipient may not participate in a contractual or other 
relationship that has the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped 
applicants or employees to discrimination prohibited by this subpart. 
The relationships referred to in this paragraph include relationships 
with employment and referral agencies, with labor unions, with 
organizations providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of 
the recipient, and with organizations providing training and 
apprenticeship programs.
    (b) Reasonable accommodation. (1) A recipient shall make reasonable 
accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an 
otherwise qualified handicapped applicant or employee under any program 
or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from OPM unless the 
recipient can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue 
hardship on the operation of its program.
    (2) Reasonable accommodation may include, but shall not be limited 
to, making facilities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped 
persons, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, 
appropriate adjustment or modification of examinations, the provision of 
readers and interpreters, job restructuring and providing part-time or 
modified work schedules and other similar actions.
    (3) In determining pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation 
of the recipient in question, factors to be considered by OPM include:
    (i) The overall size of the recipient's program with respect to the 
number of employees, number and type of facilities and size of budget;
    (ii) The type of operation, including the composition and structure 
of the work force; and
    (iii) The nature and the cost of the accommodation.
    (c) Employment criteria. (1) A recipient involved in activities 
receiving Federal financial assistance may not make use of any 
employment test or other selection criterion that screens out or tends 
to screen out handicapped persons or any class of handicapped persons in 
any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance 
unless the test score or other selection criterion, as used by the 
recipient, is shown to be job-related for the position in question and 
alternative job-related tests or criteria that do not screen out as many 
handicapped persons are not shown by the Office of Personnel 
Management's Personnel Research and Development Center to be available.
    (2) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning 
employment so as to ensure that, when administered under any program or 
activity that receives Federal financial assistance from OPM, to an 
applicant or employee who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, 
or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's 
or employee's ability to perform the duties of the type of position in 
question rather than reflecting the applicant's or employee's impaired 
sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the 
factors that the test purports to measure).
    (d) Preemployment inquiries. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, a recipient, when considering an applicant for 
employment under any program or activity receiving Federal financial 
assistance from OPM, may not conduct a preemployment medical examination 
and may not make preemployment inquiry of an applicant as to whether the 
applicant is a handicapped person or as to the nature or severity of a 
handicap. A recipient may, however, make preemployment inquiry into an 
applicant's ability to perform job-related functions.
    (2) Nothing in this section shall prohibit an organization from 
conditioning an offer of employment under

[[Page 557]]

any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from OPM 
on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the 
employee's entrance on duty: Provided, That (i) All entering employees 
are subjected to such an examination regardless of handicap or when a 
preemployment medical questionnaire used for positions which do not 
routinely require medical examination indicates a condition for which 
further examination is required because of the job-related nature of the 
condition; and
    (ii) The results of such an examination are used in accordance with 
the requirements of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 900.707  Certification required.

    (a) General. Each application to OPM for financial assistance, as a 
condition to its approval and the extension of financial assistance, 
shall contain or be accompanied by, a certification from the applicant 
in a form prescribed by OPM that the program will be conducted in 
compliance with the requirements of this subpart. The assurance shall 
obligate the recipient for the period during which the financial 
assistance is extended to the program.
    (b) Certification from subgrantees. A certification shall be 
required of all subgrantees receiving financial assistance from OPM to 
the effect that all programs or parts thereof carried out by subgrantees 
shall be in compliance with the requirements of this subpart. The 
recipient shall be responsible for securing the certification from 
subgrantees.


<R05>
Sec. 900.708  Self-evaluation.

    (a) Each recipient shall, within one year of the receipt of 
financial assistance, conduct or have conducted an evaluation of its 
compliance with this subpart with the assistance of interested persons, 
including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped 
persons. Each such recipient shall evaluate its current policies and 
practices and their effects, and modify any that do not meet the 
requirements of this part. Each such recipient shall permit the Office 
of Personnel Management, during normal business hours, to examine its 
self-evaluation along with its books, records, accounts, facilities and 
other sources of information as may be useful to determine whether there 
has been compliance with this subpart. Self-evaluation required under 
other Federal programs may be accepted by OPM if the information 
pertaining to activities receiving financial assistance from OPM is 
included and the records are available to OPM representatives.
    (b) Each recipient shall modify, after consultation with interested 
persons and organizations, including handicapped persons, any policies 
and practices that do not meet the requirements of this subpart; and
    (c) Each recipient shall take, after consultation with interested 
persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing 
handicapped persons, appropriate remedial steps to eliminate the effects 
of any discrimination that resulted from adherence to these policies and 
practices.


<R05>
Sec. 900.709  Notice and consultation.

    (a) Programs and activities receiving OPM financial support shall 
take appropriate initial and continuing steps to notify participants, 
beneficiaries, applicants, and employees, including those with impaired 
vision or hearing, that it does not discriminate on the basis of 
handicap in violation of Section 504 and this subpart.
    (b) As appropriate, a recipient shall consult with interested 
persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing 
handicapped persons, in achieving compliance with this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 900.710  Procedure for effecting compliance.

    When the Office of Personnel Management determines that a recipient 
has failed or threatens to fail to comply with this subpart and the 
noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by 
informal means, OPM may suspend or terminate or refuse to grant or 
continue financial assistance as provided in Sec. 900.408 of title 5 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations.

criminal history record information from the State or locality, OPM 
represents that--
    (1) It has obtained the written consent of the individual under

individual from criminal justice agencies in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 
9101, after advising the individual of the purposes for which the 
information is intended to be used by a Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 
552a), or an equivalent, notice; and
    (2) Upon request, OPM will provide the individual access to criminal 
history record information received from the State or locality, as 
required by 5 U.S.C. 9101(d).
    (d) Purpose requirements. OPM will use the criminal history record 
information only for the purposes stated in Sec. 911.101(a).
    (e) Notice, litigation, and settlement procedures. (1) The State or 
locality must give notice of any claim against it on or before the 10th 
day after the day on which a claim against it is received, or it has 
notice of such a claim.
    (2) The notice must be given to the Attorney General and to the 
United States Attorney of the district embracing the place wherein the 
claim is made.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 919.50  How is this part written?

    (a) This part uses a ``plain language'' format to make it easier for 
the general public and business community to use. The section headings 
and text, often in the form of questions and answers, must be read 
together.
    (b) Pronouns used within this part, such as ``I'' and ``you,'' 
change from subpart to subpart depending on the audience being 
addressed. The pronoun ``we'' always is the OPM.
    (c) The ``Covered Transactions'' diagram in the appendix to this 
part shows the levels or ``tiers'' at which the OPM enforces an 
exclusion under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 919.75  Do terms in this part have special meanings?

    This part uses terms throughout the text that have special meaning. 
Those terms are defined in Subpart I of this part. For example, three 
important terms are--
    (a) Exclusion or excluded, which refers only to discretionary 
actions taken by a suspending or debarring official under this part or 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4);
    (b) Disqualification or disqualified, which refers to prohibitions 
under specific statutes, executive orders (other than Executive Order 
12549 and Executive Order 12689), or other authorities. 
Disqualifications frequently are not subject to the discretion of an 
agency official, may have a different scope than exclusions, or have 
special conditions that apply to the disqualification; and
    (c) Ineligibility or ineligible, which generally refers to a person 
who is either excluded or disqualified.


<R04>
                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 919.100  What does this part do?

    This part adopts a governmentwide system of debarment and suspension 
for OPM nonprocurement activities. It also provides for reciprocal 
exclusion of persons who have been excluded under the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation, and provides for the consolidated listing of all 
persons who are excluded, or disqualified by statute, executive order, 
or other legal authority. This part satisfies the requirements in 
section 3 of Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment and Suspension'' (3 CFR 
1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension'' 
(3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Public 
Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).


<R05>
Sec. 919.105  Does this part apply to me?

    Portions of this part (see table at Sec. 919.25(b)) apply to you if 
you are a(n)--
    (a) Person who has been, is, or may reasonably be expected to be, a 
participant or principal in a covered transaction;

[[Page 563]]

    (b) Respondent (a person against whom the OPM has initiated a 
debarment or suspension action);
    (c) OPM debarring or suspending official; or
    (d) OPM official who is authorized to enter into covered 
transactions with non-Federal parties.


<R05>
Sec. 919.110  What is the purpose of the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system?

    (a) To protect the public interest, the Federal Government ensures 
the integrity of Federal programs by conducting business only with 
responsible persons.
    (b) A Federal agency uses the nonprocurement debarment and 
suspension system to exclude from Federal programs persons who are not 
presently responsible.
    (c) An exclusion is a serious action that a Federal agency may take 
only to protect the public interest. A Federal agency may not exclude a 
person or commodity for the purposes of punishment.


<R05>
Sec. 919.115  How does an exclusion restrict a person's involvement in covered transactions?

    With the exceptions stated in Sec. Sec. 919.120, 919.315, and 
919.420, a person who is excluded by the OPM or any other Federal agency 
may not:
    (a) Be a participant in a(n) OPM transaction that is a covered 
transaction under subpart B of this part;
    (b) Be a participant in a transaction of any other Federal agency 
that is a covered transaction under that agency's regulation for 
debarment and suspension; or
    (c) Act as a principal of a person participating in one of those 
covered transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 919.120  May we grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?

    (a) The Debarring Official may grant an exception permitting an 
excluded person to participate in a particular covered transaction. If 
the Debarring Official grants an exception, the exception must be in 
writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the governmentwide 
policy in Executive Order 12549.
    (b) An exception granted by one agency for an excluded person does 
not extend to the covered transactions of another agency.


<R05>
Sec. 919.125  Does an exclusion under the nonprocurement system affect a 
person's eligibility for Federal procurement contracts?

    If any Federal agency excludes a person under its nonprocurement 
common rule on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also 
ineligible to participate in Federal procurement transactions under the 
FAR. Therefore, an exclusion under this part has reciprocal effect in 
Federal procurement transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 919.130  Does exclusion under the Federal procurement system affect
a person's eligibility to participate in nonprocurement transactions?

    If any Federal agency excludes a person under the FAR on or after 
August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate 
in nonprocurement covered transactions under this part. Therefore, an 
exclusion under the FAR has reciprocal effect in Federal nonprocurement 
transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 919.135  May the OPM exclude a person who is not currently participating 
in a nonprocurement transaction?

    Given a cause that justifies an exclusion under this part, we may 
exclude any person who has been involved, is currently involved, or may 
reasonably be expected to be involved in a covered transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 919.140  How do I know if a person is excluded?

    Check the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) to determine whether a 
person is excluded. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains 
the EPLS and makes it available, as detailed in subpart E of this part. 
When a Federal agency takes an action to exclude a person under the 
nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the 
agency enters the information about the excluded person into the EPLS.

[[Page 564]]


<R05>
Sec. 919.145  Does this part address persons who are disqualified, as well as 
those who are excluded from nonprocurement transactions?

    Except if provided for in Subpart J of this part, this part--
    (a) Addresses disqualified persons only to--
    (1) Provide for their inclusion in the EPLS; and
    (2) State responsibilities of Federal agencies and participants to 
check for disqualified persons before entering into covered 
transactions.
    (b) Does not specify the--
    (1) OPM transactions for which a disqualified person is ineligible. 
Those transactions vary on a case-by-case basis, because they depend on 
the language of the specific statute, Executive order, or regulation 
that caused the disqualification;
    (2) Entities to which the disqualification applies; or
    (3) Process that the agency uses to disqualify a person. Unlike 
exclusion, disqualification is frequently not a discretionary action 
that a Federal agency takes.


<R04>
                     Subpart B_Covered Transactions


<R05>
Sec. 919.200  What is a covered transaction?

    A covered transaction is a nonprocurement or procurement transaction 
that is subject to the prohibitions of this part. It may be a 
transaction at--
    (a) The primary tier, between a Federal agency and a person (see 
appendix to this part); or
    (b) A lower tier, between a participant in a covered transaction and 
another person.


<R05>
Sec. 919.205  Why is it important if a particular transaction is a covered transaction?

    The importance of a covered transaction depends upon who you are.
    (a) As a participant in the transaction, you have the 
responsibilities laid out in Subpart C of this part. Those include 
responsibilities to the person or Federal agency at the next higher tier 
from whom you received the transaction, if any. They also include 
responsibilities if you subsequently enter into other covered 
transactions with persons at the next lower tier.
    (b) As a Federal official who enters into a primary tier 
transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart D of this 
part.
    (c) As an excluded person, you may not be a participant or principal 
in the transaction unless--
    (1) The person who entered into the transaction with you allows you 
to continue your involvement in a transaction that predates your 
exclusion, as permitted under Sec. 919.310 or Sec. 919.415; or
    (2) A(n) OPM official obtains an exception from the Debarring 
Official to allow you to be involved in the transaction, as permitted 
under Sec. 919.120.


<R05>
Sec. 919.210  Which nonprocurement transactions are covered transactions?

    All nonprocurement transactions, as defined in Sec. 919.970, are 
covered transactions unless listed in Sec. 919.215. (See appendix to 
this part.)


<R05>
Sec. 919.215  Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions?

    The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered 
transactions:
    (a) A direct award to--
    (1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;
    (2) A public international organization;
    (3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign 
government; or
    (4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more 
foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.
    (b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, if 
a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental 
Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301 et 
seq., those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are 
not affected if the person is excluded.
    (c) Federal employment.

[[Page 565]]

    (d) A transaction that the OPM needs to respond to a national or 
agency-recognized emergency or disaster.
    (e) A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as 
a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless 
the OPM specifically designates it to be a covered transaction.
    (f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental 
operations.
    (g) Any other transaction if the application of an exclusion to the 
transaction is prohibited by law.


<R05>
Sec. 919.220  Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?

    (a) Covered transactions under this part--
    (1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a 
Federal agency; but
    (2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal 
participants in nonprocurement covered transactions (see appendix to 
this part).
    (b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered 
transaction if any of the following applies:
    (1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement 
transaction that is covered under Sec. 919.210, and the amount of the 
contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.
    (2) The contract requires the consent of a(n) OPM official. In that 
case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered 
transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it 
could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a 
nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this part.
    (3) The contract is for federally-required audit services.


<R05>
Sec. 919.225  How do I know if a transaction in which I may participate 
is a covered transaction?

    As a participant in a transaction, you will know that it is a 
covered transaction because the agency regulations governing the 
transaction, the appropriate agency official, or participant at the next 
higher tier who enters into the transaction with you, will tell you that 
you must comply with applicable portions of this part.


<R04>
    Subpart C_Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions

                    Doing Business With Other Persons


<R05>
Sec. 919.300  What must I do before I enter into a covered transaction
with another person at the next lower tier?

    When you enter into a covered transaction with another person at the 
next lower tier, you must verify that the person with whom you intend to 
do business is not excluded or disqualified. You do this by:
    (a) Checking the EPLS; or
    (b) Collecting a certification from that person if allowed by this 
rule; or
    (c) Adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction with 
that person.


<R05>
Sec. 919.305  May I enter into a covered transaction with an excluded 
or disqualified person?

    (a) You as a participant may not enter into a covered transaction 
with an excluded person, unless the OPM grants an exception under Sec. 
919.120.
    (b) You may not enter into any transaction with a person who is 
disqualified from that transaction, unless you have obtained an 
exception under the disqualifying statute, Executive order, or 
regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 919.310  What must I do if a Federal agency excludes a person with whom 
I am already doing business in a covered transaction?

    (a) You as a participant may continue covered transactions with an 
excluded person if the transactions were in existence when the agency 
excluded the person. However, you are not required to continue the 
transactions, and you may consider termination. You should make a 
decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, 
if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper 
and appropriate.
    (b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-
cost time extensions) with any excluded

[[Page 566]]

person, unless the OPM grants an exception under Sec. 919.120.


<R05>
Sec. 919.315  May I use the services of an excluded person as a principal
under a covered transaction?

    (a) You as a participant may continue to use the services of an 
excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction if you were 
using the services of that person in the transaction before the person 
was excluded. However, you are not required to continue using that 
person's services as a principal. You should make a decision about 
whether to discontinue that person's services only after a thorough 
review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.
    (b) You may not begin to use the services of an excluded person as a 
principal under a covered transaction unless the OPM grants an exception 
under Sec. 919.120.


<R05>
Sec. 919.320  Must I verify that principals of my covered transactions are
eligible to participate?

    Yes, you as a participant are responsible for determining whether 
any of your principals of your covered transactions is excluded or 
disqualified from participating in the transaction. You may decide the 
method and frequency by which you do so. You may, but you are not 
required to, check the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 919.325  What happens if I do business with an excluded person
in a covered transaction?

    If as a participant you knowingly do business with an excluded 
person, we may disallow costs, annul or terminate the transaction, issue 
a stop work order, debar or suspend you, or take other remedies as 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 919.330  What requirements must I pass down to persons at lower tiers 
with whom I intend to do business?

    Before entering into a covered transaction with a participant at the 
next lower tier, you must require that participant to--
    (a) Comply with this subpart as a condition of participation in the 
transaction. You may do so using any method(s), unless Sec. 919.440 
requires you to use specific methods.
    (b) Pass the requirement to comply with this subpart to each person 
with whom the participant enters into a covered transaction at the next 
lower tier.

            Disclosing Information--Primary Tier Participants


<R05>
Sec. 919.335  What information must I provide before entering into a covered 
transaction with the OPM?

    Before you enter into a covered transaction at the primary tier, you 
as the participant must notify the OPM office that is entering into the 
transaction with you, if you know that you or any of the principals for 
that covered transaction:
    (a) Are presently excluded or disqualified;
    (b) Have been convicted within the preceding three years of any of 
the offenses listed in Sec. 919.800(a) or had a civil judgment rendered 
against you for one of those offenses within that time period;

charged by a governmental entity (Federal, State or local) with 
commission of any of the offenses listed in Sec. 919.800(a); or
    (d) Have had one or more public transactions (Federal, State, or 
local) terminated within the preceding three years for cause or default.


<R05>
Sec. 919.340  If I disclose unfavorable information required under Sec. 919.335,
will I be prevented from participating in the transaction?

    As a primary tier participant, your disclosure of unfavorable 
information about yourself or a principal under Sec. 919.335 will not 
necessarily cause us to deny your participation in the covered 
transaction. We will consider the information when we determine whether 
to enter into the covered transaction. We also will consider any 
additional information or explanation that you elect to submit with the 
disclosed information.


<R05>
Sec. 919.345  What happens if I fail to disclose information required under Sec. 919.335?

    If we later determine that you failed to disclose information under 
Sec. 919.335

[[Page 567]]

that you knew at the time you entered into the covered transaction, we 
may--
    (a) Terminate the transaction for material failure to comply with 
the terms and conditions of the transaction; or
    (b) Pursue any other available remedies, including suspension and 
debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 919.350  What must I do if I learn of information required under Sec. 919.335 
after entering into a covered transaction with the OPM?

    At any time after you enter into a covered transaction, you must 
give immediate written notice to the OPM office with which you entered 
into the transaction if you learn either that--
    (a) You failed to disclose information earlier, as required by Sec. 
919.335; or
    (b) Due to changed circumstances, you or any of the principals for 
the transaction now meet any of the criteria in Sec. 919.335.

             Disclosing Information--Lower Tier Participants


<R05>
Sec. 919.355  What information must I provide to a higher tier participant before 
entering into a covered transaction with that participant?

next higher tier, you as a lower tier participant must notify that 
person if you know that you or any of the principals are presently 
excluded or disqualified.


<R05>
Sec. 919.360  What happens if I fail to disclose the information required under Sec. 919.355?

    If we later determine that you failed to tell the person at the 
higher tier that you were excluded or disqualified at the time you 
entered into the covered transaction with that person, we may pursue any 
available remedies, including suspension and debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 919.365  What must I do if I learn of information required under Sec. 919.355 
after entering into a covered transaction with a higher tier participant?

    After entering into a covered transaction with a participant, you as 
an agency official may not approve a participant's use of an excluded 
person as a principal under that transaction, unless you obtain an 
exception under Sec. 919.120.


<R05>
Sec. 919.415  What must I do if a Federal agency excludes the participant
or a principal after I enter into a covered transaction?

    (a) You as an agency official may continue covered transactions with 
an excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, if 
the transactions were in existence when

[[Page 568]]

a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination 
action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action 
is proper.
    (b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-

    (a) A covered transaction with a person who is currently excluded, 
unless you obtain an exception under Sec. 919.120; or
    (b) A transaction with a person who is disqualified from that 
transaction, unless you obtain a waiver or exception under the statute, 
Executive order, or regulation that is the basis for the person's 
disqualification.


<R05>

    (a) Enter into a primary tier covered transaction;
    (b) Approve a principal in a primary tier covered transaction;
    (c) Approve a lower tier participant if agency approval of the lower

<R05>
Sec. 919.440  What method do I use to communicate those requirements to participants?

    To communicate the requirement, you must include a term or condition 
in the transaction requiring the participants' compliance with subpart C 
of this part and requiring them to include a similar term or condition 
in lower-tier covered transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 919.445  What action may I take if a primary tier participant knowingly
does business with an excluded or disqualified person?

    If a participant knowingly does business with an excluded or 
disqualified person, you as an agency official may refer the matter for 
suspension and debarment consideration. You may also disallow costs, 
annul or terminate the transaction, issue a stop work order, or take any 
other appropriate remedy.


<R05>
Sec. 919.450  What action may I take if a primary tier participant fails to
disclose the information required under Sec. 919.335?

including the initiation of a suspension or debarment action.


<R04>
                 Subpart E_Excluded Parties List System


<R05>
Sec. 919.500  What is the purpose of the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS)?

    The EPLS is a widely available source of the most current 
information about persons who are excluded or disqualified from covered 
transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 919.505  Who uses the EPLS?

    (a) Federal agency officials use the EPLS to determine whether to 
enter into a transaction with a person, as required under Sec. 919.430.
    (b) Participants also may, but are not required to, use the EPLS to 
determine if--
    (1) Principals of their transactions are excluded or disqualified, 
as required under Sec. 919.320; or
    (2) Persons with whom they are entering into covered transactions at 
the next lower tier are excluded or disqualified.
    (c) The EPLS is available to the general public.


<R05>
Sec. 919.510  Who maintains the EPLS?

    In accordance with the OMB guidelines, the General Services 
Administration (GSA) maintains the EPLS. When a Federal agency takes an 
action to exclude a person under the nonprocurement or procurement 
debarment and suspension system, the agency enters the information about 
the excluded person into the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 919.515  What specific information is in the EPLS?

    (a) At a minimum, the EPLS indicates--
    (1) The full name (where available) and address of each excluded or 
disqualified person, in alphabetical order, with cross references if 
more than one name is involved in a single action;
    (2) The type of action;
    (3) The cause for the action;
    (4) The scope of the action;
    (5) Any termination date for the action;
    (6) The agency and name and telephone number of the agency point of 
contact for the action; and
    (7) The Dun and Bradstreet Number (DUNS), or other similar code 
approved by the GSA, of the excluded or disqualified person, if 
available.
    (b)(1) The database for the EPLS includes a field for the Taxpayer 
Identification Number (TIN) (the social security number (SSN) for an 
individual) of an excluded or disqualified person.
    (2) Agencies disclose the SSN of an individual to verify the 
identity of an individual, only if permitted under the Privacy Act of 
1974 and, if appropriate, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection 
Act of 1988, as codified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a).


<R05>
Sec. 919.520  Who places the information into the EPLS?

    Federal officials who take actions to exclude persons under this 
part or officials who are responsible for identifying disqualified 
persons must enter the following information about those persons into 
the EPLS:
    (a) Information required by Sec. 919.515(a);
    (b) The Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of the excluded or 
disqualified person, including the social security number (SSN) for an 
individual, if the number is available and may be disclosed under law;
    (c) Information about an excluded or disqualified person, generally 
within five working days, after--
    (1) Taking an exclusion action;
    (2) Modifying or rescinding an exclusion action;
    (3) Finding that a person is disqualified; or
    (4) Finding that there has been a change in the status of a person 
who is listed as disqualified.

[[Page 570]]


<R05>
Sec. 919.525  Whom do I ask if I have questions about a person in the EPLS?

    If you have questions about a person in the EPLS, ask the point of 
contact for the Federal agency that placed the person's name into the 
EPLS. You may find the agency point of contact from the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 919.530  Where can I find the EPLS?

    (a) You may access the EPLS through the Internet, currently at 
http://epls.arnet.gov.
    (b) As of November 26, 2003, you may also subscribe to a printed 
version. However, we anticipate discontinuing the printed version. Until 
it is discontinued, you may obtain the printed version by purchasing a 
yearly subscription from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. 
Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, or by calling the 
Government Printing Office Inquiry and Order Desk at (202) 783-3238.


<R04>
   Subpart F_General Principles Relating to Suspension and Debarment 
                                 Actions


<R05>
Sec. 919.600  How do suspension and debarment actions start?

    When we receive information from any source concerning a cause for 
suspension or debarment, we will promptly report and investigate it. We 
refer the question of whether to suspend or debar you to our suspending 
or debarring official for consideration, if appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 919.605  How does suspension differ from debarment?

    Suspension differs from debarment in that--

------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A suspending official . . .           A debarring official . . .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Imposes suspension as a temporary    Imposes debarment for a
 status of ineligibility for              specified period as a final

 and have it lifted.                      debarment.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 919.610  What procedures does the OPM use in suspension and debarment actions?

    In deciding whether to suspend or debar you, we handle the actions 
as informally as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental 
fairness.
    (a) For suspension actions, we use the procedures in this subpart 
and subpart G of this part.
    (b) For debarment actions, we use the procedures in this subpart and 
subpart H of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 919.615  How does the OPM notify a person of a suspension or debarment action?

    (a) The suspending or debarring official sends a written notice to 
the last known street address, facsimile number, or e-mail address of--
    (1) You or your identified counsel; or
    (2) Your agent for service of process, or any of your partners, 
officers, directors, owners, or joint venturers.
    (b) The notice is effective if sent to any of these persons.


<R05>
Sec. 919.620  Do Federal agencies coordinate suspension and debarment actions?

    Yes, when more than one Federal agency has an interest in a 
suspension or debarment, the agencies may consider designating one 
agency as the lead agency for making the decision. Agencies are 
encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their 
suspension and debarment actions.

[[Page 571]]


<R05>
Sec. 919.625  What is the scope of a suspension or debarment?

    If you are suspended or debarred, the suspension or debarment is 
effective as follows:
    (a) Your suspension or debarment constitutes suspension or debarment 
of all of your divisions and other organizational elements from all 
covered transactions, unless the suspension or debarment decision is 
limited--
    (1) By its terms to one or more specifically identified individuals, 
divisions, or other organizational elements; or
    (2) To specific types of transactions.
    (b) Any affiliate of a participant may be included in a suspension 
or debarment action if the suspending or debarring official--
    (1) Officially names the affiliate in the notice; and
    (2) Gives the affiliate an opportunity to contest the action.


<R05>
Sec. 919.630  May the OPM impute conduct of one person to another?

    For purposes of actions taken under this rule, we may impute conduct 
as follows:
    (a) Conduct imputed from an individual to an organization. We may 
impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any 
officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual 
associated with an organization, to that organization when the improper 
conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of 
duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's 
knowledge, approval or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of 
the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval 
or acquiescence.
    (b) Conduct imputed from an organization to an individual, or 
between individuals. We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other 
improper conduct of any organization to an individual, or from one 
individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper 
conduct is imputed either participated in, had knowledge of, or reason 
to know of the improper conduct.
    (c) Conduct imputed from one organization to another organization. 
We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of one 
organization to another organization when the improper conduct occurred 
in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, 
association or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the 
improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control or 
influence the activities of the organization responsible for the 
improper conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is 
evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.

                          Subpart G_Suspension


<R05>
Sec. 919.700  When may the suspending official issue a suspension?

    Suspension is a serious action. Using the procedures of this subpart 
and subpart F of this part, the suspending official may impose 
suspension only when that official determines that--
    (a) There exists an indictment for, or other adequate evidence to 
suspect, an offense listed under Sec. 919.800(a), or
    (b) There exists adequate evidence to suspect any other cause for 
debarment listed under Sec. 919.800(b) through (d); and
    (c) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.

[[Page 572]]


<R05>
Sec. 919.705  What does the suspending official consider in issuing a suspension?

    (a) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the 
suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is 
available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not 
important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can 
reasonably be drawn as a result. During this assessment, the suspending 
official may examine the basic documents, including grants, cooperative 
agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant 
documents.
    (b) An indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other official 
findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/
or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of 
suspension actions.
    (c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the 
public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For 
example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate 
action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the 
circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential 
business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal 
Government.


<R05>
Sec. 919.710  When does a suspension take effect?

    A suspension is effective when the suspending official signs the 
decision to suspend.


<R05>
Sec. 919.715  What notice does the suspending official give me if I am suspended?

    After deciding to suspend you, the suspending official promptly 
sends you a Notice of Suspension advising you--
    (a) That you have been suspended;
    (b) That your suspension is based on--
    (1) An indictment;
    (2) A conviction;
    (3) Other adequate evidence that you have committed irregularities 
which seriously reflect on the propriety of further Federal Government 
dealings with you; or
    (4) Conduct of another person that has been imputed to you, or your 
affiliation with a suspended or debarred person;
    (c) Of any other irregularities in terms sufficient to put you on 
notice without disclosing the Federal Government's evidence;
    (d) Of the cause(s) upon which we relied under Sec. 919.700 for 
imposing suspension;
    (e) That your suspension is for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or resulting legal or debarment 
proceedings;
    (f) Of the applicable provisions of this subpart, Subpart F of this 
part, and any other OPM procedures governing suspension decision making; 
and
    (g) Of the governmentwide effect of your suspension from procurement 
and nonprocurement programs and activities.


<R05>
Sec. 919.720  How may I contest a suspension?

    If you as a respondent wish to contest a suspension, you or your 
representative must provide the suspending official with information in 
opposition to the suspension. You may do this orally or in writing, but 
any information provided orally that you consider important must also be 
submitted in writing for the official record.


<R05>
Sec. 919.725  How much time do I have to contest a suspension?

    (a) As a respondent you or your representative must either send, or 
make arrangements to appear and present, the information and argument to 
the suspending official within 30 days after you receive the Notice of 
Suspension.
    (b) We consider the notice to be received by you--
    (1) When delivered, if we mail the notice to the last known street 
address, or five days after we send it if the letter is undeliverable;
    (2) When sent, if we send the notice by facsimile or five days after 
we send it if the facsimile is undeliverable; or
    (3) When delivered, if we send the notice by e-mail or five days 
after we send it if the e-mail is undeliverable.

[[Page 573]]


<R05>
Sec. 919.730  What information must I provide to the suspending official if I 
contest a suspension?

    (a) In addition to any information and argument in opposition, as a 
respondent your submission to the suspending official must identify--
    (1) Specific facts that contradict the statements contained in the 
Notice of Suspension. A general denial is insufficient to raise a 
genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension;
    (2) All existing, proposed, or prior exclusions under regulations 
implementing E.O. 12549 and all similar actions taken by Federal, state, 
or local agencies, including administrative agreements that affect only 
those agencies;
    (3) All criminal and civil proceedings not included in the Notice of 
Suspension that grew out of facts relevant to the cause(s) stated in the 
notice; and
    (4) All of your affiliates.
    (b) If you fail to disclose this information, or provide false 
information, the OPM may seek further criminal, civil or administrative 
action against you, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 919.735  Under what conditions do I get an additional opportunity to
challenge the facts on which the suspension is based?

    (a) You as a respondent will not have an additional opportunity to 
challenge the facts if the suspending official determines that--
    (1) Your suspension is based upon an indictment, conviction, civil 
judgment, or other finding by a Federal, State, or local body for which 
an opportunity to contest the facts was provided;
    (2) Your presentation in opposition contains only general denials to 
information contained in the Notice of Suspension;
    (3) The issues raised in your presentation in opposition to the 
suspension are not factual in nature, or are not material to the 
suspending official's initial decision to suspend, or the official's 
decision whether to continue the suspension; or
    (4) On the basis of advice from the Department of Justice, an office 
of the United States Attorney, a State attorney general's office, or a 
State or local prosecutor's office, that substantial interests of the 
government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the 
same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced by conducting fact-
finding.
    (b) You will have an opportunity to challenge the facts if the 
suspending official determines that--
    (1) The conditions in paragraph (a) of this section do not exist; 
and
    (2) Your presentation in opposition raises a genuine dispute over 
facts material to the suspension.
    (c) If you have an opportunity to challenge disputed material facts 
under this section, the suspending official or designee must conduct 
additional proceedings to resolve those facts.


<R05>
Sec. 919.740  Are suspension proceedings formal?

    (a) Suspension proceedings are conducted in a fair and informal 
manner. The suspending official may use flexible procedures to allow you 
to present matters in opposition. In so doing, the suspending official 
is not required to follow formal rules of evidence or procedure in 
creating an official record upon which the official will base a final 
suspension decision.
    (b) You as a respondent or your representative must submit any 
documentary evidence you want the suspending official to consider.


<R05>
Sec. 919.745  How is fact-finding conducted?

    (a) If fact-finding is conducted--
    (1) You may present witnesses and other evidence, and confront any 
witness presented; and
    (2) The fact-finder must prepare written findings of fact for the 
record.
    (b) A transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings must be made, 
unless you as a respondent and the OPM agree to waive it in advance. If 
you want a copy of the transcribed record, you may purchase it.


<R05>
Sec. 919.750  What does the suspending official consider in deciding whether to continue or terminate my suspension?

    (a) The suspending official bases the decision on all information 
contained in the official record. The record includes--

[[Page 574]]

    (1) All information in support of the suspending official's initial 
decision to suspend you;
    (2) Any further information and argument presented in support of, or 
opposition to, the suspension; and
    (3) Any transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings.
    (b) The suspending official may refer disputed material facts to 
another official for findings of fact. The suspending official may 
reject any resulting findings, in whole or in part, only after 
specifically determining them to be arbitrary, capricious, or clearly 
erroneous.


<R05>
Sec. 919.755  When will I know whether the suspension is continued or terminated?

    The suspending official must make a written decision whether to 
continue, modify, or terminate your suspension within 45 days of closing 
the official record. The official record closes upon the suspending 
official's receipt of final submissions, information and findings of 
fact, if any. The suspending official may extend that period for good 
cause.


<R05>
Sec. 919.760  How long may my suspension last?

    (a) If legal or debarment proceedings are initiated at the time of, 
or during your suspension, the suspension may continue until the 
conclusion of those proceedings. However, if proceedings are not 
initiated, a suspension may not exceed 12 months.
    (b) The suspending official may extend the 12 month limit under 
paragraph (a) of this section for an additional 6 months if an office of 
a U.S. Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or other responsible 
prosecuting official requests an extension in writing. In no event may a 
suspension exceed 18 months without initiating proceedings under 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The suspending official must notify the appropriate officials 
under paragraph (b) of this section of an impending termination of a 
suspension at least 30 days before the 12 month period expires to allow 
the officials an opportunity to request an extension.

<R05>
Sec. 919.815  How may I contest a proposed debarment?

    If you as a respondent wish to contest a proposed debarment, you or

for debarment exists. The official may consider the seriousness of your 
acts or omissions and the mitigating or aggravating factors set forth at 
Sec. 919.860.
    (b) The debarring official bases the decision on all information 
contained in the official record. The record includes--
    (1) All information in support of the debarring official's proposed

official that you are presently responsible and that debarment is not 
necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 919.860  What factors may influence the debarring official's decision?

    This section lists the mitigating and aggravating factors that the 
debarring official may consider in determining whether to debar you and 
the length of your debarment period. The debarring official may consider 
other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a 
particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as 
one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative 
of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the 
debarring official may consider the following factors:
    (a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may 
result from the wrongdoing.
    (b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing.
    (c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For 
example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State 
agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the 
debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the 
debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior 
history of wrongdoing.
    (d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an 
agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate 
in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of 
conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in 
this part.
    (e) Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a 
Federal agency or a State or local government that is not governmentwide 
but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for 
debarment specified in this part.
    (f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried 
out the wrongdoing.
    (g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and 
recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for 
debarment.
    (h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and 
administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any 
investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and 
have made or agreed to make full restitution.
    (i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies 
during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In 
determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may 
consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all 
pertinent information known to you.
    (j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.
    (k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the 
wrongdoing.
    (l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or 
remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing 
programs to prevent recurrence.
    (m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense.
    (n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the 
debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a 
timely manner.
    (o) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances 
surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the 
investigation available to the debarring official.
    (p) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal 
control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred.
    (q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against 
the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause 
for debarment.
    (r) Whether you have had adequate time to eliminate the 
circumstances within your organization that led to the cause for the 
debarment.
    (s) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a 
particular case.

[[Page 578]]


<R05>
Sec. 919.865  How long may my debarment last?

    (a) If the debarring official decides to debar you, your period of 
debarment will be based on the seriousness of the cause(s) upon which 
your debarment is based. Generally, debarment should not exceed three 
years. However, if circumstances warrant, the debarring official may 
impose a longer period of debarment.
    (b) In determining the period of debarment, the debarring official 
may consider the factors in Sec. 919.860. If a suspension has preceded 
your debarment, the debarring official must consider the time you were 
suspended.
    (c) If the debarment is for a violation of the provisions of the 
Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, your period of debarment may not exceed 
five years.


<R05>
Sec. 919.870  When do I know if the debarring official debars me?

    (a) The debarring official must make a written decision whether to 
debar within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record 
closes upon the debarring official's receipt of final submissions, 
information and findings of fact, if any. The debarring official may 
extend that period for good cause.
    (b) The debarring official sends you written notice, pursuant to 
Sec. 919.615 that the official decided, either--

    (i) Refers to the Notice of Proposed Debarment;
    (ii) Specifies the reasons for your debarment;
    (iii) States the period of your debarment, including the effective 
dates; and
    (iv) Advises you that your debarment is effective for covered

Regulation (48 CFR chapter 1), throughout the executive branch of the 
Federal Government unless an agency head or an authorized designee 
grants an exception.


<R05>
Sec. 919.875  May I ask the debarring official to reconsider a decision to debar me?

    Yes, as a debarred person you may ask the debarring official to 
reconsider the debarment decision or to reduce the time period or scope 
of the debarment. However, you must put your request in writing and 
support it with documentation.


<R05>
Sec. 919.880  What factors may influence the debarring official during reconsideration?

    The debarring official may reduce or terminate your debarment based 
on--
    (a) Newly discovered material evidence;
    (b) A reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which your 
debarment was based;
    (c) A bona fide change in ownership or management;
    (d) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; 
or
    (e) Other reasons the debarring official finds appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 919.885  May the debarring official extend a debarment?

    (a) Yes, the debarring official may extend a debarment for an 
additional period, if that official determines that an extension is 
necessary to protect the public interest.
    (b) However, the debarring official may not extend a debarment 
solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the 
initial debarment action was based.
    (c) If the debarring official decides that a debarment for an 
additional period is necessary, the debarring official must follow the 
applicable procedures in this subpart, and subpart F of this part, to 
extend the debarment.

a probationary and career-conditional period before absolute appointment 
does not apply to an appointment to an administrative law judge 
position.
    (c) Appointment of incumbents of newly classified administrative law 
judge positions. An agency may appoint as an administrative law judge an 
employee who is serving in a position which is classified as an 
administrative law judge position on the basis of legislation, Executive 
order, or decision of a court, if--
    (1) The employee has a competitive status or was serving in an 
excepted position under a permanent appointment;
    (2) The employee was serving in the position on the date of the 
legislation, Executive order, or decision of the court, on which the 
classification of the position is based;
    (3) OPM receives a recommendation for the employee's appointment 
from the agency concerned not later than 6 months after classification 
of the position on the basis of the legislation, Executive order, or 
decision of the court; and

[[Page 587]]

    (4) OPM finds that the employee meets the current examination 
requirements for the position under OPM Examination Announcement No. 
318. In an emergency situation, when the needs of an agency require it, 
OPM may authorize the conditional appointment of an employee to an 
administrative law judge position pending final decision on the 
employee's eligibility for absolute appointment under this paragraph.
    (d) Appointment of legislative and judicial employees. An agency may 
appoint a former employee of the legislative or judicial branch to an 
administrative law judge position if OPM finds that the employee meets 
current examination requirements under OPM Examination Announcement No. 
318 and is otherwise eligible under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 3304(c).
    (e) Appointment of incumbents of nonadministrative law judge 
positions. Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, 
an agency may not appoint an employee who is serving in a position other 
than an administrative law judge position to an administrative law judge 
position other than by selection from a certificate of eligibles 
furnished by OPM from the open competitive register.

named by OPM.
    (b) When OPM places one of an agency's administrative law judge 
positions at a higher level on the basis of the position's managerial 
and administrative nature, an agency may promote one of its 
administrative law judges to such a position, provided the selection 
and/or promotion is in accordance with regular civil service procedures.

accordance with regular civil service procedures and merit system 
principles.


<R05>
Sec. 930.206  Transfer.

    (a) An agency may transfer an administrative law judge from another

also apply to reemployment and restoration to administrative law judge 
positions.


<R05>
Sec. 930.209  Detail and assignment to other duties.

    (a) An agency may not detail an employee who is not an 
administrative law judge to an administrative law judge position.
    (b) An agency may assign an administrative law judge (by detail or 
otherwise) to perform duties that are not the duties of an 
administrative law judge without prior approval of OPM only when--
    (1) The other duties are not inconsistent with the duties and 
responsibilities of an administrative law judge;
    (2) The assignment is to last no longer than 120 days; and
    (3) The administrative law judge has not had an aggregate of more 
than 120 days of those assignments or details within the preceding 12 
months.
    (c) On a showing by an agency that it is in the public interest to 
do so, OPM may authorize a waiver of paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this 
section.
    (d) An agency may detail an administrative law judge from one 
administrative law judge position to another in the same agency, without 
the prior approval of OPM, provided the detail is in accordance with 
regular civil service procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 930.210  Pay.

    (a) OPM will place each administrative law judges position in one of 
the three grades or levels of basic pay, AL-3, AL-2, or AL-1, of the 
Administrative Law Judge Pay System established under 5 U.S.C. 5372 in 
accordance with this section. AL-3 has six rates of basic pay, A, B, C, 
D, E, and F.
    (1) The rate of basic pay for AL-3, rate A, may not be less than 65 
percent of the rate of basic pay for level IV of the Executive Schedule. 
The rate of basic pay for AL-1 may not exceed the rate for level IV of 
the Executive Schedule.
    (2) The President will determine the appropriate adjustment for each 
rate in the Administrative Law Judge Pay System, subject to paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section. Such adjustments will take effect on the first 
day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after the first 
day of the month in which adjustments in the General Schedule rates of 
basic pay under 5 U.S.C. 5303 take effect.
    (3) An agency must use the following procedures to convert an 
administrative law judge's annual rate of basic pay to an hourly, daily, 
weekly, or biweekly rate:
    (i) To derive an hourly rate, divide the annual rate of pay by 2,087 
and round to the nearest cent, counting one-half cent and over as the 
next higher cent.
    (ii) To derive a daily rate, multiply the hourly rate by the number 
of daily hours of service required by the administrative appeals judge's 
basic daily tour of duty.
    (iii) To derive a weekly or biweekly rate, multiply the hourly rate 
by 40 or 80, as the case may be.
    (b) An agency may not grant a monetary and honorary award under 5 
U.S.C. 4503 for superior accomplishment by an administrative law judge 
in the performance of adjudicatory functions.
    (c) AL-3 is the basic pay level for administrative law judge 
positions filled through competitive examination under OPM Examination 
Announcement No. 318, as provided in section 930.203 of this part.
    (d) Subject to the approval of OPM, agencies may establish 
administrative law judge positions at pay levels AL-2 and AL-1. 
Administrative law judge positions may be placed at such levels when 
they involve significant administrative and managerial responsibilities.
    (e) Judges must serve at least 1 year in each AL level, in an 
equivalent or higher level in positions in the Federal service, before 
advancing to the next higher level and may advance only one level at a 
time.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, upon 
appointment to an administrative law judge position placed in AL-3, an 
administrative law judge shall be paid at the minimum rate A of AL-3, 
and shall be automatically advanced successively to rates B, C, and D of 
that level upon completion of 52 weeks of service in the next lower 
rate, and to rates E and F of that level upon completion of 104 weeks of 
service

[[Page 589]]

in the next lower rate. Time in a nonpay status is generally creditable 
service in the computation of a waiting period only in so far as it does 
not exceed 2 weeks per year for each 52 weeks of service. However, time 
in a nonpay status is also fully creditable if absence is due to 
military service, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 8331(13), or due to receipt of 
injury compensation under chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code.
    (g) Upon appointment to a position at AL-3, an administrative law 
judge will be paid at the minimum rate A, unless the administrative law 
judge is eligible for a higher rate B, C, D, E, or F because of prior 
service or superior qualifications, as follows--
    (1) An agency may offer an administrative law judge applicant with 
prior Federal service a higher than minimum rate, without obtaining the 
prior approval of OPM in order to pay the rate that is next above the 
applicant's highest previous Federal rate of pay, up to the maximum rate 
F.
    (2) An agency may offer an administrative law judge applicant with 
superior qualifications a higher than minimum rate if it first obtains 
approval from OPM to offer such a higher rate to an applicant who is 
within reach on a certificate of eligible administrative law judge 
applicants in order to pay that rate of pay that is next above the 
applicant's existing pay or earnings up to the maximum rate F. 
``Superior qualifications'' for applicants includes having legal 
practice before the hiring agency, having practice in another forum with 
legal issues of concern to the hiring agency, or having an outstanding 
reputation among others in the field. OPM will approve such payment of 
higher than minimum rates for applicants with superior qualifications 
only when it is clearly necessary to meet the needs of the Government.
    (h) Subject to the approval of OPM, and on the appropriate 
recommendation of the employing agency, an agency may on a one-time 
basis, advance an administrative law judge in a position at AL-3 with 
added administrative and managerial duties and responsibilities one rate 
beyond that allowed under current pay rates for AL-3, up to the maximum 
Rate F.
    (i) Upon appointment to an administrative law judge position placed 
at AL-2 or AL-1, administrative law judges will be paid at the 
established rates for those levels.
    (j) In making initial pay adjustments for administrative law judges 
from positions paid under the General Schedule to positions paid under 
the new pay system established under 5 U.S.C. 5372, the rate of basic 
pay for any such judge shall, upon conversion to the new pay system, be 
at least equal to the rate that was payable to that individual 
immediately before such conversion.
    (k) Except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section, on the 
first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after 
February 10, 1991, administrative law judges will be converted from the 
General Schedule to AL-3, 2, and 1 as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
             General schedule                            AL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GS-15, Steps 1-2-3-4......................  AL-3, Rate A.

GS-16, Step 9.............................  AL-3, Rate F.
GS-17, Steps 1-5..........................  AL-2.
GS-18.....................................  AL-1.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (l) In making the initial conversion from the General Schedule pay 
rates to the new AL pay system for administrative law judges, effective 
on the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or 
after February 10, 1991, those GS-15 and GS-16 administrative law judges 
receiving the 8 percent interim geographic adjustments authorized by 
Schedule 9 of Executive Order 12736 of December 12, 1990, will convert 
as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
             General schedule                            AL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GS-15, Steps 1-2..........................  AL-3, Rate A.
GS-15, Steps 3-4-5........................  AL-3, Rate B.
GS-15, Steps 6-7..........................  AL-3, Rate C.
GS-15, Steps 8-9-10.......................  AL-3, Rate D.
GS-16, Steps 1-2..........................  AL-3, Rate C.
GS-16, Steps 3-4..........................  AL-3, Rate D.
GS-16, Steps 5-6-7........................  AL-3, Rate E.
GS-16, Steps 8-9..........................  AL-3, Rate F.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (m) Agencies must document all pay changes made in accordance with 
this section by completing a Standard Form 50, or equivalent, in the 
usual manner and forwarding an extra copy

FR 63909, Dec. 11, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 930.211  Performance rating.

    An agency shall not rate the performance of an administrative law 
judge.


<R05>
Sec. 930.212  Rotation of administrative law judges.

    Insofar as practicable, an agency shall assign its administrative 
law judges in rotation to cases.


<R05>
Sec. 930.213  Use of administrative law judges on detail from other agencies.

    (a) An agency that is occasionally or temporarily insufficiently 
staffed with administrative law judges may ask OPM to provide for the 
temporary use by the agency of the services of an administrative law 
judge of another agency. The agency request should--
    (1) Identify and describe briefly the nature of the case(s) to be 
heard (including parties and representatives when available);
    (2) Specify the legal authority under which the use of an 
administrative law judge is required; and
    (3) Demonstrate that the agency has no administrative law judge 
available to hear the case(s).
    (b) OPM, with the consent of the agency in which an administrative 
law judge is employed, will select the administrative law judge to be 
used, and will name the date or period for which the administrative law 
judge is to be made available for detail to the agency in need of his or 
her services.
    (c) Such details generally will be reimbursable by the agency 
requesting the detail.


<R05>
Sec. 930.214  Actions against administrative law judges.

    (a) Procedures. An agency may remove, suspend, reduce in grade, 
reduce in pay, or furlough for 30 days or less, an administrative law 
judge only for good cause, established and determined by the Merit 
Systems Protection Board on the record and after opportunity for a 
hearing before the Board as provided in 5 U.S.C. 7521 and Sec. Sec. 
1201.131 through 1201.136 of this title. Procedures for adverse actions 
by agencies under part 752 of this chapter are not applicable to actions 
against administrative law judges.
    (b) Status during removal proceedings. In exceptional cases when 
there are circumstances by reason of which the retention of an 
administrative law judge in his or her position, pending adjudication of 
the existence of good cause for his or her removal, would be detrimental 
to the interests of the Government, the agency may either:
    (1) Assign the administrative law judge to duties not inconsistent 
with his or her normal duties in which these conditions would not exist;
    (2) Place the administrative law judge on leave with his or her 
consent;
    (3) Carry the administrative law judge on appropriate leave (annual 
or sick leave, leave without pay, or absence without leave) if he or she 
is voluntarily absent for reasons not originating with the agency; or
    (4) If none of the alternatives in paragraphs (b) (1), (2) and (3) 
of this section is available, agencies may consider placing the 
administrative law judge in a paid, non-duty or administrative leave 
status.
    (c) Exceptions from procedures. The procedures in this subpart 
governing the removal, suspension, reduction in grade, reduction in pay, 
or furlough of 30 days or less of administrative law judges do not apply 
in making dismissals or taking other actions requested by OPM under 
Sec. Sec. 5.2 and 5.3 of this chapter; nor to dismissals or other 
actions made by agencies in the interest of national security under 5 
U.S.C. 7532; nor to reduction-in-force action taken by agencies under 5 
U.S.C. 3502; nor any action initiated by the Special Counsel of the 
Merit Systems Protection Board under 5 U.S.C. 1206.


<R05>
Sec. 930.215  Reduction in force.

    (a) Retention preference regulations. Except as modified by this 
section, the reduction-in-force regulations in part 351 of this chapter 
apply to reductions in force of administrative law judges.

[[Page 591]]

    (b) Determination of retention standing. In determining retention 
standing in a reduction in force, each agency will classify its 
administrative law judges in groups and subgroups according to tenure of 
employment, veteran preference, and service date in the manner 
prescribed in part 351 of this chapter. However, as administrative law 
judges are not given performance ratings, the provisions in part 351 of 
this chapter referring to the effect of performance ratings on retention 
standing are not applicable to administrative law judges.
    (c) Placement Assistance. (1) Administrative law judges who are 
reached by an agency reduction in force and who are notified they are to 
be separated are eligible for placement assistance under--
    (i) Agency reemployment priority lists established and maintained by 
agencies under subpart J of part 351 of this chapter for all agency 
tenure group I career employees displaced in a reduction in force;
    (ii) Agency and OPM priority placement programs under subpart C of 
part 330 of this chapter for all agency tenure group I, career employees 
displaced in a reduction in force.
    (2) On request of administrative law judges who are reached by an 
agency in a reduction in force and who are notified they are to be 
separated, furloughed for more than 30 days, or demoted, OPM will place 
their names on OPM's priority referral list for administrative law 
judges displaced in a reduction in force for the grade or level in which 
they last served and for all lower grades or levels.
    (3) An administrative law judge may file a request under paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, for placement on the OPM priority referral list, 
at any time after the receipt of the specific reduction-in-force notice, 
but not later than 90 days after the date of separation, furlough for 
more than 30 days, or demotion. Placement assistance through the OPM 
priority referral list continues for 2 years from either the effective 
date of the reduction-in-force action, or the date assistance is 
requested if a timely request is made. Eligibility of the displaced 
administrative law judge for the OPM priority referral list is 
terminated earlier upon the administrative law judge's written request, 
acceptance of a non-temporary, full-time administrative law judge 
position, or declination of more than one offer of full-time employment 
as an administrative law judge at or above the grade level held when 
reached for reduction in force at geographic locations previously 
indicated as acceptable.
    (4) The displaced administrative law judge will file with the 
request for priority referral by OPM a Standard Form 171, Application 
for Federal Employment, and a copy of the reduction-in-force notice. 
Also, the displaced administrative law judge may ask OPM to limit 
consideration for vacant positions at any grade level for which 
qualified to specific geographic areas.
    (5) When there is no administrative law judge on the agency's 
reemployment priority list, but there is an administrative law judge who 
has been placed on the OPM priority referral list (paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section), the agency may fill a vacant administrative law judge 
position only by selection from the OPM priority referral list, unless 
it obtains the prior approval of OPM for filling the vacant position 
under Sec. 930.203a (a), (c), (d) and (e); Sec. 930.204; Sec. 
930.205, Sec. 930.206; or Sec. 930.207 of this subpart. OPM will grant 
such approval only under the extraordinary circumstance that the 
candidate(s) not on the OPM priority referral list possesses experience 
and qualifications superior to the displaced administrative law judge(s) 
on the list.
    (6) Referral, certification, and selection of administrative law 
judges from OPM's priority referral list are made without regard to 
selective certification or special qualification procedures which may 
have been applied in the original appointment in accordance with OPM 
Examination Announcement No. 318.

Sec. 930.216  Temporary reemployment: senior administrative law judges.

    (a)(1) Subject to the requirements and limitations of this section, 
the following annuitants, as defined by 5 U.S.C. 8331, who are receiving 
an annuity from the Civil Service Retirement

[[Page 592]]

and Disability Fund may be temporarily reemployed as administrative law 
judges by an agency that has temporary, irregular workload requirements 
for conducting proceedings in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557:
    (i) Annuitants who have served with absolute status as 
administrative law judges under 5 U.S.C. 3105; and
    (ii) Annuitants who have met current examination requirements set 
forth in OPM Examination Announcement 318 (including the requirement to 
maintain a current license to practice law under the laws of a state, 
the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any 
territorial court established under the Constitution).
    (2) These retired administrative law judges who are so reemployed 
will be known as senior administrative law judges.
    (b) Retired administrative law judges who meet the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section and who are available for temporary 
reemployment must notify OPM in writing of their availability, giving 
their full names, addresses, telephone numbers, names of the agencies 
where they served as administrative law judges, and jurisdictions in 
which they are currently licensed to practice law. OPM will maintain a 
master list of such retired administrative law judges for use in 
responding to agency requests for such administrative law judges.
    (c) An agency that wishes to temporarily reemploy administrative law 
judges must submit a written request to OPM. The request will--
    (1) Identify the statutory authority under which the administrative 
law judge is expected to conduct proceedings;
    (2) Demonstrate that the agency is occasionally or temporarily 
understaffed;
    (3) Specify the tour of duty, location, period of time, or 
particular case(s), for the requested reemployment; and
    (4) Describe any special qualifications desired in the retired 
administrative law judge that it wishes to reemploy, such as experience 
in a particular field, agency, or substantive area of law.
    (d) OPM will approve agency requests for temporary reemployment of 
retired administrative law judges for a specified period or periods 
provided--
    (1) The requesting agency fully justifies the need for an 
administrative law judge for formal proceedings and demonstrates that it 
is occasionally or temporarily understaffed; and
    (2) No other administrative law judge with the appropriate 
qualifications is available through OPM under Sec. 930.213 of this 
subpart to perform the occasional or temporary work for which 
reemployment is requested.
    (e) Upon approval of an agency request to reemploy a retired 
administrative law judge, OPM will select from its master list of 
retired administrative law judges, in rotation to the extent 
practicable, those retired judges who it determines meet agency 
requirements. OPM will then provide a list of such individuals to the 
requesting agency and the agency must then select from that list a 
retired administrative law judge for reemployment.
    (f) Reemployment of retired administrative law judges is subject to 
investigation of suitability in accordance with Sec. Sec. 731.201 
through 731.303 of this chapter. It is also subject to conflict of 
interest and security investigation requirements by the appointing 
agency.
    (g) Reemployment as senior administrative law judges will be for 
either a specified period not to exceed 1 year; or such periods as may 
be necessary for the reemployed administrative law judge to conduct and 
complete the hearing of one or more specified cases and issue decisions 
therein. Upon agency request, OPM may either reduce or extend such 
period of reemployment, as necessary, to coincide with changing staffing 
requirements, but not to exceed 1 year.
    (h) An agency may assign its senior administrative law judges to 
either (1) hear one or more specific cases; or (2) hear, in normal 
rotation to the extent practicable, a number of cases on its docket and 
issue decisions therein.
    (i) Hours of duty, administrative support services, and travel 
reimbursement for senior administrative law judges will be determined by 
the employing agency in accordance with the same rules and procedures 
that are generally applicable to employees.

[[Page 593]]

    (j) A senior administrative law judge serves subject to the same 
limitations on performance appraisal and reduction in pay or removal as 
any other administrative law judge employed under this subpart and 5 
U.S.C. 3105. An agency will not rate the performance of a senior 
administrative law judge. Reduction-in-pay or removal actions may not be 
taken against senior administrative law judges during the period of 
reemployment, except for good cause established and determined by the 
Merit Systems Protection Board after opportunity for a hearing on the 
record before the Board as provided in 5 U.S.C. 7521 and Sec. Sec. 
1201.131 through 1201.136 of this title.
    (k) A senior administrative law judge will be paid by the employing 
agency the current rate of pay for the level at which the duties to be 
performed have been placed and at the lowest rate of the level that is 
nearest (when rounded up) to the highest previous grade and step, or 
level and rate, attained as an administrative law judge before 
retirement. An amount equal to the annuity allocable to the period of 
actual employment will be deducted from his or her pay and deposited in 
the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Civil Service 
Retirement and Disability Fund.

<R05>
Sec. 950.102  Scope of the Combined Federal Campaign.

    (a) The CFC is the only authorized solicitation of employees in the 
Federal workplace on behalf of charitable organizations. A campaign may 
be conducted during a period, as determined by the LFCC, from September 
1 through December 15 at every Federal agency in the campaign community 
in accordance with these regulations. Except as provided in this 
section, no other solicitation on behalf of charitable organizations may 
be conducted in the Federal workplace. Upon written request, the 
Director may grant permission for solicitations of Federal employees, 
outside the CFC, in support of victims in cases of emergencies and 
disasters. Emergencies and disasters are defined as any hurricane, 
tornado storm, flood, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, 
tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, 
drought, fire, explosion, or other catastrophe in any

[[Page 596]]

part of the world. No such permissions will be granted for such 
solicitations during the period September 1 through December 15, except 
at the discretion of the Director upon a showing of extraordinary 
circumstances.
    (b) These regulations do not apply to the collection of gifts-in-
kind, such as food, clothing and toys, or to the solicitation of Federal 
employees outside of the Federal workplace as defined by the applicable 
Agency Head consistent with General Services Administration regulations 
and any other applicable laws or regulations.
    (c) The Director exercises general supervision over all operations 
of the CFC, and takes all necessary steps to ensure the achievement of 
campaign objectives. Any disputes relating to the interpretation or 
implementation of this part may be submitted to the Director for 
resolution. The decisions of the Director are final for administrative 
purposes. OPM has the authority to audit, investigate, and report on the 
administration of any campaign, the organization that administers the 
campaign, and any national, international and local federation, 
federation member or independent organization that participates in the 
campaign for compliance with these regulations. The Director resolves 
any issues reported and determines sanctions or penalties, as warranted 
under Sec. 950.603.
    (d) Heads of departments or agencies may establish policies and 
procedures applicable to solicitations conducted by organizations 
composed of civilian employees or members of the uniformed services 
among their own members for organizational support or for the benefit of 
welfare funds for their members. Such solicitations are not subject to 
these regulations, and therefore do not require permission of the 
Director.

[60 FR 57890, Nov. 24, 1995, as amended at 63 FR 65637, Nov. 30, 1998; 
71 FR 67283, Nov. 20, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 950.103  Establishing a local campaign.

    (a) The Director establishes and maintains the official list of 
local campaigns and the geographical area each covers. There is no 
prerequisite regarding the Federal employee population needed to 
establish or maintain a CFC. However, rather than establishing or 
maintaining small campaigns, OPM encourages mergers and expansions of 
campaigns to promote efficiency and economy.
    (b) The Director establishes an LFCC to govern the conduct of the 
local CFC. The LFCC will, whenever possible, be comprised of members of 
local Federal inter-agency organizations, such as Federal Executive 
Boards, Federal Executive Associations, Federal Business Associations 
or, in the absence of such organizations, self-organized associations of 
local Federal officials. These groups will include local Federal agency 
heads or their representatives. It may also include representatives of 
employee unions and other employee groups. Rotation of the LFCC Chair 
position among the LFCC members is encouraged. For continuity, each LFCC 
should appoint a Vice Chair who would be expected to serve at the 
conclusion of the Chair's term.
    (c) The agency head at each Federal installation within a campaign 
area shall:
    (1) Become familiar with all CFC regulations,
    (2) Cooperate with the representatives of the LFCC and PCFO in 
organizing and conducting the campaign,
    (3) Initiate official campaigns within their offices or 
installations and provide support for the campaign, and
    (4) Assure the campaign is conducted in accordance with these 
regulations.
    (d) Once a campaign has been established, agency heads may not 
discontinue solicitation of Federal employees within their organization 
without the written approval of the Director.
    (e) Any change in the geographical boundaries of local campaigns may 
be made only upon the express written permission of the Director.
    (f) Each year the LFCC must establish the time period during which 
CFC solicitation may take place. The solicitation may not begin before 
September 1 and in no event will it extend beyond December 15 of each 
year.
    (g) Current Federal civilian and active duty military employees may 
be solicited for contributions using payroll deduction, checks, money 
orders,

[[Page 597]]

or cash, or by electronic means, including credit cards, as approved by 
the Director. Contractor personnel, credit union employees and other 
persons present on Federal premises, as well as retired Federal 
employees, may make single contributions to the CFC through checks, 
money orders, or cash, or by electronic means, including credit cards, 
as approved by the Director. These non-Federal personnel may not be 
solicited, but donations offered by such persons must be accepted by the 
local campaigns.
    (h) A Federal employee whose official duty station is outside the 
geographic boundaries of an established CFC may not be solicited in that 
CFC. A Federal employee may participate in a particular CFC only if that 
employee's official duty station is located within the geographic 
boundaries of that CFC. This restriction may be discontinued upon 
implementation of appropriate electronic technology that allows removal 
of the need for geographic restrictions on giving as determined by the 
Director. Upon a showing of extraordinary circumstances, as determined 
in the sole discretion of the Director, Federal employees may contribute 
in support of victims in cases of emergencies and disasters defined in 
Sec. 950.102(a) outside the geographic boundaries of their 
participating CFC. Such contributions can be check, money order, or cash 
or by electronic means, including credit cards, as approved by the 
Director, but shall not be made through payroll deduction.

[60 FR 57890, Nov. 24, 1995, as amended at 71 FR 67284, Nov. 20, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 950.104  Local Federal Coordinating Committee responsibilities.

    (a) All members of the LFCC should develop an understanding of 
campaign regulations and procedures. The LFCC is the central point of 
information regarding the CFC among Federal employees.
    (b) The responsibilities of the LFCC include, but are not limited 
to, the following:
    (1) Maintaining minutes of LFCC meetings and responding promptly to 
any request for information from the Director.
    (2) Naming a campaign chairperson and notifying the Director when 
the chairperson changes.
    (3) Determining the eligibility of local organizations that apply to 
participate in the local campaign. This is the exclusive responsibility 
of the LFCC and may not be delegated to the PCFO.
    (4) Ensuring that the list of charities determined by the Director 
to be nationally eligible to participate in all local campaigns is 
reproduced in the Charity List in accordance with OPM instructions.
    (5) Ensuring that the Charity List and pledge form are produced in 
accordance with these regulations and instructions from the Director.
    (6) Encouraging local Federal agencies to appoint loaned executives 
to assist in the campaign. CFC loaned executives' time should be charged 
to regular working hours. It is not appropriate to place a CFC loaned 
executive on administrative leave, leave without pay, or annual leave. 
Federal loaned executives are prohibited from working on non-CFC 
fundraising activities during duty hours.
    (7) Establishing a network of employee keyworkers and volunteers and 
participating in interagency briefing sessions and kick-off meetings.
    (8) Ensuring that, to the extent reasonably possible, every employee 
is given the opportunity to participate in the CFC, and ensuring 
employee designations are honored.
    (9) Ensuring that the PCFO includes in keyworker training 
instructions to encourage employees to designate the charitable 
organizations they wish to receive their donations and specific 
information on how general designation monies are distributed.
    (10) Ensuring that contributions are distributed in accordance with 
the method described in these regulations.
    (11) Ensuring that no employee is coerced in any way to participate 
in the campaign.
    (12) Bringing allegations of coercion to the attention of the 
Director and the employee's agency and providing a mechanism to review 
employee complaints of undue pressure and coercion

[[Page 598]]

in Federal fundraising. Federal agencies shall provide procedures and 
assign responsibility for the investigation of such complaints. 
Personnel offices shall be responsible for informing employees of the 
proper channels for pursuing such complaints.
    (13) Notifying the Director of any significant problems or 
controversies concerning the campaign that the LFCC cannot resolve by 
applying these regulations. The LFCC must abide by the Director's 
decisions on all matters concerning the campaign.
    (14) Ensuring the PCFO does not use the services of consulting 
firms, advertising firms or similar business organizations to perform 
the policy-making or decisionmaking functions in the CFC. A PCFO may, 
however, contract with entities or individuals such as banks, 
accountants, lawyers, and other vendors of goods and/or services to 
assist in accomplishing its administrative tasks.
    (15) Ensuring that the activities and functions required of the PCFO 
are kept separate from any non-CFC operations of the organization. The 
LFCC must verify that the PCFO keeps and maintains CFC financial records 
and interest bearing bank accounts separate from the PCFO's non-CFC 
financial records and bank accounts.
    (16) Monitoring the work of the PCFO, and inspecting closely the 
annual audit required of the PCFO pursuant to Sec. 950.105(d)(9) for 
compliance with these regulations.
    (17) Authorizing to the PCFO reimbursement of only those campaign 
expenses that are legitimate CFC costs and are adequately documented. 
Total reimbursable expenses may not exceed the approved campaign budget 
by more than 10 percent.
    (18) Determining whether each local federation, federation member, 
and unaffiliated organization that applies to participate in the local 
campaign has completed the sanctions compliance certification required 
pursuant to Sec. 950.605. The LFCC must deny participation to any 
federation or organization that has not completed the sanctions 
compliance certification.
    (c) The LFCC must select a PCFO to act as its fiscal agent and 
campaign coordinator on the basis of presentations made to the LFCC as 
described in Sec. 950.105(c). The LFCC may, in its discretion, select a 
PCFO to serve in that role for up to three campaign periods, subject to 
renewal each year following a review of performance as defined in Sec. 
950.105. The LFCC must consider the capacity of the organization to 
manage an efficient and effective campaign, its history of public 
accountability, use of funds, truthfulness and accuracy in 
solicitations, and sound governance and fiscal management practices as 
the primary factors in selecting a PCFO. The LFCC must solicit 
applications on a competitive basis for the PCFO no later than a date to 
be determined by OPM and, if the LFCC exercises discretion to enter into 
a multi-year arrangement, upon completion of the multi-year term. The 
LFCC shall solicit applications via outreach activities including: 
Public notice in newspapers, postings on Web sites, advertising in trade 
journals, dissemination among participating CFC organizations and 
federations, and/or outreach through local or state nonprofit 
associations and training centers, among others. The PCFO application 
period must be open a minimum of 21 calendar days. Costs incurred for 
soliciting applications must be added to the PCFO budget as an 
administrative cost.

[60 FR 57890, Nov. 24, 1995, as amended at 70 FR 67341, Nov. 7, 2005; 71 
FR 67284, Nov. 20, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 950.105  Principal Combined Fund Organization (PCFO) responsibilities.

    (a) Only federations, charitable organizations or combinations 
thereof may serve as the PCFO.
    (b) the primary goal of the PCFO is to conduct an effective and 
efficient campaign in a fair and even-handed manner aimed at collecting 
the greatest amount of charitable contributions possible. Therefore, 
PCFO's should afford federated groups and agencies with representatives 
in the local campaign area adequate opportunity to offer suggestions 
relating to the operation of the campaign, developed campaign material, 
and training. If requested in writing to either the LFCC or PCFO, 
federated groups and agencies must be given the opportunity to attend 
all

[[Page 599]]

campaign meetings, kick-off events, and training sessions. The PCFO must 
provide representatives of federated groups, agencies and the general 
public the opportunity to review at the PCFO office all reports, 
budgets, audits, training information, and other records pertaining to 
the CFC.
    (c) Any federation, charitable organization or combinations thereof 
wishing to be selected for the PCFO must submit a timely application in 
accordance with the deadline set by the LFCC, that includes:
    (1) A written campaign plan sufficient in detail to allow the LFCC 
to determine if the applicant could administer an efficient and 
effective CFC. The campaign plan must include a CFC budget that details 
all estimated costs required to operate the CFC. The budget may not be 
based on the percentage of funds raised in the local campaign.
    (2) A statement signed by the applicant's local director or 
equivalent pledging to:
    (i) administer the CFC fairly and equitably,
    (ii) conduct campaign operations, such as training, kick-off and 
other events, and fiscal operations, such as banking, auditing, 
reporting and distribution separate from the applicant's non-CFC 
operations, and
    (iii) abide by the directions, decisions, and supervision of the 
LFCC and/or Director.
    (3) A statement signed by the applicant's local director or 
equivalent acknowledging the applicant is subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 950.403 and Sec. 950.603.
    (d) The specific responsibilities of the PCFO include but are not 
limited to:
    (1) Honoring employee designations.
    (2) Helping to ensure no employee is coerced in any way regarding 
participation in the campaign and that allegations of coercion are 
brought to the attention of the appropriate Federal officials.
    (3) Training agency loaned executives, coordinators, and keyworkers 
in the methods of non-coercive solicitation. This training must be 
completely separate from training given for other types of charitable 
campaign drives. Additionally, keyworkers should be trained to check to 
ensure the pledge form is legible on each copy, verify arithmetical 
calculations, and ensure the block on the pledge form concerning the 
release of the employee's name and contact information is completed 
fully.
    (4) Ensuring that no employee is questioned in any way as to his or 
her designation or its amount except by keyworkers, loaned executives, 
or other non-supervisory Federal personnel.
    (5) Preparing pledge forms and Charity Lists that are consistent 
with these regulations and instructions by the Director.
    (6) Honoring the request of employees who indicate on the pledge 
form that their names, contact information and contribution amounts not 
be released to the organization(s) that they designate.
    (7) Maintaining a detailed schedule of its actual CFC administrative 
expenses with, to the extent possible, itemized receipts for the 
expenses. The expense schedule must be in a format that can be 
reconciled to the PCFO's budget submitted in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section.
    (8) Keeping and maintaining CFC financial records and interest-
bearing bank accounts separate from the PCFO's internal organizational 
financial records and bank accounts. Interest earned on all CFC accounts 
must be distributed in the same manner as undesignated funds pursuant to 
Sec. 950.501. All financial records and bank accounts must be kept in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
    (9) Submitting to the LFCC an audit of collections and disbursements 
for each campaign managed no later than June 15 of the year in which the 
last disbursement is made. For example, for the 1994 CFC the audit of 
the 1994 campaign must be submitted to the LFCC no later than June 15, 
1996. The audit must be performed by an independent certified public 
accountant in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and 
OPM guidance.
    (10) Absorbing the cost of any reproduction and/or reissuing of 
campaign information due to its noncompliance with these regulations, 
embezzlement, or loss of funds. A PCFO must also absorb campaign costs 
exceeding 110 percent of the approved budget.

[[Page 600]]

    (11) Designing and implementing CFC awards programs which are 
accessible to all employees and which reflect the Government's 
commitment to non-coercion. Awards to Federal agencies or employees by 
individual federations or organizations for CFC accomplishments is 
prohibited.
    (12) Producing any documents or information requested by the LFCC 
and/or the Director within 10 calendar days of the receipt of that 
request.
    (13) Responding in a timely and appropriate manner to reasonable 
inquiries from participating organizations.

<R05>
Sec. 950.106  PCFO expense recovery.

    (a) The PCFO shall recover from the gross receipts of the campaign 
its expenses, approved by the LFCC, reflecting the actual costs of 
administering the local campaign. The amount recovered for campaign 
expenses shall not exceed 110 percent of the estimated budget submitted 
pursuant to Sec. 950.105(c)(1) unless approved by the Director.
    (b) The PCFO may only recover campaign expenses from receipts 
collected for that campaign year. Expenses incurred preparing for and 
conducting the CFC cannot be recovered from receipts collected in the 
previous year's campaign. The PCFO may absorb the costs associated with 
conducting the campaign from its own funds and be reimbursed, or obtain 
a commercial loan to pay for costs associated with conducting the 
campaign. If the commercial loan option is used, the amount of a 
reasonable rate of interest is an allowable campaign expense, subject to 
the approval of the LFCC when the PCFO budget is submitted.
    (c) The campaign expenses will be shared proportionately by all the 
recipient organizations reflecting their percentage share of gross 
campaign receipts.

<R05>
Sec. 950.107  Lack of a qualified PCFO.

    There is no authority in statute or regulation for an LFCC or any 
Federal official or employee to assume the duties and responsibilities 
of the PCFO. In the event that there is no qualified PCFO, the LFCC 
Chairman will promptly inform the Director in writing. The Director will 
assist the LFCC in merging the campaign with an adjacent campaign that 
has a qualified PCFO or identifying an eligible organization to function 
as the campaign's PCFO. If the LFCC's of the adjacent campaigns elect 
not to merge and a qualified PCFO cannot be found, the local CFC will be 
canceled. No workplace solicitation of any Federal employee in the 
campaign area is authorized and payroll allotments cannot be accepted 
and honored during the duration of the cancellation of the CFC.


<R05>
Sec. 950.108  Preventing coercive activity.

    True voluntary giving is fundamental to Federal fundraising 
activities. Actions that do not allow free choices or create the 
appearance employees do not have a free choice to give or not to give, 
or to publicize their gifts or to keep them confidential, are contrary 
to Federal fundraising policy. Activities contrary to the non-coercive 
intent of Federal fundraising policy are not permitted in campaigns. 
They include, but are not limited to:
    (a) Solicitation of employees by their supervisor or by any 
individual in their supervisory chain of command. This does not prohibit 
the head of an agency to perform the usual activities associated with 
the campaign kick-off and to demonstrate his or her support of the CFC 
in employee newsletters or other routine communications with the Federal 
employees.
    (b) Supervisory inquiries about whether an employee chose to 
participate or not to participate or the amount of an employee's 
donation. Supervisors may be given nothing more than summary information 
about the major units that they supervise.
    (c) Setting of 100 percent participation goals.
    (d) Establishing personal dollar goals and quotas.
    (e) Developing and using lists of non-contributors.

[[Page 601]]

    (f) Providing and using contributor lists for purposes other than 
the routine collection and forwarding of contributions and allotments, 
and as allowed under Sec. 950.601.
    (g) Using as a factor in a supervisor's performance appraisal the 
results of the solicitation in the supervisor's unit or organization.


<R05>
Sec. 950.109  Avoidance of conflict of interest.

    Any Federal employee who serves on the LFCC, on the eligibility 
committee, or as a Federal agency fundraising program coordinator, must 
not serve in any official capacity in any organization that serves as 
the PCFO of the local CFC, or participate in any decisions where, 
because of membership on the board or other affiliation with a 
charitable organization, there could be or appear to be a conflict of 
interest under any statute, regulation, Executive order, or applicable 
agency standards of conduct. Under no circumstances may an LFCC member 
affiliated with an organization applying for inclusion on the local 
list, participate in the eligibility determinations.

Sec. 950.110  Prohibited discrimination.

    Discrimination for or against any individual or group on account of 
race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap, or political 
affiliation is prohibited in all aspects of the management and the 
execution of the CFC. Nothing herein denies eligibility to any 
organization, which is otherwise eligible under this part to participate 
in the CFC, merely because such organization is organized by, on behalf 
of, or to serve persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex, 
national origin, age, or handicap.

                    Subpart B_Eligibility Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 950.201  National/international eligibility.

    (a) The Director shall annually:
    (1) Determine the timetable and other procedures regarding 
application for inclusion in the National/International and 
International parts of the Charity List.
    (2) Determine which organizations among those that apply qualify to 
be included in the National/International and International parts of the 
Charity List and then provide these parts of the Charity List of 
qualified organizations to all local campaigns. In order to determine 
whether an organization may participate in the campaign, the Director 
may request evidence of corrective action regarding any prior violation 
of regulation or directive, sanction, or penalty, as appropriate. The 
Director retains the ultimate authority to decide whether the 
organization has demonstrated, to the Director's satisfaction, that the 
organization has taken appropriate corrective action. Failure to 
demonstrate satisfactory corrective action or to respond to the 
Director's request for information within 10 business days of the date 
of the request may result in a determination that the organization will 
not be included in the Charity List.
    (b) The National/International and International parts of the 
Charity List shall be included in the Charity List in accordance with 
these regulations. The Charity List will include each organization's CFC 
code and other information as determined by OPM. These CFC codes must be 
verbatim reproduced in the Charity List.
    (c) An organization on the National/International or International 
parts of the Charity List may elect to be removed from the applicable 
part of the Charity List and have its local affiliate or subunit listed 
on the Local part of the Charity List of organizations in its stead. For 
the local affiliate or subunit to be listed in lieu of the organization 
on the National/International or International parts, the following 
procedures must be followed:
    (1) The organization must send a letter to the local affiliate or 
subunit in that particular geographic CFC, waiving its listing on the 
National/International or International part of the Charity List so that 
its eligible local affiliate or subunit listed in the Local part of the 
Charity List in that geographic CFC will appear as that organization's 
sole listing in the Charity List.
    (2) The local affiliate or subunit will include in its application 
to the LFCC

[[Page 602]]

a copy of the letter authorizing the removal of the organization from 
the National/International or International part of the Charity List, as 
well as all the required materials for completing a local organization 
application.
    (3) Upon finding the local organization eligible, the waiver letter 
from the organization on the National/International or International 
part authorizes the LFCC to delete that organization from the National/
International or International part of the Charity List.

<R05>
Sec. 950.202  National/international eligibility requirements.

    (a) Certify that it provides or conducts real services, benefits, 
assistance, or program activities, in 15 or more different states or a 
foreign country over the 3 year period immediately preceding the start 
of the year involved. This requirement cannot be met on the sole basis 
of services provided through an ``800'' telephone number or by 
disseminating information and publications via the U.S. Postal Service, 
the internet, or a combination thereof. A schedule listing a detailed 
description of the services in each state (minimum 15) or foreign 
countries (minimum 1), including the year of service, must be included 
with the CFC application. The schedule must make a clear showing of 
national or international presence. Broad descriptions of services and 
identical repetitive narratives will not be accepted in the sole 
discretion of OPM if they do not allow OPM to adequately determine that 
real services were provided or to accurately determine the individuals 
or entities who benefited. Providing listings of affiliated groups does 
not sufficiently demonstrate provision of real services by the 
applicant. Location of residence of organization members or location of 
residence of visitors to a facility does not substantiate provision of 
services. Organizations that issue student scholarships or fellowships 
must indicate the state in which the recipient resides, not the state of 
the school or place of fellowship. Mere dissemination of information 
does not demonstrate acceptable provision of real services. While it is 
not expected that an organization maintain an office in each state or 
foreign country, a clear showing must be made of the actual services, 
benefits, assistance or activities provided in each state or foreign 
country. De minimis services, benefits, assistance, or other program 
activities in any state or foreign country will not be accepted as a 
basis for qualification as a national or international organization.
    (b) Certify that it is an organization recognized by the Internal 
Revenue Service as tax exempt under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) to which 
contributions are deductible under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 170(c)(2) and that 
the organization is further classified as a public charity under 26 
U.S.C. Sec. 509(a). A copy of the letter(s) from the Internal Revenue 
Service granting tax exempt and public charity status must be included 
in the organization's application.

[71 FR 67285, Nov. 20, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 950.203  Public accountability standards.

    (a) To insure organizations wishing to solicit donations from 
Federal employees in the workplace are portraying accurately their 
programs and benefits, several standards and certifications must be met 
annually by each organization seeking eligibility. Each organization 
wishing to participate must:
    (1) Certify that the organization is a human health and welfare 
organization providing services, benefits, or assistance to, or 
conducting activities affecting, human health and welfare.
    (2) Certify that it accounts for its funds on an accrual basis 
(cash, modified cash, modified accrual and any other methods of 
accounting are not acceptable) in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles and that an audit of its fiscal operations is 
completed annually by an independent certified public accountant in 
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. A copy of the 
organization's most recent annual audited financial statements must be 
included with the application. The audited financial statements must 
cover the fiscal period ending not more than 18 months prior to the 
January of the

[[Page 603]]

year of the campaign for which the organization is applying. For 
example, the audited financial statements included in the 2007 
application must cover the fiscal period ending on or after June 30, 
2005.
    (3) Certify that it prepares and submits to the IRS a complete copy 
of the organization's IRS Form 990 or that it is not required to prepare 
and submit an IRS Form 990 to the IRS. Provide a completed copy of the 
organization's IRS Form 990 submitted to the IRS covering a fiscal 
period ending not more than 18 months prior to the January of the year 
of the campaign for which the organization is applying, including 
signature, supplemental statements and Schedule A, with the application, 
or if not required to file an IRS Form 990, provide a pro forma IRS Form 
990 page 1 and Part V only. IRS Forms 990EZ, 990PF, and comparable forms 
are not acceptable substitutes. The IRS Form 990 and audited financial 
statements must cover the same fiscal period.
    (4) Provide a computation of the organization's percentage of total 
support and revenue spent on administrative and fundraising. This 
percentage shall be computed from information on the IRS Form 990 
submitted pursuant to Sec. 950.203(a)(3).
    (5) Certify that the organization is directed by an active and 
responsible governing body whose members have no material conflict of 
interest and, a majority of which serve without compensation.
    (6) Certify that the organization's fundraising practices prohibit 
the sale or lease of its CFC contributor lists.
    (7) Certify that its publicity and promotional activities are based 
upon its actual program and operations, are truthful and non-deceptive, 
and make no exaggerated or misleading claims.
    (8) Certify that contributions are effectively used for the 
announced purposes of the charitable organization.
    (9) Provide a statement that the certifying official is authorized 
by the organization to certify and affirm all statements required for 
inclusion on the Charity List.
    (b) The Director shall review these applications for accuracy, 
completeness, and compliance with these regulations. Failure to supply 
any of this information may be judged a failure to comply with the 
requirements of public accountability, and the charitable organization 
may be ruled ineligible for inclusion on the national list.
    (c) The Director may request such additional information as the 
Director deems necessary to complete these reviews. An organization that 
fails to comply with such requests within 10 calendar days from receipt 
of the request may be judged ineligible.
    (d) The required certifications and documentation must have been 
completed and submitted prior to the application filing deadline. 
Applications received that are incomplete may not be perfected during 
the appeal process described in Sec. 950.205.
    (e) The Director may waive any of these standards and certifications 
upon a showing of extenuating circumstances.

FR 67285, Nov. 20, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 950.204  Local eligibility.

    (a) The LFCC shall establish an annual application process 
consistent with these regulations for organizations that wish to be 
listed in the Charity List.
    (b) The requirements for an organization to be listed in the Charity 
List shall include the following:
    (1) An organization must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the LFCC 
of the appropriate local campaign, that it has a substantial local 
presence in the geographical area covered by the local campaign, a 
substantial local presence in the geographical area covered by an 
adjacent local campaign, or substantial statewide presence. Eligibility 
to participate in an adjoining campaign on the basis of adjacency or 
statewide presence may be discontinued upon implementation of 
appropriate electronic technology that allows removal of the need for 
geographic restrictions on giving as determined by the Director.
    (i) Substantial local presence is defined as a staffed facility, 
office or portion of a residence dedicated exclusively to that 
organization, available to members of the public seeking its

[[Page 604]]

services or benefits. The facility must be open at least 15 hours a week 
and have a telephone dedicated exclusively to the organization. The 
office may be staffed by volunteers. Substantial local presence cannot 
be met on the basis of services provided solely through an ``800'' 
telephone number, the internet, the U.S. Postal Service or a combination 
thereof.
    (ii) An adjacent local campaign is defined as a local campaign whose 
geographic border touches the geographic border of another local 
campaign. Participation in a local campaign via an adjacency 
determination does not grant the organization a substantial local 
presence in the adjacent local campaign and participating via adjacency 
cannot be used to establish adjacency to local campaigns bordering the 
adjacent campaign area.
    (iii) Substantial statewide presence is defined as providing or 
conducting real services, benefits, assistance or program activities 
covering 30 percent of a state's geographic boundaries or providing or 
conducting real services, benefits, assistance or program activities 
affecting 30 percent of a state's population. Substantial statewide 
presence cannot be met on the basis of services provided solely through 
an ``800'' telephone number, the internet, the U.S. Postal Service or a 
combination thereof.
    (2) An organization seeking local eligibility also must meet all 
requirements for national list eligibility in Sec. 950.202 and Sec. 
950.203, with the following exceptions:
    (i) Local charitable organizations are not required to have provided 
services or benefits in 15 states or a foreign country over the prior 3 
years.
    (ii) A local charitable organization with annual revenue of less 
than $100,000 reported on its IRS Form 990 or pro form IRS Form 990 
submitted to the CFC is not required to undergo an audit or to submit 
audited financial statements. Rather, the organization must certify that 
it has controls in place to ensure that funds are properly accounted for 
and that it can provide accurate and timely financial information to 
interested parties. A local organization with annual revenue of at least 
$100,000 but less than $250,000 must certify that it accounts for its 
funds on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles and that an audit of its fiscal operations is 
completed annually as described in section 950.203(a)(2), but such 
organization does not have to submit a copy of its audited financial 
statements with its CFC application, unless requested to do so by the 
LFCC or Director.
    (iii) An organization seeking local eligibility in Puerto Rico, the 
U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, 
American Samoa, or Guam is exempt from the requirements of Sec. 
950.202(b), but the organization must include with its CFC application 
the appropriate documentation from its governing authority demonstrating 
its status as a charitable organization.
    (c) Family support and youth activities certified by the commander 
of a military installation as meeting the eligibility criteria contained 
in Sec. 950.204(d) may appear on the list of local organizations and be 
supported from CFC funds. Family support and youth activities may 
participate in the CFC as a member of a federation at the discretion of 
the certifying commander.
    (d) A family support and youth activity must:
    (1) Be a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization that provides family 
service programs or youth activity programs to personnel in the Command. 
The activity must not receive a majority of its financial support from 
appropriated funds.
    (2) Have a high degree of integrity and responsibility in the 
conduct of their affairs. Contributions received must be used 
effectively for the announced purposes of the organization.
    (3) Be directed by the base Non-Appropriated Fund Council or an 
active voluntary board of directors which serves without compensation 
and holds regular meetings.
    (4) Conduct its fiscal operations in accordance with a detailed 
annual budget, prepared and approved at the beginning of the fiscal 
year. Any significant variations from the approved budget must have 
prior authorization

[[Page 605]]

from the Non-Appropriated Fund Council or the directors. The family 
support and youth activities must have accounting procedures acceptable 
to an installation auditor and the inspector general.
    (5) Have a policy and practice of nondiscrimination on the basis of 
race, color, religion, sex or national origin applicable to persons 
served by the organization.
    (6) Prepare an annual report which includes a full description of 
the organization's activities and accomplishments. These reports must be 
made available to the public upon request.
    (e) Local eligibility determinations. The LFCC shall communicate its 
eligibility decisions by a date to be determined by OPM as part of the 
annual timetable issued by the Director under Sec. 950.801(b). Denial 
of the application by the LFCC must be sent via U.S. Postal Service 
certified or registered mail with a return receipt requested. Approvals 
may be sent via U.S. Postal Service regular first class mail. Applicants 
denied eligibility may appeal in accordance with Sec. 950.205.
    (f) No LFCC may produce the Charity List while there are appeals of 
eligibility decisions from their campaign pending with the Director. 
LFCC's are obligated to check with OPM 21 calendar days after the 
mailing of the local appeal decision as to whether the Director is on 
notice of a pending timely appeal.
    (g) In order to determine whether an organization may participate in 
the campaign, the LFCC may request evidence of corrective action 
regarding any prior violation of regulation or directive, sanction, or 
penalty, as appropriate. The LFCC will decide whether the organization 
has demonstrated, to the LFCC's satisfaction, that the organization has 
taken appropriate corrective action. Failure to demonstrate satisfactory 
corrective action or to respond to the LFCC's request for information 
within 10 business days of the date of the request may result in a 
determination that the organization will not be included in the local 
part of the Charity List.

Sec. 950.205  Appeals.

    (a) Organizations who apply and are denied eligibility for inclusion 
on the national list will be notified of the Director's decision by 
registered or certified mail of the U.S. Postal Service. Organizations 
may appeal the Director's decision by submitting a written request to 
reconsider the denial to the Director. This request must be received 
within 10 business days from the date of receipt of the Director's

    (b) Applicants denied listing in the local Charity List must first 
appeal in writing to the LFCC to reconsider its original decision. Such 
an appeal must be received by the LFCC within 7 business days from the 
date of receipt of the initial LFCC decision or 14 calendar days from 
the date the decision was mailed, whichever is earlier. The LFCC must 
consider all timely appeals and notify the appealing organization within 
a reasonable time period. Denial of the appeal by the LFCC must be sent 
via U.S. Postal Service certified or registered mail with a return 
receipt. Approval of local appeals may be sent via U.S. Postal Service 
regular first class mail or facsimile.
    (c) A local applicant which is unsuccessful in its appeal to the 
LFCC may appeal to the Director. All appeals must:
    (1) Be in writing;
    (2) Be received by the Director within 10 business days of the date 
of receipt of the letter from the LFCC denying eligibility on appeal;
    (3) Include a statement explaining the reason(s) why eligibility

[[Page 606]]

    (d) If an organization fails to file a timely application or a 
timely appeal of an adverse eligibility determination in accordance with 
these regulations, such application or appeal to the Director will be 
dismissed as untimely.
    (e) Appeals to the Director may not be used to supplement original 
applications that had missing or outdated documents. Any such 
supplemental documents will not be considered. Such appeals shall be 
limited to those facts justifying the reversal of the original decision.
    (f) The Director's decision is final for administrative purposes.

<R05>
Sec. 950.301  National and international federations eligibility.

    (a) The Director may recognize national and international 
federations that conform to the requirements and are eligible to receive 
designations. The Director may from time to time place a moratorium on 
the recognition of national and international federations. In order to 
determine whether the Director will recognize a national or 
international federation, the Director may request evidence of 
corrective action regarding any prior violation of regulation or 
directive, sanction, or penalty, as appropriate. The Director retains 
the ultimate authority to decide whether the federation has 
demonstrated, to the Director's satisfaction, that the federation has 
taken appropriate corrective action. Failure to demonstrate satisfactory 
corrective action or to respond to the Director's request for 
information within 10 business days of the date of the request may 
result in a determination that the federation will not be included in 
the Charity List.
    (b) By applying for inclusion in the CFC, federations consent to 
allow the Director complete access to it and its members' CFC books and 
records and to respond to requests for information by the Director.
    (c) An organization may apply to the Director for inclusion as a 
national or international federation to participate in the CFC if the 
applicant has, as members of the proposed federation, 15 or more 
charitable organizations, in addition to the federation itself, that 
meet the eligibility criteria of Sec. Sec. 950.202 and 950.203. The 
initial year an organization applies for federation status, it must 
submit the applications of all its proposed member organizations in 
addition to the federation application. A federation must re-establish 
eligibility each year, however only the applications of its new and 
former members that were not within the federation, as a CFC 
participant, in the previous year's campaign need accompany the annual 
federation application once an organization has obtained federation 
status, unless additional member applications are requested by the 
Director.
    (d) After an organization has been granted federation status, it may 
certify that its member organizations meet all eligibility criteria of 
Sec. 950.202 and Sec. 950.203 to be included on the national list. 
Federation status in a prior campaign is not a guarantee of federation 
status in a subsequent campaign. Failure to meet minimum federation 
eligibility requirements shall not be deemed to be a withdrawal of 
federation status subject to a hearing on the record.
    (e) An applicant for national or international federation status 
must annually certify and/or demonstrate:
    (1) That all member organizations seeking participation in the CFC 
are qualified for inclusion on the National or International part of the 
Charity List. Applicants must provide a complete list of those member 
organizations it certified.
    (2) That it meets the eligibility requirements and public 
accountability standards contained in Sec. Sec. 950.202 and 950.203. 
The federation can demonstrate that it has met the eligibility 
requirement in Sec. 950.202(a) either through its own services, 
benefits, assistance or program activities or through its 15 members' 
activities.
    (i) The federation must complete the certification set forth at 
Sec. 950.203(a)(2) without regard to the amount of revenue reported on 
its IRS Form 990 and must provide a copy of its audited financial 
statements. The audited financial statements provided must verify

[[Page 607]]

that the federation is honoring designations made to each member 
organization by distributing a proportionate share of receipts based on 
donor designations to each member. The audit requirement is waived for 
newly created federations operating for less than a year as determined 
from the date of its IRS tax-exemption letter to the closing date of the 
CFC application period.
    (ii) The federation must provide a listing of its board of 
directors, beginning and ending dates of each member's current term of 
office, and the board's meeting dates and locations for the year prior 
to the year of the campaign for which the organization is applying.
    (iii) The federation must certify that it prepares and makes 
available to the public, upon request, an annual report that includes a 
full description of the organization's activities and supporting 
services and identifies its directors and chief administrative 
personnel. The federation must provide a copy of its most recently 
completed annual report covering the fiscal period ending not more than 
18 months prior to January of the campaign year to which the federation 
is applying or the preceding calendar year. The annual report must also 
include an accurate description of the federation's membership dues and/
or service charges received by the federation from the charitable 
organizations participating as members. The information must clearly 
present the amounts raised, the sources of contributions, the cost of 
fundraising, and how costs are recovered from donations.
    (3) That it does not employ in its CFC operations the services of 
private consultants, consulting firms, advertising agencies or similar 
business organizations to perform its policy-making or decision-making 
functions in the CFC. It may, however, contract with entities or 
individuals such as banks, accountants, lawyers, and other vendors of 
goods and/or services to assist in accomplishing its administrative 
tasks.
    (f) The Director will notify a federation if it is determined that 
the federation does not meet the eligibility requirements of this 
section. A federation may appeal an adverse eligibility decision in 
accordance with Sec. 950.205.
    (g) The Director may waive any eligibility criteria for federation 
status if it is determined that such a waiver will be in the best 
interest of the CFC.
    (h) Two organizations--American Red Cross and United Service 
Organization--are exempt from the 15-member requirement of Sec. 
950.301(c).

Sec. 950.302  Responsibilities of national and international federations.

    (a) National and international federations must ensure that only 
those member organizations that comply with all eligibility requirements 
included in these regulations are certified for participation in the 
CFC.
    (b) The Director may elect to review, accept or reject the 
certifications of the eligibility of the members of the national 
federations. If the Director requests information supporting a 
certification of national eligibility, that information shall be 
furnished promptly. Failure to furnish such information within 10 
business days of the receipt of the request constitutes grounds for the 
denial of national eligibility of that member.
    (c) Each federation, as fiscal agent for its member organizations, 
must ensure that Federal employee designations are honored in that each 
member organization receives its proportionate share of receipts based 
on the results of each individual campaign. The proportionate share of 
receipts is determined by donor designations to the individual member 
organization as compared to total campaign designations.

Sec. 950.303  Local federations eligibility.

    (a) LFCC's must approve local federations that meet the applicable 
requirements, except that in order to determine whether the LFCC must 
recognize a local federation, the LFCC may request evidence of 
corrective action regarding any prior violation of regulation or 
directive, sanction, or penalty, as appropriate. A local federation that

[[Page 608]]

has been notified that it will not be included on the Local part of the 
Charity List because of failure to correct a prior violation may appeal 
the LFCC's decision to the Director in accordance with Sec. 950.205(b). 
The Director retains the ultimate authority to decide whether the local 
federation has demonstrated, to the Director's satisfaction, that the 
local federation has taken appropriate corrective action. Failure to 
demonstrate satisfactory corrective action or to respond to a request by 
the LFCC or Director for information within 10 business days of the date 
of the request may result in a determination that the local federation 
will not be included in the Local part of the Charity List.
    (b) By applying for inclusion in the CFC, federations consent to 
allow the LFCC and Director complete access to it and its members' CFC 
books and records and to respond to requests for information by the LFCC 
and the Director.
    (c) An organization may apply to the LFCC for inclusion as a local 
federation to participate in the CFC if the applicant has as members of 
the proposed federation 15 or more charitable organizations, in addition 
to the federation itself, that meet the eligibility criteria of 
Sec. Sec. 950.202, 950.203 and 950.204. The initial year an 
organization applies for federation status, it must submit to the LFCC 
applications of all its proposed member organizations in addition to the 
federation application. A federation must re-establish eligibility each 
year, however only the applications of its new and former members that 
were not within the federation, as a CFC participant, in the previous 
year's campaign need accompany the annual federation application once an 
organization has obtained federation status, unless additional member 
applications are requested by the LFCC.
    (d) After an organization has been granted federation status, it may 
certify that its member organizations meet all eligibility criteria of 
Sec. Sec. 950.202, 950.203, and 950.204 to be included on the Local 
List. While deference should be given to federation certifications, the 
LFCC, during the review process, may request independent evidence of 
individual member organization's eligibility. Federation status in a 
prior campaign is not a guarantee of federation status in a subsequent 
campaign. Failure to meet minimum federation eligibility requirements 
shall not be deemed to be a withdrawal of federation status subject to a 
hearing on the record.
    (e) An applicant for local federation status must certify and/or 
demonstrate:
    (1) That all member organizations seeking participation in the CFC 
are qualified for inclusion on the Local List and provide a complete 
list of those member organizations it certified.
    (2) That it meets the eligibility requirements contained in Sec. 
950.204 (including eligibility requirements and public accountability 
standards of Sec. Sec. 950.202 and 950.203 that are incorporated by 
reference). The federation can demonstrate that it has met the 
eligibility requirement in Sec. 950.204(b)(1) either through its own 
services, benefits, assistance or program activities or through its 15 
members' activities.
    (i) The federation must complete the certification set forth at 
Sec. 950.203(a)(2) without regard to the amount of revenue reported on 
its IRS Form 990 and must provide a copy of its audited financial 
statements. The audited financial statements provided must verify that 
the federation is honoring designations made to each member organization 
by distributing a proportionate share of receipts based on donor 
designations to each member. The audit requirement is waived for newly 
created federations operating for less than a year as determined from 
the date of its IRS tax-exemption letter to the closing date of the CFC 
application period.
    (ii) The federation must provide a listing of its board of 
directors, beginning and ending dates of each member's current term of 
office, and the board's meeting dates and locations for the year prior 
to the year of the campaign for which the organization is applying.
    (iii) The federation must certify that it prepares and makes 
available to the public, upon request, an annual report that includes a 
full description of the

[[Page 609]]

organization's activities and supporting services and identifies its 
directors and chief administrative personnel. The federation must 
provide a copy of its most recently completed annual report covering the 
fiscal year ending not more than 18 months prior to January of the 
campaign year to which the federation is applying or the preceding 
calendar year. The annual report must also include an accurate 
description of the federation's membership dues and/or service charges 
received by the federation from the charitable organizations 
participating as members. The information must clearly present the 
amounts raised, the sources of contributions, the cost of fundraising, 
and how costs are recovered from donations.
    (3) That is does not employ, in its CFC operations, the services of 
private consultants, consulting firms, advertising agencies or similar 
business organizations to perform the policy-making or decision-making 
functions in the CFC. It may, however, contract with entities or 
individuals such as banks, accountants, lawyers, and other vendors of 
goods and/or services to assist in accomplishing its administrative 
tasks.
    (f) The LFCC will notify a federation if it is determined that the 
federation does not meet the eligibility requirements of this section. A 
federation may appeal an adverse eligibility decision in accordance with 
Sec. 950.205.
    (g) The Director may waive any eligibility criteria for federation 
status if it is determined that such a waiver will be in the best 
interest of the CFC.

<R05>
Sec. 950.304  Responsibilities of local federations.

    (a) Local federations must ensure that only those member 
organizations that comply with all eligibility requirements included in 
these regulations are certified for participation in the CFC.
    (b) If the LFCC requests information supporting a certification of 
local eligibility, that information shall be furnished promptly. Failure 
to furnish such information within 10 business days of the receipt of 
the request constitutes grounds for the denial of local eligibility.
    (c) Each federation, as fiscal agent for its member organizations, 
must ensure that Federal employee designations are honored in that each 
member organization receives its proportionate share of receipts based 
on the results of each individual campaign. The proportionate share of 
receipts is determined by donor designations to the individual member 
organization as compared to total campaign designations.

<R04>
                     Subpart D_Campaign Information


<R05>
Sec. 950.401  Campaign and publicity information.

    (a) The specific campaign and publicity information, such as the 
official Charity List, will be developed locally, except as specified in 
these regulations. All information must be reviewed by the LFCC for 
compliance with these regulations and will be developed and supplied by 
the PCFO. All publicity information must have the approval of the LFCC 
before being used. Federations must notify the PCFO in writing of their 
desire to participate in the development of campaign and publicity 
information. The PCFO must respond in a timely manner to a federation's 
request to participate in the development of campaign and publicity 
information. Federations must also respond in a timely fashion in the 
development of campaign and publicity information.
    (b) During the CFC solicitation period, participating CFC 
organizations may distribute bona fide educational information 
describing its services or programs. The organization must be granted 
permission by the Federal agency installation head, or designee to 
distribute the material. CFC Coordinators, Keyworkers or members of the 
LFCC, are not authorized to grant permission for the distribution of 
such information. If one organization is granted permission to 
distribute educational information, then the Federal agency installation 
head must allow any other requesting CFC organization to distribute 
educational information.

[[Page 610]]

    (c) Organizations and federations are encouraged to publicize their 
activities outside Federal facilities and to broadcast messages aimed at 
Federal employees in an attempt to solicit their contributions through 
the media and other outlets.
    (d) Agency Heads are further authorized to permit the distribution 
by organizations of promotional information to Federal personnel in 
public areas of Federal workplaces in connection with the CFC, provided 
that the manner of distribution accords equal treatment to all 
charitable organizations furnishing such information for local use, and 
further provided that no such distribution shall utilize Federal 
personnel on official duty or interfere with Federal government 
activities. LFCC members and other campaign personnel are to be 
particularly aware of the prohibition of assisting any charitable 
organization or federated group in distributing any type of literature, 
especially during the campaign period. Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to require an LFCC to distribute or arrange for the 
distribution of any material other than the Campaign Charity List and 
the pledge form.
    (e) The Campaign Charity List and pledge form is the official source 
of CFC information and shall be made available either in hard copy or 
electronic format to all potential contributors. All CFC Charity Lists 
must inform employees of their right to make a choice to contribute or 
not to contribute; to designate or not to designate; and to give a 
confidential gift in a sealed envelope.
    (f) Campaign information must constitute a simple and attractive 
design that has fundraising appeal and essential working information. 
The design should focus on the CFC without undue use of charitable 
organization symbols and logos or other distractions that compete for 
the donor's attention. Extraneous instructions concerning the routing of 
forms, tallying of contributor's receipt, and similar reports, which are 
primarily for keyworkers must be avoided.
    (g) The following applies specifically to the campaign Charity List:
    (1) OPM will include in the annual distribution of the National/
International and International parts of the Charity List explicit 
instructions for the production of the Charity List and language to be 
reproduced verbatim in the introductory section. The general information 
provided will include:
    (i) A description of the CFC arrangement and explanation of the 
payroll deduction privilege.
    (ii) a statement that the donor may only designate charitable 
organizations or federations that are listed in the Charity List and 
that write-ins are prohibited.
    (iii) instructions as to how an employee may obtain more specific 
information about the programs and the finances of the organizations 
participating in the campaign.
    (iv) A description of employees' rights to pursue complaints of 
undue pressure or coercion in Federal fundraising activities.
    (2) Following the introductory section, the Charity List will 
consist of three parts--the National/International, the International, 
and the Local. The order of these three parts will be annually rotated 
in accordance with OPM instructions. The National/International and 
International parts will consist of faithful reproductions of the parts 
of National/International and International organizations, including 
federations, provided by OPM. The third part, the Local part, is 
determined by the LFCC. The order of listing of the federated and 
independent organizations within the three separate parts will be 
determined by random drawing. The order of organizations within each 
federation will be determined by the federation. The order within the 
National/International, International and Local independent groups will 
be alphabetical. Absent specific instructions from OPM to the contrary, 
each participating organization and federated group listing must include 
a description, not to exceed 25 words, of its services and programs, 
plus a telephone number for the Federal donor to request further 
information about the group's services, benefits, and administrative 
expenses. Each listing will include the organization's

[[Page 611]]

administration and fundraising percentage as calculated pursuant to 
Sec. 950.203(a)(4). Neither the percentage of administrative and 
fundraising expenses, nor the telephone number count toward the 25-word 
statement.
    (3) Each federation and charitable organization will be assigned a 
code in a manner determined by the Director. At the beginning of each 
federated group's listing will be the federation's name, code number, 
25-word statement, percentage of administrative and fundraising 
expenses, and telephone number. The sections of the Charity List where 
the independent organizations are listed will begin with the titles 
National/International Independent Organizations, International 
Independent Organizations and Local Independent Organizations, 
respectively.
    (h) Omission of an eligible charitable organization from the Charity 
List may require that the Charity List be corrected and reissued. Such 
an omission must be reported to OPM immediately upon discovery. The 
Director or LFCC may direct that the cost of such correction and reissue 
be borne by the PCFO or charged to CFC administrative expenses.
    (i) Listing of National and Local Affiliate. Listing of a national 
organization, as well as its local affiliate organization, is permitted. 
Each national or local organization must individually meet all of the 
eligibility criteria and submit independent documentation as required in 
Sec. 950.202, Sec. 950.203 or Sec. 950.204 to be included in the 
Charity List, except that a local affiliate of a national organization 
that is not separately incorporated, in lieu of its own 26 U.S.C. 
501(c)(3) tax exemption letter and, to the extent required by Sec. 
950.204(b)(2)(ii), audited financial statements, may submit the national 
organization's 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) tax exemption letter and audited 
financial statements, but must provide its own pro forma IRS Form 990, 
page 1 and Part V only, for CFC purposes. The local organization must 
submit a certification from the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or CEO 
equivalent of the national organization stating that it operates as a 
bonafide chapter or affiliate in good standing of the national 
organization and is covered by the national organization's 26 U.S.C. 
501(c)(3) tax exemption, IRS Form 990 and audited financial statements. 
A national organization may waive its listing in the National/
International or International parts of the Charity List in favor of its 
local affiliate by following the procedures set forth in Sec. 
950.201(c).
    (j) Multiple Listing Prohibited. Except as provided in paragraph (i) 
of this section, once an organization is deemed eligible, it is entitled 
to only one listing in the Charity List, regardless of the number of 
federations to which that organization belongs.
    (k) The LFCC may omit the 25-word program description from the CFC 
Charity List if, in the immediately preceding campaign period, 
contributions received in the local CFC totaled less than $100,000 or if 
the LFCC can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director that it can 
make the same information available electronically without disrupting 
donor opportunities to contribute.

<R05>
Sec. 950.402  Pledge form.

    (a) The Director will make available each campaign period at least 
one model pledge form which shall be reproduced at the local level.
    (b) Campaigns may incorporate additional giving levels to the 
Director's authorized pledge form. Campaigns may also include their 
award recognition program. No further modifications to the pledge form 
are permitted unless approved in advance by the Director.
    (c) An employee may not make a designation to an organization not 
listed in the Charity List. In addition, an employee may not make a CFC 
contribution to an organization listed in the Charity List of a campaign 
covering a geographic location different from the campaign where the 
employee works, except in cases of emergencies or disasters as approved 
by the Director. This restriction does not apply upon implementation of 
electronic technology that removes the geographic restrictions on giving 
as announced by the Director. Designations made to organizations not 
listed in the Charity List are

[[Page 612]]

not invalid, but will be treated as undesignated funds and distributed 
accordingly.
    (d) In the event the PCFO receives a pledge form that has 
designations that add up to less than the total amount pledged, the PCFO 
must honor the total amount pledged and treat the excess amount as 
undesignated funds. In the event that a PCFO receives a pledge form that 
has a total amount pledged that is less than the sum of the individual 
designations, the PCFO must honor the designations by assigning a 
proportionate share of the total gift to each organization designated. 
For example, if an employee indicates a total gift of $100 on the pledge 
form, but designates $50 to one organization and $25 to each of three 
other organizations, the PCFO must adjust the pledges proportionately by 
entering a pledge of $40 to the first organization and $20 to each of 
the three other organizations.

<R05>
Sec. 950.501  Applicability.

    (a) All undesignated funds shall be distributed to all of the 
organizations in the CFC Charity List in the same proportion that they 
received designations in the campaign.
    (b) The distribution of undesignated funds described in Sec. 
950.501(a) applies to all domestic area campaigns. It does not apply to 
the DOD Overseas Campaign.
    (c) The Director may alter the distribution of undesignated funds as 
local campaign circumstances may require or to enforce the distribution 
method described herein.

<R05>
Sec. 950.601  Release of contributor information.

    (a) The pledge form, designed pursuant to Sec. 950.402, must allow 
a contributor to indicate if the contributor does wish his or her name, 
contribution amount, and home contact information forwarded to the 
charitable organization or organizations designated. A PCFO's failure to 
honor a contributor's wish may result in the PCFO being sanctioned or 
penalized as provided for in Sec. 950.603(a).
    (b) The pledge form shall permit a contributor to specify which 
information, if any, he or she wishes released to organizations 
receiving his or her donations.
    (c) It is the responsibility of the PCFO to forward the contributor 
information for those who have indicated that they wish this information 
released to the recipient organization directly, if the organization is 
independent, and to the organization's federation if the organization is 
a member of a federation. The PCFO may not sell or make any other use of 
this information.

[71 FR 67288, Nov. 20, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 950.602  Solicitation methods.

    (a) Employee solicitations shall be conducted during duty hours 
using methods that permit true voluntary giving and shall reserve to the 
individual the option of disclosing any gift or keeping it confidential. 
Campaign kick-offs, victory events, awards, and other non-solicitation 
events to build support for the CFC are encouraged.
    (b) Special CFC fundraising events, such as raffles, lotteries, 
auctions, bake sales, carnivals, athletic events, or other activities 
not specifically provided for in these regulations are permitted during 
the campaign period if approved by the appropriate agency head or 
government official, consistent with agency ethics regulations. CFC 
special fundraising events should be undertaken in the spirit of 
generating interest in the CFC and be open to all individuals without 
regard to whether an individual participates in the CFC. Chances to win 
must be disassociated from amount of contributions, if any. Raffle 
prizes should be modest in nature and value. Examples of appropriate 
raffle prizes may include opportunities for lunch with Agency Officials, 
agency parking spaces for a specific time period, and gifts of minimal 
financial value. Any special CFC fundraising event and prize or gift 
should

[[Page 613]]

be approved in advance by the Agency's ethics official.
    (c) In all approved special fundraising events the donor must have 
the option of designating to a specific participating organization or 
federation or be advised that the donation will be counted as an 
undesignated contribution and distributed according to these 
regulations.

Sec. 950.603  Sanctions and penalties.

    (a)(1) The Director may impose sanctions or penalties on a 
federation, charitable organization or PCFO for violating these 
regulations, other applicable provisions of law, or any directive or 
instruction from the Director. The Director will determine the 
appropriate sanction and/or penalty, up to and including expulsion from 
the CFC. In determining the appropriate sanction and/or penalty, the 
Director will consider previous violations, harm to Federal employee 
confidence in the CFC, and any other relevant factors. The Director may 
bar a federation or charitable organization from serving as PCFO, for a 
period not to exceed one campaign period, if it is determined that that 
the federation or charitable organization has violated any provisions of 
these regulations. A federation, charitable organization or PCFO will be 
notified in writing of the Director's intent to sanction and/or penalize 
and will have 10 business days from the date of receipt of the notice to 
submit a written response. The Director's final decision will be 
communicated in writing to the federation, charitable organization, or 
PCFO, with a copy to the appropriate LFCC.
    (2) The Director may withdraw federation status with respect to a 
national, international or local federation that makes a false 
certification or fails to comply with any directive of the Director, or 
to respond in a timely fashion to a request by the Director or LFCC for 
information or cooperation, including with respect to an investigation 
or in the settlement of disbursements. The LFCC may recommend the 
withdrawal of federation status with respect to a local federation. As 
stated in Sec. Sec. 950.301(d) and 950.303(d), failure to meet minimum 
federation eligibility requirements shall not be deemed to be a 
withdrawal of federation status subject to a hearing on the record. 
Eligibility decisions shall follow the procedures in Sec. Sec. 
950.301(f) and 950.303(f). A federation will be notified in writing of 
the Director's intent to withdraw federation status for a period of up 
to one campaign period and will have 10 business days from the date of 
receipt of the notice to submit a written response. On receipt of the 
response, or in the absence of a timely response, the Director or 
representative shall set a date, time, and place for a hearing. The 
federation shall be notified at least 10 business days in advance of the 
hearing. A hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer designated by 
the Director unless it is waived in writing by the federation. After the 
hearing is held, or after the Director's receipt of the federation's 
written waiver of the hearing, the Director shall make a final decision 
on the record, taking into consideration the recommendation submitted by 
the hearing officer. The Director's final decision will be communicated 
in writing to the federation, with a copy to the appropriate LFCC.
    (3) A federation, charitable organization or PCFO sanctioned or 
penalized under any provision of these regulations must demonstrate to 
the satisfaction of the Director that it has taken corrective action to 
resolve the reason for sanction and/or penalty and has implemented 
reasonable and appropriate controls to ensure that the situation will 
not occur again prior to being allowed to participate in subsequent CFCs 
and/or serving as a PCFO for a campaign.
    (b) At the Director's discretion, PCFO's and Federations may be 
directed to suspend distribution of current and future CFC donations 
from Federal employees to recipient organizations. Federations and 
PCFO's shall immediately place suspended contributions in an interest 
bearing account until directed to do otherwise.

<R05>
Sec. 950.604  Records retention.

    Federations, PCFOs and other participants in the CFC shall retain 
documents pertinent to the campaign for at least three completed 
campaign periods. For example, documentation regarding the 2006 campaign 
must be retained through the completion of the 2007, 2008 and 2009 
campaign periods (i.e. until early 2011). Documents requested by OPM 
must be made available within 10 business days of the request.

Sec. 950.605  Sanctions compliance certification.

    Each federation, federation member and unaffiliated organization 
applying for participation in the CFC must, as a condition of 
participation, complete a certification that it is in compliance with 
all statutes, Executive orders, and regulations restricting or 
prohibiting U.S. persons from engaging in transactions and dealings with 
countries, entities or individuals subject to economic sanctions 
administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign 
Assets Control (OFAC). Should any change in circumstances pertaining to 
this certification occur at any time, the organization must notify OPM's 
Office of CFC Operations immediately. OPM will take such steps as it 
deems appropriate under the circumstances, including, but not limited 
to, notifying OFAC and/or other enforcement authorities of such change, 
suspending disbursement of CFC funds not yet disbursed, retracting (to 
the extent practicable) CFC funds already disbursed, and suspending or 
expelling the organization from the CFC.

Sec. 950.701  DoD overseas campaign.

    (a) A Combined Federal Campaign is authorized for all Department of 
Defense (DoD) activities in the overseas areas during a 6-week period in 
the fall. Organizations that may participate in the Overseas Campaign 
will consist of organizations determined nationally eligible by OPM.
    (b) The DoD must select an organization or combination of

    (e) Family support and youth activities established in overseas 
locations may be supported from CFC funds.
    (f) Undesignated funds contributed in the Overseas Campaign equal to 
up to 6 percent of the gross campaign contributions will be allocated to 
the Overseas family support and youth activities. No other funds may be 
used for this purpose. If the undesignated funds exceed 6 percent of the 
gross campaign contributions, this excess shall be distributed to all 
other organizations in the same proportions as designations.
    (g) Overseas family support and youth activities shall not be 
charged any share of campaign costs. All other organizations 
participating in the Overseas Area CFC will be charged for campaign 
costs in the same proportion that they received gross campaign receipts, 
net of that amount of receipts set aside for family support and youth 
activities.
    (h) The overseas campaign Charity List must explain the allocation 
policy utilized by each of the military services to allocate funds 
received from the Overseas campaign to their overseas family support and 
youth activities.

                      Subpart I_Payroll Withholding


<R05>
Sec. 950.901  Payroll allotment.

    The policies and procedures in this section are authorized for 
payroll withholding operations in accordance with the Office of 
Personnel Management Pay Administration regulations in part 550 of this 
Title.
    (a) Applicability. Voluntary payroll allotments will be authorized 
by all Federal departments and agencies for payment of charitable 
contributions to local CFC organizations.
    (b) Allotters. The allotment privilege will be made available to 
Federal personnel as follows:
    (1) Employees whose net pay regularly is sufficient to cover the 
allotment are eligible. An employee serving under an appointment limited 
to 1 year or less may make an allotment to a CFC when an appropriate 
official of the employing Federal agency determines that the employee 
will continue employment for a period to justify an allotment. This 
includes military reservists, National Guard, and other part-time and 
intermittent employees who are regularly employed.
    (2) Members of the Uniformed Services are eligible, excluding those 
on only short-term assignment (less than 3 months).
    (c) Authorization. Allotments will be totally voluntary and will be 
based upon contributor's individual authorization.
    (1) The CFC Pledge Form, in conformance with Sec. 950.402, is the 
only form for authorization of the CFC payroll allotment and may be 
reproduced by each PCFO. The pledge forms and official Charity List will 
be made available to employees when charitable contributions are 
solicited.
    (2) The original copy of each paper pledge form (payroll allotment 
authorization or an acceptable electronic version) should be transmitted 
to the contributor's servicing payroll office as promptly as possible, 
preferably by December 15. However, if pledge forms are received after 
that date they should be accepted and processed by the payroll office.
    (d) Duration. Authorization of allotments will be in the form of a 
term allotment. Term authorizations will be in effect for 1 full year--
26, 24, or 12 pay periods depending on the allotter's pay schedule--
starting with the first pay period beginning in January and ending with 
the last pay period that begins in December. Three months of employment 
is considered the minimum amount of time that is reasonable for 
establishing an allotment.
    (e) Amount. Allotters will make a single allotment that is 
apportioned into equal amounts for deductions each pay period during the 
year.
    (1) The minimum amount of the allotment will be determined by the 
LFCC but will not be less than $1 per payday, with no restriction on the 
size of the increment above that minimum.

    (2) No change of amount will be authorized for term allotments.
    (3) No deduction will be made for any period in which the allotter's 
net pay, after all legal and previously authorized deductions, is 
insufficient to cover the CFC allotment. No adjustment will be made in 
subsequent periods to make up for missed deductions.
    (f) Remittance. One check will be sent by the payroll office each 
pay period, in the gross amount of deductions on the basis of current 
authorizations, to the Central Receipt and Accounting Point (CRP) at 
each local CFC location for which the payroll office has received 
allotment authorizations. The Director will provide a list of the 
authorized CRP's to Federal payroll offices.
    (1) The check will be accompanied by a statement identifying the 
agency, the dates of the pay period, pay period number, and the total 
number of employee deductions.
    (2) There will be no listing of allotters included or of allotter 
discontinuances.
    (g) Discontinuance. Term allotments will be discontinued 
automatically on expiration of the 1 year withholding period, or on the 
death, retirement, or separation of the allotter from the Federal 
service, whichever is earlier.
    (1) An allotter may revoke a term authorization at any time by 
requesting it in writing from the payroll office. Discontinuance will be 
effective the first pay period beginning after receipt of the written 
revocation in the payroll office.
    (2) A discontinued allotment will not be reinstated.
    (h) Transfer. When an allotter moves to another organizational unit 
served by a different payroll office in the same CFC location, whether 
in the same office or a different Department or agency, his or her 
allotment authorization should be transferred to the new payroll office.
    (i) Accounting. Federal payroll offices will oversee the 
establishment of individual allotment accounts, the deductions each pay 
period, and the reconciliation of employee accounts in accordance with 
agency and General Accounting Office requirements. The payroll office 
will accept responsibility for the accuracy of remittances, as supported 
by current allotment authorizations, and internal accounting and 
auditing requirements.
    (1) The PCFO shall notify the federations, national and 
international organizations, and local organizations as soon as 
practicable after the completion of the campaign, but in no case later 
than a date to be determined by OPM, of the amounts, if any, designated 
to them and their member agencies and of the amounts of the undesignated 
funds, if any, allocated to them. The date will be part of the annual 
timetable issued by the Director under Sec. 950.801(b).
    (2) The PCFO is responsible for the accuracy of disbursements it 
transmits to recipients. It shall transmit disbursements at least 
quarterly, minus the approved proportionate share for administrative 
cost reimbursement and the PCFO fee set forth in Sec. 950.106. It shall 
remit the contributions to each organization or to the federation, if 
any, of which the organization is a member. The PCFO will distribute all 
CFC receipts beginning April 1, and quarterly thereafter. At the close 
of each disbursement period, the PCFO's CFC account shall have a balance 
of zero.
    (3) The PCFO may make one-time disbursements to organizations 
receiving minimal donations from Federal employees. The LFCC must 
determine and authorize the amount of these one-time disbursements. The 
PCFO may deduct the proportionate amount of each organization's share of 
the campaign's administrative costs and the average of the previous 3 
years pledge loss from the one-time disbursement. This is the only 
approved application of adjusting for pledge loss.
    (4) Federated and national charitable organizations, or their 
designated agents, will accept responsibility for:
    (i) The accuracy of distribution amount the charitable organizations 
of remittances from the PCFO; and
    (ii) Arrangements for an independent audit conducted by a certified 
public accountant agreed upon by the participating charitable 
organizations.

Subpart A_Claims and Appeals of Veterans; Recognition of Representatives


<R05>
Sec. 990.101  Appearance.

    A preference eligible who has filed with OPM a claim or an appeal 
under section 3502, 3503, or 7701 of title 5, United States Code, may 
appear in a proceeding in connection therewith either personally or by a 
representative. The representative may be a person designated by the 
preference eligible, that person being referred to in this part as 
agent; or a service organization designated by the preference eligible 
and approved by OPM.


<R05>
Sec. 990.102  Agents.

    A competent person of good moral character and of good repute who is 
a citizen of the United States, or who has declared his intention to 
become a citizen of the United States, may be designated as an agent. A 
person (other than a Member of Congress) claiming to act as an agent 
shall submit a written statement from the preference eligible (OPM Form 
307) authorizing him to represent the preference eligible in his claim 
or appeal. A written statement is not required of a Member of Congress 
claiming to act as an agent to represent a preference eligible in his 
claim or appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 990.103  Recognition of service organizations.

    A service organization approved by OPM may be recognized in the 
presentation of claims or appeals under section 3502, 3503, or 7701 of 
title 5, United States Code, when the proper officers thereof make 
application for recognition, and as a part of the application agree and 
certify that neither the organization nor its representatives will 
charge claimants or appellants a fee or compensation for their services, 
except expenses actually incurred with the consent of the claimant. In 
requesting recognition, the following information shall be supplied:
    (a) Statement outlining the purpose of the organization and need 
thereof, and manner in which the preference eligible will be benefited 
by the recognition.
    (b) Names, titles, and addresses of officers.
    (c) Number of posts or chapters, and States in which located.
    (d) Names, titles, and addresses of full-time paid employees who are 
qualified to act as accredited representatives.
    (e) Copy of constitution or charter and bylaws of the organization.

[[Page 621]]


<R05>
Sec. 990.104  Accredited representatives of service organizations.

    (a) Each recognized service organization shall file with OPM, on the 
prescribed form (OPM Form 306), the name of any officer whom it desires 
to be recognized as its accredited representative and OPM office or 
offices to which recognition is to be extended in the presentation of 
claims or appeals. In proposing a candidate for recognition as a 
representative, the organization, through its appropriate officer, shall 
certify to the following:
    (1) That the candidate is a citizen of the United States, of good 
character and reputation, is qualified by training or experience to 
assist in the presentation of claims, and is a member or employee of the 
organization.
    (2) That he is not employed in any civil or military department or 
agency of the United States, and is not a retired member of the Regular 
Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or Public Health 
Service.
    (3) Whether the candidate is a preference eligible and, if so, that 
he was honorably discharged from active service.
    (b) A single application (OPM Form 306) shall be filed with the 
central office of OPM for recognition before (1) the central office 
only, (2) two or more regional offices, or (3) the central office and 
one or more regional offices. Application shall be filed with the 
regional office where the candidate is to serve when recognition before 
only one regional office is requested. Application Form 306 shall be 
retained by the approving office of OPM.
    (c) The central office or regional director, as the case may be, is 
responsible for determining the qualifications of a candidate of a 
service organization for recognition. Normally, the candidate of a 
service organization will be approved. However, if there is doubt as to 
the qualifications or suitability of a candidate, appropriate 
investigation may be made to resolve the doubts. If it is determined 
that the candidate is qualified, duplicate copies of a letter of notice 
to that effect shall be issued to the veterans organization concerned, 
with an Identification Card (OPM Form 308) in the candidate's name 
signed by the appropriate official in the central office or the regional 
director. One copy of the letter of approval shall be retained by the 
organization and the other forwarded to the candidate with the 
Identification Card 308 countersigned by the appropriate officer of the 
organization. When approval is made by the central office, a copy of the 
letter of approval shall be sent to each regional office before which 
recognition of the candidate is approved. When approval is made by a 
regional office, a copy of the letter of approval shall be sent to the 
central office of OPM. Each regional office shall maintain a record of 
all accredited representatives approved for recognition before that 
regional office. The central office shall maintain a record of all 
accredited representatives approved by all regional directors and the 
central office. If the regional director's determination is adverse, or 
the case is one of doubtful aspect, the entire matter may be referred to 
OPM's central office, at the regional director's option, where it will 
be handled in the same manner as a request for recognition ordinarily 
handled by the central office.
    (d) Recognition may be canceled at the request of the organization. 
The central office or regional director may cancel or suspend a 
recognition for cause. When a regional director cancels or suspends a 
recognition, a report of the facts shall be made to the central office. 
Notice of cancellation or suspension shall be supplied in the same 
manner as a notice of recognition.
    (e) Nominations for accredited representatives of national service 
organizations are acceptable only if approved by the certifying officer, 
national headquarters, of the organization.
    (f) Letters of recognition issued by the central office to national 
and field officers of recognized organizations constitute authorization 
for their recognition in claims or appeals in any regional office within 
their respective assignments. Letters of recognition issued by a 
regional director constitute authorization for the accredited 
representatives to present claims or appeals in any regional office 
within their respective assignments.
    (g) When a representative has been recognized, a card shall be 
prepared in

[[Page 622]]

the office which approves the recognition, showing his name, address, 
organization, and date of recognition. Copies of this card shall be 
filed in the central office of OPM, and in the regional office by which 
he is recognized or in which he is authorized to act.


<R05>
Sec. 990.105  Designation of service organizations as representatives.

    (a) Before a service organization may be recognized in an individual 
claim or appeal, there shall be filed a designation duly executed by the 
claimant or appellant, specifically conferring on the organization the 
authority to represent him in the presentation of his claim or appeal, 
and to receive information in connection therewith. This designation 
shall be on the form prescribed by OPM (OPM Form 307) and shall be 
presented to the office concerned, to be filed in connection with the 
claim or appeal. The designation shall be signed by the claimant or 
appellant.
    (b) On receipt and approval of the designation, the service 
organization named therein shall be recognized as the sole agency for 
the presentation of the claim or appeal covered thereby, and no other 
organization shall be recognized in the presentation of that claim or 
appeal. The designation made by the claimant may be revoked by him at 
any time and a subsequent designation made, naming another organization. 
A subsequently executed designation constitutes a revocation of any 
existing designation. A designation may also be revoked by the 
organization named therein.


<R05>
Sec. 990.106  General provisions.

    (a) Nothing in this subpart permits the unauthorized practice of law 
in any place or the giving of any service except the authorized 
participation in agency proceedings by agents or accredited 
representatives who have been approved by OPM.
    (b) This subpart does not apply to adjudications of charges of 
political activity on the part of officers or employees in the 
competitive service, or of officers or employees of a State or local 
government, nor to adjudications of the existence of good cause for the 
removal of hearing examiners appointed under section 3105 of title 5 
United States Code.
