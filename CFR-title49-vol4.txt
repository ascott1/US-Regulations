                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2008), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

Sec. 209.7  Subpoenas; witness fees.

    (a) The Chief Counsel may issue a subpoena on his or her own 
initiative in any matter related to enforcement of the railroad safety 
laws. However, where a proceeding under subpart B, C, or D of this part 
has been initiated, only the presiding officer may issue subpoenas, and 
only upon the written request of any party to the proceeding who makes 
an adequate showing that the information sought will materially advance 
the proceeding.
    (b) A subpoena may require attendance of a witness at a deposition 
or hearing or the production of documentary or other tangible evidence 
in the possession or control of the person served, or both.
    (c) A subpoena may be served personally by any person who is not an 
interested person and is not less than eighteen (18) years of age, or by 
certified or registered mail.
    (d) Service of a subpoena shall be made by delivering a copy of the 
subpoena in the appropriate manner, as set forth below. Service of a 
subpoena requiring attendance of a person is not complete unless 
delivery is accompanied by tender of fees for one day's attendance and 
mileage as specified by paragraph (f) of this section. However, when a 
subpoena is issued upon the request of any officer or agency of the 
United States, fees and mileage need not be tendered at the time of 
service but will be paid by FRA at the place and time specified in the 
subpoena for attendance.

Delivery of a copy of the subpoena may be made:
    (1) To a natural person by:
    (i) Handing it to the person;
    (ii) Leaving it at his or her office with the person in charge 
thereof;
    (iii) Leaving it at his or her dwelling place or usual place of 
abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing 
therein;
    (iv) Mailing it by registered or certified mail to him or her at his 
or her last known address; or

[[Page 20]]

    (v) Any method whereby actual notice of the issuance and content is 
given (and the fees are made available) prior to the return date.
    (2) To an entity other than a natural person by:
    (i) Handing a copy of the subpoena to a registered agent for service 
or to any officer, director, or agent in charge of any office of the 
person;
    (ii) Mailing it by registered or certified mail to any 
representative listed in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section at his or 
her last known address; or
    (iii) Any method whereby actual notice is given to such 
representative (and the fees are made available) prior to the return 
date.
    (e) The original subpoena bearing a certificate of service shall be 
filed in accordance with Sec. 209.9.
    (f) A witness subpoenaed by the FRA shall be entitled to the same 
fees and mileage as would be paid to a witness in a proceeding in the 
district courts of the United States. See 28 U.S.C. 1821. The witness 
fees and mileage shall be paid by the person requesting that the 
subpoena be issued. In an appropriate case, the Chief Counsel or the 
hearing officer may direct the person requesting issuance of a subpoena 
for the production of documentary or other tangible evidence to 
reimburse the responding person for actual costs of producing and/or 
transporting such evidence.
    (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section, 
and upon request, witness fees and mileage or the costs of producing 
other evidence may be paid by the FRA if the official who issued the 
subpoena determines on the basis of good cause shown that:
    (1) The presence of the subpoenaed witness or evidence will 
materially advance the proceedings; and
    (2) The party at whose instance the subpoena was issued would suffer 
a serious financial hardship if required to pay the witness fees and 
mileage.
    (h) Any person to whom a subpoena is directed may, prior to the time 
specified therein for compliance, but in no event more than ten (10) 
days after the date of service of such subpoena, apply in writing to the 
official who issued the subpoena, or if that person is unavailable, to 
the Chief Counsel, to quash or modify the subpoena. The application 
shall contain a brief statement of the reasons relied upon in support of 
the action sought therein. The issuing official or the Chief Counsel, as 
the case may be, may:
    (1) Deny the application;
    (2) Quash or modify the subpoena; or
    (3) In the case of subpoena to produce documentary or other tangible 
evidence, condition denial of the application upon the advancement by 
the party in whose behalf the subpoena is issued of the reasonable cost 
of producing the evidence.
    (i) If there is a refusal to obey a subpoena served upon any person 
under the provisions of this section, the FRA may request the Attorney 
General to seek the aid of the United States District Court for any

notice, to appear and give testimony, or to appear and produce the 
subpoenaed documents before the FRA, or both.
    (j) Attendance of any FRA employee engaged in an investigation which

purpose of eliciting factual testimony may be assured by filing a 
request with the Chief Counsel at least fifteen (15) days before the 
date of the hearing. The request must indicate the present intent of the

Sec. 209.8  Depositions in formal proceedings.

    (a) Any party to a proceeding under subpart B, C, or D of this part 
may take the testimony of any person, including a party, by deposition 
upon oral examination on order of the presiding officer following the 
granting of a motion under paragraph (b) of this section. Depositions 
may be taken before any disinterested person who is authorized by law to 
administer oaths. The attendance of witnesses may be compelled by 
subpoena as provided in Sec. 209.7 and, for proceedings under subpart D 
of this part, Sec. 209.315.
    (b) Any party desiring to take the deposition of a witness shall 
file and

[[Page 21]]

serve a written motion setting forth the name of the witness; the date, 
time, and place of the deposition; the subject matter of the witness' 
expected testimony; whether any party objects to the taking of the 
deposition; and the reasons for taking such deposition. Such motion 
shall be granted only upon a showing of good cause. Good cause exists to 
take a person's deposition when the information sought is relevant to 
the subject matter involved in the proceeding and:
    (1) The information is not obtainable from some other source that is 
more convenient, less burdensome, and less expensive; or
    (2) The request is not unreasonably cumulative, unduly burdensome, 
or unduly expensive, taking into account the needs of the case, 
limitations on the parties' resources, and the importance of the issues 
in the case.
    (c) Such notice as the presiding officer shall order will be given 
for the taking of a deposition, but this shall not be less than 10 days' 
written notice unless the parties agree to a shorter period.
    (d) Each witness testifying upon deposition shall be sworn and the 
adverse party shall have the right to cross-examine. The questions 
propounded and the answers thereto, together with all objections made, 
shall be reduced to writing, subscribed by the witness, and certified by 
the reporter.
    (e) Depositions taken under this section may be used for discovery, 
to contradict or impeach the testimony of the deponent as a witness, or 
as evidence in the proceeding as permitted by paragraph (f) of this 
section and in accordance with the limitations of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 32 
as though it were applicable to these proceedings.
    (f) Subject to such objections to the questions and answers as were 
noted at the time of taking the deposition and as would be valid were 
the witness personally present and testifying, such deposition may be 
offered in evidence by any party to the proceeding.

Sec. 209.11  Request for confidential treatment.

    (a) This section governs the procedures for requesting confidential 
treatment of any document filed with or otherwise provided to FRA in 
connection with its enforcement of statutes or FRA regulations related 
to railroad safety. For purposes of this section, ``enforcement'' shall 
include receipt of documents required to be submitted by FRA 
regulations, and all investigative and compliance activities, in 
addition to the development of violation reports and recommendations for 
prosecution.
    (b) A request for confidential treatment with respect to a document 
or portion thereof may be made on the basis that the information is--
    (1) Exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirements of the Freedom 
of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552);
    (2) Required to be held in confidence by 18 U.S.C. 1905; or
    (3) Otherwise exempt by law from public disclosure.
    (c) Any document containing information for which confidential 
treatment is requested shall be accompanied at the time of filing by a 
statement justifying nondisclosure and referring to the specific legal 
authority claimed.
    (d) Any document containing any information for which confidential 
treatment is requested shall be marked ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or ``CONTAINS 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION'' in bold letters. If confidentiality is 
requested as to the entire document, or if it is claimed that 
nonconfidential information in the document is not reasonably segregable 
from confidential information, the accompanying statement of 
justification shall so indicate. If confidentiality is requested as to a 
portion of the document, then the person filing the document shall file 
together with the document a second

[[Page 22]]

copy of the document from which the information for which confidential 
treatment is requested has been deleted. If the person filing a document 
of which only a portion is requested to be held in confidence does not 
submit a second copy of the document with the confidential information 
deleted. FRA may assume that there is no objection to public disclosure 
of the document in its entirety.
    (e) FRA retains the right to make its own determination with regard 
to any claim of confidentiality. Notice of a decision by the FRA to deny 
a claim, in whole or in part, and an opportunity to respond shall be 
given to a person claiming confidentiality of information no less than 
five days prior to its public disclosure.

matter(s) pending against the same respondent or with any related 
matter(s) pending against other respondent(s) under the same subpart. 
However, on certification by the presiding officer that a consolidated 
proceeding is unmanageable or otherwise undesirable, the Chief Counsel 
will rescind or modify the consolidation.

Unless otherwise specified by the presiding officer, any objection to a 
written motion must be filed within 10 days after receipt of the motion.

<R05>
Sec. 209.105  Notice of probable violation.

    (a) FRA, through the Chief Counsel, begins a civil penalty

this part contains guidelines used by the chief counsel in making 
initial penalty assessments.
    (b) A notice of probable violation issued under this section 
includes:
    (1) A statement of the provision(s) which the respondent is believed 
to have violated;
    (2) A statement of the factual allegations upon which the proposed 
civil penalty is being sought;

is given an opportunity to respond. In an amended notice, FRA may change 
the civil penalty amount proposed to be assessed up to and including the 
maximum penalty amount of $50,000 for each violation, except that if the 
violation results in death, serious illness or severe injury to any 
person, or substantial destruction of property, FRA may change the

good cause shown.
    (c) Failure of the respondent to reply by taking one of the three 
actions described in paragraph (a) of this section within the period 
provided constitutes a waiver of his or her right to appear and contest 
the allegations and authorizes the Chief Counsel, without further notice 
to the respondent, to find the facts to be as alleged in the notice of 
probable violation and to assess an appropriate civil penalty.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 209.111  Informal response and assessment.

    (a) If a respondent elects to make an informal response to a notice 
of probable violation, respondent shall submit to the Chief Counsel such 
written explanations, information or other materials as respondent may 
desire in answer to the charges or in mitigation of the proposed 
penalty.
    (b) The respondent may include in his or her informal written 
response a request for a conference. Upon receipt of such a request, the 
Chief Counsel arranges for a conference as soon as practicable at a time 
and place of mutual convenience.
    (c) Written explanations, information or materials, submitted by the 
respondent and relevant information presented during any conference held 
under this section are considered by the Chief Counsel in reviewing the 
notice of proposed violation and determining the fact of violation and 
the amount of any penalty to be assessed.
    (d) After consideration of an informal response, including any 
relevant information presented at a conference, the Chief Counsel may 
dismiss the notice of probable violation in whole or in part. If he or 
she does not dismiss it in whole, he or she may issue an order assessing 
a civil penalty.

provisions of this subpart pertaining to civil penalties and permitted 
by law which may expedite the hearing or aid in the disposition of an 
issue raised, therein.
    (c) The Chief Counsel has the burden of providing the facts alleged 
in the notice of proposed violation and may offer such relevant 
information as may be necessary fully to inform the presiding officer as 
to the matter concerned.
    (d) The respondent may appear and be heard on his or her own behalf 
or through counsel of his or her choice. The respondent or his or her 
counsel may offer relevant information including testimony which he or 
she believes

should be considered in defense of the allegations or which may bear on 
the penalty proposed to be assessed and conduct such cross-examination

violation of the Federal hazardous materials transportation law or a 
regulation issued under those laws for which FRA exercises enforcement 
responsibility, he or she shall report it to the Chief Counsel. If 
evidence exists tending to establish a prima facie case, and if it

Sec. 209.201  Compliance orders generally.

    (a) This subpart prescribes rules of procedure leading to the 
issuance of compliance orders pursuant to the Federal railroad safety 
laws at 49 U.S.C. 5121(a) and/or 20111(b).
    (b) The FRA may commence a proceeding under this subpart when FRA 
has reason to believe that a person is engaging in conduct or a pattern 
of conduct that involves one or more violations of the Federal railroad 
safety laws or any regulation or order issued under those laws for which 
FRA exercises enforcement authority.

[61 FR 38647, July 25, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 209.203  Notice of investigation.

    (a) FRA begins a compliance order proceeding by serving a notice of 
investigation on the respondent.
    (b) The notice of investigation contains:
    (1) A statement of the legal authority for the proceeding;
    (2) A statement of the factual allegations upon which the remedial 
action is being sought; and
    (3) A statement of the remedial action being sought in the form of a 
proposed compliance order.
    (c) The FRA may amend the notice of investigation at any time prior 
to the entry of a final compliance order. If an amendment includes any 
new material allegation of fact or seeks new or additional remedial 
action, the respondent is given an opportunity to respond.


<R05>
Sec. 209.205  Reply.

    (a) Within thirty (30) days of service of a notice of investigation, 
the respondent may file a reply with the FRA. The Chief Counsel may 
extend the time for filing for good cause shown.
    (b) The reply must be in writing, signed by the person filing it, 
and state with respect to each factual allegation whether it is admitted 
or denied. Even though formally denied, a factual allegation set forth 
in a notice of investigation is considered to be admitted for purposes 
of the proceeding unless:
    (1) Opposed by the affidavit of an individual having personal 
knowledge of the subject matter;
    (2) Challenged as defective on its face together with a supporting 
explanation as to why it is believed to be defective; or
    (3) Otherwise actively put at issue through the submission of 
relevant evidence.
    (c) The reply must set forth any affirmative defenses and include a 
statement of the form and nature of proof by which those defenses are to 
be established.
    (d) If it is necessary to respond to an amendment to the notice of 
investigation, the respondent may amend the reply concerning the 
substance of matters contained in the amendment to the notice at any 
time before the issuance of an order under Sec. 209.211.
    (e) If the respondent elects not to contest one or more factual 
allegations, he or she should so state in the reply. An election not to 
contest a factual allegation is an admission of that allegation solely 
for the purpose of issuing a compliance order. That election constitutes 
a waiver of hearing as to that allegation but does not, by itself, 
constitute a waiver of the right to be heard on other issues. In 
connection with a statement of election not to contest a factual 
allegation, the respondent may propose an appropriate order for issuance 
by the Administrator or propose the negotiation of a consent order.
    (f) Failure of the respondent to file a reply within the period 
provided constitutes a waiver of his or her right to appear and contest 
the allegation and authorizes the Administrator, without further notice 
to the respondent, to find the facts to be as alleged in the notice of 
proposed violation and to issue an appropriate order directing 
compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 209.207  Consent order.

    (a) At any time before the issuance of an order under Sec. 209.211, 
the Chief Counsel and the respondent may execute an

[[Page 27]]

agreement proposing the entry by consent of an order directing 
compliance. The Administrator may accept the proposed order by signing 
it. If the Administrator rejects the proposed order, he or she directs 
that the proceeding continue.
    (b) An agreement submitted to the Administrator under this section 
must include:
    (1) A proposed compliance order suitable for the Administrator's 
signature;
    (2) An admission of all jurisdictional facts;
    (3) An express waiver of further procedural steps and of all right 
to seek judicial review or otherwise challenge or contest the validity 
of the order; and
    (4) An acknowledgment that the notice of investigation may be used 
to construe the terms of the order.


<R05>
Sec. 209.209  Hearing.

    (a) When a respondent files a reply contesting allegations in a 
notice of investigation issued under Sec. 209.203 or when the FRA and 
the respondent fail to agree upon an acceptable consent order, the 
hearing officer designated by the Chief Counsel convenes and presides 
over a hearing on the proposed compliance order.
    (b) The presiding official may:
    (1) Administer oaths and affirmations;
    (2) Issue subpoenas as provided by Sec. 209.7;
    (3) Adopt procedures for the submission of evidence;
    (4) Take or cause depositions to be taken;
    (5) Rule on offers of proof and receive relevant evidence;
    (6) Examine witnesses at the hearing;
    (7) Convene, recess, reconvene, ad- journ and otherwise regulate the 
course of the hearing;
    (8) Hold conferences for settlement, simplification of the issues or 
any other proper purpose; and
    (9) Take any other action authorized by or consistent with the 
provisions of this subpart pertaining to compliance orders and permitted 
by law which may expedite the hearing or aid in the disposition of an 
issue raised therein.
    (c) The Chief Counsel has the burden of providing the facts alleged 
in the notice of investigation and may offer such relevant information 
as may be necessary fully to inform the presiding officer as to the 
matter concerned.
    (d) The respondent may appear and be heard on his or her own behalf 
or through counsel of his or her choice. The respondent or his or her 
counsel may offer relevant information, including testimony which he or 
she believes should be considered in defense of the allegations or which 
may bear on the remedial action being sought, and conduct such cross-
examination as may be required for a full disclosure of the material 
facts.
    (e) At the conclusion of the hearing or as soon thereafter as the 
hearing officer shall provide, the parties may file proposed findings 
and conclusions, together with supporting reasons therefor.

                  Subpart D_Disqualification Procedures

    Source: 54 FR 42907, Oct. 18, 1989, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 209.301  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart prescribes the rules of practice for administrative 
proceedings relating to the determination of an individual's fitness for 
performing safety-sensitive functions under section 209(f) of the 
Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 438(f)).
    (b) The purpose of this subpart is to prevent accidents and 
casualties in railroad operations that result from the presence in the 
work force of railroad employees, including managers and supervisors, 
and agents of railroads who have demonstrated their unfitness to perform 
the safety-sensitive functions described in Sec. 209.303 by violating 
any rule, regulation, order or standard prescribed by FRA. Employees and 
agents who evidence such unfitness may be disqualified, under specified 
terms and conditions, temporarily or permanently, from performing such 
safety-sensitive functions.
    (c) This subpart does not preempt a railroad from initiating 
disciplinary proceedings and imposing disciplinary sanctions against its 
employees, including managers and supervisors, under its collective 
bargaining agreements or in the normal and customary manner. 
Disqualification determinations made under this subpart shall have no 
effect on prior or subsequent disciplinary actions taken against such 
employees by railroads.


<R05>
Sec. 209.303  Coverage.

    This subpart applies to the following individuals:
    (a) Railroad employees who are assigned to perform service subject 
to the Hours of Service Act (45 U.S.C. 61-64b) during a duty tour, 
whether or not the person has performed or is currently performing such 
service, and any person who performs such service.
    (b) Railroad employees or agents who:
    (1) Inspect, install, repair, or maintain track and roadbed;
    (2) Inspect, repair or maintain, locomotives, passenger cars, and 
freight cars;
    (3) Conduct training and testing of employees when the training or 
testing is required by the FRA's safety regulations; or
    (c) Railroad managers, supervisors, or agents when they:
    (1) Perform the safety-sensitive functions listed in paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section;
    (2) Supervise and otherwise direct the performance of the safety-
sensitive functions listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section; or
    (3) Are in a position to direct the commission of violations of any 
of the requirements of parts 213 through 236 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 209.305  Notice of proposed disqualification.

    (a) FRA, through the Chief Counsel, begins a disqualification 
proceeding by serving a notice of proposed disqualification on the 
respondent charging him or her with having violated one or more rules, 
regulations, orders, or standards promulgated by FRA, which render the 
respondent unfit to perform safety-sensitive functions described in 
Sec. 209.303.
    (b) The notice of proposed disqualification issued under this 
section shall contain:
    (1) A statement of the rule(s), regulation(s), order(s), or 
standard(s) that the respondent is alleged to have violated;
    (2) A statement of the factual allegations that form the basis of 
the initial determination that the respondent is not fit to perform 
safety-sensitive functions;
    (3) A statement of the effective date, duration, and other 
conditions, if any, of the disqualification order;
    (4) A statement of the respondent's right to answer the charges in 
writing and furnish affidavits and any other documentary evidence in 
support of the answer;
    (5) A statement of the respondent's right to make an informal 
response to the Chief Counsel;

[[Page 29]]

    (6) A statement of the respondent's right to request a hearing and 
the procedures for requesting a hearing;
    (7) A statement of the respondent's right to counsel or other 
designated representative; and
    (8) Notice of the consequences of the respondent's failure to take 
any of the actions described in Sec. 209.307(a).
    (c) The Chief Counsel shall enclose with the notice of proposed 
disqualification a copy of the material that is relied on in support of 
the charges. Nothing in this section precludes the Chief Counsel from 
presenting at a subsequent hearing under Sec. 209.321 any evidence of 
the charges set forth in the notice that the Chief Counsel acquires 
after service thereof on the respondent. The Chief Counsel, however, 
shall serve a copy of any such evidence on the respondent at or before 
the prehearing conference required under Sec. 209.319. Failure to 
furnish such evidence to respondent at or before the prehearing 
conference bars its introduction at the hearing.
    (d) The Chief Counsel shall provide a copy of the notice of proposed 
disqualification to the railroad that employs the respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 209.307  Reply.

    (a) Within 30 days after receipt of the notice of proposed 
disqualification issued under Sec. 209.305, the respondent shall reply 
in writing to the charges. The respondent may furnish affidavits and any 
other documentary evidence in support of the reply. Further, the 
respondent may elect to--
    (1) Stipulate to the charges and consent to the imposition of the 
disqualification order under the conditions set forth in the notice;
    (2) Make an informal response as provided in Sec. 209.309; or
    (3) Request a hearing as provided in Sec. 209.311.
    (b) The Chief Counsel may extend the reply period for good cause 
shown, provided the request for extension is served before the 
expiration of the period provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Failure of the respondent to reply to the notice of proposed 
disqualification within the period provided in paragraph (a) of this 
section or an extension thereto provided under paragraph (b) of this 
section constitutes a waiver of the respondent's right to appear and 
contest the charges or the proposed disqualification. Respondent's 
failure to reply authorizes the Chief Counsel, without further notice to 
the respondent, to find the respondent unfit for the performance of the 
safety-sensitive functions described in Sec. 209.303 and to order the 
respondent disqualified from performing them for the period and under 
the other conditions described in the notice of proposed 
disqualification. The Chief Counsel shall serve respondent with the 
disqualification order and provide a copy of the order to the railroad 
by which the respondent is employed.


<R05>
Sec. 209.309  Informal response.

    (a) If the respondent elects to make an informal response to a 
notice of proposed disqualification, he or she shall submit to the Chief 
Counsel such written explanations, information, or other materials as 
respondent may desire in answer to the charges or in mitigation of the 
proposed disqualification.
    (b) The respondent may include in an informal written response a 
request for a conference. Upon receipt of such a request, the Chief 
Counsel shall arrange for a conference at a time and place designated by 
the Chief Counsel.
    (c) Written explanations, information, or materials submitted by the 
respondent and relevant information presented during any conference held 
under this section shall be considered by the Chief Counsel in reviewing 
the notice of proposed disqualification, including the question of the 
respondent's fitness and the conditions of any disqualification that may 
be imposed.
    (d) After consideration of an informal response, including any 
relevant information presented at a conference, the Chief Counsel shall 
take one of the following actions:
    (1) Dismiss all the charges and terminate the notice of proposed 
disqualification;
    (2) Dismiss some of the charges and mitigate the proposed 
disqualification;
    (3) Mitigate the proposed disqualification; or
    (4) Sustain the charges and proposed disqualification.

[[Page 30]]

    (e) Should the Chief Counsel sustain, in whole or in part, the 
charges and proposed disqualification and reach settlement with the 
respondent, the Chief Counsel shall issue an appropriate 
disqualification order reflecting the settlement and shall provide a 
copy of that order to the railroad by which the respondent is employed. 
The duration of the disqualification period may be less than, but shall 
be no greater than, the period set forth in the notice. Any settlement 
reached shall be evidenced by a written agreement, which shall include 
declarations from the respondent stipulating to the charges contained in 
the disqualification order, consenting to the imposition of the 
disqualification under the conditions set forth in the disqualification 
order, and waiving his or her right to a hearing.
    (f) If settlement of the charges against the respondent is not 
achieved, the Chief Counsel shall terminate settlement discussions no 
later than 30 days from service of the informal response upon the Chief 
Counsel by serving respondent written notice of termination of 
settlement negotiations.
    (g) By electing to make an informal response to a notice of proposed 
disqualification, the respondent does not waive the right to a hearing. 
However, the respondent must submit the hearing request required by 
Sec. 209.311(a) within l0 days after receipt of the notice of 
termination of settlement negotiations from the Chief Counsel. Failure 
to submit such a request constitutes a waiver of the respondent's right 
to appear and contest the charges or the proposed disqualification.
    (h) The Chief Counsel may extend the period for requesting a hearing 
for good cause shown, provided the request for extension is served 
before the expiration of the period provided in paragraph (g) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 209.311  Request for hearing.

    (a) If the respondent elects to request a hearing, he or she must 
submit a written request within the time periods specified in Sec. 
209.307(a) or Sec. 209.309(g) to the Chief Counsel referring to the 
case number that appears on the notice of proposed disqualification. The 
request must contain the following:
    (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the respondent and of 
the respondent's designated representative, if any;
    (2) A specific response admitting, denying, or explaining each 
allegation of the notice of disqualification order.
    (3) A description of the claims and defenses to be raised by the 
respondent at the hearing; and
    (4) The signature of the respondent or the representative, if any.
    (b) Upon receipt of a request for a hearing complying with the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the Chief Counsel shall 
arrange for the appointment of a presiding officer and transmit the 
disqualification file to the presiding officer, who shall schedule the 
hearing for the earliest practicable date within the time period set by 
Sec. 209.321(a) of this subpart.
    (c) Upon assignment of a presiding officer, further matters in the 
proceeding generally are conducted by and through the presiding officer, 
except that the Chief Counsel and respondent may settle or voluntarily 
dismiss the case without order of the presiding officer. The Chief 
Counsel shall promptly notify the presiding officer of any settlement or 
dismissal of the case.


<R05>
Sec. 209.313  Discovery.

    (a) Disqualification proceedings shall be conducted as expeditiously 
as possible with due regard to the rights of the parties. Discovery is 
designed to enable a party to obtain relevant information needed for 
preparation of the party's case. These regulations are intended to 
provide a simple, timely, and relatively economical system for 
discovery. They shall be interpreted and applied so as to avoid delay 
and facilitate adjudication of the case.
    (b) Discovery may be obtained by requests for admission under Sec. 
209.6, requests for production of documentary or other tangible evidence 
under Sec. 209.7, and depositions under Sec. 209.8.
    (c) A party may initiate the methods of discovery permitted under 
paragraph (b) of this section at any time after respondent requests a 
hearing under Sec. 209.311.
    (d) Discovery shall be completed within 90 days after receipt of 
respondent's request for a hearing under

[[Page 31]]

Sec. 209.311. Upon motion for good cause shown, the presiding officer 
may extend this time period for an additional 30 days. The presiding 
officer may grant an additional 30 day extension only when the party 
requesting the extension shows by clear and convincing evidence that the 
party was unable to complete discovery within the prescribed time period 
through no fault or lack of due diligence of such party, and that denial 
of the request would result in irreparable prejudice.
    (e) If a party fails to comply with a discovery order or an order to 
compel, the presiding officer may:
    (1) Strike any appropriate part of the pleadings or other 
submissions of the party failing to comply with such order;
    (2) Prohibit the party failing to comply with such order from 
introducing evidence relating to the information sought;
    (3) Draw an inference in favor of the requesting party with regard 
to the information sought; and
    (4) Permit the requesting party to introduce secondary evidence 
concerning the information sought.


<R05>
Sec. 209.315  Subpoenas.

    Once a notice of proposed disqualification has been issued in a 
particular matter, only the presiding officer may issue, deny, quash, or 
modify subpoenas under this subpart in accordance with Sec. 209.7.


<R05>
Sec. 209.317  Official record.

    The notice of proposed disqualification, respondent's reply, 
exhibits, and verbatim record of testimony, if a hearing is held, and 
all pleadings, stipulations, and admissions filed and rulings and orders 
entered in the course of the proceeding shall constitute the exclusive 
and official record.


<R05>
Sec. 209.319  Prehearing conference.

    (a) The parties shall confer with the presiding officer, either in 
person or by telephone, for a conference at least 10 days before the 
hearing to consider:
    (1) Formulation and simplification of the issues;
    (2) Stipulations, admissions of fact, and admissions of the contents 
and authenticity of documents;
    (3) Advance rulings from the presiding officer on the admissibility 
of evidence;
    (4) Identification of witnesses, including the scope of their 
testimony, and of hearing exhibits;
    (5) Possibility of settlement; and
    (6) Such other matters as the presiding officer deems necessary to 
expedite the disposition of the proceeding.
    (b) The record shall show the matters disposed of by order and by 
agreement in such a prehearing conference. The subsequent course of the 
hearing shall be controlled by such action.
    (c) The prehearing conference shall be held within 150 days after 
receipt of respondent's request for a hearing under Sec. 209.311.


<R05>
Sec. 209.321  Hearing.

    (a) Upon receipt of a hearing request complying with Sec. 209.311, 
an administrative hearing for review of a notice of proposed 
disqualification shall be conducted by a presiding officer, who can be 
any person authorized by the FRA Administrator, including an 
administrative law judge. The hearing shall begin within 180 days from 
receipt of respondent's hearing request. Notice of the time and place of 
the hearing shall be given to the parties at least 20 days before the 
hearing. Testimony by witnesses shall be given under oath and the 
hearing shall be recorded verbatim. The hearing shall be open to the 
public, unless the presiding official determines that it would be in the 
best interests of the respondent, a witness, or other affected persons, 
to close all or any part of it. If the presiding official makes such a 
determination, an appropriate order, which sets forth the reasons 
therefor, shall be entered.
    (b) The presiding officer may:
    (1) Administer oaths and affirmations;
    (2) Issue subpoenas as provided by Sec. 209.7;
    (3) Adopt procedures for the submission of evidence in written form;
    (4) Take or cause depositions to be taken as provided in Sec. 
209.8;
    (5) Rule on offers of proof and receive relevant evidence;
    (6) Examine witnesses at the hearing;

[[Page 32]]

    (7) Convene, recess, reconvene, adjourn, and otherwise regulate the 
course of the hearing;
    (8) Hold conferences for settlement, simplification of the issues, 
or any other proper purpose; and
    (9) Take any other action authorized by or consistent with the 
provisions of this subpart and permitted by law that may expedite the 
hearing or aid in the disposition of an issue raised therein.
    (c) FRA has the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, 
as to the facts alleged in the notice of proposed disqualification, the 
reasonableness of the conditions of the qualification proposed, and, 
except as provided in Sec. 209.329(a), the respondent's lack of fitness 
to perform safety-sensitive functions. The Chief Counsel may offer 
relevant evidence, including testimony, in support of the allegations 
contained in the notice of proposed disqualification and conduct such 
cross-examination as may be required for a full disclosure of the 
material facts.
    (d) The respondent may appear and be heard on respondent's own 
behalf or through respondent's designated representative. The respondent 
may offer relevant evidence, including testimony, in defense of the 
allegations or in mitigation of the proposed disqualification and 
conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full disclosure 
of the material facts. Respondent has the burden of proof, by a 
preponderance of the evidence, as to any affirmative defense, including 
that respondent's actions were in obedience to the direct order of a 
railroad supervisor or higher level official.
    (e) The record shall be closed at the conclusion of the hearing, 
unless the parties request the opportunity to submit proposed findings 
and conclusions. When the presiding officer allows the parties to submit 
proposed findings and conclusions, documents previously identified for 
introduction into evidence, briefs, or other posthearing submissions the 
record shall be left open for such time as the presiding officer grants 
for that purpose.

<R05>
Sec. 209.323  Initial decision.

    (a) The presiding officer shall prepare an initial decision after 
the closing of the record. The initial decision may dismiss the notice 
of proposed disqualification, in whole or in part, sustain the charges 
and proposed disqualification, or sustain the charges and mitigate the 
proposed disqualification.
    (b) If the presiding officer sustains the charges and the proposed 
disqualification, dismisses some of the charges, or mitigates the 
proposed disqualification, the presiding officer shall issue and serve 
an appropriate order disqualifying respondent from engaging in the 
safety-sensitive functions described in Sec. 209.303. If the presiding 
officer dismisses all of the charges set forth in notice of proposed 
disqualification, a dismissal order shall be issued and served.
    (c) Each initial decision shall contain:
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as the reasons

prescribed in Sec. 209.325; and
    (5) Notice of the parties' appeal rights, as prescribed in Sec. 
209.327.
    (d) The decision shall be served upon the FRA Chief Counsel and the

employed.


<R05>
Sec. 209.325  Finality of decision.

    (a) The initial decision of the presiding officer shall become final 
35 days after issuance. Such decisions are not precedent.
    (b) Exception. The initial decision shall not become final if, 
within 35 days after issuance of the decision, any party files an appeal 
under Sec. 209.327. The timely filing of such an appeal shall stay the 
order in the initial decision.

[[Page 33]]


<R05>
Sec. 209.327  Appeal.

    (a) Any party aggrieved by an initial decision issued under Sec. 
209.323 may file an appeal. The appeal must be filed within 35 days of

the appeal shall be served on each party. The appeal shall set forth 
objections to the initial decision, supported by reference to applicable 
laws and regulations, and with specific reference to the record. If the 
Administrator has played any role in investigating, prosecuting, or 
deciding to prosecute the particular case, the Administrator shall 
recuse him or herself and delegate his or her authority under this 
section to a person not so involved.
    (b) A party may file a reply to an appeal within 25 days of service

the appeal. On the Administrator's own initiative or upon written motion 
by any party, the Administrator may determine that oral argument will 
contribute substantially to the development of the issues on appeal and 
may grant the parties an opportunity for oral argument.
    (e) The Administrator may affirm, reverse, alter, or modify the 
decision of the presiding officer, or may remand the case for further 
proceedings before the presiding officer. The Administrator shall inform 
the parties and the presiding officer of his or her decision.
    (f) The decision of the Administrator is final, constitutes final 
agency action, and is not subject to further administrative review.


<R05>
Sec. 209.329  Assessment considerations.

    (a) Proof of a respondent's willful violation of one of the 
requirements of parts 213 through 236 (excluding parts 225, 228, and 
233) of this title establishes a rebuttable presumption that the 
respondent is unfit to perform the safety-sensitive functions described 
in Sec. 209.303. Where such presumption arises, the respondent has the 
burden of establishing that, taking account of the factors in paragraph 
(b) of this section, he or she is fit to perform the foregoing safety-
sensitive functions for the period and under the other conditions, if 
any, proposed in the notice of proposed disqualification.
    (b) In determining respondent's lack of fitness to perform safety-
sensitive functions and the duration and other conditions, if any, of 
appropriate disqualification orders under Sec. Sec. 209.309, 209.323, 
and 209.327, the factors to be considered, to the extent: Each is 
pertinent to the respondent's case, include but are not limited to the 
following:
    (1) The nature and circumstances of the violation, including whether 
the violation was intentional, technical, or inadvertent, was committed 
willfully, or was frequently repeated;
    (2) The adverse impact or the potentially adverse impact of the 
violation on the health and safety of persons and the safety of 
property;
    (3) The railroad's operating rules, safety rules, and repair and 
maintenance standards;
    (4) Repair and maintenance standards adopted by the industry;
    (5) The consistency of the conditions of the proposed 
disqualification with disqualification orders issued against other 
employees for the same or similar violations;
    (6) Whether the respondent was on notice of any safety regulations 
that were violated or whether the respondent had been warned about the 
conduct in question;
    (7) The respondent's past record of committing violations of safety 
regulations, including previous FRA warnings issued, disqualifications 
imposed, civil penalties assessed, railroad disciplinary actions, and 
criminal convictions therefor;
    (8) The civil penalty scheduled for the violation of the safety 
regulation in question;

[[Page 34]]

    (9) Mitigating circumstances surrounding the violation, such as the 
existence of an emergency situation endangering persons or property and 
the need for the respondent to take immediate action; and
    (10) Such other factors as may be warranted in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 209.331  Enforcement of disqualification order.

    (a) A railroad that employs or formerly employed an individual 
serving under a disqualification order shall inform prospective or 
actual employers of the terms and conditions of the order upon receiving 
notice that the disqualified employee is being considered for employment 
with or is employed by another railroad to perform any of the safety-
sensitive functions described in Sec. 209.303.
    (b) A railroad that is considering hiring an individual to perform 
the safety-sensitive functions described in Sec. 209.303 shall 
ascertain from the individual's previous employer, if such employer was 
a railroad, whether the individual is subject to a disqualification 
order.
    (c) An individual subject to a disqualification order shall inform 
his or her employer of the order and provide a copy thereof within 5 
days after receipt of the order. Such an individual shall likewise 
inform any prospective employer who is considering hiring the individual 
to perform any of the safety-sensitive functions described in Sec. 
209.303 of the order and provide a copy thereof within 5 days after 
receipt of the order or upon application for the position, whichever 
first occurs.


<R05>
Sec. 209.333  Prohibitions.

    (a) An individual subject to a disqualification order shall not work 
for any railroad in any manner inconsistent with the order.
    (b) A railroad shall not employ any individual subject to a 
disqualification order in any manner inconsistent with the order.


<R05>
Sec. 209.335  Penalties.

    (a) Any individual who violates Sec. 209.331(c) or Sec. 209.333(a) 
may be permanently disqualified from performing the safety-sensitive 
functions described in Sec. 209.303. Any individual who willfully 
violates Sec. 209.331(c) or Sec. 209.333(a) may also be assessed a 
civil penalty of at least $1,000 and not more than $5,000 per violation.
    (b) Any railroad that violates Sec. 209.331 (a) or (b) or Sec. 
209.333(b) may be assessed a civil penalty of at least $5,000 and not 
more than $11,000 per violation.
    (c) Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate 
offense.

    Source: 59 FR 43676, Aug. 24, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 209.401  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of this subpart is to prevent accidents and 
casualties arising from the operation of a railroad that result from a 
railroad's failure to remedy certain violations of the Federal railroad 
safety laws for which assessment of a civil penalty has been 
recommended.
    (b) To achieve this purpose, this subpart requires that if an FRA 
Safety Inspector notifies a railroad both that assessment of a civil 
penalty will be recommended for its failure to comply with a provision 
of the Federal railroad safety laws and that a remedial actions report 
must be submitted, the railroad shall report to the FRA Safety 
Inspector, within 30 days after the end of the calendar month in which 
such notification is received, actions taken to remedy that failure.
    (c) This subpart does not relieve the railroad of the underlying 
responsibility to comply with a provision of the Federal railroad safety 
laws. The 30-day period after the end of the calendar month in which 
notification is received

[[Page 35]]

is intended merely to provide the railroad with an opportunity to 
prepare its report to FRA, and does not excuse continued noncompliance.
    (d) This subpart requires the submission of remedial actions reports 
for the general categories of physical defects, recordkeeping and 
reporting violations, and filing violations, where the railroad can 
literally and specifically correct a failure to comply with a provision 
of the Federal railroad safety laws, as reasonably determined by the FRA 
Safety Inspector. No railroad is required to submit a report for a 
failure involving either a completed or past transaction or a 
transaction that it can no longer remedy.


<R05>
Sec. 209.403  Applicability.

    This subpart applies to any railroad that receives written 
notification from an FRA Safety Inspector both (i) that assessment of a 
civil penalty will be recommended for its failure to comply with a 
provision of the Federal railroad safety laws and (ii) that it must 
submit a remedial actions report.


<R05>
Sec. 209.405  Reporting of remedial actions.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 209.407, each railroad that has 
received written notification on Form FRA F 6180.96 from an FRA Safety 
Inspector both that assessment of a civil penalty will be recommended 
for the railroad's failure to comply with a provision of the Federal 
railroad safety laws and that it must submit a remedial actions report, 
shall report on this form all actions that it takes to remedy that 
failure. The railroad shall submit the completed form to the FRA Safety 
Inspector within 30 days after the end of the calendar month in which 
the notification is received.
    (1) Date of receipt of notification. If the FRA Safety Inspector 
provides written notification to the railroad by first class mail, then 
for purposes of determining the calendar month in which notification is 
received, the railroad shall be presumed to have received the 
notification five business days following the date of mailing.
    (2) Completion of Form FRA F 6180.96, including selection of 
railroad remedial action code. Each railroad shall complete the remedial 
actions report in the manner prescribed on the report form. The railroad 
shall select the one remedial action code on the reporting form that 
most accurately reflects the action or actions that it took to remedy 
the failure, such as, repair or replacement of a defective component 
without movement, movement of a locomotive or car for repair (where 
permitted) and its subsequent repair, completion of a required test or 
inspection, removal of a noncomplying item from service but not for 
repair (where permitted), reduction of operating speed (where sufficient 
to achieve compliance), or any combination of actions appropriate to 
remedy the noncompliance cited. Any railroad selecting the remedial 
action code ``other remedial actions'' shall also furnish FRA with a 
brief narrative description of the action or actions taken.
    (3) Submission of Form FRA F 6180.96. The railroad shall return the 
form by first class mail to the FRA Safety Inspector whose name and 
address appear on the form.
    (b) Any railroad concluding that the violation alleged on the 
inspection report may not have occurred may submit the remedial actions 
report with an appropriate written explanation. Failure to raise all 
pertinent defenses does not foreclose the railroad from doing so in 
response to a penalty demand.


<R05>
Sec. 209.407  Delayed reports.

    (a) If a railroad cannot initiate or complete remedial actions 
within 30 days after the end of the calendar month in which the 
notification is received, it shall--
    (1) Prepare, in writing, an explanation of the reasons for such 
delay and a good faith estimate of the date by which it will complete 
the remedial actions, stating the name and job title of the preparer and 
including either:
    (i) A photocopy of both sides of the Form FRA F 6180.96 on which the 
railroad received notification; or
    (ii) The following information:
    (A) The inspection report number;
    (B) The inspection date; and
    (C) The item number; and
    (2) Sign, date, and submit such written explanation and estimate, by 
first

[[Page 36]]

class mail, to the FRA Safety Inspector whose name and address appear on 
the notification, within 30 days after the end of the calendar month in 
which the notification is received.
    (b) Within 30 days after the end of the calendar month in which all 
such remedial actions are completed, the railroad shall report in 
accordance with the remedial action code procedures referenced in Sec. 
209.405(a). The additional time provided by this section for a railroad 
to submit a delayed report shall not excuse it from liability for any 
continuing violation of a provision of the Federal railroad safety laws.


<R05>
Sec. 209.409  Penalties.

    Any person who violates any requirement of this subpart or causes 
the violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil penalty of 
at least $500 and not more than $16,000 per violation, except that: 
Penalties may be assessed against individuals only for willful 
violations, and, where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of 
repeated violations has created an imminent hazard of death or injury to 
persons, or has caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $27,000 
per violation may be assessed. Each day a violation continues shall 
constitute a separate offense. A person may also be subject to the 
criminal penalties provided for in 49 U.S.C. 21311 (formerly codified in 
45 U.S.C. 438(e)) for knowingly and willfully falsifying reports 
required by this subpart.

   Sec. Appendix A to Part 209--Statement of Agency Policy Concerning 

             Enforcement of the Federal Railroad Safety Laws

    The Federal Railroad Administration (``fra'') enforces the federal 
railroad safety statutes under delegation from the Secretary of 
Transportation. See 49 CFR 1.49 (c), (d), (f), (g), and (m). Those 
statutes include the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (``Safety 
Act''), 45 U.S.C. 421 et seq., and a group of statutes enacted prior to 
1970 referred to collectively herein as the ``older safety statutes'': 
The Safety Appliance Acts, 45 U.S.C. 1-16; the Locomotive Inspection 
Act, 45 U.S.C. 22-34; the Accident Reports Act, 45 U.S.C. 38-43; the 
Hours of Service Act, 45 U.S.C. 61-64b; and the Signal Inspection Act, 
49 App. U.S.C. 26. Regulations implementing those statutes are found at 
49 CFR parts 213 through 236. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988 
(Pub. L. No. 100-342, enacted June 22, 1988) (``RSIA'') raised the 
maximum civil penalties available under the railroad safety laws and 
made individuals liable for willful violations of those laws. FRA also 
enforces the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, 49 App. U.S.C. 1801 
et seq., as it pertains to the shipment or transportation of hazardous 
materials by rail.

                        The Civil Penalty Process

    The front lines in the civil penalty process are the FRA safety 
inspectors: FRA employs over 300 inspectors, and their work is 
supplemented by approximately 100 inspectors from states participating 
in enforcement of the federal rail safety laws. These inspectors 
routinely inspect the equipment, track, and signal systems and observe 
the operations of the nation's railroads. They also investigate hundreds 
of complaints filed annually by those alleging noncompliance with the 
laws. When inspection or complaint investigation reveals noncompliance 
with the laws, each noncomplying condition or action is listed on an 
inspection report. Where the inspector determines that the best method 
of promoting compliance is to assess a civil penalty, he or she prepares 
a violation report, which is essentially a recommendation to the FRA 
Office of Chief Counsel to assess a penalty based on the evidence 
provided in or with the report.
    In determining which instances of noncompliance merit penalty 
recommendations, the inspector considers:
    (1) The inherent seriousness of the condition or action;
    (2) The kind and degree of potential safety hazard the condition or 
action poses in light of the immediate factual situation;
    (3) Any actual harm to persons or property already caused by the 
condition or action;
    (4) The offending person's (i.e., railroad's or individual's) 
general level of current compliance as revealed by the inspection as a 
whole;
    (5) The person's recent history of compliance with the relevant set 
of regulations, especially at the specific location or division of the 
railroad involved;
    (6) Whether a remedy other than a civil penalty (ranging from a 
warning on up to an emergency order) is more appropriate under all of 
the facts; and
    (7) Such other factors as the immediate circumstances make relevant.
    The civil penalty recommendation is reviewed at the regional level 
by a specialist in the subject matter involved, who requires correction 
of any technical flaws and determines whether the recommendation is 
consistent with national enforcement policy in

[[Page 37]]

similar circumstances. Guidance on that policy in close cases is 
sometimes sought from Office of Safety headquarters. Violation reports 
that are technically and legally sufficient and in accord with FRA 
policy are sent from the regional office to the Office of Chief Counsel.
    The exercise of this discretion at the field and regional levels is 
a vital part of the enforcement process, ensuring that the exacting and 
time-consuming civil penalty process is used to address those situations 
most in need of the deterrent effect of penalties. FRA exercises that 
discretion with regard to individual violators in the same manner it 
does with respect to railroads.
    The Office of Chief Counsel's Safety Division reviews each violation 
report it receives from the regional offices for legal sufficiency and 
assesses penalties based on those allegations that survive that review. 
Historically, the Division has returned to the regional offices less 
than five percent of the reports submitted in a given year, often with a 
request for further work and resubmission.
    Where the violation was committed by a railroad, penalties are 
assessed by issuance of a penalty demand letter that summarizes the 
claims, encloses the violation report with a copy of all evidence on 
which FRA is relying in making its initial charge, and explains that the 
railroad may pay in full or submit, orally or in writing, information 
concerning any defenses or mitigating factors. The railroad safety 
statutes, in conjunction with the Federal Claims Collection Act, 
authorize FRA to adjust or compromise the initial penalty claims based 
on a wide variety of mitigating factors. This system permits the 
efficient collection of civil penalties in amounts that fit the actual 
offense without resort to time-consuming and expensive litigation. Over 
its history, FRA has had to request that the Attorney General bring suit 
to collect a penalty on only a very few occasions.
    Once penalties have been assessed, the railroad is given a 
reasonable amount of time to investigate the charges. Larger railroads 
usually make their case before FRA in an informal conference covering a 
number of case files that have been issued and investigated since the 
previous conference. Thus, in terms of the negotiating time of both 
sides, economies of scale are achieved that would be impossible if each 
case were negotiated separately. The settlement conferences, held either 
in Washington or another mutually agreed on location, include technical 
experts from both FRA and the railroad as well as lawyers for both 
parties. In addition to allowing the two sides to make their cases for 
the relative merits of the various claims, these conferences also 
provide a forum for addressing current compliance problems. Smaller 
railroads usually prefer to handle negotiations through the mail or over 
the telephone, often on a single case at a time. Once the two sides have 
agreed to an amount on each case, that agreement is put in writing and a 
check is submitted to FRA's accounting division covering the full amount 
agreed on.
    Cases brought under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, 49 
App. U.S.C. 1801 et seq., are, due to certain statutory requirements, 
handled under more formal administrative procedures. See 49 CFR part 
209, subpart B.

                   Civil Penalties Against Individuals

    The RSIA amended the penalty provisions of the railroad safety 
statutes to make them applicable to any ``person (including a railroad 
and any manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of a 
railroad)'' who fails to comply with the regulations or statutes. E.g., 
section 3 of the RSIA, amending section 209 of the Safety Act. However, 
the RSIA also provided that civil penalties may be assessed against 
individuals ``only for willful violations.''
    Thus, any individual meeting the statutory description of ``person'' 
is liable for a civil penalty for a willful violation of, or for 
willfully causing the violation of, the safety statutes or regulations. 
Of course, as has traditionally been the case with respect to acts of 
noncompliance by railroads, the FRA field inspector exercises discretion 
in deciding which situations call for a civil penalty assessment as the 
best method of ensuring compliance. The inspector has a range of 
options, including an informal warning, a more formal warning letter 
issued by the Safety Division of the Office of Chief Counsel, 
recommendation of a civil penalty assessment, recommendation of 
disqualification or suspension from safety-sensitive service, or, under 
the most extreme circumstances, recommendation of emergency action.
    The threshold question in any alleged violation by an individual 
will be whether that violation was ``willful.'' (Note that section 3(a) 
of the RSIA, which authorizes suspension or disqualification of a person 
whose violation of the safety laws has shown him or her to be unfit for 
safety-sensitive service, does not require a showing of willfulness. 
Regulations implementing that provision are found at 49 CFR part 209, 
subpart D.) FRA proposed this standard of liability when, in 1987, it 
originally proposed a statutory revision authorizing civil penalties 
against individuals. FRA believed then that it would be too harsh a 
system to collect fines from individuals on a strict liability basis, as 
the safety statutes permit FRA to do with respect to railroads. FRA also 
believed that even a reasonable care standard (e.g., the Hazardous 
Materials Transportation Act's standard for civil penalty liability, 49 
U.S.C. 1809(a)) would subject individuals to civil penalties

[[Page 38]]

in more situations than the record warranted. Instead, FRA wanted the 
authority to penalize those who violate the safety laws through a 
purposeful act of free will.
    Thus, FRA considers a ``willful'' violation to be one that is an 
intentional, voluntary act committed either with knowledge of the 
relevant law or reckless disregard for whether the act violated the 
requirements of the law. Accordingly, neither a showing of evil purpose 
(as is sometimes required in certain criminal cases) nor actual 
knowledge of the law is necessary to prove a willful violation, but a 
level of culpability higher than negligence must be demonstrated. See 
Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U.S. 111 (1985); Brock v. 
Morello Bros. Constr., Inc. 809 F.2d 161 (1st Cir. 1987); and Donovan v. 
Williams Enterprises, Inc., 744 F.2d 170 (D.C. Cir. 1984).
    Reckless disregard for the requirements of the law can be 
demonstrated in many ways. Evidence that a person was trained on or made 
aware of the specific rule involved--or, as is more likely, its 
corresponding industry equivalent--would suffice. Moreover, certain 
requirements are so obviously fundamental to safe railroading (e.g., the 
prohibition against disabling an automatic train control device) that 
any violation of them, regardless of whether the person was actually 
aware of the prohibition, should be seen as reckless disregard of the 
law. See Brock, supra, 809 F.2d 164. Thus, a lack of subjective 
knowledge of the law is no impediment to a finding of willfulness. If it 
were, a mere denial of the content of the particular regulation would 
provide a defense. Having proposed use of the word ``willful,'' FRA 
believes it was not intended to insulate from liability those who simply 
claim--contrary to the established facts of the case--they had no reason 
to believe their conduct was wrongful.
    A willful violation entails knowledge of the facts constituting the 
violation, but actual, subjective knowledge need not be demonstrated. It 
will suffice to show objectively what the alleged violator must have 
known of the facts based on reasonable inferences drawn from the 
circumstances. For example, a person shown to have been responsible for 
performing an initial terminal air brake test that was not in fact 
performed would not be able to defend against a charge of a willful 
violation simply by claiming subjective ignorance of the fact that the 
test was not performed. If the facts, taken as a whole, demonstrated 
that the person was responsible for doing the test and had no reason to 
believe it was performed by others, and if that person was shown to have 
acted with actual knowledge of or reckless disregard for the law 
requiring such a test, he or she would be subject to a civil penalty.
    This definition of ``willful'' fits squarely within the parameters 
for willful acts laid out by Congress in the RSIA and its legislative 
history. Section 3(a) of the RSIA amends the Safety Act to provide:
    For purposes of this section, an individual shall be deemed not to 
have committed a willful violation where such individual has acted 
pursuant to the direct order of a railroad official or supervisor, under 
protest communicated to the supervisor. Such individual shall have the 
right to document such protest.
    As FRA made clear when it recommended legislation granting 
individual penalty authority, a railroad employee should not have to 
choose between liability for a civil penalty or insubordination charges 
by the railroad. Where an employee (or even a supervisor) violates the 
law under a direct order from a supervisor, he or she does not do so of 
his or her free will. Thus, the act is not a voluntary one and, 
therefore, not willful under FRA's definition of the word. Instead, the 
action of the person who has directly ordered the commission of the 
violation is itself a willful violation subjecting that person to a 
civil penalty. As one of the primary sponsors of the RSIA said on the 
Senate floor:
    This amendment also seeks to clarify that the purpose of imposing 
civil penalties against individuals is to deter those who, of their free 
will, decide to violate the safety laws. The purpose is not to penalize 
those who are ordered to commit violations by those above them in the 
railroad chain of command. Rather, in such cases, the railroad official 
or supervisor who orders the others to violate the law would be liable 
for any violations his order caused to occur. One example is the 
movement of railroad cars or locomotives that are actually known to 
contain certain defective conditions. A train crew member who was 
ordered to move such equipment would not be liable for a civil penalty, 
and his participation in such movements could not be used against him in 
any disqualification proceeding brought by FRA.

133 Cong. Rec. S.15899 (daily ed. Nov. 5, 1987) (remarks of Senator 
Exon).

    It should be noted that FRA will apply the same definition of 
``willful'' to corporate acts as is set out here with regard to 
individual violations. Although railroads are strictly liable for 
violations of the railroad safety laws and deemed to have knowledge of 
those laws, FRA's penalty schedules contain, for each regulation, a 
separate amount earmarked as the initial assessment for willful 
violations. Where FRA seeks such an extraordinary penalty from a 
railroad, it will apply the definition of ``willful'' set forth above. 
In such cases--as in all civil penalty cases brought by FRA--the 
aggregate knowledge and actions of the railroad's managers, supervisors, 
employees, and other agents will

[[Page 39]]

be imputed to the railroad. Thus, in situations that FRA decides warrant 
a civil penalty based on a willful violation, FRA will have the option 
of citing the railroad and/or one or more of the individuals involved. 
In cases against railroads other than those in which FRA alleges 
willfulness or in which a particular regulation imposes a special 
standard, the principles of strict liability and presumed knowledge of 
the law will continue to apply.
    The RSIA gives individuals the right to protest a direct order to 
violate the law and to document the protest. FRA will consider such 
protests and supporting documentation in deciding whether and against 
whom to cite civil penalties in a particular situation. Where such a 
direct order has been shown to have been given as alleged, and where 
such a protest is shown to have been communicated to the supervisor, the 
person or persons communicating it will have demonstrated their lack of 
willfulness. Any documentation of the protest will be considered along 
with all other evidence in determining whether the alleged order to 
violate was in fact given.
    However, the absence of such a protest will not be viewed as 
warranting a presumption of willfulness on the part of the employee who 
might have communicated it. The statute says that a person who 
communicates such a protest shall be deemed not to have acted willfully; 
it does not say that a person who does not communicate such a protest 
will be deemed to have acted willfully. FRA would have to prove from all 
the pertinent facts that the employee willfully violated the law. 
Moreover, the absence of a protest would not be dispositive with regard 
to the willfulness of a supervisor who issued a direct order to violate 
the law. That is, the supervisor who allegedly issued an order to 
violate will not be able to rely on the employee's failure to protest 
the order as a complete defense. Rather, the issue will be whether, in 
view of all pertinent facts, the supervisor intentionally and 
voluntarily ordered the employee to commit an act that the supervisor 
knew would violate the law or acted with reckless disregard for whether 
it violated the law.
    FRA exercises the civil penalty authority over individuals through 
informal procedures very similar to those used with respect to railroad 
violations. However, FRA varies those procedures somewhat to account for 
differences that may exist between the railroad's ability to defend 
itself against a civil penalty charge and an individual's ability to do 
so. First, when the field inspector decides that an individual's actions 
warrant a civil penalty recommendation and drafts a violation report, 
the inspector or the regional director informs the individual in writing 
of his or her intention to seek assessment of a civil penalty and the 
fact that a violation report has been transmitted to the Office of Chief 
Counsel. This ensures that the individual has the opportunity to seek 
counsel, preserve documents, or take any other necessary steps to aid 
his or her defense at the earliest possible time.
    Second, if the Office of Chief Counsel concludes that the case is 
meritorious and issues a penalty demand letter, that letter makes clear 
that FRA encourages discussion, through the mail, over the telephone or 
in person, of any defenses or mitigating factors the individual may wish 
to raise. That letter also advises the individual that he or she may 
wish to obtain representation by an attorney and/or labor 
representative. During the negotiation stage, FRA considers each case 
individually on its merits and gives due weight to whatever information 
the alleged violator provides.
    Finally, in the unlikely event that a settlement cannot be reached, 
FRA sends the individual a letter warning of its intention to request 
that the Attorney General sue for the initially proposed amount and 
giving the person a sufficient interval (e.g., 30 days) to decide if 
that is the only alternative.
    FRA believes that the intent of Congress would be violated if 
individuals who agree to pay a civil penalty or are ordered to do so by 
a court are indemnified for that penalty by the railroad or another 
institution (such as a labor organization). Congress intended that the 
penalties have a deterrent effect on individual behavior that would be 
lessened, if not eliminated, by such indemnification.
    Although informal, face-to-face meetings are encouraged during the 
negotiation of a civil penalty charge, the RSIA does not require that 
FRA give individuals or railroads the opportunity for a formal, trial-
type administrative hearing as part of the civil penalty process. FRA 
does not provide that opportunity because such administrative hearings 
would be likely to add significantly to the costs an individual would 
have to bear in defense of a safety claim (and also to FRA's enforcement 
expenses) without shedding any more light on what resolution of the 
matter is fair than would the informal procedures set forth here. Of 
course, should an individual or railroad decide not to settle, that 
person would be entitled to a trial de novo when FRA, through the 
Attorney General, sued to collect the penalty in the appropriate United 
States district court.

           Penalty Schedules; Assessment of Maximum Penalties

    As recommended by the Department of Transportation in its initial 
proposal for rail safety legislative revisions in 1987, the RSIA raised 
the maximum civil penalties for violations of the safety regulations. 
Under the Hours of Service Act, the penalty was changed from a flat $500 
to a penalty of ``up to $1,000, as the Secretary of Transportation

[[Page 40]]

deems reasonable.'' Under all the other statutes, the maximum penalty 
was raised from $2,500 to $10,000 per violation, except that ``where a 
grossly negligent violation or pattern of repeated violations has 
created an imminent hazard of death or injury to persons, or has caused 
death or injury,'' a penalty of up to $20,000 per violation may be 
assessed.
    The Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act of 1992 (RSERA) increased 
the maximum penalty from $1,000 to $10,000 and in some cases, $20,000 
for a violation of the Hours of Service Laws, making these penalty 
amounts uniform with those of FRA's other regulatory provisions. RSERA 
also increased the minimum civil monetary penalty from $250 to $500 for 
all of FRA's regulatory provisions. The Federal Civil Penalties 
Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, Public Law 101-410, 104 Stat. 890, 
note, as amended by Section 31001(s)(1) of the Debt Collection 
Improvement Act of 1996 Public Law 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321-373, April 
26, 1996 required that agencies adjust by regulation each maximum civil 
monetary penalty within the agency's jurisdiction for inflation and make 
subsequent adjustments once every four years after the initial 
adjustment. Accordingly, FRA's maximum civil monetary penalties have 
been adjusted.
    FRA's traditional practice has been to issue penalty schedules 
assigning to each particular regulation specific dollar amounts for 
initial penalty assessments. The schedule (except where issued after 
notice and an opportunity for comment) constitutes a statement of agency 
policy, and is ordinarily issued as an appendix to the relevant part of 
the Code of Federal Regulations. For each regulation, the schedule shows 
two amounts within the $550 to $16,000 range in separate columns, the 
first for ordinary violations, the second for willful violations 
(whether committed by railroads or individuals). In one instance--part 
231--the schedule refers to sections of the relevant FRA defect code 
rather than to sections of the CFR text. Of course, the defect code, 
which is simply a reorganized version of the CFR text used by FRA to 
facilitate computerization of inspection data, is substantively 
identical to the CFR text.
    The schedule amounts are meant to provide guidance as to FRA's 
policy in predictable situations, not to bind FRA from using the full 
range of penalty authority where extraordinary circumstances warrant. 
The Senate report on the bill that became the RSIA stated:
    It is expected that the Secretary would act expeditiously to set 
penalty levels commensurate with the severity of the violations, with 
imposition of the maximum penalty reserved for violation of any 
regulation where warranted by exceptional circumstances. S. Rep. No. 
100-153, 10th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1987).
    Accordingly, under each of the schedules (ordinarily in a footnote), 
and regardless of the fact that a lesser amount might be shown in both 
columns of the schedule, FRA reserves the right to assess the statutory 
maximum penalty of up to $27,000 per violation where a grossly negligent 
violation has created an imminent hazard of death or injury. This 
authority to assess a penalty for a single violation above $11,000 and 
up to $27,000 is used only in very exceptional cases to penalize 
egregious behavior. Where FRA avails itself of this right to use the 
higher penalties in place of the schedule amount it so indicates in its 
penalty demand letter.

          The Extent And Exercise Of FRA's Safety Jurisdiction

    The Safety Act and, as amended by the RSIA, the older safety 
statutes apply to ``railroads.'' Section 202(e) of the Safety Act 
defines railroad as follows:
    The term ``railroad'' as used in this title means all forms of non-
highway ground transportation that run on rails or electromagnetic 
guideways, including (1) commuter or other short-haul rail passenger 
service in a metropolitan or suburban area, as well as any commuter rail 
service which was operated by the Consolidated Rail Corporation as of 
January 1, 1979, and (2) high speed ground transportation systems that 
connect metropolitan areas, without regard to whether they use new 
technologies not associated with traditional railroads. Such term does 
not include rapid transit operations within an urban area that are not 
connected to the general railroad system of transportation.
    Prior to 1988, the older safety statutes had applied only to common 
carriers engaged in interstate or foreign commerce by rail. The Safety 
Act, by contrast, was intended to reach as far as the Commerce Clause of 
the Constitution (i.e., to all railroads that affect interstate 
commerce) rather than be limited to common carriers actually engaged in 
interstate commerce. In reporting out the bill that became the 1970 
Safety Act, the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce 
stated:
    The Secretary's authority to regulate extends to all areas of 
railroad safety. This legislation is intended to encompass all those 
means of rail transportation as are commonly included within the term. 
Thus, ``railroad'' is not limited to the confines of ``common carrier by 
railroad'' as that language is defined in the Interstate Commerce Act.

    FRA's jurisdiction was bifurcated until, in 1988, the RSIA amended 
the older safety statutes to make them coextensive with the Safety Act 
by making them applicable to railroads and incorporating the Safety 
Act's

[[Page 41]]

definition of the term (e.g., 45 U.S.C. 16, as amended). The RSIA also 
made clear that FRA's safety jurisdiction is not confined to entities 
using traditional railroad technology. The new definition of 
``railroad'' emphasized that all non-highway high speed ground 
transportation systems--regardless of technology used--would be 
considered railroads.
    Thus, with the exception of self-contained urban rapid transit 
systems, FRA's statutory jurisdiction extends to all entities that can 
be construed as railroads by virtue of their providing non-highway 
ground transportation over rails or electromagnetic guideways, and will 
extend to future railroads using other technologies not yet in use. For 
policy reasons, however, FRA does not exercise jurisdiction under all of 
its regulations to the full extent permitted by statute. Based on its 
knowledge of where the safety problems were occurring at the time of its 
regulatory action and its assessment of the practical limitations on its 
role, FRA has, in each regulatory context, decided that the best option 
was to regulate something less than the total universe of railroads.
    For example, all of FRA's regulations exclude from their reach 
railroads whose entire operations are confined to an industrial 
installation (i.e., ``plant railroads''), such as those in steel mills 
that do not go beyond the plant's boundaries. E.g., 49 CFR 225.3(a)(1) 
(accident reporting regulations). Some rules exclude passenger 
operations that are not part of the general railroad system (such as 
some tourist railroads) only if they meet the definition of ``insular.'' 
E.g., 49 CFR 225.3(a)(3) (accident reporting) and 234.3(c) (grade 
crossing signal safety). Other regulations exclude not only plant 
railroads but all other railroads that are not operated as a part of, or 
over the lines of, the general railroad system of transportation. E.g., 
49 CFR 214.3 (railroad workplace safety).
    By ``general railroad system of transportation,'' FRA refers to the 
network of standard gage track over which goods may be transported 
throughout the nation and passengers may travel between cities and 
within metropolitan and suburban areas. Much of this network is 
interconnected, so that a rail vehicle can travel across the nation 
without leaving the system. However, mere physical connection to the 
system does not bring trackage within it. For example, trackage within 
an industrial installation that is connected to the network only by a 
switch for the receipt of shipments over the system is not a part of the 
system.
    Moreover, portions of the network may lack a physical connection but 
still be part of the system by virtue of the nature of operations that 
take place there. For example, the Alaska Railroad is not physically 
connected to the rest of the general system but is part of it. The 
Alaska Railroad exchanges freight cars with other railroads by car float 
and exchanges passengers with interstate carriers as part of the general 
flow of interstate commerce. Similarly, an intercity high speed rail 
system with its own right of way would be part of the general system 
although not physically connected to it. The presence on a rail line of 
any of these types of railroad operations is a sure indication that such 
trackage is part of the general system: the movement of freight cars in 
trains outside the confines of an industrial installation, the movement 
of intercity passenger trains, or the movement of commuter trains within 
a metropolitan or suburban area. Urban rapid transit operations are 
ordinarily not part of the general system, but may have sufficient 
connections to that system to warrant exercise of FRA's jurisdiction 
(see discussion of passenger operations, below). Tourist railroad 
operations are not inherently part of the general system and, unless 
operated over the lines of that system, are subject to few of FRA's 
regulations.
    The boundaries of the general system are not static. For example, a 
portion of the system may be purchased for the exclusive use of a single 
private entity and all connections, save perhaps a switch for receiving 
shipments, severed. Depending on the nature of the operations, this 
could remove that portion from the general system. The system may also 
grow, as with the establishment of intercity service on a brand new 
line. However, the same trackage cannot be both inside and outside of 
the general system depending upon the time of day. If trackage is part 
of the general system, restricting a certain type of traffic over that 
trackage to a particular portion of the day does not change the nature 
of the line--it remains the general system.
    Of course, even where a railroad operates outside the general 
system, other railroads that are definitely part of that system may have 
occasion to enter the first railroad's property (e.g., a major railroad 
goes into a chemical or auto plant to pick up or set out cars). In such 
cases, the railroad that is part of the general system remains part of 
that system while inside the installation; thus, all of its activities 
are covered by FRA's regulations during that period. The plant railroad 
itself, however, does not get swept into the general system by virtue of 
the other railroad's activity, except to the extent it is liable, as the 
track owner, for the condition of its track over which the other 
railroad operates during its incursion into the plant. Of course, in the 
opposite situation, where the plant railroad itself operates beyond the 
plant boundaries on the general system, it becomes a railroad with 
respect to those particular operations, during which its equipment, 
crew, and practices would be subject to FRA's regulations.

[[Page 42]]

    In some cases, the plant railroad leases track immediately adjacent 
to its plant from the general system railroad. Assuming such a lease 
provides for, and actual practice entails, the exclusive use of that 
trackage by the plant railroad and the general system railroad for 
purposes of moving only cars shipped to or from the plant, the lease 
would remove the plant railroad's operations on that trackage from the 
general system for purposes of FRA's regulations, as it would make that 
trackage part and parcel of the industrial installation. (As explained 
above, however, the track itself would have to meet FRA's standards if a 
general system railroad operated over it. See 49 CFR 213.5 for the rules 
on how an owner of track may assign responsibility for it.) A lease or 
practice that permitted other types of movements by general system 
railroads on that trackage would, of course, bring it back into the 
general system, as would operations by the plant railroad indicating it 
was moving cars on such trackage for other than its own purposes (e.g., 
moving cars to neighboring industries for hire).
    FRA exercises jurisdiction over tourist, scenic, and excursion 
railroad operations whether or not they are conducted on the general 
railroad system. There are two exceptions: (1) operations of less than 
24-inch gage (which, historically, have never been considered railroads 
under the Federal railroad safety laws); and (2) operations that are off 
the general system and ``insular'' (defined below).
    Insularity is an issue only with regard to tourist operations over 
trackage outside of the general system used exclusively for such 
operations. FRA considers a tourist operation to be insular if its 
operations are limited to a separate enclave in such a way that there is 
no reasonable expectation that the safety of any member of the 
public'except a business guest, a licensee of the tourist operation or 
an affiliated entity, or a trespasser'would be affected by the 
operation. A tourist operation will not be considered insular if one or 
more of the following exists on its line:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq>A public highway-rail crossing that is in use;
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq>An at-grade rail crossing that is in use;
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq>A bridge over a public road or waters used for 
commercial navigation; or
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq>A common corridor with a railroad, i.e., its 
operations are within 30 feet of those of any railroad.
    When tourist operations are conducted on the general system, FRA 
exercises jurisdiction over them, and all of FRA's pertinent regulations 
apply to those operations unless a waiver is granted or a rule 
specifically excepts such operations (e.g., the passenger equipment 
safety standards contain an exception for these operations, 49 CFR 
238.3(c)(3), even if conducted on the general system). When a tourist 
operation is conducted only on track used exclusively for that purpose 
it is not part of the general system. The fact that a tourist operation 
has a switch that connects it to the general system does not make the 
tourist operation part of the general system if the tourist trains do 
not enter the general system and the general system railroad does not 
use the tourist operation's trackage for any purpose other than 
delivering or picking up shipments to or from the tourist operation 
itself.
    If a tourist operation off the general system is insular, FRA does 
not exercise jurisdiction over it, and none of FRA's rules apply. If, 
however, such an operation is not insular, FRA exercises jurisdiction 
over the operation, and some of FRA's rules (i.e., those that 
specifically apply beyond the general system to such operations) will 
apply. For example, FRA's rules on accident reporting, steam 
locomotives, and grade crossing signals apply to these non-insular 
tourist operations (see 49 CFR 225.3, 230.2 amd 234.3), as do all of 
FRA's procedural rules (49 CFR parts 209, 211, and 216) and the Federal 
railroad safety statutes themselves.
    In drafting safety rules, FRA has a specific obligation to consider 
financial, operational, or other factors that may be unique to tourist 
operations. 49 U.S.C. 20103(f). Accordingly, FRA is careful to consider 
those factors in determining whether any particular rule will apply to 
tourist operations. Therefore, although FRA asserts jurisdiction quite 
broadly over these operations, we work to ensure that the rules we issue 
are appropriate to their somewhat special circumstances.
    It is important to note that FRA's exercise of its regulatory 
authority on a given matter does not preclude it from subsequently 
amending its regulations on that subject to bring in railroads 
originally excluded. More important, the self-imposed restrictions on 
FRA's exercise of regulatory authority in no way constrain its exercise 
of emergency order authority under section 203 of the Safety Act. That 
authority was designed to deal with imminent hazards not dealt with by 
existing regulations and/or so dangerous as to require immediate, ex 
parte action on the government's part. Thus, a railroad excluded from 
the reach of any of FRA's regulations is fully within the reach of FRA's 
emergency order authority, which is coextensive with FRA's statutory 
jurisdiction over all railroads.

         FRA's Policy on Jurisdiction Over Passenger Operations

    Under the Federal railroad safety laws, FRA has jurisdiction over 
all railroads except ``rapid transit operations in an urban area that 
are not connected to the general railroad system of transportation.'' 49 
U.S.C.

[[Page 43]]

20102. Within the limits imposed by this authority, FRA exercises 
jurisdiction over all railroad passenger operations, regardless of the 
equipment they use, unless FRA has specifically stated below an 
exception to its exercise of jurisdiction for a particular type of 
operation. This policy is stated in general terms and does not change 
the reach of any particular regulation under its applicability section. 
That is, while FRA may generally assert jurisdiction over a type of 
operation here, a particular regulation may exclude that kind of 
operation from its reach. Therefore, this statement should be read in 
conjunction with the applicability sections of all of FRA's regulations.

                     Intercity Passenger Operations

    FRA exercises jurisdiction over all intercity passenger operations. 
Because of the nature of the service they provide, standard gage 
intercity operations are all considered part of the general railroad 
system, even if not physically connected to other portions of the 
system. Other intercity passenger operations that are not standard gage 
(such as a magnetic levitation system) are within FRA's jurisdiction 
even though not part of the general system.

                           Commuter Operations

    FRA exercises jurisdiction over all commuter operations. Congress 
apparently intended that FRA do so when it enacted the Federal Railroad 
Safety Act of 1970, and made that intention very clear in the 1982 and 
1988 amendments to that act. FRA has attempted to follow that mandate 
consistently. A commuter system's connection to other railroads is not 
relevant under the rail safety statutes. In fact, FRA considers commuter 
railroads to be part of the general railroad system regardless of such 
connections.
    FRA will presume that an operation is a commuter railroad if there 
is a statutory determination that Congress considers a particular 
service to be commuter rail. For example, in the Northeast Rail Service 
Act of 1981, 45 U.S.C. 1104(3), Congress listed specific commuter 
authorities. If that presumption does not apply, and the operation does 
not meet the description of a system that is presumptively urban rapid 
transit (see below), FRA will determine whether a system is commuter or 
urban rapid transit by analyzing all of the system's pertinent facts. 
FRA is likely to consider an operation to be a commuter railroad if:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq>The system serves an urban area, its suburbs, and 
more distant outlying communities in the greater metropolitan area,
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq>The system's primary function is moving passengers 
back and forth between their places of employment in the city and their 
homes within the greater metropolitan area, and moving passengers from 
station to station within the immediate urban area is, at most, an 
incidental function, and
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq>The vast bulk of the system's trains are operated 
in the morning and evening peak periods with few trains at other hours.
    Examples of commuter railroads include Metra and the Northern 
Indiana Commuter Transportation District in the Chicago area; Virginia 
Railway Express and MARC in the Washington area; and Metro-North, the 
Long Island Railroad, New Jersey Transit, and the Port Authority Trans 
Hudson (PATH) in the New York area.

                   Other Short Haul Passenger Service

    The federal railroad safety statutes give FRA authority over 
``commuter or other short-haul railroad passenger service in a 
metropolitan or suburban area.'' 49 U.S.C. 20102. This means that, in 
addition to commuter service, there are other short-haul types of 
service that Congress intended that FRA reach. For example, a passenger 
system designed primarily to move intercity travelers from a downtown 
area to an airport, or from an airport to a resort area, would be one 
that does not have the transportation of commuters within a metropolitan 
area as its primary purpose. FRA would ordinarily exercise jurisdiction 
over such a system as ``other short-haul service'' unless it meets the 
definition of urban rapid transit and is not connected in a significant 
way to the general system.

                     Urban Rapid Transit Operations

    One type of short-haul passenger service requires special treatment 
under the safety statutes: ``rapid transit operations in an urban 
area.'' Only these operations are excluded from FRA's jurisdiction, and 
only if they are ``not connected to the general railroad system.'' FRA 
will presume that an operation is an urban rapid transit operation if 
the system is not presumptively a commuter railroad (see discussion 
above) the operation is a subway or elevated operation with its own 
track system on which no other railroad may operate, has no highway-rail 
crossings at grade, operates within an urban area, and moves passengers 
from station to station within the urban area as one of its major 
functions.
    Where neither the commuter railroad nor urban rapid transit 
presumptions applies, FRA will look at all of the facts pertinent to a 
particular operation to determine its proper characterization. FRA is 
likely to consider an operation to be urban rapid transit if:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq>The operation serves an urban area (and may also 
serve its suburbs),
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq>Moving passengers from station to station within 
the urban boundaries is a major function of the system and there are 
multiple

[[Page 44]]

station stops within the city for that purpose (such an operation could 
still have the transportation of commuters as one of its major functions 
without being considered a commuter railroad), and
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq>The system provides frequent train service even 
outside the morning and evening peak periods.
    Examples of urban rapid transit systems include the Metro in the 
Washington, D.C. area, CTA in Chicago, and the subway systems in New 
York, Boston, and Philadelphia. The type of equipment used by such a 
system is not determinative of its status. However, the kinds of 
vehicles ordinarily associated with street railways, trolleys, subways, 
and elevated railways are the types of vehicles most often used for 
urban rapid transit operations.
    FRA can exercise jurisdiction over a rapid transit operation only if 
it is connected to the general railroad system, but need not exercise 
jurisdiction over every such operation that is so connected. FRA is 
aware of several different ways that rapid transit operations can be 
connected to the general system. Our policy on the exercise of 
jurisdiction will depend upon the nature of the connection(s). In 
general, a connection that involves operation of transit equipment as a 
part of, or over the lines of, the general system will trigger FRA's 
exercise of jurisdiction. Below, we review some of the more common types 
of connections and their effect on the agency's exercise of 
jurisdiction. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of connections.

   Rapid Transit Connections Sufficient To Trigger FRA's Exercise of 
                              Jurisdiction

    Certain types of connections to the general railroad system will 
cause FRA to exercise jurisdiction over the rapid transit line to the 
extent it is connected. FRA will exercise jurisdiction over the portion 
of a rapid transit operation that is conducted as a part of or over the 
lines of the general system. For example, rapid transit operations are 
conducted on the lines of the general system where the rapid transit 
operation and other railroad use the same track. FRA will exercise its 
jurisdiction over the operations conducted on the general system. In 
situations involving joint use of the same track, it does not matter 
that the rapid transit operation occupies the track only at times when 
the freight, commuter, or intercity passenger railroad that shares the 
track is not operating. While such time separation could provide the 
basis for waiver of certain of FRA's rules (see 49 CFR part 211), it 
does not mean that FRA will not exercise jurisdiction. However, FRA will 
exercise jurisdiction over only the portions of the rapid transit 
operation that are conducted on the general system. For example, a rapid 
transit line that operates over the general system for a portion of its 
length but has significant portions of street railway that are not used 
by conventional railroads would be subject to FRA's rules only with 
respect to the general system portion. The remaining portions would not 
be subject to FRA's rules. If the non-general system portions of the 
rapid transit line are considered a ``rail fixed guideway system'' under 
49 CFR Part 659, those rules, issued by the Federal Transit 
Administration (FTA), would apply to them.
    Another connection to the general system sufficient to warrant FRA's 
exercise of jurisdiction is a railroad crossing at grade where the rapid 
transit operation and other railroad cross each other's tracks. In this 
situation, FRA will exercise its jurisdiction sufficiently to assure 
safe operations over the at-grade railroad crossing. FRA will also 
exercise jurisdiction to a limited extent over a rapid transit operation 
that, while not operated on the same tracks as the conventional 
railroad, is connected to the general system by virtue of operating in a 
shared right-of-way involving joint control of trains. For example, if a 
rapid transit line and freight railroad were to operate over a movable 
bridge and were subject to the same authority concerning its use (e.g., 
the same tower operator controls trains of both operations), FRA will 
exercise jurisdiction in a manner sufficient to ensure safety at this 
point of connection. Also, where transit operations share highway-rail 
grade crossings with conventional railroads, FRA expects both systems to 
observe its signal rules. For example, FRA expects both railroads to 
observe the provision of its rule on grade crossing signals that 
requires prompt reports of warning system malfunctions. See 49 CFR part 
234. FRA believes these connections present sufficient intermingling of 
the rapid transit and general system operations to pose significant 
hazards to one or both operations and, in the case of highway-rail grade 
crossings, to the motoring public. The safety of highway users of 
highway-rail grade crossings can best be protected if they get the same 
signals concerning the presence of any rail vehicles at the crossing and 
if they can react the same way to all rail vehicles.

 Rapid Transit Connections Not Sufficient To Trigger FRA's Exercise of 
                              Jurisdiction

    Although FRA could exercise jurisdiction over a rapid transit 
operation based on any connection it has to the general railroad system, 
FRA believes there are certain connections that are too minimal to 
warrant the exercise of its jurisdiction. For example, a rapid transit 
system that has a switch for receiving shipments from the general system 
railroad is not one over which FRA would assert jurisdiction. This 
assumes that the switch is used only for that purpose. In that case, any 
entry onto the rapid transit line by the freight railroad would be for a 
very short

[[Page 45]]

distance and solely for the purpose of dropping off or picking up cars. 
In this situation, the rapid transit line is in the same situation as 
any shipper or consignee; without this sort of connection, it cannot 
receive or offer goods by rail.
    Mere use of a common right-of-way or corridor in which the 
conventional railroad and rapid transit operation do not share any means 
of train control, have a rail crossing at grade, or operate over the 
same highway-rail grade crossings would not trigger FRA's exercise of 
jurisdiction. In this context, the presence of intrusion detection 
devices to alert one or both carriers to incursions by the other one 
would not be considered a means of common train control. These common 
rights of way are often designed so that the two systems function 
completely independently of each other. FRA and FTA will coordinate with 
rapid transit agencies and railroads wherever there are concerns about 
sufficient intrusion detection and related safety measures designed to 
avoid a collision between rapid transit trains and conventional 
equipment.
    Where these very minimal connections exist, FRA will not exercise 
jurisdiction unless and until an emergency situation arises involving 
such a connection, which is a very unlikely event. However, if such a 
system is properly considered a rail fixed guideway system, FTA's rules 
(49 CFR part 659) will apply to it.

                Coordination of the FRA and FTA Programs

    FTA's rules on rail fixed guideway systems (49 CFR part 659) apply 
to any rapid transit systems or portions thereof not subject to FRA's 
rules. On rapid transit systems that are not sufficiently connected to 
the general railroad system to warrant FRA's exercise of jurisdiction 
(as explained above), FTA's rules will apply exclusively. On those rapid 
transit systems that are connected to the general system in such a way 
as warrant exercise of FRA's jurisdiction, only those portions of the 
rapid transit system that are connected to the general system will 
generally be subject to FRA's rules.
    A rapid transit railroad may apply to FRA for a waiver of any FRA 
regulations. See 49 CFR part 211. FRA will seek FTA's views whenever a 
rapid transit operation petitions FRA for a waiver of its safety rules. 
In granting or denying any such waiver, FRA will make clear whether its 
rules do not apply to any segments of the operation so that it is clear 
where FTA's rules do apply.

                         Extraordinary Remedies

    While civil penalties are the primary enforcement tool under the 
federal railroad safety laws, more extreme measures are available under 
certain circumstances. FRA has authority to issue orders directing 
compliance with the Federal Railroad Safety Act, the Hazardous Materials 
Transportation Act, the older safety statutes, or regulations issued 
under any of those statutes. See 45 U.S.C. 437(a) and (d), and 49 App. 
U.S.C. 1808(a). Such an order may issue only after notice and 
opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
49 CFR part 209, subpart C. FRA inspectors also have the authority to 
issue a special notice requiring repairs where a locomotive or freight 
car is unsafe for further service or where a segment of track does not 
meet the standards for the class at which the track is being operated. 
Such a special notice may be appealed to the regional director and the 
FRA Administrator. See 49 CFR part 216, subpart B.
    FRA may, through the Attorney General, also seek injunctive relief 
in federal district court to restrain violations or enforce rules issued 
under the railroad safety laws. See 45 U.S.C. 439 and 49 App. U.S.C. 
1810.
    FRA also has the authority to issue, after notice and an opportunity 
for a hearing, an order prohibiting an individual from performing 
safety-sensitive functions in the rail industry for a specified period. 
This disqualification authority is exercised under procedures found at 
49 CFR part 209, subpart D.
    Criminal penalties are available for knowing violations of 49 U.S.C. 
5104(b), or for willful or reckless violations of the Federal hazardous 
materials transportation law or a regulation issued under that law. See 
49 U.S.C. Chapter 51, and 49 CFR 209.131, 133. The Accident Reports Act, 
45 U.S.C. 39, also contains criminal penalties.
    Perhaps FRA's most sweeping enforcement tool is its authority to 
issue emergency safety orders ``where an unsafe condition or practice, 
or a combination of unsafe conditions or practices, or both, create an 
emergency situation involving a hazard of death or injury to persons * * 
*'' 45 U.S.C. 432(a). After its issuance, such an order may be reviewed 
in a trial-type hearing. See 49 CFR 211.47 and 216.21 through 216.27. 
The emergency order authority is unique because it can be used to 
address unsafe conditions and practices whether or not they contravene 
an existing regulatory or statutory requirement. Given its extraordinary 
nature, FRA has used the emergency order authority sparingly.

<R05>
Sec. Appendix B to Part 209--Federal Railroad Administration Guidelines 

               for Initial Hazardous Materials Assessments

    These guidelines establish benchmarks to be used in determining 
initial civil penalty assessments for violations of the Hazardous 
Materials Regulations (HMR). The guideline penalty amounts reflect the 
best judgment of the FRA Office of Safety Assurance and Compliance (RRS) 
and of the Safety Law Division of the Office of Chief Counsel (RCC) on 
the relative severity of the various violations routinely encountered by 
FRA inspectors on a scale of $250 to $50,000, except the maximum civil 
penalty is $100,000 if the violation results in death, serious illness 
or severe injury to any person, or substantial destruction of property, 
and a minimum $450 penalty applies to a violation related to training. 
(49 U.S.C. 5123) Unless otherwise specified, the guideline amounts refer 
to average violations, that is, violations involving a hazardous 
material with a medium level of hazard, and a violator with an average 
compliance history. In an ``average violation,'' the respondent has 
committed the acts due to a failure to exercise reasonable care under 
the circumstances (``knowingly''). For some sections, the guidelines 
contain a breakdown according to relative severity of the violation, for 
example, the guidelines for shipping paper violations at 49 CFR 
Sec. Sec. 172.200-.203. All penalties in these guidelines are subject 
to change depending upon the circumstances of the particular case. The 
general duty sections, for example Sec. Sec. 173.1 and 174.7, are not 
ordinarily cited as separate violations; they are primarily used as 
explanatory citations to demonstrate applicability of a more specific 
section where applicability is otherwise unclear.
    FRA believes that infractions of the regulations that lead to 
personal injury are especially serious; this is directly in line with 
Department of Transportation policy that hazardous materials are only 
safe for transportation when they are securely sealed in a proper 
package. (Some few containers, such as tank cars of carbon dioxide, are 
designed to vent off excess internal pressure. They are exceptions to 
the ``securely sealed'' rule.) ``Personal injury'' has become somewhat 
of a term of art, especially in the fields of occupational safety and of 
accident reporting. To avoid confusion, these penalty guidelines use the 
notion of ``human contact'' to trigger penalty aggravation. In essence, 
any contact by a hazardous material on a person during transportation is 
a per se injury and proof will not be required regarding the extent of 
the physical contact or its consequences. When a violation of the 
Federal hazardous materials transportation law, an order issued 
thereunder, the Hazardous Materials Regulations or a special permit, 
approval, or order issued under those regulations results in death, 
serious illness or severe injury to any person, or substantial 
destruction of property, a maximum penalty of at least $50,000 and up to 
and including $100,000 shall always be assessed initially.
    These guidelines are a preliminary assessment tool for FRA's use. 
They create no rights in any party. FRA is free to vary from them when 
it deems appropriate and may amend them from time to time without prior 
notice. Moreover, FRA is not bound by any amount it initially proposes 
should litigation become necessary. In fact, FRA reserves the express 
authority to amend the NOPV to seek a penalty of up to $50,000 for each

Emergency Response Information...........  Violations of Sec. Sec.  172.600-.604 are in addition to shipping
                                            paper violations. In citing a carrier, if the railroad's practice is
                                            to carry an emergency response (E/R) book or to put the E/R
                                            information as an attachment to the consist, the unit of violation
                                            is generally the train (or the consist). ``Telephone number''
                                            violations are generally best cited against the shipper; if against
                                            a railroad, there should be proof that the number was given to the
                                            railroad; that is, the number was on the original shipping document.
                                            Considerable aggravation of the penalties under these sections is
                                            possible.

    173.24(b)(1) and 173.24(b)(2) and      Securing closures: These subsections are the general ``no leak''
     173.24(f)(1) and 173.24(f)(1)(ii).     standard for all packagings. Sec.  173.24(b) deals primarily with
                                            packaging as a whole, while Sec.  173.24(f) focuses on closures.
                                            Use Sec.  173.31(d) for tank cars, when possible. Cite the sections
                                            accordingly, using both the leak/non-leak criteria and the package
                                            size considerations to reach the appropriate penalty. Any actual
                                            leak will aggravate the guideline by, typically, 50%; a leak with
                                            contact with a human being will aggravate by at least 100%, up to
                                            the maximum of $50,000, and up to $100,000 if the violation results
                                            in death, serious illness or injury or substantial destruction of
                                            property. For intermodal (IM) portable tanks and other tanks of that
                                            size range, use the tank car penalty amounts, as stated in Sec.
                                            173.31.

                                            Sec.  173.24(f) and use
                                            the penalty amounts for
                                            tank cars: Residue,
                                            generally, Sec.

                                            portable tanks, tank cars,
                                            etc.).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    173.24(c)............................  Use of package not meeting specifications, including required
                                            stencils and markings. The most specific section for the package
                                            involved should be cited (see below). The penalty guideline should
                                            be adjusted for the size of the container. Any actual leak will
                                            aggravate the guideline by, typically, 50%; a leak with contact with
                                            a human being will aggravate by at least 100%, up to the maximum of
                                            $50,000, and up to $100,000 if the violation results in death,
                                            serious illness or injury or substantial destruction of property.

                                            The regulation requires offering ``in the same manner as when''
                                            loaded and may be cited when a car not meeting specifications (see

                                            commodity involved. In addition to the vapor pressure factor cited
                                            below, the RQ (reportable quantity) is a fair measure of the danger
                                            of a commodity to the environment. For RQ values <= 10, consider
                                            aggravating the penalties below by no less than 50 percent.

                                            in a train: The carrier
                                            shall inspect the rail
                                            car, at ground level, for
                                            required markings, labels,
                                            placards, securement of
                                            closures and leakage. The
                                            inspection may be
                                            performed in conjunction
                                            with the inspections
                                            required under parts 215
                                            and 232. This requirement
                                            will not ``trigger'' an
                                            inspection and thereby
                                            require a train to be
                                            stopped. For example, in
                                            run-through train
                                            operations, the train crew
                                            of the receiving railroad
                                            simply assumes
                                            responsibility for the
                                            train from the delivering
                                            crew. Acceptance of
                                            responsibility includes
                                            the right to receive a
                                            penalty action for
                                            transporting a rail car
                                            with a non-complying
                                            condition. Note also that

                                            complying condition by
                                            itself does not prove that
                                            there was a failure to
                                            inspect. See also Sec.
                                            174.50 for violations
                                            against the carrier for
                                            loose (visible from ground
                                            level) closures on cars.
    174.14...............................  Failure to expedite:         2,500.
                                            Violation of ``48-hour

General Operating Requirements...........  This subpart (Subpart B) of Part 174 has two sections referring to
                                            shipment documentation: Sec.  174.24 relating to accepting
                                            documents, and Sec.  174.26 relating to movement documents in the
                                            possession of the train crew. Only the most relevant section should
                                            be cited. In most cases, the unit of violation is the shipment,
                                            although where a unified consist is used to give notice to the crew,
                                            there is some justification for making it the train, especially
                                            where the discrepancy was generated using automated data processing
                                            and the error is repetitious.

                                            hazardous material packages be loaded and securely blocked and
                                            braced to prevent the packages from changing position, falling or
                                            sliding into each other. If the load is tight and secure, pieces of
                                            lumber or other material may not be necessary to achieve the ``tight
                                            load'' requirement.

    174.59...............................  Other specific placarding and marking sections may also be
                                            applicable.
                                           Marking and placarding. A railroad's placarding duties are to not
                                            accept a car without placards [Sec.  172.508(b)], and to not
                                            transport a car without placards [Sec.  174.59]. At each inspection
                                            point, a railroad must determine that all placards are in place.
                                            [Sec.  174.9]. The ``next inspection point'' replacement
                                            requirement in this section refers to placards that disappear
                                            between inspection points. A car at an inspection point must be
                                            placarded because it is ``in transportation'' [49 U.S.C. 5102(12)],
                                            even if held up at that point. Because the statute creates civil
                                            penalty liability only if a violation is ``knowing,'' that is, ``a
                                            reasonable person knew or should have known that an act performed by
                                            him was in violation of the HMR,'' and because railroads are not
                                            under a duty to inspect hazardous material cars merely standing in a
                                            yard, violations written for unplacarded cars in yards must include
                                            proof that the railroad knew about the unplacarded cars and took no
                                            corrective action within a reasonable time. (Note also that the real
                                            problem with unplacarded cars in a railyard may be a lack of
                                            emergency response information, Sec. Sec.  172.600-172.604, and
                                            investigation may reveal that those sections should be cited instead
                                            of this one.)

                                            one of them more correctly states the violation. Note that marking

179.7....................................  Section 179.7 requires that each tank car facility have a quality
                                            assurance (QA) program that encompasses at least the elements in
                                            Sec.  179.7(b). A tank car facility is an entity that manufactures,
                                            repairs, inspects, tests, qualifies, or maintains a tank car to
                                            ensure that the tank car conforms to parts 179 and 180, or alters
                                            the certificate of construction of the car. As a rule, a facility
                                            ``qualifies'' a tank by ``inspecting'' it and then ``representing''
                                            it as meeting the standard. In addition to the following penalty
                                            amounts, the agency may ``recall'' all tanks qualified by the tank
                                            car facility during the period the facility failed to comply with
                                            the quality assurance requirements. See, for example, Sec.
                                            180.509(b)(4).

  Sec. Appendix C to Part 209--FRA's Policy Statement Concerning Small 

                                Entities

    This policy statement required by the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121) (SBREFA) explains 
FRA's communication and enforcement policies concerning small entities 
subject to the federal railroad safety laws. These policies have been 
developed to take into account the unique concerns and operations of 
small businesses in the administration of the national railroad safety 
program, and will continue to evolve to meet the needs of the railroad 
industry. For purposes of this policy statement, the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.), and the ``excessive demand'' 
provisions of the Equal Justice Act (5 U.S.C. 504 (a)(4), and 28 U.S.C. 
2412 (d)(1)(D)), Class III railroads, contractors and hazardous 
materials shippers meeting the economic criteria established for Class 
III railroads in 49 CFR 1201.1-1, and commuter railroads or small 
governmental jurisdictions that serve populations of 50,000 or less 
constitute the class of organizations considered ``small entities'' or 
``small businesses.''
    FRA understands that small entities in the railroad industry have 
significantly different characteristics than larger carriers and 
shippers. FRA believes that these differences necessitate careful 
consideration in order to ensure that those entities receive appropriate 
treatment on compliance and enforcement matters, and enhance the safety 
of railroad operations. Therefore, FRA has developed programs to respond 
to compliance-related inquiries of small entities, and to ensure proper 
handling of civil penalty and other enforcement actions against small 
businesses.

                    Small Entity Communication Policy

    It is FRA's policy that all agency personnel respond in a timely and 
comprehensive fashion to the inquiries of small entities concerning rail 
safety statutes, safety regulations, and interpretations of these 
statutes and regulations. Also, FRA personnel provide guidance to small 
entities, as needed, in applying the law to specific facts and 
situations that arise in the course of railroad operations. These agency 
communications take many forms, and are tailored to meet the needs of 
the requesting party.
    FRA inspectors provide training on the requirements of all railroad 
safety statutes and regulations for new and existing small businesses 
upon request. Also, FRA inspectors often provide impromptu training 
sessions in the normal course of their inspection duties. FRA believes 
that this sort of preventive, rather than punitive, communication 
greatly enhances railroad safety. FRA's Office of Safety and Office of 
Chief Counsel regularly provide oral and written responses to questions 
raised by small entities concerning the plain meaning of the railroad 
safety standards, statutory requirements, and interpretations of the 
law. As required by the SBREFA, when FRA issues a final rule that has a 
significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, FRA will 
also issue a compliance guide for small entities concerning that rule.
    It is FRA's policy to maintain frequent and open communications with 
the national representatives of the primary small entity associations 
and to consult with these organizations before embarking on new policies 
that may impact the interests of small businesses. In some regions of 
the country where the concentration of small entities is particularly 
high, FRA Regional Administrators have established programs in which all 
small entities in the region meet with FRA regional specialists on a 
regular basis to discuss new regulations, persistent safety concerns, 
emerging technology, and compliance issues. Also, FRA regional offices 
hold periodic conferences, in which specific blocks of time are set 
aside to meet with small businesses and hear their concerns.
    In addition to these communication practices, FRA has instituted an 
innovative partnership program that expands the extent to which small 
entities participate in the development of policy and process. The 
Railroad Safety Advisory Committee (RSAC) has been established to advise 
the agency on the development and revision of railroad safety standards. 
The committee consists of a wide range of industry representatives, 
including organizations that represent the interests of

[[Page 67]]

small business. The small entity representative groups that sit on the 
RSAC may appoint members of their choice to participate in the 
development of new safety standards. This reflects FRA's policy that 
small business interests must be heard and considered in the development 
of new standards to ensure that FRA does not impose unnecessary economic 
burdens on small businesses, and to create more effective standards. 
Finally, FRA's Web site (http://www.fra.dot.gov) makes pertinent agency 
information available instantly to the public.
    FRA's longstanding policy of open communication with small entities 
is apparent in these practices. FRA will make every effort to develop 
new and equally responsive communication procedures as is warranted by 
new developments in the railroad industry.

                     Small Entity Enforcement Policy

    FRA has adopted an enforcement policy that addresses the unique 
nature of small entities in the imposition of civil penalties and 
resolution of those assessments. Pursuant to FRA's statutory authority, 
and as described in Appendix A to 49 CFR part 209, it is FRA's policy to 
consider a variety of factors in determining whether to take enforcement 
action against persons, including small entities, who have violated the 
safety laws and regulations. In addition to the seriousness of the 
violation and the person's history of compliance, FRA inspectors 
consider ``such other factors as the immediate circumstances make 
relevant.'' In the context of violations by small entities, those 
factors include whether the violations were made in good faith (e.g., 
based on an honest misunderstanding of the law), and whether the small 
entity has moved quickly and thoroughly to remedy the violation(s). In 
general, the presence of both good faith and prompt remedial action 
militates against taking a civil penalty action, especially if the 
violations are isolated events. On the other hand, violations involving 
willful actions and/or posing serious health, safety, or environmental 
threats should ordinarily result in enforcement actions, regardless of 
the entity's size.
    Once FRA has assessed a civil penalty, it is authorized to adjust or 
compromise the initial penalty claims based on a wide variety of 
mitigating factors, unless FRA must terminate the claim for some reason. 
FRA has the discretion to reduce the penalty as it deems fit, but not 
below the statutory minimums. The mitigating criteria FRA evaluates are 
found in the railroad safety statutes and SBREFA: The severity of the 
safety or health risk presented; the existence of alternative methods of 
eliminating the safety hazard; the entity's culpability; the entity's 
compliance history; the entity's ability to pay the assessment; the 
impacts an assessment might exact on the entity's continued business; 
and evidence that the entity acted in good faith. FRA staff attorneys 
regularly invite small entities to present any information related to 
these factors, and reduce civil penalty assessments based on the value 
and integrity of the information presented. Staff attorneys conduct 
conference calls or meet with small entities to discuss pending 
violations, and explain FRA's view on the merits of any defenses or 
mitigating factors presented that may have resulted or failed to result 
in penalty reductions. Among the ``other factors'' FRA considers at this 
stage is the promptness and thoroughness of the entity's remedial action 
to correct the violations and prevent a recurrence. Small entities 
should be sure to address these factors in communications with FRA 
concerning civil penalty cases. Long-term solutions to compliance 
problems will be given great weight in FRA's determinations of a final 
settlement offer.
    Finally, under FRA's Safety Assurance and Compliance Program (SACP), 
FRA identifies systemic safety hazards that continue to occur in a 
carrier or shipper operation, and in cooperation with the subject 
business, develops an improvement plan to eliminate those safety 
concerns. Often, the plan provides small entities with a reasonable time 
frame in which to make improvements without the threat of civil penalty. 
If FRA determines that the entity has failed to comply with the 
improvement plan, however, enforcement action is initiated.
    FRA's small entity enforcement policy is flexible and comprehensive. 
FRA's first priority in its compliance and enforcement activities is 
public and employee safety. However, FRA is committed to obtaining 
compliance and enhancing safety with reasoned, fair methods that do not 
inflict undue hardship on small entities.

operations covered by the Standards.


<R05>
Sec. 210.23  Authorization.

    (a) An inspector is authorized to perform any noise test prescribed 
in the Standards and in the procedures of this part at any time, at any 
appropriate location, and without prior notice to the railroad, for the 
purpose of determining whether railroad equipment is in compliance with 
the Standards.
    (b)(1) An inspector is authorized to request that railroad equipment 
and appropriate railroad personnel be made available for a passby or 
stationary noise emission test, as prescribed in the Standards and in 
the procedures of this part, and to conduct such test, at a reasonable 
time and location, for the purpose of determining whether the railroad 
equipment is in compliance with the Standards.
    (2) If the railroad has the capability to perform an appropriate 
noise emission test, as prescribed in the Standards and in the 
procedures of this part, an inspector is authorized to request that the 
railroad test railroad equipment. The railroad shall perform the 
appropriate test as soon as practicable.
    (3) The request referred to in this paragraph will be in writing, 
will state the grounds upon which the inspector has reason to believe 
that the railroad equipment does not conform to the Standards, and will 
be presented to an appropriate operating official of the railroad.
    (4) Testing or submission for testing is not required if the cause 
of the noise defect is readily apparent and the inspector verifies that 
it is corrected by the replacement of defective components or by 
instituting a normal maintenance or repair procedure.
    (c)(1) An inspector is authorized to inspect or examine a 
locomotive, rail car, or consist of a locomotive and rail

[[Page 70]]

cars operated by a railroad, or to request that the railroad inspect or 
examine the locomotive, rail car, or consist of a locomotive and rail 
cars, whenever the inspector has reason to believe that it does not 
conform to the requirements of the Standards.
    (2) An inspector may request that a railroad conduct an inspection 
or examination of a locomotive, rail car, or consist of a locomotive and 
rail cars on the basis of an excessive noise emission level measured by 
a passby test. If, after such inspection or examination, no mechanical 
condition that would result in a noise defect can be found and the 
inspector verifies that no such mechanical condition exists, the 
locomotive, rail car, or consist of a locomotive and rail cars may be 
continued in service.
    (3) The requests referred to in this paragraph will be in writing, 
will state the grounds upon which the inspector has reason to believe 
that the locomotive, rail car, or consist of a locomotive and rail cars 
does not conform to the Standards, and will be presented to an 
appropriate operating official of the railroad.
    (4) The inspection or examination referred to in this paragraph may 
be conducted only at recognized inspection points or scheduled stopping 
points.

during continual use, and immediately following a measurement indicating 
a violation.
    (ii) The sound level measurement system shall be checked not less 
than once each year by its manufacturer, a representative of its 
manufacturer, or a person of equivalent special competence to verify 
that its accuracy meets the manufacturer's design criteria.
    (2) An acoustical calibrator of the microphone coupler type designed 
for the sound level measurement system in use shall be used to calibrate 
the sound level measurement system in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section. The calibration must meet or exceed the 
accuracy requirements specified in section 5.4.1 of the American 
National Standard Institute Standards, ``Method for Measurement of Sound 
Pressure Levels,'' (ANSI S1.13-1971) for field method measurements.
    (c) Acoustical environment, weather conditions, and background noise 
requirements are prescribed in Sec. 201.23 of the Standards. In 
addition, a measurement tolerance of 2 dB(A) for a given measurement 
will be allowed to take into account the effects of the factors listed 
below and the interpretations of these effects by enforcement personnel:
    (1) The common practice of reporting field sound level measurements 
to the nearest whole decibel;
    (2) Variations resulting from commercial instrument tolerances;
    (3) Variations resulting from the topography of the noise 
measurement site;

   Sec. Appendix B to Part 210--Switcher Locomotive Enforcement Policy

    The EPA standards require that the noise emissions from all switcher 
locomotives in a particular facility be less than prescribed levels 
measured at 30 meters, under all operating modes. This requirement is 
deemed to be met unless ``receiving property'' noise due to switcher 
locomotives exceeds 65 dB(A), when measured in accordance with subpart C 
of 40 CFR part 201. The 65 dB(A) receiving property standard is the 
``trigger'' for requiring the 30-meter test of switcher locomotives.
    The purpose underlying FRA's enforcement of the noise standards is 
to reduce the impact of rail operations noise on receiving properties. 
In some instances, measures other than the 30-meter test approach may 
more effectively reduce the noise levels at receiving properties; 
therefore, FRA enforcement efforts will focus on abatement procedures 
that will achieve a reduction of receiving property noise levels to less 
than 65 dB(A).
    For example, a parked, idling locomotive, even if equipped with 
exhaust silencing that meets the stationary locomotive standard (30-
meter test), may cause the receiving property standard to be exceeded if 
located on trackage adjacent to the receiving property. In that case, 
application of the 30-meter test to other switcher locomotives at the 
facility may not serve to reduce the receiving property noise level. On 
the other hand, operational changes by the railroad could significantly 
reduce receiving property noise levels. In such case, FRA would consider 
retesting after abatement measures have been taken. If the receiving 
property noise level is below the trigger and the abatement action is 
adopted, FRA would not make a 30-meter test of the switcher locomotives 
at the facility.

<R04>
                     Subpart B_Rulemaking Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 211.11  Processing of petitions for rulemaking.

    (a) General. Each petition for rulemaking filed as prescribed in 
Sec. Sec. 211.7 and 211.9 is referred to the head of the office 
responsible for the subject matter of the petition to review and 
recommend appropriate action to the Administrator. No public hearing or 
oral argument is held before the Administrator decides whether the 
petition should be granted. However, a notice may be published in the 
Federal Register inviting written comments concerning the petition. Each 
petition shall be granted or denied not later than six months after its 
receipt by the Docket Clerk.
    (b) Grants. If the Administrator determines that a rulemaking 
petition complies with the requirements of Sec. 211.9 and that 
rulemaking is justified, he initiates a rulemaking proceeding by 
publishing an advance notice or notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
Federal Register.
    (c) Denials. If the Administrator determines that a rulemaking 
petition does not comply with the requirements of Sec. 211.9 or that 
rulemaking is not justified, he denies the petition. If the petition 
pertains to railroad safety, the Administrator may also initiate an 
informal safety inquiry under Sec. 211.61.
    (d) Notification; closing of docket. Whenever the Administrator 
grants or denies a rulemaking petition, a notice of the grant or denial 
is mailed to the petitioner. If the petition is denied, the proceeding 
is terminated and the docket for that petition is closed.


<R05>
Sec. 211.13  Initiation and completion of rulemaking proceedings.

    The Administrator initiates all rulemaking proceedings on his own 
motion by publishing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking or a 
notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register. However, he may 
consider the recommendations of interested persons or other agencies of 
the United States. A separate docket is established and maintained for 
each rulemaking proceeding. Each rulemaking proceeding shall be 
completed not later than 12 months after the initial notice in that 
proceeding is published in the Federal Register. However, if it was 
initiated as the result of the granting of a rulemaking petition, the 
rulemaking proceeding shall be completed not later than 12 months after 
the petition was filed as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 211.7 and 211.9.


<R05>
Sec. 211.15  Notice and participation.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, or when the 
Administrator finds for good cause that notice is impractical, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest (and incorporates the 
findings and a brief statement of the reasons therefore in the rules 
issued), an advance notice or notice of proposed rulemaking is published 
in the Federal Register and interested persons are invited to 
participate in the rulemaking proceedings with respect to each 
substantive rule.
    (b) Unless the Administrator determines that notice and public 
rulemaking proceedings are necessary or desirable, interpretive rules, 
general statements of policy, and rules relating to organization, 
procedure, or practice, including those relating to agency management or 
personnel, are prescribed as final without notice or other public 
rulemaking proceedings.
    (c) An advance notice or notice of proposed rulemaking is issued and 
interested persons are invited to participate in rulemaking proceedings 
with respect only to those procedural and substantive rules of general 
applicability relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or 
contracts which the Administrator has determined to be of substantial 
public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 211.17  Publication and contents of notices.

    Each advance notice or notice of proposed rulemaking is published in 
the Federal Register and includes--
    (a) A statement of the time, place and nature of the proposed 
rulemaking proceeding;
    (b) A reference to the authority under which it is issued;
    (c) A description of the subjects or issues involved or the 
substance or terms of the proposed rule;

[[Page 77]]

    (d) A statement of the time within which written comments must be 
submitted and the required number of copies; and
    (e) A statement of how and to what extent interested persons may 
participate in the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 211.19  Petitions for extensions of time to comment.

    (a) Any person may petition the Administrator for an extension of 
time to submit comments in response to an advance notice or notice of 
proposed rulemaking. The petition must be received by the FRA Docket 
Clerk not later than 10 days before expiration of the time stated in the 
notice and must contain reference to the FRA docket number for the 
proceeding involved. The filing of the petition does not automatically 
extend the time for petitioner's comments.
    (b) The Administrator grants the petition only if the petitioner 
shows a substantive interest in the proposed rule and good cause for the 
extension, and if time permits and the extension is in the public 
interest. Extensions will not be granted unless time permits and will 
not exceed one month. If an extension is granted, it is granted as to 
all persons and a notice of the extension is published in the Federal 
Register.

[41 FR 54181, Dec. 13, 1976, as amended at 64 FR 70195, Dec. 16, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 211.21  Consideration of comments received.

    All timely comments are considered before final action is taken on a 
rulemaking proposal. Late-filed comments will be considered so far as 
possible without incurring additional expense or delay.


<R05>
Sec. 211.23  Additional public proceedings.

    The Administrator may conduct other public proceedings that he finds 
necessary or desirable. For example, he may invite interested persons to 
present oral arguments, participate in conferences, or appear at 
informal hearings.


<R05>
Sec. 211.25  Hearings.

    (a) A hearing will be held if required by statute or the 
Administrator finds it necessary or desirable.
    (b) Except for statutory hearings required to be on the record--
    (1) Hearings are fact-finding proceedings, and there are no formal 
pleadings or adverse parties;
    (2) Any rule issued in a proceeding in which a hearing is held is 
not based exclusively on the record of the hearing; and
    (3) Hearings are conducted in accordance with section 553 of title 
5, U.S.C.; section 556 and 557 of title 5 do not apply to hearings held 
under this part.
    (c) The Administrator conducts or designates a representative to 
conduct any hearing held under this part. The Chief Counsel serves or 
designates a member of his staff to serve as legal officer at the 
hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 211.27  Publication of adopted rules and withdrawal of notices.

    Whenever the Administrator adopts a final rule or withdraws an 
advance notice or notice of proposed rulemaking, the final rule or a 
notice of withdrawal is published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 211.29  Petitions for reconsideration of a final rule.

    (a) Any person may petition the Administrator for reconsideration of 
any rule issued under this part. Except for good cause shown, such a 
petition must be submitted not later than 60 days after publication of 
the rule in the Federal Register, or 10 days prior to the effective date 
of the rule, whichever is the earlier. The petition must contain a brief 
statement of the complaint and an explanation as to why compliance with 
the rule is not possible, is not practicable, is unreasonable, or is not 
in the public interest.
    (b) If the petitioner requests consideration of additional facts, he 
must state the reason they were not presented to the Administrator 
within the allotted time.
    (c) The Administrator does not consider repetitious petitions.
    (d) Unless the Administrator specifically provides otherwise, and 
publishes notice thereof in the Federal Register, the filing of a 
petition under

[[Page 78]]

this section does not stay the effectiveness of a rule.

[41 FR 54181, Dec. 13, 1976, as amended at 42 FR 27593, May 31, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 211.31  Proceedings on petitions for reconsideration of a final rule.

    (a) The Administrator may grant or deny, in whole or in part, any 
petition for reconsideration of a final rule without further 
proceedings. Each petition shall be decided not later than 4 months 
after its receipt by the Docket Clerk. In the event he determines to 
reconsider a rule, the Administrator may amend the rule or initiate a 
new rulemaking proceeding. An appropriate notice is published in the 
Federal Register.
    (b) Whenever the Administrator determines that a petition should be 
granted or denied, a notice of the grant or denial of a petition for 
reconsideration is sent to the petitioner. When a petition is granted, a 
notice is published in the Federal Register.
    (c) The Administrator may consolidate petitions relating to the same 
rule.


<R05>
Sec. 211.33  Direct final rulemaking procedures.

    (a) Rules that the Administrator judges to be noncontroversial and 
unlikely to result in adverse public comment may be published in the 
final rule section of the Federal Register as direct final rules. These 
include noncontroversial rules that:
    (1) Affect internal procedures of the Federal Railroad 
Administration, such as filing requirements and rules governing 
inspection and copying of documents,
    (2) Are nonsubstantive clarifications or corrections to existing 
rules,
    (3) Update existing forms, and
    (4) Make minor changes in the substantive rules regarding statistics 
and reporting requirements.
    (b) The Federal Register document will state that any adverse 
comment or notice of intent to submit adverse comment must be received 
in writing by the Federal Railroad Administration within the specified 
time after the date of publication and that, if no written adverse 
comment or request for oral hearing (if such opportunity is required by 
statute) is received, the rule will become effective a specified number 
of days after the date of publication.
    (c) If no adverse comment or request for oral hearing is received by 
the Federal Railroad Administration within the specified time of 
publication in the Federal Register, the Federal Railroad Administration 
will publish a notice in the Federal Register indicating that no adverse 
comment was received and confirming that the rule will become effective 
on the date that was indicated in the direct final rule.
    (d) If the Federal Railroad Administration receives any written 
adverse comment or request for oral hearing within the specified time of 
publication in the Federal Register, a notice withdrawing the direct 
final rule will be published in the final rule section of the Federal 
Register and, if the Federal Railroad Administration decides a 
rulemaking is warranted, a notice of proposed rulemaking will be 
published in the proposed rule section of the Federal Register.
    (e) An ``adverse'' comment for the purpose of this subpart means any 
comment that the Federal Railroad Administration determines is critical 
of the rule, suggests that the rule should not be adopted, or suggests a 
change that should be made in the rule.

                            Subpart C_Waivers


<R05>
Sec. 211.41  Processing of petitions for waiver of safety rules.

    (a) General. Each petition for a permanent or temporary waiver of a 
safety rule, regulation or standard filed as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 
211.7 and 211.9, is referred to the Railroad Safety Board for decision 
and decided not later than 9 months after receipt.
    (b) Notice and hearing. If required by statute or the Administrator 
or the Railroad Safety Board deems it desirable, a notice is published 
in the Federal Register, an opportunity for public comment is provided, 
and a hearing is held in accordance with Sec. 211.25, before the 
petition is granted or denied.
    (c) Grants. If the Railroad Safety Board determines that the 
petition complies with the requirements of Sec. 211.9 and that a waiver 
is justified, it

[[Page 79]]

grants the petition. Conditions may be imposed on the grant of waiver if 
the Board concludes they are necessary to assure safety or are in the 
public interest.
    (d) Denials. If the Railroad Safety Board determines that the 
petition does not comply with the requirements of Sec. 211.9 or that a 
waiver is not justified, it denies the petition.
    (e) Notification. Whenever the Railroad Safety Board grants or 
denies a petition, a notice of that grant or denial is sent to the 
petitioner. When a petition has been decided, interested persons are 
also notified or a notice is published in the Federal Register.
    (f) Petition for reconsideration. Any person may petition for 
reconsideration of the grant or denial of a waiver under procedures set 
forth in Sec. 211.57. Each petition shall be processed in accordance 
with Sec. 211.59.


<R05>
Sec. 211.43  Processing of other waiver petitions.

    (a) General. Except as provided in Sec. 211.41, each petition for a 
permanent or temporary waiver of a rule, regulation or standard shall be

opportunity for public comment is provided, and a hearing is held in 
accordance with Sec. 211.25, before the petition is granted or denied.
    (c) Grants. If the Administrator determines that the petition 
complies with the requirements of Sec. 211.9 and that a waiver is 
justified, he grants the waiver. Conditions may be imposed on the grant 
of waiver if the Administrator concludes they are necessary to achieve 
the purposes of programs affected by the grant of waiver or are 
otherwise in the public interest.
    (d) Denials. If the Administrator determines that the petition does 
not comply with the requirements of Sec. 211.9 or that a waiver is not 
justified, he denies the waiver.
    (e) Notification. Whenever the Administrator grants or denies a 
petition, a notice of the grant or denial is sent to the petitioner. 
When a petition has been decided, interested persons are also notified 
or a notice is published in the Federal Register.

reconsideration of the grant or denial of a waiver under procedures set 
forth in Sec. 211.57. Each petition shall be processed in accordance 
with Sec. 211.59.


<R05>
Sec. 211.45  Petitions for emergency waiver of safety rules.

    (a) General. This section applies only to petitions for waiver of a 
safety rule, regulation, or standard that FRA determines are directly 
related to the occurrence of, or imminent threat of, an emergency event. 
For purposes of this section an emergency event could be local, 
regional, or national in scope and includes a natural or manmade 
disaster, such as a hurricane, flood, earthquake, mudslide, forest fire, 
significant snowstorm, terrorist act, biological outbreak, release of a 
dangerous radiological, chemical, or biological material, war-related 
activity, or other similar event.
    (b) Emergency Relief Docket. Each calendar year FRA creates an 
Emergency Relief Docket (ERD) in the publicly accessible DOT Document 
Management System (DMS). The DMS can be accessed 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week, via the Internet at the docket facility's Web site at 
http://dms.dot.gov. All documents in the DMS are available for 
inspection and copying on the Web site or are available for examination 
at the DOT Docket Management Facility, Room PL-401 (Plaza Level), 400 
7th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 during regular business hours (9 
a.m.-5 p.m.). By January 31st of each year, FRA publishes a notice in 
the Federal Register identifying by docket number the ERD for that year. 
A notice will also be published in the previous year's ERD identifying 
the new docket number.
    (c) Determining the existence of an emergency event. If the 
Administrator determines that an emergency event identified in paragraph 
(a) of this section has occurred, or that an imminent threat of it 
occurring exists, and determines that public safety or recovery efforts 
require that the provisions of this

[[Page 80]]

section be implemented, the Administrator will activate the Emergency 
Relief Docket identified in paragraph (d) of this section. In 
determining whether an emergency exists, the Administrator may consider 
declarations of emergency made by local, State, or Federal officials, 
and determinations by the Federal government that a credible threat of a 
terrorist attack exists.
    (d) Additional notification. When possible, FRA will post the FRA 
Administrator's determination described in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section on its website at http://www.fra.dot.gov. FRA will also publish 
a notice in the Federal Register alerting interested parties of the FRA 
Administrator's determination as soon as practicable.
    (e) Content of petitions for emergency waivers. Petitions submitted 
to FRA pursuant to this section should specifically address how the 
petition is related to the emergency, and to the extent practicable, 
contain the information required under Sec. 211.9(a) and (b). The 
petition should at a minimum describe the following: how the petitioner 
or public is affected by the emergency (including the impact on railroad 
operations); what FRA regulations are implicated by the emergency (e.g. 
movement of defective equipment); how waiver of the implicated 
regulations would benefit petitioner during the emergency; and how long 
the petitioner expects to be affected by the emergency.
    (f) Filing requirements. Petitions filed under this section, shall 
be submitted using any of the following methods:
    (1) Direct e-mail to FRA at: RRS.Correspondence@fra.dot.gov;
    (2) Direct fax to FRA at: 202-493-6309; or
    (3) To FRA Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, RCC-10, Mail Stop 
10, 1120 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20590, fax no. (202) 493-
6068.
    (g) FRA Handling and Initial Review. Upon receipt and initial review 
of a petition for waiver, to verify that it meets the criteria for use 
of these emergency procedures, FRA will add the petition to the ERD. The 
DMS numbers each document that is added to a docket. (For example, the 
first document submitted to the docket in 2006 will be identified as 
FRA-2006-XXX-1.) Thus, each petition submitted to the ERD will have a 
unique document number which should be identified on all communications 
related to petitions contained in this docket. If FRA determines that 
the petition does not meet the criteria for use of these emergency 
procedures, FRA will notify the petitioner and will process the petition 
under normal waiver procedures of this subpart.
    (h) Comments. Comments should be submitted within 72 hours from the 
close of business on the day that the petition is entered into and 
available on the DMS. Any comment received after that period will be 
considered to the extent practicable. All comments should identify the 
appropriate ERD and should identify the specific document number of the 
petition designated by the DMS in the ERD. Interested parties commenting 
on a petition under this section should also include in their comments 
to the ERD telephone numbers at which their representatives may be 
reached. Interested parties may submit their comments using any of the 
following methods:
    (1) Direct e-mail to FRA at: RRS.Correspondence@fra.dot.gov.
    (2) Direct fax to FRA at: 202-493-6309.
    (3) Submission of comments to the Docket Clerk, DOT Docket 
Management Facility, Room PL-401 (Plaza Level), 400 7th Street, SW., 
Washington, DC 20590 or electronically via the internet at http://
dms.dot.gov. Any comments or information sent directly to FRA will be 
immediately provided to the DOT DMS for inclusion in the ERD.
    (i) Request for hearing. Parties desiring a public hearing on any 
petition being processed under this section must notify FRA through the 
comment process identified in paragraph (h) of this section within 72 
hours from the close of business on the day that the petition is entered 
into and available on the DMS. In response to a request for a public 
hearing, FRA will arrange a telephone conference between all interested 
parties to provide an opportunity for oral comment. The conference will 
be arranged as soon as practicable. After such conference, if a party 
stills desires a public hearing on

[[Page 81]]

the petition, then a public hearing will be arranged as soon as 
practicable pursuant to the provisions contained in 49 CFR part 211.
    (j) Decisions. FRA may grant a petition for waiver prior to 
conducting a public hearing if such action is in the public interest and 
consistent with safety or in situations where a hearing request is 
received subsequent to the 72-hour comment period. In such an instance, 
FRA will notify the party requesting the public hearing of its decision 
and will arrange to conduct such hearing as soon as practicable.
    (1) FRA reserves the right to reopen any docket and reconsider any 
decision made pursuant to these emergency procedures based upon its own 
initiative or based upon information or comments received subsequent to 
the 72-hour comment period or at a later scheduled public hearing.
    (2) FRA decision letters, either granting or denying a petition, 
will be posted in the appropriate ERD and will reference the document 
number of the petition to which it relates.
    (3) Relief granted shall not extend for more than nine months.
    (4) For matters that may significantly impact the missions of the 
Department of Homeland Security, FRA consults with the Department of 
Homeland Security as soon as practicable.

    (a) Pursuant to the Department of Transportation Act (80 Stat. 931, 
49 U.S.C. 1651 et seq.), the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (84 
Stat. 971, 45 U.S.C. 421, 431-441), or both, the Administrator may 
temporarily suspend compliance with a substantive rule of the Federal 
Railroad Administration, if:
    (1) The suspension is necessary to the conduct of a Federal Railroad 
Administration approved test program designed to evaluate the 
effectiveness of new technology or operational approaches or instituted 
in furtherance of a present or proposed rulemaking proceeding;
    (2) The suspension is limited in scope and application to such 
relief as may be necessary to facilitate the conduct of the test

<R05>
   Sec. Appendix A to Part 211--Statement of Agency Policy Concerning 

Waivers Related to Shared Use of Trackage or Rights-of-Way by Light Rail 

                       and Conventional Operations

    1. By statute, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) may grant a 
waiver of any rule or order if the waiver ``is in the public interest 
and consistent with railroad safety.'' 49 U.S.C. 20103(d). Waiver 
petitions are reviewed by FRA's Railroad Safety Board (the ``Safety 
Board'') under the provisions of 49 CFR part 211. Waiver petitions must 
contain the information required by 49 CFR 211.9. The Safety Board can, 
in granting a waiver, impose any conditions it concludes are necessary 
to assure safety or are in the public interest. If the conditions under 
which the waiver was granted change substantially, or unanticipated 
safety issues arise, FRA may modify or withdraw a waiver in order to 
ensure safety.
    2. Light rail equipment, commonly referred to as trolleys or street 
railways, is not designed to be used in situations where there is a 
reasonable likelihood of a collision with much heavier and stronger 
conventional rail equipment. However, existing conventional railroad 
tracks and rights-of-way provide attractive opportunities for expansion 
of light rail service.
    3. Light rail operators who intend to share use of the general 
railroad system trackage with conventional equipment and/or whose 
operations constitute commuter service (see Appendix A of 49 CFR part 
209 for relevant definitions) will either have to comply with FRA's 
safety rules or obtain a waiver of appropriate rules. Light rail 
operators whose operations meet the definition of urban rapid transit 
and who will share a right-of-way or corridor with a conventional 
railroad but will not share trackage with that railroad will be subject 
to only those rules that pertain to any significant point of connection 
to the general system, such as a rail crossing at grade, a shared method 
of train control, or shared highway-rail grade crossings.
    4. Shared use of track refers to situations where light rail transit 
operators conduct their operations over the lines of the general system, 
and includes light rail operations

[[Page 84]]

that are wholly separated in time (temporally separated) from 
conventional operations as well as light rail operations operating on 
the same trackage at the same time as conventional rail equipment 
(simultaneous joint use). Where shared use of general system trackage is 
contemplated, FRA believes a comprehensive waiver request covering all 
rules for which a waiver is sought makes the most sense. FRA suggests 
that a petitioner caption such a waiver petition as a Petition for 
Approval of Shared Use so as to distinguish it from other types of 
waiver petitions. The light rail operator should file the petition. All 
other affected railroads will be able to participate in the waiver 
proceedings by commenting on the petition and providing testimony at a 
hearing on the petition if anyone requests such a hearing. If any other 
railroad will be affected by the proposed operation in such a way as to 
necessitate a waiver of any FRA rule, that railroad may either join with 
the light rail operator in filing the comprehensive petition or file its 
own petition.
    5. In situations where the light rail operator is an urban rapid 
transit system that will share a right-of-way or corridor with the 
conventional railroad but not share trackage, any waiver petition should 
cover only the rules that may apply at any significant points of 
connection between the rapid transit line and the other railroad. A 
Petition for Approval of Shared Use would not be appropriate in such a 
case.

              I. Preliminary Jurisdictional Determinations

    Where a light rail operator is uncertain whether the planned 
operation will be subject to FRA's safety jurisdiction and, if so, to 
what extent, the operator may wish to obtain FRA's views on the 
jurisdictional issues before filing a waiver petition. In that case, the 
light rail operator (here including a transit authority that may not 
plan to actually operate the system itself) should write to FRA 
requesting such a determination. The letter should be addressed to Chief 
Counsel, Federal Railroad Administration, 1120 Vermont Ave., NW., Mail 
Stop 10, Washington, DC 20590, with a copy to the Associate 
Administrator for Safety at the same address at Mail Stop 25. The letter 
should address the criteria (found in 49 CFR part 209, appendix A) FRA 
uses to determine whether it has jurisdiction over a rail operation and 
to distinguish commuter from urban rapid transit service. A complete 
description of the nature of the contemplated operation is essential to 
an accurate determination. FRA will attempt to respond promptly to such 
a request. Of course, FRA's response will be based only on the facts as 
presented by the light rail operator. If FRA subsequently learns that 
the facts are different from those presented or have changed 
substantially, FRA may revise its initial determination.

 II. General Factors To Address in a Petition for Approval of Shared Use

    1. Like all waiver petitions, a Petition for Approval of Shared Use 
will be reviewed by the Safety Board. A non-voting FTA liaison to the 
Safety Board will participate in an advisory capacity in the Safety 
Board's consideration of all such petitions. This close cooperation 
between the two agencies will ensure that FRA benefits from the 
insights, particularly with regard to operational and financial issues, 
that FTA can provide about light rail operations, as well as from FTA's 
knowledge of and contacts with state safety oversight programs. This 
working relationship will also ensure that FTA has a fuller appreciation 
of the safety issues involved in each specific shared use operation and 
a voice in shaping the safety requirements that will apply to such 
operations.
    2. FRA resolves each waiver request on its own merits based on the 
information presented and the agency's own investigation of the issues. 
In general, the greater the safety risks inherent in a proposed 
operation the greater will be the mitigation measures required. While 
FRA cannot state in advance what kinds of waivers will be granted or 
denied, we can provide guidance to those who may likely be requesting 
waivers to help ensure that their petitions address factors that FRA 
will no doubt consider important.
    3. FRA's procedural rules give a general description of what any 
waiver petition should contain, including an explanation of the nature 
and extent of the relief sought; a description of the persons, 
equipment, installations, and locations to be covered by the waiver; an 
evaluation of expected costs and benefits; and relevant safety data. 49 
CFR 211.9. The procedural rules, of course, are not specifically 
tailored to situations involving light rail operations over the general 
system, where waiver petitions are likely to involve many of FRA's 
regulatory areas. In such situations, FRA suggests that a Petition for 
Approval of Shared Use address the following general factors.
    A. Description of operations. You should explain the frequency and 
speeds of all operations on the line and the nature of the different 
operations. You should explain the nature of any connections between the 
light rail and conventional operations.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq>If the light rail line will operate on any 
segments (e.g., a street railway portion) that will not be shared by a 
conventional railroad, describe those segments and their connection with 
the shared use segments. If the petitioner has not previously sought and 
received a determination from FRA concerning jurisdictional issues, 
explain, using the criteria set out in 49 CFR part 209, Appendix A,

[[Page 85]]

whether the light rail operation is, in the petitioner's view, a 
commuter operation or urban rapid transit.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq>You should describe precisely what the respective 
hours of operation will be for each type of equipment on the shared use 
segments. If light rail and conventional operations will occur only at 
different times of day, describe what means of protection will ensure 
that the different types of equipment are not operated simultaneously on 
the same track, and how protection will be provided to ensure that, 
where one set of operations begins and the other ends, there can be no 
overlap that would possibly result in a collision.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq>If the light rail and conventional operations will 
share trackage during the same time periods, the petitioners will face a 
steep burden of demonstrating that extraordinary safety measures will be 
taken to adequately reduce the likelihood of a collision between 
conventional and light rail equipment to the point where the safety 
risks associated with joint use would be acceptable. You should explain 
the nature of such simultaneous joint use, the system of train control, 
the frequency and proximity of both types of operations, the training 
and qualifications of all operating personnel in both types of 
operations, and all methods that would be used to prevent collisions. 
You should also include a quantitative risk assessment concerning the 
risk of collision between the light rail and conventional equipment 
under the proposed operating scenario.
    B. Description of equipment. (1) You should describe all equipment 
that will be used by the light rail and conventional operations. Where 
the light rail equipment does not meet the standards of 49 CFR part 238, 
you should provide specifics on the crash survivability of the light 
rail equipment, such as static end strength, sill height, strength of 
corner posts and collision posts, side strength, etc.
    (2) Given the structural incompatibility of light rail and 
conventional equipment, FRA has grave concerns about the prospect of 
operating these two types of equipment simultaneously on the same track. 
If the light rail and conventional operations will share trackage during 
the same time periods, you should provide an engineering analysis of the 
light rail equipment's resistance to damage in various types of 
collisions, including a worst case scenario involving a failure of the 
collision avoidance systems resulting in a collision between light rail 
and conventional equipment at track speeds.
    C. Alternative safety measures to be employed in place of each rule 
for which waiver is sought. The petition should specify exactly which 
rules the petitioner desires to be waived. For each rule, the petition 
should explain exactly how a level of safety at least equal to that 
afforded by the FRA rule will be provided by the alternative measures 
the petitioner proposes.
    (1) Most light rail operations that entail some shared use of the 
general system will also have segments that are not on the general 
system. FTA's rules on rail fixed guideway systems will probably apply 
to those other segments. If so, the petition for waiver of FRA's rules 
should explain how the system safety program plan adopted under FTA's 
rules may affect safety on the portions of the system where FRA's rules 
apply. Under certain circumstances, effective implementation of such a 
plan may provide FRA sufficient assurance that adequate measures are in 
place to warrant waiver of certain FRA rules.
    (2) In its petition, the light rail operator may want to certify 
that the subject matter addressed by the rule to be waived is addressed 
by the system safety plan and that the light rail operation will be 
monitored by the state safety oversight program. That is likely to 
expedite FRA's processing of the petition. FRA will analyze information 
submitted by the petitioner to demonstrate that a safety matter is 
addressed by the light rail operator's system safety plan. Alternately, 
conditional approval may be requested at an early stage in the project, 
and FRA would thereafter review the system safety program plan's status 
to determine readiness to commence operations. Where FRA grants a 
waiver, the state agency will oversee the area addressed by the waiver, 
but FRA will actively participate in partnership with FTA and the state 
agency to address any safety problems.
    D. Documentation of agreement with affected railroads. Conventional 
railroads that will share track with the light rail operation need not 
join as a co-petitioner in the light rail operator's petition. However, 
the petition should contain documentation of the precise terms of the 
agreement between the light rail operator and the conventional railroad 
concerning any actions that the conventional railroad must take to 
ensure effective implementation of alternative safety measures. For 
example, if temporal separation is planned, FRA expects to see the 
conventional railroad's written acceptance of its obligations to ensure 
that the separation is achieved. Moreover, if the arrangements for the 
light rail service will require the conventional railroad to employ any 
alternative safety measures rather than strictly comply with FRA's 
rules, that railroad will have to seek its own waiver (or join in the 
light rail operator's petition).

   III. Waiver Petitions Involving No Shared Use of Track and Limited 
       Connections Between Light Rail and Conventional Operations

    Even where there is no shared use of track, light rail operators may 
be subject to certain

[[Page 86]]

FRA rules based on limited, but significant connections to the general 
system.
    1. Rail crossings at grade. Where a light rail operation and a 
conventional railroad have a crossing at grade, several FRA rules may 
apply to the light rail operation at the point of connection. If 
movements at the crossing are governed by a signal system, FRA's signal 
rules (49 CFR parts 233, 235, and 236) apply, as do the signal 
provisions of the hours of service statute, 49 U.S.C. 21104. To the 
extent radio communication is used to direct the movements, the radio 
rules (part 220) apply. The track rules (part 213) cover any portion of 
the crossing that may affect the movement of the conventional railroad. 
Of course, if the conventional railroad has responsibility for 
compliance with certain of the rules that apply at that point (for 
example, where the conventional railroad maintains the track and signals 
and dispatches all trains), the light rail operator will not have 
compliance responsibility for those rules and would not need a waiver.
    2. Shared train control systems. Where a light rail operation is 
governed by the same train control system as a conventional railroad 
(e.g., at a moveable bridge that they both traverse), the light rail 
operator will be subject to applicable FRA rules (primarily the signal 
rules in parts 233, 235, and 236) if it has maintenance or operating 
responsibility for the system.
    3. Highway-Rail Grade Crossings. Light rail operations over highway-
rail grade crossings also used by conventional trains will be subject to 
FRA's rules on grade crossing signal system safety (part 234) and the 
requirement to have auxiliary lights on locomotives (49 CFR 229.125). 
Even if the conventional railroad maintains the crossing, the light rail 
operation will still be responsible for reporting and taking appropriate 
actions in response to warning system malfunctions.
    In any of these shared right-of-way situations involving significant 
connections, the light rail operator may petition for a waiver of any 
rules that apply to its activities.

   IV. Factors To Address Related to Specific Regulations and Statutes

    Operators of light rail systems are likely to apply for waivers of 
many FRA rules. FRA offers the following suggestions on factors 
petitioners may want to address concerning specific areas of regulation. 
(All ``part'' references are to title 49 CFR.) Parts 209 (Railroad 
Safety Enforcement Procedures), 211 (Rules of Practice), 212 (State 
Safety Participation), and 216 (Special Notice and Emergency Order 
Procedures) are largely procedural rules that are unlikely to be the 
subject of waivers, so those parts are not discussed further. For 
segments of a light rail line not involving operations over the general 
system, assuming the light rail operation meets the definition of 
``rapid transit,'' FRA's standards do not apply and the petition need 
not address those segments with regard to each specific rule from which 
waivers are sought with regard to shared use trackage.

                   1. Track, structures, and signals.

    A. Track safety standards (part 213). For general system track used 
by both the conventional and light rail lines, the track standards apply 
and a waiver is very unlikely. A light rail operation that owns track 
over which the conventional railroad operates may wish to consider 
assigning responsibility for that track to the other railroad. If so, 
the track owner must follow the procedure set forth in 49 CFR 213.5(c). 
Where such an assignment occurs, the owner and assignee are responsible 
for compliance.
    B. Signal systems reporting requirements (part 233). This part 
contains reporting requirements with respect to methods of train 
operation, block signal systems, interlockings, traffic control systems, 
automatic train stop, train control, and cab signal systems, or other 
similar appliances, methods, and systems. If a signal system failure 
occurs on general system track which is used by both conventional and 
light rail lines, and triggers the reporting requirements of this part, 
the light rail operator must file, or cooperate fully in the filing of, 
a signal system report. The petition should explain whether the light 
rail operator or conventional railroad is responsible for maintaining 
the signal system. Assuming that the light rail operator (or a 
contractor hired by this operator) has responsibility for maintaining 
the signal system, that entity is the logical choice to file each signal 
failure report, and a waiver is very unlikely. Moreover, since a signal 
failure first observed by a light rail operator can later have 
catastrophic consequences for a conventional railroad using the same 
track, a waiver would jeopardize rail safety on that general system 
trackage. Even if the conventional railroad is responsible for 
maintaining the signal systems, the light rail operator must still 
assist the railroad in reporting all signal failures by notifying the 
conventional railroad of such failures.
    C. Grade crossing signal system safety (part 234). This part 
contains minimum standards for the maintenance, inspection, and testing 
of highway-rail grade crossing warning systems, and also prescribes 
standards for the reporting of system failures and minimum actions that 
railroads must take when such warning systems malfunction. If a grade 
crossing accident or warning activation failure occurs during light rail 
operations on general system track that is used by both conventional and 
light rail lines, the light rail operator must submit, or cooperate with 
the other railroad to ensure the submission

[[Page 87]]

of, a report to FRA within the required time frame (24 hours for an 
accident report, or 15 days for a grade crossing signal system 
activation failure report). The petition should explain whether the 
light rail operator or conventional railroad is responsible for 
maintaining the grade crossing devices. Assuming that the light rail 
operator (or a contractor hired by this operator) has responsibility for 
maintaining the grade crossing devices, that entity is the logical 
choice to file each grade crossing signal failure report, and a waiver 
is very unlikely. Moreover, since a grade crossing warning device 
failure first observed by a light rail operator can later have 
catastrophic consequences for a conventional railroad using the same 
track, a waiver would jeopardize rail safety on that general system 
trackage. However, if the conventional railroad is responsible for 
maintaining the grade crossing devices, the light rail operator will 
still have to assist the railroad in reporting all grade crossing signal 
failures. Moreover, regardless of which railroad is responsible for 
maintenance of the grade crossing signals, any railroad (including a 
light rail operation) operating over a crossing that has experienced an 
activation failure, partial activation, or false activation must take 
the steps required by this rule to ensure safety at those locations. 
While the maintaining railroad will retain all of its responsibilities 
in such situations (such as contacting train crews and notifying law 
enforcement agencies), the operating railroad must observe requirements 
concerning flagging, train speed, and use of the locomotive's audible 
warning device.
    D. Approval of signal system modifications (part 235). This part 
contains instructions governing applications for approval of a 
discontinuance or material modification of a signal system or relief 
from the regulatory requirements of part 236. In the case of a signal 
system located on general system track which is used by both 
conventional and light rail lines, a light rail operation is subject to 
this part only if it (or a contractor hired by the operator) owns or has 
responsibility for maintaining the signal system. If the conventional 
railroad does the maintenance, then that railroad would file any 
application submitted under this part; the light rail operation would 
have the right to protest the application under Sec. 235.20. The 
petition should discuss whether the light rail operator or conventional 
railroad is responsible for maintaining the signal system.
    E. Standards for signal and train control systems (part 236). This 
part contains rules, standards, and instructions governing the 
installation, inspection, maintenance, and repair of signal and train 
control systems, devices, and appliances. In the case of a signal system 
located on general system track which is used by both conventional and 
light rail lines, a light rail operation is subject to this part only if 
it (or a contractor hired by the operation) owns or has responsibility 
for installing, inspecting, maintaining, and repairing the signal 
system. If the light rail operation has these responsibilities, a waiver 
would be unlikely because a signal failure would jeopardize the safety 
of both the light rail operation and the conventional railroad. If the 
conventional railroad assumes all of the responsibilities under this 
part, the light rail operation would not need a waiver, but it would 
have to abide by all operational limitations imposed this part and by 
the conventional railroad. The petition should discuss whether the light 
rail operator or conventional railroad has responsibility for 
installing, inspecting, maintaining, and repairing the signal system.

                     2. Motive power and equipment.

    A. Railroad noise emission compliance regulations (part 210). FRA 
issued this rule under the Noise Control Act of 1972, 42 U.S.C. 4916, 
rather than under its railroad safety authority. Because that statute 
included a definition of ``railroad'' borrowed from one of the older 
railroad safety laws, this part has an exception for ``street, suburban, 
or interurban electric railways unless operated as a part of the general 
railroad system of transportation.'' 49 CFR 210.3(b)(2). The petition 
should address whether this exception may apply to the light rail 
operation. Note that this exception is broader than the sole exception 
to the railroad safety statutes (i.e., urban rapid transit not connected 
to the general system). The greater the integration of the light rail 
and conventional operations, the less likely this exception would apply.
    If the light rail equipment would normally meet the standards in 
this rule, there would be no reason to seek a waiver of it. If it 
appears that the light rail system would neither meet the standards nor 
fit within the exception, the petition should address noise mitigation 
measures used on the system, especially as part of a system safety 
program. Note, however, that FRA lacks the authority to waive certain 
Environmental Protection Agency standards (40 CFR part 201) that 
underlie this rule. See 49 CFR 210.11(a).
    B. Railroad freight car safety standards (part 215). A light rail 
operator is likely to move freight cars only in connection with 
maintenance-of-way work. As long as such cars are properly stenciled in 
accordance with section 215.305, this part does not otherwise apply, and 
a waiver would seem unnecessary.
    C. Rear end marking devices (part 221). This part requires that each 
train occupying or operating on main line track be equipped with, 
display, and continuously illuminate or flash a marking device on the 
trailing end of the rear car during periods of darkness or other reduced 
visibility. The device, which must be approved by FRA, must have 
specific intensity, beam arc width, color, and

[[Page 88]]

flash rate characteristics. A light rail operation seeking a waiver of 
this part will need to explain how other marking devices with which it 
equips its vehicles, or other means such as train control, will provide 
the same assurances as this part of a reduced likelihood of collisions 
attributable to the failure of an approaching train to see the rear end 
of a leading train in time to stop short of it during periods of reduced 
visibility. The petition should describe the light rail vehicle's 
existing marking devices (e.g., headlights, brakelights, taillights, 
turn signal lights), and indicate whether the vehicle bears reflectors. 
If the light rail system will operate in both a conventional railroad 
environment and in streets mixed with motor vehicles, the petition 
should discuss whether adapting the design of the vehicle's lighting 
characteristics to conform to FRA's regulations would adversely affect 
the safety of its operations in the street environment. A light rail 
system that has a system safety program developed under FTA's rules may 
choose to discuss how that program addresses the need for equivalent 
levels of safety when its vehicles operate on conventional railroad 
corridors.
    D. Safety glazing standards (part 223). This part provides that 
passenger car windows be equipped with FRA-certified glazing materials 
in order to reduce the likelihood of injury to railroad employees and 
passengers from the breakage and shattering of windows and avoid 
ejection of passengers from the vehicle in a collision. This part, in 
addition to requiring the existence of at least four emergency windows, 
also requires window markings and operating instructions for each 
emergency window, as well as for each window intended for emergency 
access, so as to provide the necessary information for evacuation of a 
passenger car. FRA will not permit operations to occur on the general 
system in the absence of effective alternatives to the requirements of 
this part that provide an equivalent level of safety. The petition 
should explain what equivalent safeguards are in place to provide the 
same assurance as part 223 that passengers and crewmembers are safe from 
the effects of objects striking a light rail vehicle's windows. The 
petition should also discuss the design characteristics of its equipment 
when it explains how the safety of its employees and passengers will be 
assured during an evacuation in the absence of windows meeting the 
specific requirements of this part. A light rail system that has a 
system safety program plan developed under FTA's rule may be able to 
demonstrate that the plan satisfies the safety goals of this part.
    E. Locomotive safety standards (part 229). (1) This part contains 
minimum safety standards for all locomotives, except those propelled by 
steam power. FRA recognizes that due to the unique characteristics of 
light rail equipment, some of these provisions may be irrelevant to 
light rail equipment, and that others may not fit properly in the 
context of light rail operations. A waiver petition should explain 
precisely how the light rail system's practices will provide for the 
safe condition and operation of its locomotive equipment.
    (2) FRA is not likely to waive completely the provision (section 
229.125) of this rule concerning auxiliary lights designed to warn 
highway motorists of an approaching train. In order to reduce the risk 
of grade crossing accidents, it is important that all locomotives used 
by both conventional railroads and light rail systems present the same 
distinctive profile to motor vehicle operators approaching grade 
crossings on the general railroad system. If uniformity is sacrificed by 
permitting light rail systems to operate locomotives through the same 
grade crossings traversed by conventional trains with light arrangements 
placed in different locations on the equipment, safety could be 
compromised. Accordingly, the vehicle design should maintain the 
triangular pattern required of other locomotives and cab cars to the 
extent practicable.
    (3) FRA is aware that light rail headlights are likely to produce 
less than 200,000 candela. While some light rail operators may choose to 
satisfy the requirements of section 229.125 by including lights on their 
equipment of different candlepower controlled by dimmer switches, the 
headlights on the majority of light rail vehicles will likely not meet 
FRA's minimum requirement. However, based on the nature of the 
operations of light rail transit, FRA recognizes that waivers of the 
minimum candela requirement for transit vehicle headlights seems 
appropriate.
    F. Safety appliance laws (49 U.S.C. 20301-20305). (1) Since certain 
safety appliance requirements (e.g., automatic couplers) are statutory, 
they can only be ``waived'' by FRA under the exemption conditions set 
forth in 49 U.S.C. 20306. Because exemptions requested under this 
statutory provision do not involve a waiver of a safety rule, 
regulation, or standard (see 49 CFR 211.41), FRA is not required to 
follow the rules of practice for waivers contained in part 211. However, 
whenever appropriate, FRA will combine its consideration of any request 
for an exemption under Sec. 20306 with its review under part 211 of a 
light rail operation's petition for waivers of FRA's regulations.
    (2) FRA may grant exemptions from the statutory safety appliance 
requirements in 49 U.S.C. 20301-20305 only if application of such 
requirements would ``preclude the development or implementation of more 
efficient railroad transportation equipment or other transportation 
innovations.'' 49 U.S.C. 20306. The exemption for technological 
improvements was originally enacted to further the implementation of a 
specific type of

[[Page 89]]

freight car, but the legislative history shows that Congress intended 
the exemption to be used elsewhere so that ``other types of railroad 
equipment might similarly benefit.'' S. Rep. 96-614 at 8 (1980), 
reprinted in 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1156,1164.
    (3) FRA recognizes the potential public benefits of allowing light 
rail systems to take advantage of underutilized urban freight rail 
corridors to provide service that, in the absence of the existing right-
of-way, would be prohibitively expensive. Any petitioner requesting an 
exemption for technological improvements should carefully explain how 
being forced to comply with the existing statutory safety appliance 
requirements would conflict with the exemption exceptions set forth at 
49 U.S.C. 20306. The petition should also show that granting the 
exemption is in the public interest and is consistent with assuring the 
safety of the light rail operator's employees and passengers.
    G. Safety appliance standards (part 231). (1) The regulations in 
this part specify the requisite location, number, dimensions, and manner 
of application of a variety of railroad car safety appliances (e.g., 
handbrakes, ladders, handholds, steps), and directly implement a number 
of the statutory requirements found in 49 U.S.C. 20301-20305. These very 
detailed regulations are intended to ensure that sufficient safety 
appliances are available and able to function safely and securely as 
intended.
    (2) FRA recognizes that due to the unique characteristics of light 
rail equipment, some of these provisions may be irrelevant to light rail 
operation, and that others may not fit properly in the context of light 
rail operations (e.g., crewmembers typically do not perform yard duties 
from positions outside and adjacent to the light rail vehicle or near 
the vehicle's doors). However, to the extent that the light rail 
operation encompasses the safety risks addressed by the regulatory 
provisions of this part, a waiver petition should explain precisely how 
the light rail system's practices will provide for the safe operation of 
its passenger equipment. The petition should focus on the design 
specifications of the equipment, and explain how the light rail system's 
operating practices, and its intended use of the equipment, will satisfy 
the safety purpose of the regulations while providing at least an 
equivalent level of safety.
    H. Passenger equipment safety standards (part 238). This part 
prescribes minimum Federal safety standards for railroad passenger 
equipment. Since a collision on the general railroad system between 
light rail equipment and conventional rail equipment could prove 
catastrophic, because of the significantly greater mass and structural 
strength of the conventional equipment, a waiver petition should 
describe the light rail operation's system safety program that is in 
place to minimize the risk of such a collision. The petition should 
discuss the light rail operation's operating rules and procedures, train 
control technology, and signal system. If the light rail operator and 
conventional railroad will operate simultaneously on the same track, the 
petition should include a quantitative risk assessment that incorporates 
design information and provide an engineering analysis of the light rail 
equipment and its likely performance in derailment and collision 
scenarios. The petitioner should also demonstrate that risk mitigation 
measures to avoid the possibility of collisions, or to limit the speed 
at which a collision might occur , will be employed in connection with 
the use of the equipment on a specified shared-use rail line. This part 
also contains requirements concerning power brakes on passenger trains, 
and a petitioner seeking a waiver in this area should refer to these 
requirements, not those found in 49 CFR part 232.

                         3. Operating practices.

    A. Railroad workplace safety (part 214). (1) This part contains 
standards for protecting bridge workers and roadway workers. The 
petition should explain whether the light rail operator or conventional 
railroad is responsible for bridge work on shared general system 
trackage. If the light rail operator does the work and does similar work 
on segments outside of the general system, it may wish to seek a waiver 
permitting it to observe OSHA standards throughout its system.
    (2) There are no comparable OSHA standards protecting roadway 
workers. The petition should explain which operator is responsible for 
track and signal work on the shared segments. If the light rail operator 
does this work, the petition should explain how the light rail operator 
protects these workers. However, to the extent that protection varies 
significantly from FRA's rules, a waiver permitting use of the light 
rail system's standards could be very confusing to train crews of the 
conventional railroad who follow FRA's rules elsewhere. A waiver of this 
rule is unlikely. A petition should address how such confusion would be 
avoided and safety of roadway workers would be ensured.
    B. Railroad operating rules (part 217). This part requires filing of 
a railroad's operating rules and that employees be instructed and tested 
on compliance with them. A light rail operation would not likely have 
difficulty complying with this part. However, if a waiver is desired, 
the light rail system should explain how other safeguards it has in 
place provide the same assurance that operating employees are trained 
and periodically tested on the rules that govern train operation. A 
light rail system that has a system safety program plan developed under 
FTA's rules

[[Page 90]]

may be in a good position to give such an assurance.
    C. Railroad operating practices (part 218). This part requires 
railroads to follow certain practices in various aspects of their 
operations (protection of employees working on equipment, protection of 
trains and locomotives from collisions in certain situations, 
prohibition against tampering with safety devices, protection of 
occupied camp cars). Some of these provisions (e.g., camp cars) may be 
irrelevant to light rail operations. Others may not fit well in the 
context of light rail operations. To the extent the light rail operation 
presents the risks addressed by the various provisions of this part, a 
waiver provision should explain precisely how the light rail system's 
practices will address those risks. FRA is not likely to waive the 
prohibition against tampering with safety devices, which would seem to 
present no particular burden to light rail operations. Moreover, blue 
signal regulations, which protect employees working on or near 
equipment, are not likely to be waived to the extent that such work is 
performed on track shared by a light rail operation and a conventional 
railroad, where safety may best be served by uniformity.
    D. Control of alcohol and drug use (part 219). FRA will not permit 
operations to occur on the general system in the absence of effective 
rules governing alcohol and drug use by operating employees. FTA's own 
rules may provide a suitable alternative for a light rail system that is 
otherwise governed by those rules. However, to the extent that light 
rail and conventional operations occur simultaneously on the same track, 
FRA is not likely to apply different rules to the two operations, 
particularly with respect to post-accident testing, for which FRA 
requirements are more extensive (e.g., section 219.11(f) addresses the 
removal, under certain circumstances, of body fluid and/or tissue 
samples taken from the remains of any railroad employee who performs 
service for a railroad). (FRA recognizes that in the event of a fatal 
train accident involving a transit vehicle, whether involving temporal 
separation or simultaneous use of the same track, the National 
Transportation Safety Board will likely investigate and obtain its own 
toxicology test results.)
    E. Railroad communications (part 220). A light rail operation is 
likely to have an effective system of radio communication that may 
provide a suitable alternative to FRA's rules. However, the greater the 
need for radio communication between light rail personnel (e.g., train 
crews or dispatchers) and personnel of the conventional railroad (e.g., 
train crews, roadway workers), the greater will be the need for 
standardized communication rules and, accordingly, the less likely will 
be a waiver.
    F. Railroad accident/incident reporting (part 225). (1) FRA's 
accident/incident information is very important in the agency's 
decisionmaking on regulatory issues and strategic planning. A waiver 
petition should indicate precisely what types of accidents and incidents 
it would report, and to whom, under any alternative it proposes. FRA is 
not likely to waive its reporting requirements concerning train 
accidents or highway-rail grade crossing collisions that occur on the 
general railroad system. Reporting of accidents under FTA's rules is 
quite different and would not provide an effective substitute. However, 
with regard to employee injuries, the light rail operation may, absent 
FRA's rules, otherwise be subject to reporting requirements of FTA and 
OSHA and may have an interest in uniform reporting of those injuries 
wherever they occur on the system. Therefore, it is more likely that FRA 
would grant a waiver with regard to reporting of employee injuries.
    (2) Any waiver FRA may grant in the accident/incident reporting area 
would have no effect on FRA's authority to investigate such incidents or 
on the duties of light rail operators and any other affected railroads 
to cooperate with those investigations. See sections 225.31 and 225.35 
and 49 U.S.C. 20107 and 20902. Light rail operators should anticipate 
that FRA will investigate any serious accident or injury that occurs on 
the shared use portion of their lines, even if it occurs during hours 
when only the light rail trains are operating. Moreover, there may be 
instances when FRA will work jointly with FTA and the state agency to 
investigate the cause of a transit accident that occurs off the general 
system under circumstances that raise concerns about the safety of 
operations on the shared use portions. For example, if a transit 
operator using the same light rail equipment on the shared and non-
shared-use portions of its operation has a serious accident on the non-
shared-use portion, FRA may want to determine whether the cause of the 
accident pointed to a systemic problem with the equipment that might 
impact the transit system's operations on the general system. Similarly, 
where human error might be a factor, FRA may want to determine whether 
the employee potentially at fault also has safety responsibilities on 
the general system and, if so, take appropriate action to ensure that 
corrective action is taken. FRA believes its statutory investigatory 
authority extends as far as necessary to address any condition that 
might reasonably be expected to create a hazard to railroad operations 
within its jurisdiction.
    G. Hours of service laws (49 U.S.C. 21101-21108). (1) The hours of 
service laws apply to all railroads subject to FRA's jurisdiction, and 
govern the maximum work hours and minimum off-duty periods of employees 
engaged in one or more of the three categories

[[Page 91]]

of covered service described in 49 U.S.C. 21101. If an individual 
performs more than one kind of covered service during a tour of duty, 
then the most restrictive of the applicable limitations control. Under 
current law, a light rail operation could request a waiver of the 
substantive provisions of the hours of service laws only under the 
``pilot project'' provision described in 49 U.S.C. 21108, provided that 
the request is based upon a joint petition submitted by the railroad and 
its affected labor organizations. Because waivers requested under this 
statutory provision do not involve a waiver of a safety rule, 
regulation, or standard (see 49 CFR 211.41), FRA is not required to 
follow the rules of practice for waivers contained in part 211. However, 
whenever appropriate, FRA will combine its consideration of any request 
for a waiver under Sec. 21108 with its review under part 211 of a light 
rail operation's petition for waivers of FRA's regulations.
    (2) If such a statutory waiver is desired, the light rail system 
will need to assure FRA that the waiver of compliance is in the public 
interest and consistent with railroad safety. The waiver petition should 
include a discussion of what fatigue management strategies will be in 
place for each category of covered employees in order to minimize the 
effects of fatigue on their job performance. However, FRA is unlikely to 
grant a statutory waiver covering employees of a light rail operation 
who dispatch the trains of a conventional railroad or maintain a signal 
system affecting shared use trackage.
    H. Hours of service recordkeeping (part 228). This part prescribes 
reporting and recordkeeping requirements with respect to the hours of 
service of employees who perform the job functions set forth in 49 
U.S.C. 21101. As a general rule, FRA anticipates that any waivers 
granted under this part will only exempt the same groups of employees 
for whom a light rail system has obtained a waiver of the substantive 
provisions of the hours of service laws under 49 U.S.C. 21108. Since it 
is important that FRA be able to verify that a light rail operation is 
complying with the on- and off-duty restrictions of the hour of service 
laws for all employees not covered by a waiver of the laws' substantive 
provisions, it is unlikely that any waiver granted of the reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements would exclude those employees. However, in a 
system with fixed work schedules that do not approach 12 hours on duty 
in the aggregate, it may be possible to utilize existing payroll records 
to verify compliance.
    I. Passenger train emergency preparedness (part 239). This part 
prescribes minimum Federal safety standards for the preparation, 
adoption, and implementation of emergency preparedness plans by 
railroads connected with the operation of passenger trains. FRA's 
expectation is that by requiring affected railroads to provide 
sufficient emergency egress capability and information to passengers, 
along with mandating that these railroads coordinate with local 
emergency response officials, the risk of death or injury from accidents 
and incidents will be lessened. A waiver petition should state whether 
the light rail system has an emergency preparedness plan in place under 
a state system safety program developed under FTA's rules for the light 
rail operator's separate street railway segments. Under a system safety 
program, a light rail operation is likely to have an effective plan for 
dealing with emergency situations that may provide an equivalent 
alternative to FRA's rules. To the extent that the light rail 
operation's plan relates to the various provisions of this part, a 
waiver petition should explain precisely how each of the requirements of 
this part is being addressed. The petition should especially focus on 
the issues of communication, employee training, passenger information, 
liaison relationships with emergency responders, and marking of 
emergency exits.
    J. Qualification and certification of locomotive engineers (part 
240). This part contains minimum Federal safety requirements for the 
eligibility, training, testing, certification, and monitoring of 
locomotive engineers. Those who operate light rail trains may have 
significant effects on the safety of light rail passengers, motorists at 
grade crossings, and, to the extent trackage is shared with conventional 
railroads, the employees and passengers of those railroads. The petition 
should describe whether a light rail system has a system safety plan 
developed under FTA's rules that is likely to have an effective means of 
assuring that the operators, or ``engineers,'' of its equipment receive 
the necessary training and have proper skills to operate a light rail 
vehicle in shared use on the general railroad system. The petition 
should explain what safeguards are in place to ensure that light rail 
engineers receive at least an equivalent level of training, testing, and 
monitoring on the rules governing train operations to that received by 
locomotive engineers employed by conventional railroads and certified 
under part 240. Any light rail system unable to meet this burden would 
have to fully comply with the requirements of part 240. Moreover, where 
a transit system intends to operate simultaneously on the same track 
with conventional equipment, FRA will not be inclined to waive the part 
240 requirements. In that situation, FRA's paramount concern would be 
uniformity of training and qualifications of all those operating trains 
on the general system, regardless of the type of equipment.

[[Page 92]]

    V. Waivers That May be Appropriate for Time-Separated Light Rail 
                               Operations

    1. The foregoing discussion of factors to address in a petition for 
approval of shared use concerns all such petitions and, accordingly, is 
quite general. FRA is willing to provide more specific guidance on where 
waivers may be likely with regard to light rail operations that are 
time-separated from conventional operations. FRA's greatest concern with 
regard to shared use of the general system is a collision between light 
rail and conventional trains on the same track. Because the results 
could well be catastrophic, FRA places great emphasis on avoiding such 
collisions. The surest way to guarantee that such collisions will not 
occur is to strictly segregate light rail and conventional operations by 
time of day so that the two types of equipment never share the same 
track at the same time. This is not to say that FRA will not entertain 
waiver petitions that rely on other methods of collision avoidance such 
as sophisticated train control systems. However, petitioners who do not 
intend to separate light rail from conventional operations by time of 
day will face a steep burden of demonstrating an acceptable level of 
safety. FRA does not insist that all risk of collision be eliminated. 
However, given the enormous severity of the likely consequences of a 
collision, the demonstrated risk of such an event must be extremely 
remote.
    2. There are various ways of providing such strict separation by 
time. For example, freight operations could be limited to the hours of 
midnight to 5 a.m. when light rail operations are prohibited. Or, there 
might be both a nighttime and a mid-day window for freight operation. 
The important thing is that the arrangement not permit simultaneous 
operation on the same track by clearly defining specific segments of the 
day when only one type of operation may occur. Mere spacing of train 
movements by a train control system does not constitute this temporal 
separation.
    3. FRA is very likely to grant waivers of many of its rules where 
complete temporal separation between light rail and conventional 
operations is demonstrated in the waiver request. The chart below lists 
each of FRA's railroad safety rules and provides FRA's view on whether 
it is likely to grant a waiver in a particular area where temporal 
separation is assured. Where the ``Likely Treatment'' column says 
``comply'' a waiver is not likely, and where it says ``waive'' a waiver 
is likely. Of course, FRA will consider each petition on its own merits 
and one should not presume, based on the chart, that FRA will grant or 
deny any particular request in a petition. This chart is offered as 
general guidance as part of a statement of policy, and as such does not 
alter any safety rules or obligate FRA to follow it in every case. This 
chart assumes that the operations of the local rail transit agency on 
the general railroad system are completely separated in time from 
conventional railroad operations, and that the light rail operation 
poses no atypical safety hazards. FRA's procedural rules on matters such 
as enforcement (49 CFR parts 209 and 216), and its statutory authority 
to investigate accidents and injuries and take emergency action to 
address an imminent hazard of death or injury, would apply to these 
operations in all cases.
    4. Where waivers are granted, a light rail operator would be 
expected to operate under a system safety plan developed in accordance 
with the FTA state safety oversight program. The state safety oversight 
agency would be responsible for the safety oversight of the light rail 
operation, even on the general system, with regard to aspects of that 
operation for which a waiver is granted. (The ``Comments'' column of the 
chart shows ``State Safety Oversight'' where waivers conditioned on such 
state oversight are likely.) FRA will coordinate with FTA and the state 
agency to address any serious safety problems. If the conditions under 
which the waiver was granted change substantially, or unanticipated 
safety issues arise, FRA may modify or withdraw a waiver in order to 
ensure safety. On certain subjects where waivers are not likely, the 
``Comments'' column of the chart makes special note of some important 
regulatory requirements that the light rail system will have to observe 
even if it is not primarily responsible for compliance with that 
particular rule.

* Safety Appliance Statute. Certain safety appliance requirements (e.g., automatic couplers) are statutory and
  can only be waived under the conditions set forth in 49 U.S.C. 20306, which permits exemptions if application
  of the requirements would ``preclude the development or implementation of more efficient railroad
  transportation equipment or other transportation innovations.'' If consistent with employee safety, FRA could
  probably rely on this provision to address most light rail equipment that could not meet the standards.
** Hours of Service Statute. Currently, 49 U.S.C. 21108 permits FRA to waive substantive provisions of the hours
  of service laws based upon a joint petition by the railroad and affected labor organizations, after notice and
  an opportunity for a hearing. This is a ``pilot project'' provision, so waivers are limited to two years but
  may be extended for additional two-year periods after notice and an opportunity for comment.

<R05>
Sec. 212.5  Filing.

    Each State agency desiring to conduct investigative and surveillance 
activities must submit to the Associate Administrator for Safety, 
Federal Railroad Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 
20590, the documentation which contains the information prescribed by 
Sec. Sec. 212.105 and 212.107.


<R04>
                      Subpart B_State/Federal Roles


<R05>
Sec. 212.101  Program principles.

    (a) The purpose of the national railroad safety program is to 
promote safety in all areas of railroad operations in order to reduce 
deaths, injuries and damage to property resulting from railroad 
accidents.
    (b)(1) The national railroad safety program is carried out in part 
through the issuance of mandatory Federal safety requirements and 
through inspection efforts designed to monitor compliance with those 
requirements. FRA and State inspections determine the extent to which 
the railroads, shippers, and manufacturers have fulfilled their 
obligations with respect to inspection, maintenance, training, and 
supervision. The FRA and participating States do not conduct inspections 
of track, equipment, signal systems, operating practices, and hazardous 
materials handling for the railroads, shippers, and manufacturers.
    (2) The national railroad safety program is also carried out through 
routine inspections, accident investigations, formal and informal 
educational efforts, complaint investigations, safety assessments, 
special inquiries, regulatory development, research and similar 
initiatives.
    (c) It is the policy of the FRA to maintain direct oversight of 
railroad, shipper, and manufacturer conditions and practices relevant to 
safety by conducting inspections and investigations in concert with 
participating State agencies.
    (d) The principal role of the State Safety Participation Program in 
the national railroad safety effort is to provide an enhanced 
investigative and surveillance capability through assumption, by 
participating State agencies, of responsibility for planned routine 
compliance inspections. The FRA encourages further State contributions 
to the national railroad safety program consistent with overall program 
needs, individual State capabilities, and the willingness of the States 
to undertake additional investigative and surveillance activities.
    (e) It is the policy of the FRA to promote the growth and vitality 
of the State Safety Participation Program through liaison with State 
government, coordination of Federal and State investigative and 
surveillance activities, and training of inspection personnel.

[47 FR 41051, Sept. 16, 1982, as amended at 57 FR 28115, June 24, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 212.103  Investigative and surveillance authority.

    (a) Subject to the requirements of this part, a State agency with 
jurisdiction under State law may participate in investigative and 
surveillance activities concerning Federal railroad safety laws and 
regulations by entering into an agreement under Sec. 212.105 for the 
exercise of specified authority.
    (b) Subject to requirements of this part, a State agency with 
jurisdiction under State law may participate in investigative and 
surveillance activities with respect to particular rules, regulations, 
orders or standards issued under the regulatory authority of the Federal 
Railroad Safety Act of 1970 by filing an annual certification under 
Sec. 212.107.


<R05>
Sec. 212.105  Agreements.

    (a) Scope. The principal method by which States may participate in 
investigative and surveillance activities is by agreement with FRA. An 
agreement may delegate investigative and surveillance authority with 
respect to all or any part of the Federal railroad safety laws.
    (b) Duration. An agreement may be for a fixed term or for an 
indefinite duration.
    (c) Amendments. An agreement may be amended to expand or contract 
its scope by consent of FRA and the State.
    (d) Common terms. Each agreement entered into under this section 
provides that:

subpart C of this part) to be qualified to perform the particular 
investigative and surveillance activities to which the personnel are 
assigned; and
    (3) The State agency agrees to provide the capability necessary to 
assure coverage of facilities, equipment, and operating practices 
through planned routine compliance inspections for all, or a specified 
part of, the territory of the State.
    (e) Request for agreement. A request for agreement shall contain the 
following information:
    (1) An opinion of the counsel for the State agency stating that:

    (5) A description of the organization, programs, and functions of 
the agency with respect to railroad safety.
    (f) Developmental agreement. Consistent with national program 
requirements, the Associate Administrator may enter into an agreement 
under this section prior to the qualification of inspection personnel of 
the State under subpart C of this part. In such a case, the agreement 
shall (1) specify the date at which the State will assume investigative 
and surveillance duties, and (2) refer to any undertaking by the FRA to 
provide training for State inspection personnel, including a schedule 
for the training courses that will be made available.
    (g) Action on request. The Associate Administrator responds to a 
request for agreement by entering into an agreement based on the 
request, by declining the request, or by suggesting modifications.

    (a) This part prescribes minimum safety requirements for railroad 
track

[[Page 106]]

that is part of the general railroad system of transportation. The 
requirements prescribed in this part apply to specific track conditions 
existing in isolation. Therefore, a combination of track conditions, 
none of which individually amounts to a deviation from the requirements 
in this part, may require remedial action to provide for safe operations 
over that track. This part does not restrict a railroad from adopting 
and enforcing additional or more stringent requirements not inconsistent 
with this part.
    (b) Subparts A through F apply to track Classes 1 through 5. Subpart 
G and 213.2, 213.3, and 213.15 apply to track over which trains are 
operated at speeds in excess of those permitted over Class 5 track.


<R05>
Sec. 213.2  Preemptive effect.

    Under 49 U.S.C. 20106, issuance of these regulations preempts any 
State law, regulation, or order covering the same subject matter, except 
an additional or more stringent law, regulation, or order that is 
necessary to eliminate or reduce an essentially local safety hazard; is 
not incompatible with a law, regulation, or order of the United States 
Government; and that does not impose an unreasonable burden on 
interstate commerce.


<R05>
Sec. 213.3  Application.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this part 
applies to all standard gage track in the general railroad system of 
transportation.
    (b) This part does not apply to track--
    (1) Located inside an installation which is not part of the general 
railroad system of transportation; or
    (2) Used exclusively for rapid transit operations in an urban area 
that are not connected with the general railroad system of 
transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 213.4  Excepted track.

    A track owner may designate a segment of track as excepted track 
provided that--
    (a) The segment is identified in the timetable, special 
instructions, general order, or other appropriate records which are 
available for inspection during regular business hours;
    (b) The identified segment is not located within 30 feet of an 
adjacent track which can be subjected to simultaneous use at speeds in 
excess of 10 miles per hour;
    (c) The identified segment is inspected in accordance with 
213.233(c) and 213.235 at the frequency specified for Class 1 track;
    (d) The identified segment of track is not located on a bridge 
including the track approaching the bridge for 100 feet on either side, 
or located on a public street or highway, if railroad cars containing 
commodities required to be placarded by the Hazardous Materials 
Regulations (49 CFR part 172), are moved over the track; and
    (e) The railroad conducts operations on the identified segment under 
the following conditions:
    (1) No train shall be operated at speeds in excess of 10 miles per 
hour;
    (2) No occupied passenger train shall be operated;
    (3) No freight train shall be operated that contains more than five 
cars required to be placarded by the Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 
CFR part 172); and
    (4) The gage on excepted track shall not be more than 4 feet 10\1/4\ 
inches. This paragraph (e)(4) is applicable September 21, 1999.
    (f) A track owner shall advise the appropriate FRA Regional Office 
at least 10 days prior to removal of a segment of track from excepted 
status.

Sec. 213.5  Responsibility for compliance.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any owner 
of track to which this part applies who knows or has notice that the 
track does not comply with the requirements of this part, shall--
    (1) Bring the track into compliance;
    (2) Halt operations over that track; or
    (3) Operate under authority of a person designated under Sec. 
213.7(a), who has at least one year of supervisory experience in 
railroad track maintenance, subject to conditions set forth in this 
part.
    (b) If an owner of track to which this part applies designates a 
segment of track as ``excepted track'' under the

[[Page 107]]

provisions of Sec. 213.4, operations may continue over that track 
without complying with the provisions of subparts B, C, D, and E of this 
part, unless otherwise expressly stated.
    (c) If an owner of track to which this part applies assigns 
responsibility for the track to another person (by lease or otherwise), 
written notification of the assignment shall be provided to the 
appropriate FRA Regional Office at least 30 days in advance of the 
assignment. The notification may be made by any party to that 
assignment, but shall be in writing and include the following--
    (1) The name and address of the track owner;
    (2) The name and address of the person to whom responsibility is 
assigned (assignee);
    (3) A statement of the exact relationship between the track owner 
and the assignee;
    (4) A precise identification of the track;
    (5) A statement as to the competence and ability of the assignee to 
carry out the duties of the track owner under this part; and
    (6) A statement signed by the assignee acknowledging the assignment 
to him of responsibility for purposes of compliance with this part.
    (d) The Administrator may hold the track owner or the assignee or 
both responsible for compliance with this part and subject to penalties 
under Sec. 213.15.
    (e) A common carrier by railroad which is directed by the Surface 
Transportation Board to provide service over the track of another 
railroad under 49 U.S.C. 11123 is considered the owner of that track for 
the purposes of the application of this part during the period the 
directed service order remains in effect.
    (f) When any person, including a contractor for a railroad or track 
owner, performs any function required by this part, that person is 
required to perform that function in accordance with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 213.7  Designation of qualified persons to supervise certain renewals and 

inspect track.

    (a) Each track owner to which this part applies shall designate

    (b) If a segment of track does not meet all of the requirements for 
its intended class, it is reclassified to the next lowest class of track 
for which it does meet all of the requirements of this part. However, if 
the segment of track does not at least meet the requirements for Class 1 
track, operations may continue at Class 1 speeds for a period of not 
more than 30 days without bringing the track into compliance, under the 
authority of a person designated under Sec. 213.7(a), who has at least 
one year of supervisory experience in railroad track maintenance, after 
that person determines that operations may safely continue and subject 
to any limiting conditions specified by such person.


<R05>
Sec. 213.11  Restoration or renewal of track under traffic conditions.

    If during a period of restoration or renewal, track is under traffic 
conditions and does not meet all of the requirements prescribed in this 
part, the work on the track shall be under the continuous supervision of 
a person designated under Sec. 213.7(a) who has at least one year of 
supervisory experience in

[[Page 109]]

railroad track maintenance, and subject to any limiting conditions 
specified by such person. The term ``continuous supervision'' as used in 
this section means the physical presence of that person at a job site. 
However, since the work may be performed over a large area, it is not 
necessary that each phase of the work be done under the visual 
supervision of that person.


<R05>
Sec. 213.13  Measuring track not under load.

    When unloaded track is measured to determine compliance with 
requirements of this part, the amount of rail movement, if any, that 
occurs while the track is loaded must be added to the measurements of 
the unloaded track.


<R05>
Sec. 213.15  Penalties.

    (a) Any person who violates any requirement of this part or causes 
the violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil penalty of 
at least $550 and not more than $16,000 per violation, except that: 
Penalties may be assessed against individuals only for willful 
violations, and, where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of 
repeated violations has created an imminent hazard of death or injury to 
persons, or has caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $27,000 
per violation may be assessed. ``Person'' means an entity of any type 
covered under 1 U.S.C. 1, including but not limited to the following: a 
railroad; a manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of 
a railroad; any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad 
equipment, track, or facilities; any independent contractor providing 
goods or services to a railroad; any employee of such owner, 
manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor; and anyone held 
by the Federal Railroad Administrator to be responsible under Sec. 
213.5(d) or Sec. 213.303(c). Each day a violation continues shall 
constitute a separate offense. See appendix B to this part for a 
statement of agency civil penalty policy.
    (b) Any person who knowingly and willfully falsifies a record or 
report required by this part may be subject to criminal penalties under 
49 U.S.C. 21311.

Sec. 213.17  Waivers.

    (a) Any owner of track to which this part applies, or other person 
subject to this part, may petition the Federal Railroad Administrator 
for a waiver from any or all requirements prescribed in this part. The 
filing of such a petition does not affect that person's responsibility 
for compliance with that requirement while the petition is being 
considered.
    (b) Each petition for a waiver under this section shall be filed in 
the manner and contain the information required by part 211 of this 
chapter.
    (c) If the Administrator finds that a waiver is in the public 
interest and is consistent with railroad safety, the Administrator may 
grant the exemption subject to any conditions the Administrator deems 
necessary. Where a waiver is granted, the Administrator publishes a 
notice containing the reasons for granting the waiver.

Sec. 213.57  Curves; elevation and speed limitations.

    (a) The maximum crosslevel on the outside rail of a curve may not be 
more than 8 inches on track Classes 1 and 2 and 7 inches on Classes 3 
through 5. Except as provided in Sec. 213.63, the outside rail of a 
curve may not be lower than the inside rail. (The first sentence of 
paragraph (a) is applicable September 21, 1999.)

[[Page 111]]

    (b)(1) The maximum allowable operating speed for each curve is 
determined by the following formula--
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22JN98.001

Where--

V<INF>max</INF> = Maximum allowable operating speed (miles per hour).
E<INF>a</INF> = Actual elevation of the outside rail (inches).\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Actual elevation for each 155 foot track segment in the body of 
the curve is determined by averaging the elevation for 10 points through 
the segment at 15.5 foot spacing. If the curve length is less than 155 
feet, average the points through the full length of the body of the 
curve.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

D = Degree of curvature (degrees).\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Degree of curvature is determined by averaging the degree of 
curvature over the same track segment as the elevation.

    (2) Table 1 of Appendix A is a table of maximum allowable operating 
speed computed in accordance with this formula for various elevations 
and degrees of curvature.
    (c)(1) For rolling stock meeting the requirements specified in 
paragraph (d) of this section, the maximum operating speed for each 
curve may be determined by the following formula--
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22JN98.002

Where--

V<INF>max</INF> = Maximum allowable operating speed (miles per hour).
E<INF>a</INF> = Actual elevation of the outside rail (inches).\1\
D = Degree of curvature (degrees).\2\

    (2) Table 2 of Appendix A is a table of maximum allowable operating 
speed computed in accordance with this formula for various elevations 
and degrees of curvature.
    (d) Qualified equipment may be operated at curving speeds determined 
by the formula in paragraph (c) of this section, provided each specific 
class of equipment is approved for operation by the Federal Railroad 
Administration and the railroad demonstrates that:
    (1) When positioned on a track with a uniform 4-inch superelevation, 
the roll angle between the floor of the equipment and the horizontal 
does not exceed 5.7 degrees; and
    (2) When positioned on a track with a uniform 6 inch superelevation, 
no wheel of the equipment unloads to a value of 60 percent of its static 
value on perfectly level track, and the roll angle between the floor of 
the equipment and the horizontal does not exceed 8.6 degrees.
    (3) The track owner shall notify the Federal Railroad Administrator 
no less than 30 calendar days prior to the proposed implementation of 
the higher curving speeds allowed under the formula in paragraph (c) of 
this section. The notification shall be in writing and shall contain, at 
a minimum, the following information--
    (i) A complete description of the class of equipment involved, 
including schematic diagrams of the suspension systems and the location 
of the center of gravity above top of rail;
    (ii) A complete description of the test procedure \3\ and 
instrumentation used to qualify the equipment and the maximum values for 
wheel unloading and roll angles which were observed during testing;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The test procedure may be conducted in a test facility whereby 
all the wheels on one side (right or left) of the equipment are 
alternately raised and lowered by 4 and 6 inches and the vertical wheel 
loads under each wheel are measured and a level is used to record the 
angle through which the floor of the equipment has been rotated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (iii) Procedures or standards in effect which relate to the 
maintenance of the suspension system for the particular class of 
equipment; and
    (iv) Identification of line segment on which the higher curving 
speeds are proposed to be implemented.
    (e) A track owner, or an operator of a passenger or commuter 
service, who provides passenger or commuter service over trackage of 
more than one track owner with the same class of equipment may provide 
written notification to the Federal Railroad Administrator with the 
written consent of the other affected track owners.
    (f) Equipment presently operating at curving speeds allowed under 
the formula in paragraph (c) of this section,

[[Page 112]]

by reason of conditional waivers granted by the Federal Railroad 
Administration, shall be considered to have successfully complied with 
the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.
    (g) A track owner or a railroad operating above Class 5 speeds, may 
request approval from the Federal Railroad Administrator to operate 
specified equipment at a level of cant deficiency greater than four 
inches in accordance with Sec. 213.329(c) and (d) on curves in Class 1

that--
    (1) The track owner or railroad submits a test plan to the Federal 
Railroad Administrator for approval no less than thirty calendar days 
prior to any proposed implementation of the higher curving speeds. The 
test plan shall include an analysis and determination of carbody 
acceleration safety limits for each vehicle type which indicate wheel 
unloading of 60 percent in a steady state condition and 80 percent in a 
transient (point by point) condition. Accelerometers shall be laterally-
oriented and floor-mounted near the end of a representative vehicle of 
each type;
    (2) Upon FRA approval of a test plan, the track owner or railroad 
conducts incrementally increasing train speed test runs over the curves 
in the identified track segment(s) to demonstrate that wheel unloading 
is within the limits prescribed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section;
    (3) Upon FRA approval of a cant deficiency level, the track owner or 
railroad inspects the curves in the identified track segment with a 
Track Geometry Measurement System (TGMS) qualified in accordance with 
Sec. 213.333 (b) through (g) at an inspection frequency of at least 
twice annually with not less than 120 days interval between inspections; 
and
    (4) The track owner or railroad operates an instrumented car having 
dynamic response characteristics that are representative of other 
equipment assigned to service or a portable device that monitors on-
board instrumentation on trains over the curves in the identified track 
segment at the revenue speed profile at a frequency of at least once 
every 90-day period with not less than 30 days interval between 
inspections. The instrumented car or the portable device shall monitor a 
laterally-oriented accelerometer placed near the end of the vehicle at 
the floor level. If the carbody lateral acceleration measurement exceeds 
the safety limits prescribed in paragraph (g)(1), the railroad shall 
operate trains at curving speeds in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) 
of this section; and
    (5) The track owner or railroad shall maintain a copy of the most

\1\ Definitions for the GRMS parameters referenced in this table are
  found in paragraph (p) of this section.
\2\ This note recognizes that typical good track will increase in total
  gage by as much as \1/4\ inch due to outward rail rotation under GRMS
  loading conditions. For Class 2 & 3 track, the GRMS LTG values are
  also increased by \1/4\ inch to a maximum of 58 inches. However, for
  any Class of track, GRMS LTG values in excess of 58 inches are
  considered First Level exceptions and the appropriate remedial actions
  must be taken by the track owner. This \1/4\-inch increase in
  allowable gage applies only to GRMS LTG. For gage measured by
  traditional methods, or with the use of the PTLF, the table in Sec.
  213.53(b) will apply.

    (m) Between GRMS inspections, the PTLF may be used as an additional 
analytical tool to assist fully qualified Sec. 213.7 individuals in 
determining compliance with the crosstie and fastener requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 213.109 and 213.127. When the PTLF is used, whether as an 
additional analytical tool or to fulfill the requirements of paragraph 
(l), it shall be used subject to the following criteria--
    (1) At any location along the track that the PTLF is applied, that 
location will be deemed in compliance with the crosstie and fastener 
requirements specified in Sec. Sec. 213.109 and 213.127 provided that--
    (i) The total gage widening at that location does not exceed \5/8\ 
inch when increasing the applied force from 0 to 4,000 pounds; and
    (ii) The gage of the track under 4,000 pounds of applied force does 
not exceed the allowable gage prescribed in Sec. 213.53(b) for the 
class of track.
    (2) Gage widening in excess of \5/8\ inch shall constitute a 
deviation from Class 1 standards.
    (3) A person designated as fully qualified under Sec. 213.7 retains 
the discretionary authority to prescribe additional remedial actions for 
those locations which comply with the requirements of paragraph 
(m)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (4) When a functional PTLF is not available to a fully qualified 
person designated under Sec. 213.7, the criteria for determining 
crosstie and fastener compliance shall be based solely on the 
requirements specified in Sec. Sec. 213.109 and 213.127.
    (5) If the PTLF becomes non-functional or is missing, the track 
owner will replace or repair it before the next inspection required 
under Sec. 213.233.
    (6) Where vertical loading of the track is necessary for contact 
with the lateral rail restraint components, a PTLF test will not be 
considered valid until contact with these components is restored under 
static loading conditions.
    (n) The track owner shall maintain a record of the two most recent 
GRMS inspections at locations which meet the requirements specified in 
Sec. 213.241(b). At a minimum, records shall indicate the following--

[[Page 118]]

    (1) Location and nature of each First Level exception; and
    (2) Nature and date of remedial action, if any, for each exception 
identified in paragraph (n)(1) of this section.
    (o) The inspection interval for designated GRMS line segments shall 
be such that--
    (1) On line segments where the annual tonnage exceeds two million 
gross tons, or where the maximum operating speeds for passenger trains 
exceeds 30 mph, GRMS inspections must be performed annually at an 
interval not to exceed 14 months; or
    (2) On line segments where the annual tonnage is two million gross 
tons or less and the maximum operating speed for passenger trains does 
not exceed 30 mph, the interval between GRMS inspections must not exceed 
24 months.
    (p) As used in this section--
    (1) Gage Restraint Measurement System (GRMS) means a track loading 
vehicle meeting the minimum design requirements specified in this 
section.
    (2) Gage Widening Ratio (GWR) means the measured difference between 
loaded and unloaded gage measurements, linearly normalized to 16,000 
pounds of applied lateral load.
    (3) L/V ratio means the numerical ratio of lateral load applied at a 
point on the rail to the vertical load applied at that same point. GRMS 
design requirements specify an L/V ratio of between 0.5 and 1.25. GRMS 
vehicles using load combinations developing L/V ratios which exceed 0.8 
must be operated with caution to protect against the risk of wheel climb 
by the test wheelset.
    (4) Load severity means the amount of lateral load applied to the 
fastener system after friction between rail and tie is overcome by any 
applied gage-widening lateral load.
    (5) Loaded Track Gage (LTG) means the gage measured by the GRMS 
vehicle at a point no more than 12 inches from the lateral load 
application point.
    (6) Portable Track Loading Fixture (PTLF) means a portable track 
loading device capable of applying an increasing lateral force from 0 to 
4,000 pounds on the web/base fillet of each rail simultaneously.
    (7) Projected Loaded Gage (PLG) means an extrapolated value for 
loaded gage calculated from actual measured loads and deflections. PLG 
24 means the extrapolated value for loaded gage under a 24,000 pound 
lateral load and a 33,000 pound vertical load.
    (8) Unloaded Track Gage (UTG) means the gage measured by the GRMS 
vehicle at a point no less than 10 feet from any lateral or vertical 
load.

Sec. 213.113  Defective rails.

    (a) When an owner of track to which this part applies learns, 
through inspection or otherwise, that a rail in that track contains any 
of the defects listed in the following table, a person designated under 
Sec. 213.7 shall determine whether or not the track may continue in 
use. If he determines that the track may continue in use, operation over 
the defective rail is not permitted until--
    (1) The rail is replaced; or
    (2) The remedial action prescribed in the table is initiated.

[[Page 119]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN28SE98.059

    Notes: A. Assign person designated under Sec. 213.7 to visually 
supervise each operation over defective rail.
    A2. Assign person designated under Sec. 213.7 to make visual 
inspection. After a visual inspection, that person may authorize 
operation to continue without continuous visual

[[Page 120]]

supervision at a maximum of 10 m.p.h. for up to 24 hours prior to 
another such visual inspection or replacement or repair of the rail.
    B. Limit operating speed over defective rail to that as authorized 
by a person designated under Sec. 213.7(a), who has at least one year 
of supervisory experience in railroad track maintenance. The operating 
speed cannot be over 30 m.p.h. or the maximum allowable speed under 
Sec. 213.9 for the class of track concerned, whichever is lower.
    C. Apply joint bars bolted only through the outermost holes to 
defect within 20 days after it is determined to continue the track in 
use. In the case of Classes 3 through 5 track, limit operating speed 
over defective rail to 30 m.p.h. until joint bars are applied; 
thereafter, limit speed to 50 m.p.h. or the maximum allowable speed 
under Sec. 213.9 for the class of track concerned, whichever is lower. 
When a search for internal rail defects is conducted under Sec. 
213.237, and defects are discovered in Classes 3 through 5 which require 
remedial action C, the operating speed shall be limited to 50 m.p.h., or 
the maximum allowable speed under Sec. 213.9 for the class of track 
concerned, whichever is lower, for a period not to exceed 4 days. If the 
defective rail has not been removed from the track or a permanent repair 
made within 4 days of the discovery, limit operating speed over the 
defective rail to 30 m.p.h. until joint bars are applied; thereafter, 
limit speed to 50 m.p.h. or the maximum allowable speed under Sec. 
213.9 for the class of track concerned, whichever is lower.
    D. Apply joint bars bolted only through the outermost holes to 
defect within 10 days after it is determined to continue the track in 
use. In the case of Classes 3 through 5 track, limit operating speed 
over the defective rail to 30 m.p.h. or less as authorized by a person 
designated under Sec. 213.7(a), who has at least one year of 
supervisory experience in railroad track maintenance, until joint bars 
are applied; thereafter, limit speed to 50 m.p.h. or the maximum 
allowable speed under Sec. 213.9 for the class of track concerned, 
whichever is lower.
    E. Apply joint bars to defect and bolt in accordance with Sec. 
213.121(d) and (e).
    F. Inspect rail 90 days after it is determined to continue the track 
in use.
    G. Inspect rail 30 days after it is determined to continue the track 
in use.
    H. Limit operating speed over defective rail to 50 m.p.h. or the 
maximum allowable speed under Sec. 213.9 for the class of track 
concerned, whichever is lower.
    I. Limit operating speed over defective rail to 30 m.p.h. or the 
maximum allowable speed under Sec. 213.9 for the class of track 
concerned, whichever is lower.

    (b) As used in this section--
    (1) Transverse fissure means a progressive crosswise fracture 
starting from a crystalline center or nucleus inside the head from which 
it spreads outward as a smooth, bright, or dark, round or oval surface 
substantially at a right angle to the length of the rail. The 
distinguishing features of a transverse fissure from other types of 
fractures or defects are the crystalline center or nucleus and the 
nearly smooth surface of the development which surrounds it.
    (2) Compound fissure means a progressive fracture originating in a 
horizontal split head which turns up or down in the head of the rail as 
a smooth, bright, or dark surface progressing until substantially at a 
right angle to the length of the rail. Compound fissures require 
examination of both faces of the fracture to locate the horizontal split 
head from which they originate.
    (3) Horizontal split head means a horizontal progressive defect 
originating inside of the rail head, usually one-quarter inch or more 
below the running surface and progressing horizontally in all 
directions, and generally accompanied by a flat spot on the running 
surface. The defect appears as a crack lengthwise of the rail when it 
reaches the side of the rail head.
    (4) Vertical split head means a vertical split through or near the 
middle of the head, and extending into or through it. A crack or rust 
streak may show under the head close to the web or pieces may be split 
off the side of the head.
    (5) Split web means a lengthwise crack along the side of the web and 
extending into or through it.
    (6) Piped rail means a vertical split in a rail, usually in the web, 
due to failure of the shrinkage cavity in the ingot to unite in rolling.
    (7) Broken base means any break in the base of the rail.
    (8) Detail fracture means a progressive fracture originating at or 
near the surface of the rail head. These fractures should not be 
confused with transverse fissures, compound fissures, or other defects 
which have internal origins. Detail fractures may arise from shelly 
spots, head checks, or flaking.
    (9) Engine burn fracture means a progressive fracture originating in 
spots where driving wheels have slipped on top of the rail head. In 
developing downward they frequently resemble the

[[Page 121]]

compound or even transverse fissures with which they should not be 
confused or classified.
    (10) Ordinary break means a partial or complete break in which there 
is no sign of a fissure, and in which none of the other defects 
described in this paragraph (b) are found.
    (11) Damaged rail means any rail broken or injured by wrecks, 
broken, flat, or unbalanced wheels, slipping, or similar causes.
    (12) Flattened rail means a short length of rail, not at a joint, 
which has flattened out across the width of the rail head to a depth of 
\3/8\ inch or more below the rest of the rail. Flattened rail 
occurrences have no repetitive regularity and thus do not include 
corrugations, and have no apparent localized cause such as a weld or 
engine burn. Their individual length is relatively short, as compared to 
a condition such as head flow on the low rail of curves.
    (13) Bolt hole crack means a crack across the web, originating from 
a bolt hole, and progressing on a path either inclined upward toward the 
rail head or inclined downward toward the base. Fully developed bolt 
hole cracks may continue horizontally along the head/web or base/web 
fillet, or they may progress into and through the head or base to 
separate a piece of the rail end from the rail. Multiple cracks 
occurring in one rail end are considered to be a single defect. However, 
bolt hole cracks occurring in adjacent rail ends within the same joint 
must be reported as separate defects.
    (14) Defective weld means a field or plant weld containing any 
discontinuities or pockets, exceeding 5 percent of the rail head area 
individually or 10 percent in the aggregate, oriented in or near the 
transverse plane, due to incomplete penetration of the weld metal 
between the rail ends, lack of fusion between weld and rail end metal, 
entrainment of slag or sand, under-bead or other shrinkage cracking, or 
fatigue cracking. Weld defects may originate in the rail head, web, or 
base, and in some cases, cracks may progress from the defect into either 
or both adjoining rail ends.
    (15) Head and web separation means a progressive fracture, 
longitudinally separating the head from the web of the rail at the head 
fillet area.

Sec. 213.119  Continuous welded rail (CWR); general.

    Each track owner with track constructed of CWR shall have in effect 
and comply with a plan that contains written procedures which address: 
the installation, adjustment, maintenance, and inspection of CWR; 
inspection of CWR joints; and a training program for the application of 
those procedures. The plan shall be submitted to the Federal Railroad 
Administration. FRA reviews each plan for compliance with the 
following--
    (a) Procedures for the installation and adjustment of CWR which 
include--
    (1) Designation of a desired rail installation temperature range for 
the geographic area in which the CWR is located; and
    (2) De-stressing procedures/methods which address proper attainment 
of the desired rail installation temperature range when adjusting CWR.

[[Page 122]]

    (b) Rail anchoring or fastening requirements that will provide 
sufficient restraint to limit longitudinal rail and crosstie movement to 
the extent practical, and specifically addressing CWR rail anchoring or 
fastening patterns on bridges, bridge approaches, and at other locations 
where possible longitudinal rail and crosstie movement associated with 
normally expected train-induced forces, is restricted.
    (c) Procedures which specifically address maintaining a desired rail 
installation temperature range when cutting CWR including rail repairs, 
in-track welding, and in conjunction with adjustments made in the area 
of tight track, a track buckle, or a pull-apart. Rail repair practices 
shall take into consideration existing rail temperature so that--
    (1) When rail is removed, the length installed shall be determined 
by taking into consideration the existing rail temperature and the 
desired rail installation temperature range; and
    (2) Under no circumstances should rail be added when the rail 
temperature is below that designated by paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, without provisions for later adjustment.
    (d) Procedures which address the monitoring of CWR in curved track 
for inward shifts of alinement toward the center of the curve as a 
result of disturbed track.
    (e) Procedures which control train speed on CWR track when--
    (1) Maintenance work, track rehabilitation, track construction, or 
any other event occurs which disturbs the roadbed or ballast section and 
reduces the lateral or longitudinal resistance of the track; and
    (2) In formulating the procedures under this paragraph (e), the 
track owner shall--
    (i) Determine the speed required, and the duration and subsequent 
removal of any speed restriction based on the restoration of the 
ballast, along with sufficient ballast re-consolidation to stabilize the 
track to a level that can accommodate expected train-induced forces. 
Ballast re-consolidation can be achieved through either the passage of 
train tonnage or mechanical stabilization procedures, or both; and
    (ii) Take into consideration the type of crossties used.
    (f) Procedures which prescribe when physical track inspections are 
to be performed to detect buckling prone conditions in CWR track. At a 
minimum, these procedures shall address inspecting track to identify--
    (1) Locations where tight or kinky rail conditions are likely to 
occur;
    (2) Locations where track work of the nature described in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section have recently been performed; and
    (3) In formulating the procedures under this paragraph (f), the 
track owner shall--
    (i) Specify the timing of the inspection; and
    (ii) Specify the appropriate remedial actions to be taken when 
buckling prone conditions are found.
    (g) Procedures which prescribe the scheduling and conduct of 
inspections to detect cracks and other indications of potential failures 
in CWR joints. On and after January 1, 2007, in formulating the 
procedures under this paragraph, the track owner shall--
    (1) Address the inspection of joints and the track structure at 
joints, including, at a minimum, periodic on-foot inspections;
    (2) Identify joint bars with visible or otherwise detectable cracks 
and conduct remedial action pursuant to Sec. 213.121;
    (3) Specify the conditions of actual or potential joint failure for 
which personnel must inspect, including, at a minimum, the following 
items:
    (i) Loose, bent, or missing joint bolts;
    (ii) Rail end batter or mismatch that contributes to instability of 
the joint; and
    (iii) Evidence of excessive longitudinal rail movement in or near 
the joint, including, but not limited to; wide rail gap, defective joint 
bolts, disturbed ballast, surface deviations, gap between tie plates and 
rail, or displaced rail anchors;
    (4) Specify the procedures for the inspection of CWR joints that are 
imbedded in highway-rail crossings or in other structures that prevent a 
complete inspection of the joint, including procedures for the removal 
from the

[[Page 123]]

joint of loose material or other temporary material;
    (5) Specify the appropriate corrective actions to be taken when 
personnel find conditions of actual or potential joint failure, 
including on-foot follow-up inspections to monitor conditions of 
potential joint failure in any period prior to completion of repairs.
    (6) Specify the timing of periodic inspections, which shall be based 
on the configuration and condition of the joint:
    (i) Except as provided in paragraphs (g)(6)(ii) through (iv), track 
owners must specify that all CWR joints are inspected, at a minimum, in 
accordance with the intervals identified in the following table--

\1\ Where a track owner operates both freight and passenger trains over a given segment of track, and there are
  two different possible inspection interval requirements, the more frequent inspection interval applies.
\2\ When extreme weather conditions prevent a track owner from conducting an inspection of a particular
  territory within the required interval, the track owner may extend the interval by up to 30 calendar days from
  the last day that the extreme weather condition prevented the required inspection.

    (ii) Consistent with any limitations applied by the track owner, a 
passenger train conducting an unscheduled detour operation may proceed 
over track not normally used for passenger operations at a speed not to 
exceed the maximum authorized speed otherwise allowed, even though CWR 
joints have not been inspected in accordance with the frequency 
identified in paragraph (g)(6)(i), provided that:
    (A) All CWR joints have been inspected consistent with requirements 
for freight service; and
    (B) The unscheduled detour operation lasts no more than 14 
consecutive calendar days. In order to continue operations beyond the 
14-day period, the track owner must inspect the CWR joints in accordance 
with the requirements of paragraph (g)(6)(i).
    (iii) Tourist, scenic, historic, or excursion operations, if limited 
to the maximum authorized speed for passenger trains over the next lower 
class of track, need not be considered in determining the frequency of 
inspections under paragraph (g)(6)(i).
    (iv) All CWR joints that are located in switches, turnouts, track 
crossings, lift rail assemblies or other transition devices on moveable 
bridges must be inspected on foot at least monthly, consistent with the 
requirements in Sec. 213.235; and all records of those inspections must 
be kept in accordance with the requirements in Sec. 213.241. A track 
owner may include in its Sec. 213.235 inspections, in lieu of the joint 
inspections required by paragraph (g)(6)(i), CWR joints that are located 
in track structure that is adjacent to switches and turnouts, provided 
that the track owner precisely defines the parameters of that 
arrangement in the CWR plans.
    (7) Specify the recordkeeping requirements related to joint bars in 
CWR, including the following:

[[Page 124]]

    (i) The track owner shall keep a record of each periodic and follow-
up inspection required to be performed by the track owner's CWR plan, 
except for those inspections conducted pursuant to Sec. 213.235 for 
which track owners must maintain records pursuant to Sec. 213.241. The 
record shall be prepared on the day the inspection is made and signed by 
the person making the inspection. The record shall include, at a 
minimum, the following items: the boundaries of the territory inspected; 
the nature and location of any deviations at the joint from the 
requirements of this Part or of the track owner's CWR plan, with the 
location identified with sufficient precision that personnel could 
return to the joint and identify it without ambiguity; the date of the 
inspection; the remedial action, corrective action, or both, that has 
been taken or will be taken; and the name or identification number of 
the person who made the inspection.
    (ii) The track owner shall generate a Fracture Report for every 
cracked or broken CWR joint bar that the track owner discovers during 
the course of an inspection conducted pursuant to Sec. Sec. 213.119(g), 
213.233, or 213.235 on track that is required under Sec. 
213.119(g)(6)(i) to be inspected.
    (A) The Fracture Report shall be prepared on the day the cracked or 
broken joint bar is discovered. The record shall include, at a minimum: 
the railroad name; the location of the joint bar as identified by 
milepost and subdivision; the class of track; annual million gross tons 
for the previous calendar year; the date of discovery of the crack or 
break; the rail section; the type of bar (standard, insulated, or 
compromise); the number of holes in the joint bar; a general description 
of the location of the crack or break in bar; the visible length of the 
crack in inches; the gap measurement between rail ends; the amount and 
length of rail end batter or ramp on each rail end; the amount of tread 
mismatch; the vertical movement of joint; and in curves or spirals, the 
amount of gage mismatch and the lateral movement of the joint.
    (B) The track owner shall submit the information contained in the 
Fracture Reports to the FRA Associate Administrator for Safety 
(Associate Administrator) twice annually, by July 31 for the preceding 
six-month period from January 1 through June 30 and by January 31 for 
the preceding six-month period from July 1 through December 31.
    (C) After February 1, 2010, any track owner may petition FRA to 
conduct a technical conference to review the Fracture Report data 
submitted through December of 2009 and assess whether there is a 
continued need for the collection of Fracture Report data. The track 
owner shall submit a written request to the Associate Administrator, 
requesting the technical conference and explaining the reasons for 
proposing to discontinue the collection of the data.
    (8) In lieu of the requirements for the inspection of rail joints 
contained in paragraphs (g)(1) through (7) of this section, a track 
owner may seek approval from FRA to use alternate procedures.
    (i) The track owner shall submit the proposed alternate procedures 
and a supporting statement of justification to the Associate 
Administrator for Safety (Associate Administrator).
    (ii) If the Associate Administrator finds that the proposed 
alternate procedures provide an equivalent or higher level of safety 
than the requirements in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(7) of this 
section, the Associate Administrator will approve the alternate 
procedures by notifying the track owner in writing. The Associate 
Administrator will specify in the written notification the date on which 
the procedures will become effective, and after that date, the track 
owner shall comply with the procedures. If the Associate Administrator 
determines that the alternate procedures do not provide an equivalent 
level of safety, the Associate Administrator will disapprove the 
alternate procedures in writing, and the track owner shall continue to 
comply with the requirements in paragraphs (g)(1) through (7) of this 
section.
    (iii) While a determination is pending with the Associate 
Administrator on a request submitted pursuant to paragraph (g)(8) of 
this section, the track owner shall continue to comply with the 
requirements contained in paragraphs (g)(1) through (7) of this section.

[[Page 125]]

    (h) The track owner shall have in effect a comprehensive training 
program for the application of these written CWR procedures, with 
provisions for periodic re-training, for those individuals designated 
under Sec. 213.7 as qualified to supervise the installation, 
adjustment, and maintenance of CWR track and to perform inspections of 
CWR track.
    (i) The track owner shall prescribe and comply with recordkeeping 
requirements necessary to provide an adequate history of track 
constructed with CWR. At a minimum, these records must include:
    (1) Rail temperature, location and date of CWR installations. This 
record shall be retained for at least one year;
    (2) A record of any CWR installation or maintenance work that does 
not conform with the written procedures. Such record shall include the 
location of the rail and be maintained until the CWR is brought into 
conformance with such procedures;
    (3) Information on inspection of rail joints as specified in 
paragraph (g)(7) of this part.
    (j) As used in this section--
    Action Items mean the rail joint conditions that track owners 
identify in their CWR plans pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) which require 
the application of a corrective action.
    Adjusting/De-stressing means the procedure by which a rail's 
temperature is re-adjusted to the desired value. It typically consists 
of cutting the rail and removing rail anchoring devices, which provides 
for the necessary expansion and contraction, and then re-assembling the 
track.
    Buckling Incident means the formation of a lateral misalignment 
sufficient in magnitude to constitute a deviation from the Class 1 
requirements specified in Sec. 213.55. These normally occur when rail 
temperatures are relatively high and are caused by high longitudinal 
compressive forces.
    Continuous Welded Rail (CWR) means rail that has been welded 
together into lengths exceeding 400 feet.
    Corrective Actions mean those actions which track owners specify in 
their CWR plans to address conditions of actual or potential joint 
failure, including, as applicable, repair, restrictions on operations, 
and additional on-foot inspections.
    CWR Joint means (a) any joint directly connected to CWR, and (b) any 
joint(s) in a segment of rail between CWR strings that are less than 195 
feet apart, except joints located on jointed sections on bridges.
    Desired Rail Installation Temperature Range means the rail 
temperature range, within a specific geographical area, at which forces 
in CWR should not cause a buckling incident in extreme heat, or a pull-
apart during extreme cold weather.
    Disturbed Track means the disturbance of the roadbed or ballast 
section, as a result of track maintenance or any other event, which 
reduces the lateral or longitudinal resistance of the track, or both.
    Mechanical Stabilization means a type of procedure used to restore 
track resistance to disturbed track following certain maintenance 
operations. This procedure may incorporate dynamic track stabilizers or 
ballast consolidators, which are units of work equipment that are used 
as a substitute for the stabilization action provided by the passage of 
tonnage trains.
    Rail Anchors means those devices which are attached to the rail and 
bear against the side of the crosstie to control longitudinal rail 
movement. Certain types of rail fasteners also act as rail anchors and 
control longitudinal rail movement by exerting a downward clamping force 
on the upper surface of the rail base.
    Rail Temperature means the temperature of the rail, measured with a 
rail thermometer.
    Remedial Actions mean those actions which track owners are required 
to take as a result of requirements of this part to address a non-
compliant condition.
    Tight/Kinky Rail means CWR which exhibits minute alignment 
irregularities which indicate that the rail is in a considerable amount 
of compression.
    Tourist, Scenic, Historic, or Excursion Operations mean railroad 
operations that carry passengers with the conveyance of the passengers 
to a particular destination not being the principal purpose.

[[Page 126]]

    Train-induced Forces means the vertical, longitudinal, and lateral 
dynamic forces which are generated during train movement and which can 
contribute to the buckling potential of the rail.
    Track Lateral Resistance means the resistance provided by the rail/
crosstie structure against lateral displacement.
    Track Longitudinal Resistance means the resistance provided by the 
rail anchors/rail fasteners and the ballast section to the rail/crosstie 
structure against longitudinal displacement.
    Unscheduled Detour Operation means a short-term, unscheduled 
operation where a track owner has no more than 14 calendar days' notice 
that the operation is going to occur.

    (a) Each rail joint, insulated joint, and compromise joint shall be 
of a structurally sound design and dimensions for the rail on which it 
is applied.
    (b) If a joint bar on Classes 3 through 5 track is cracked, broken, 
or because of wear allows excessive vertical movement of either rail 
when all bolts are tight, it shall be replaced.
    (c) If a joint bar is cracked or broken between the middle two bolt 
holes it shall be replaced.
    (d) In the case of conventional jointed track, each rail shall be 
bolted with at least two bolts at each joint in Classes 2 through 5 
track, and with at least one bolt in Class 1 track.
    (e) In the case of continuous welded rail track, each rail shall be 
bolted with at least two bolts at each joint.
    (f) Each joint bar shall be held in position by track bolts 
tightened to allow the joint bar to firmly support the abutting rail 
ends and to allow longitudinal movement of the rail in the joint to 
accommodate expansion and contraction due to temperature variations. 
When no-slip, joint-to-rail contact exists by design, the requirements 
of this paragraph do not apply. Those locations when over 400 feet in 
length, are considered to be continuous welded rail track and shall meet 
all the requirements for continuous welded rail track prescribed in this 
part.

through 5 track.


<R05>
Sec. 213.122  Torch cut rail.

    (a) Except as a temporary repair in emergency situations no rail 
having a torch cut end shall be used in Classes 3 through 5 track. When 
a rail end is torch cut in emergency situations, train speed over that 
rail end shall not exceed the maximum allowable for Class 2 track. For 
existing torch cut rail ends in Classes 3 through 5 track the following 
shall apply--
    (1) Within one year of September 21, 1998, all torch cut rail ends 
in Class 5 track shall be removed;
    (2) Within two years of September 21, 1998, all torch cut rail ends 
in Class 4 track shall be removed; and
    (3) Within one year of September 21, 1998, all torch cut rail ends 
in Class 3 track over which regularly scheduled passenger trains 
operate, shall be inventoried by the track owner.
    (b) Following the expiration of the time limits specified in 
paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, any torch cut rail end 
not removed from Classes 4 and 5 track, or any torch cut rail end not 
inventoried in Class 3 track over which regularly scheduled passenger 
trains operate, shall be removed within 30 days of discovery. Train 
speed over that rail end shall not exceed the maximum allowable for 
Class 2 track until removed.


<R05>
Sec. 213.123  Tie plates.

    (a) In Classes 3 through 5 track where timber crossties are in use 
there shall be tie plates under the running rails on at least eight of 
any 10 consecutive ties.

each switch, frog, and guard rail shall be kept free of obstructions 
that may interfere with the passage of wheels.
    (b) Classes 3 through 5 track shall be equipped with rail anchoring 
through and on each side of track crossings and turnouts, to restrain 
rail movement affecting the position of switch points and frogs. For 
Class 3 track, this paragraph (b) is applicable September 21, 1999.)
    (c) Each flangeway at turnouts and track crossings shall be at least 
1\1/2\ inches wide.


<R05>
Sec. 213.135  Switches.

    (a) Each stock rail must be securely seated in switch plates, but 
care shall be used to avoid canting the rail by overtightening the rail 
braces.
    (b) Each switch point shall fit its stock rail properly, with the 
switch stand in either of its closed positions to allow wheels to pass 
the switch point. Lateral and vertical movement of a stock rail in the 
switch plates or of a switch plate on a tie shall not adversely affect 
the fit of the switch point to the stock rail. Broken or cracked switch 
point rails will be subject to the requirements of Sec. 213.113, except 
that where remedial actions C, D, or E require the use of joint bars, 
and joint bars cannot be placed due to the physical configuration of the 
switch, remedial action B will govern, taking into account any added 
safety provided by the presence of reinforcing bars on the switch 
points.
    (c) Each switch shall be maintained so that the outer edge of the 
wheel tread cannot contact the gage side of the stock rail.
    (d) The heel of each switch rail shall be secure and the bolts in 
each heel shall be kept tight.
    (e) Each switch stand and connecting rod shall be securely fastened 
and operable without excessive lost motion.

Sec. 213.231  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes requirements for the frequency and manner of 
inspecting track to detect deviations from the standards prescribed in 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 213.233  Track inspections.

    (a) All track shall be inspected in accordance with the schedule 
prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section by a person designated under 
Sec. 213.7.
    (b) Each inspection shall be made on foot or by riding over the 
track in a vehicle at a speed that allows the person making the 
inspection to visually inspect the track structure for compliance with 
this part. However, mechanical, electrical, and other track inspection 
devices may be used to supplement visual inspection. If a vehicle is 
used for visual inspection, the speed of the vehicle may not be more 
than 5 miles per hour when passing over track crossings and turnouts, 
otherwise, the inspection vehicle speed shall be at the sole discretion 
of the inspector, based on track conditions and inspection requirements. 
When riding over the track in a vehicle, the inspection will be subject 
to the following conditions--
    (1) One inspector in a vehicle may inspect up to two tracks at one 
time provided that the inspector's visibility remains unobstructed by 
any cause and that the second track is not centered more than 30 feet 
from the track upon which the inspector is riding;
    (2) Two inspectors in one vehicle may inspect up to four tracks at a 
time provided that the inspectors' visibility remains unobstructed by 
any cause and that each track being inspected is centered within 39 feet 
from the track upon which the inspectors are riding;
    (3) Each main track is actually traversed by the vehicle or 
inspected on foot at least once every two weeks, and each siding is 
actually traversed by the vehicle or inspected on foot at least once 
every month. On high density commuter railroad lines where track time 
does not permit an on track vehicle inspection, and where track centers 
are 15 foot or less, the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3) will not 
apply; and
    (4) Track inspection records shall indicate which track(s) are 
traversed by the vehicle or inspected on foot as outlined in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section.
    (c) Each track inspection shall be made in accordance with the 
following schedule--

mgt or once a year, whichever interval is longer. (This paragraph (a) is 
applicable January 1, 1999.
    (b) Inspection equipment shall be capable of detecting defects 
between joint bars, in the area enclosed by joint bars.
    (c) Each defective rail shall be marked with a highly visible 
marking on both sides of the web and base.
    (d) If the person assigned to operate the rail defect detection 
equipment being used determines that, due to rail surface conditions, a 
valid search for internal defects could not be made over a particular 
length of track, the test on that particular length of track cannot be 
considered as a search for internal defects under paragraph (a) of this 
section. (This paragraph (d) is not retroactive to tests performed prior 
to September 21, 1998.
    (e) If a valid search for internal defects cannot be conducted for 
reasons described in paragraph (d) of this section, the track owner 
shall, before the expiration of time or tonnage limits--
    (1) Conduct a valid search for internal defects;
    (2) Reduce operating speed to a maximum of 25 miles per hour until 
such time as a valid search for internal defects can be made; or
    (3) Remove the rail from service.


<R05>
Sec. 213.239  Special inspections.

    In the event of fire, flood, severe storm, or other occurrence which 
might have damaged track structure, a special inspection shall be made 
of the track involved as soon as possible after the occurrence and, if 
possible, before the operation of any train over that track.


<R05>
Sec. 213.241  Inspection records.

    (a) Each owner of track to which this part applies shall keep a 
record of each inspection required to be performed on that track under 
this subpart.
    (b) Each record of an inspection under Sec. Sec. 213.4, 213.119, 
213.233, and 213.235 shall be prepared on the day the inspection is made 
and signed by the person making the inspection. Records shall specify 
the track inspected, date of inspection, location and nature of any 
deviation from the requirements of this part, and the remedial action 
taken by the person making the inspection. The owner shall designate the 
location(s) where each original record shall be maintained for at least 
one year after the inspection covered by the record. The owner shall 
also designate one location, within 100 miles of each state in which 
they conduct operations, where copies of records which apply to those 
operations are either maintained or can be viewed following 10 days 
notice by the Federal Railroad Administration.
    (c) Rail inspection records shall specify the date of inspection, 
the location and nature of any internal defects found, the remedial 
action taken and the date thereof, and the location of any intervals of 
track not tested per Sec. 213.237(d). The owner shall retain a rail 
inspection record for at least two years after the inspection and for 
one year after remedial action is taken.

[[Page 131]]

    (d) Each owner required to keep inspection records under this 
section shall make those records available for inspection and copying by 
the Federal Railroad Administration.
    (e) For purposes of compliance with the requirements of this 
section, an owner of track may maintain and transfer records through 
electronic transmission, storage, and retrieval provided that--
    (1) The electronic system be designed so that the integrity of each 
record is maintained through appropriate levels of security such as 
recognition of an electronic signature, or other means, which uniquely

Sec. 213.329  Curves, elevation and speed limitations.

    (a) The maximum crosslevel on the outside rail of a curve may not be 
more than 7 inches. The outside rail of a curve may not be more than \1/
2\ inch lower than the inside rail.
    (b) (1) The maximum allowable operating speed for each curve is 
determined by the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22JN98.009

Where--

V<INF>max</INF> = Maximum allowable operating speed (miles per hour).

[[Page 136]]

E<INF>a</INF> = Actual elevation of the outside rail (inches) \4\.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Actual elevation for each 155 foot track segment in the body of 
the curve is determined by averaging the elevation for 10 points through 
the segment at 15.5 foot spacing. If the curve length is less than 155 
feet, average the points through the full length of the body of the 
curve. If E<INF>u</INF> exceeds 4 inches, the Vmax formula applies to 
the spirals on both ends of the curve.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

D = Degree of curvature (degrees) \5\.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Degree of curvature is determined by averaging the degree of 
curvature over the same track segment as the elevation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3 = 3 inches of unbalance.

    (2) Appendix A includes tables showing maximum allowable operating 
speeds computed in accordance with this formula for various elevations 
and degrees of curvature for track speeds greater than 90 m.p.h.
    (c) For rolling stock meeting the requirements specified in 
paragraph (d) of this section, the maximum operating speed for each 
curve may be determined by the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22JN98.008

Where--

V<INF>max</INF> = Maximum allowable operating speed (miles per hour).
E<INF>a</INF> = Actual elevation of the outside rail (inches) \4\.
D = Degree of curvature (degrees) \5\.
E<INF>u</INF> = Unbalanced elevation (inches).

    (d) Qualified equipment may be operated at curving speeds determined 
by the formula in paragraph (c) of this section, provided each specific 
class of equipment is approved for operation by the Federal Railroad 
Administration and the railroad demonstrates that--
    (1) When positioned on a track with uniform superelevation,

in the following table of vehicle/track interaction safety limits are 
exceeded, speeds will be reduced until these safety limits are not 
exceeded.

[[Page 139]]

    (l) For track Classes 8 and 9, an instrumented car having dynamic 
response characteristics that are representative of other equipment 
assigned to service shall be operated over the track at the revenue 
speed profile annually with not less than 180 days between inspections. 
The instrumented car shall be equipped with functioning instrumented 
wheelsets to measure wheel/rail forces. If the wheel/rail force limits

Sec. 213.337  Defective rails.

    (a) When an owner of track to which this part applies learns, 
through inspection or otherwise, that a rail in that track contains any 
of the defects listed in the following table, a person designated under 
Sec. 213.305 shall determine whether or not the track may continue in 
use. If the person determines that the track may continue in use, 
operation over the defective rail is not permitted until--
    (1) The rail is replaced; or
    (2) The remedial action prescribed in the table is initiated--

[[Page 142]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN28SE98.059

    Notes: A. Assign person designated under Sec. 213.305 to visually 
supervise each operation over defective rail.
    A2. Assign person designated under Sec. 213.305 to make visual 
inspection. That person may authorize operation to continue without 
visual supervision at a maximum of 10 m.p.h.

[[Page 143]]

for up to 24 hours prior to another such visual inspection or 
replacement or repair of the rail.
    B. Limit operating speed over defective rail to that as authorized 
by a person designated under Sec. 213.305(a)(1)(i) or (ii). The 
operating speed cannot be over 30 m.p.h.
    C. Apply joint bars bolted only through the outermost holes to 
defect within 20 days after it is determined to continue the track in 
use. Limit operating speed over defective rail to 30 m.p.h. until joint 
bars are applied; thereafter, limit speed to 50 m.p.h. When a search for 
internal rail defects is conducted under Sec. 213.339 and defects are 
discovered which require remedial action C, the operating speed shall be 
limited to 50 m.p.h., for a period not to exceed 4 days. If the 
defective rail has not been removed from the track or a permanent repair 
made within 4 days of the discovery, limit operating speed over the 
defective rail to 30 m.p.h. until joint bars are applied; thereafter, 
limit speed to 50 m.p.h.
    D. Apply joint bars bolted only through the outermost holes to 
defect within 10 days after it is determined to continue the track in 
use. Limit operating speed over the defective rail to 30 m.p.h. or less 
as authorized by a person designated under Sec. 213.305(a)(1)(i) or 
(ii) until joint bars are applied; thereafter, limit speed to 50 m.p.h.

    I. Limit operating speed over defective rail to 30 m.p.h.

    (b) As used in this section--
    (1) Transverse fissure means a progressive crosswise fracture 
starting from a crystalline center or nucleus inside the head from which 
it spreads outward as a smooth, bright, or dark, round or oval surface 
substantially at a right angle to the length of the rail. The 
distinguishing features of a transverse fissure from other types of 
fractures or defects are the crystalline center or nucleus and the 
nearly smooth surface of the development which surrounds it.
    (2) Compound fissure means a progressive fracture originating in a 
horizontal split head which turns up or down in the head of the rail as 
a smooth, bright, or dark surface progressing until substantially at a 
right angle to the length of the rail. Compound fissures require 
examination of both faces of the fracture to locate the horizontal split 
head from which they originate.
    (3) Horizontal split head means a horizontal progressive defect 
originating inside of the rail head, usually one-quarter inch or more 
below the running surface and progressing horizontally in all 
directions, and generally accompanied by a flat spot on the running 
surface. The defect appears as a crack lengthwise of the rail when it 
reaches the side of the rail head.
    (4) Vertical split head means a vertical split through or near the 
middle of the head, and extending into or through it. A crack or rust 
streak may show under the head close to the web or pieces may be split 
off the side of the head.
    (5) Split web means a lengthwise crack along the side of the web and 
extending into or through it.
    (6) Piped rail means a vertical split in a rail, usually in the web, 
due to failure of the shrinkage cavity in the ingot to unite in rolling.
    (7) Broken base means any break in the base of the rail.
    (8) Detail fracture means a progressive fracture originating at or 
near the surface of the rail head. These fractures should not be 
confused with transverse fissures, compound fissures, or other defects 
which have internal origins. Detail fractures may arise from shelly 
spots, head checks, or flaking.
    (9) Engine burn fracture means a progressive fracture originating in 
spots where driving wheels have slipped on top of the rail head. In 
developing downward they frequently resemble the compound or even 
transverse fissures with which they should not be confused or 
classified.
    (10) Ordinary break means a partial or complete break in which there 
is no sign of a fissure, and in which none of the other defects 
described in this paragraph (b) are found.
    (11) Damaged rail means any rail broken or injured by wrecks, 
broken, flat, or unbalanced wheels, slipping, or similar causes.
    (12) Flattened rail means a short length of rail, not a joint, which 
has flattened out across the width of the rail head to a depth of \3/8\ 
inch or more below the rest of the rail. Flattened

[[Page 144]]

rail occurrences have no repetitive regularity and thus do not include 
corrugations, and have no apparent localized cause such as a weld or 
engine burn. Their individual length is relatively short, as compared to 
a condition such as head flow on the low rail of curves.
    (13) Bolt hole crack means a crack across the web, originating from 
a bolt hole, and progressing on a path either inclined upward toward the 
rail head or inclined downward toward the base. Fully developed bolt 
hole cracks may continue horizontally along the head/web or base/web 
fillet, or they may progress into and through the head or base to 
separate a piece of the rail end from the rail. Multiple cracks 
occurring in one rail end are considered to be a single defect. However, 
bolt hole cracks occurring in adjacent rail ends within the same joint 
shall be reported as separate defects.
    (14) Defective weld means a field or plant weld containing any 
discontinuities or pockets, exceeding 5 percent of the rail head area 
individually or 10 percent in the aggregate, oriented in or near the 
transverse plane, due to incomplete penetration of the weld metal 
between the rail ends, lack of fusion between weld and rail end metal, 
entrainment of slag or sand, under-bead or other shrinkage cracking, or 
fatigue cracking. Weld defects may originate in the rail head, web, or 
base, and in some cases, cracks may progress from the defect into either 
or both adjoining rail ends.
    (15) Head and web separation means a progressive fracture, 
longitudinally separating the head from the web of the rail at the head 
fillet area.

    (d) If the person assigned to operate the rail defect detection 
equipment being used determines that, due to rail surface conditions, a 
valid search for internal defects could not be made over a particular 
length of track, the test on that particular length of track cannot be 
considered as a search for internal defects under Sec. 213.337(a).
    (e) If a valid search for internal defects cannot be conducted for 
reasons described in paragraph (d) of this section, the track owner 
shall, before the expiration of time limits--

constitute compliance with the requirements for initial inspection of 
new rail and plant welds, or of new plant welds made in used rail; and
    (d) Inspection of field welds--An initial inspection of field welds, 
either those joining the ends of CWR strings or those made for isolated 
repairs, shall be conducted not less than one day and not more than 30 
days after the welds have been made. The initial inspection may be 
conducted by means of portable test equipment. The track owner shall 
retain a record of such inspections until the welds receive their first 
scheduled inspection under Sec. 213.339.
    (e) Each defective rail found during inspections conducted under 
paragraph (a) or (d) of this section shall be marked with highly visible 
markings on both sides of the web and base and the remedial action as 
appropriate under Sec. 213.337 will apply.


<R05>
Sec. 213.343  Continuous welded rail (CWR).

    Each track owner with track constructed of CWR shall have in effect 
and comply with written procedures which address the installation, 
adjustment, maintenance and inspection of CWR, and a training program 
for the application of those procedures, which shall be submitted to the 
Federal Railroad Administration by March 21, 1999. FRA reviews each plan 
for compliance with the following--
    (a) Procedures for the installation and adjustment of CWR which 
include--
    (1) Designation of a desired rail installation temperature range for 
the geographic area in which the CWR is located; and
    (2) De-stressing procedures/methods which address proper attainment 
of the desired rail installation temperature range when adjusting CWR.
    (b) Rail anchoring or fastening requirements that will provide 
sufficient restraint to limit longitudinal rail and crosstie movement to 
the extent practical, and specifically addressing CWR rail anchoring or 
fastening patterns on bridges, bridge approaches, and at other locations 
where possible longitudinal rail and crosstie movement associated with 
normally expected train-induced forces, is restricted.
    (c) Procedures which specifically address maintaining a desired rail 
installation temperature range when cutting CWR including rail repairs, 
in-track welding, and in conjunction with adjustments made in the area 
of tight track, a track buckle, or a pull-apart. Rail repair practices 
shall take into consideration existing rail temperature so that--
    (1) When rail is removed, the length installed shall be determined 
by taking into consideration the existing rail temperature and the 
desired rail installation temperature range; and
    (2) Under no circumstances should rail be added when the rail 
temperature is below that designated by paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, without provisions for later adjustment.
    (d) Procedures which address the monitoring of CWR in curved track 
for inward shifts of alinement toward the center of the curve as a 
result of disturbed track.
    (e) Procedures which control train speed on CWR track when--
    (1) Maintenance work, track rehabilitation, track construction, or 
any other event occurs which disturbs the roadbed or ballast section and 
reduces the lateral and/or longitudinal resistance of the track; and
    (2) In formulating the procedures under this paragraph (e), the 
track owner shall--
    (i) Determine the speed required, and the duration and subsequent 
removal of any speed restriction based on the restoration of the 
ballast, along with sufficient ballast re-consolidation to stabilize the 
track to a level that can accommodate expected train-induced forces. 
Ballast re-consolidation can be achieved through either the passage of 
train tonnage or mechanical stabilization procedures, or both; and
    (ii) Take into consideration the type of crossties used.
    (f) Procedures which prescribe when physical track inspections are 
to be performed to detect buckling prone conditions in CWR track. At a 
minimum, these procedures shall address inspecting track to identify--
    (1) Locations where tight or kinky rail conditions are likely to 
occur;
    (2) Locations where track work of the nature described in paragraph 
(e)(1) of

[[Page 146]]

this section have recently been performed; and
    (3) In formulating the procedures under this paragraph (f), the 
track owner shall--
    (i) Specify the timing of the inspection; and
    (ii) Specify the appropriate remedial actions to be taken when 
buckling prone conditions are found.
    (g) The track owner shall have in effect a comprehensive training 
program for the application of these written CWR procedures, with 
provisions for periodic re-training, for those individuals designated 
under Sec. 213.305(c) of this part as qualified to supervise the 
installation, adjustment, and maintenance of CWR track and to perform 
inspections of CWR track.
    (h) The track owner shall prescribe recordkeeping requirements 
necessary to provide an adequate history of track constructed with CWR. 
At a minimum, these records shall include:
    (1) Rail temperature, location and date of CWR installations. This 
record shall be retained for at least one year; and
    (2) A record of any CWR installation or maintenance work that does 
not conform with the written procedures. Such record shall include the 
location of the rail and be maintained until the CWR is brought into 
conformance with such procedures.
    (i) As used in this section--
    (1) Adjusting/de-stressing means the procedure by which a rail's 
temperature is re-adjusted to the desired value. It typically consists 
of cutting the rail and removing rail anchoring devices, which provides 
for the necessary expansion and contraction, and then re-assembling the 
track.
    (2) Buckling incident means the formation of a lateral mis-alinement 
sufficient in magnitude to constitute a deviation of 5 inches measured 
with a 62-foot chord. These normally occur when rail temperatures are 
relatively high and are caused by high longitudinal compressive forces.
    (3) Continuous welded rail (CWR) means rail that has been welded 
together into lengths exceeding 400 feet.
    (4) Desired rail installation temperature range means the rail 
temperature range, within a specific geographical area, at which forces 
in CWR should not cause a buckling incident in extreme heat, or a pull-
apart during extreme cold weather.
    (5) Disturbed track means the disturbance of the roadbed or ballast 
section, as a result of track maintenance or any other event, which 
reduces the lateral or longitudinal resistance of the track, or both.
    (6) Mechanical stabilization means a type of procedure used to 
restore track resistance to disturbed track following certain 
maintenance operations. This procedure may incorporate dynamic track 
stabilizers or ballast consolidators, which are units of work equipment 
that are used as a substitute for the stabilization action provided by 
the passage of tonnage trains.
    (7) Rail anchors means those devices which are attached to the rail 
and bear against the side of the crosstie to control longitudinal rail 
movement. Certain types of rail fasteners also act as rail anchors and 
control longitudinal rail movement by exerting a downward clamping force 
on the upper surface of the rail base.
    (8) Rail temperature means the temperature of the rail, measured 
with a rail thermometer.
    (9) Tight/kinky rail means CWR which exhibits minute alinement 
irregularities which indicate that the rail is in a considerable amount 
of compression.
    (10) Train-induced forces means the vertical, longitudinal, and 
lateral dynamic forces which are generated during train movement and 
which can contribute to the buckling potential.
    (11) Track lateral resistance means the resistance provided to the 
rail/crosstie structure against lateral displacement.
    (12) Track longitudinal resistance means the resistance provided by 
the rail anchors/rail fasteners and the ballast section to the rail/
crosstie structure against longitudinal displacement.
    (j) Track owners shall revise their CWR plans to include provisions 
for the inspection of joint bars in accordance with Sec. Sec. 
213.119(g) and (i)(3).

Sec. 213.345  Vehicle qualification testing.

    (a) All rolling stock types which operate at Class 6 speeds and 
above shall be qualified for operation for their intended track classes 
in order to demonstrate that the vehicle dynamic response to track 
alinement and geometry variations are within acceptable limits to assure 
safe operation. Rolling stock operating in Class 6 within one year prior 
to the promulgation of this subpart shall be considered as being 
successfully qualified for Class 6 track and vehicles presently 
operating at Class 7 speeds by reason of conditional waivers shall be 
considered as qualified for Class 7.
    (b) The qualification testing shall ensure that, at any speed less 
than 10 m.p.h. above the proposed maximum operating speed, the equipment 
will not exceed the wheel/rail force safety limits and the truck lateral 
accelerations specified in Sec. 213.333, and the testing shall 
demonstrate the following:
    (1) The vertical acceleration, as measured by a vertical 
accelerometer mounted on the car floor, shall be limited to no greater 
than 0.55g single event, peak-to-peak.
    (2) The lateral acceleration, as measured by a lateral accelerometer 
mounted on the car floor, shall be limited to no greater than 0.3g 
single event, peak-to-peak; and
    (3) The combination of the lateral acceleration (L) and the vertical 
acceleration (V) within any period of two consecutive seconds as 
expressed by the square root of (V\2\ + L\2\) shall be limited to no 
greater than 0.604, where L may not exceed 0.3g and V may not exceed 
0.55g.
    (c) To obtain the test data necessary to support the analysis 
required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the track owner 
shall have a test plan which shall consider the operating practices and 
conditions, signal system, road crossings and trains on adjacent tracks 
during testing. The track owner shall establish a target maximum testing 
speed (at least 10 m.p.h. above the maximum proposed operating speed) 
and target test and operating conditions and conduct a test program 
sufficient to evaluate the operating limits of the track and equipment. 
The test program shall demonstrate vehicle dynamic response as speeds 
are incrementally increased from acceptable Class 6 limits to the target 
maximum test speeds. The test shall be suspended at that speed where any 
of the safety limits specified in paragraph (b) are exceeded.
    (d) At the end of the test, when maximum safe operating speed is 
known along with permissible levels of cant deficiency, an additional 
run shall be made with the subject equipment over the entire route 
proposed for revenue service at the speeds the railroad will request FRA 
to approve for such service and a second run again at 10 m.p.h. above 
this speed. A report of the test procedures and results shall be 
submitted to FRA upon the completions of the tests. The test report 
shall include the design flange angle of the equipment which shall be 
used for the determination of the lateral to vertical wheel load safety 
limit for the track/vehicle interaction safety measurements required per 
Sec. 213.333(l).
    (e) As part of the submittal required in paragraph (d) of the 
section, the operator shall include an analysis and description of the 
signal system and operating practices to govern operations in Classes 7 
and 8. This statement shall include a statement of sufficiency in these 
areas for the class of operation. Operation at speeds in excess of 150 
m.p.h. is authorized only in conjunction with a rule of particular 
applicability addressing other safety issues presented by the system.
    (f) Based on test results and submissions, FRA will approve a 
maximum train speed and value of cant deficiency for revenue service.

Sec. 213.347  Automotive or railroad crossings at grade.

    (a) There shall be no at-grade (level) highway crossings, public or 
private, or rail-to-rail crossings at-grade on Class 8 and 9 track.
    (b) If train operation is projected at Class 7 speed for a track 
segment that will include rail-highway grade crossings, the track owner 
shall submit for FRA's approval a complete description of the proposed 
warning/barrier system to address the protection of highway

[[Page 148]]

traffic and high speed trains. Trains shall not operate at Class 7 
speeds over any track segment having highway-rail grade crossings 
unless:
    (1) An FRA-approved warning/barrier system exists on that track 
segment; and
    (2) All elements of that warning/barrier system are functioning.

Sec. 213.351  Rail joints.

    (a) Each rail joint, insulated joint, and compromise joint shall be 
of a structurally sound design and dimensions for the rail on which it 
is applied.
    (b) If a joint bar is cracked, broken, or because of wear allows 
excessive vertical movement of either rail when all bolts are tight, it 
shall be replaced.
    (c) If a joint bar is cracked or broken between the middle two bolt 
holes it shall be replaced.
    (d) Each rail shall be bolted with at least two bolts at each joint.
    (e) Each joint bar shall be held in position by track bolts 
tightened to allow the joint bar to firmly support the abutting rail 
ends and to allow longitudinal movement of the rail in the joint to 
accommodate expansion and contraction due to temperature variations. 
When no-slip, joint-to-rail contact exists by design, the requirements 
of this section do not apply. Those locations, when over 400 feet long, 
are considered to be continuous welded rail track and shall meet all the 
requirements for continuous welded rail track prescribed in this 
subpart.
    (f) No rail shall have a bolt hole which is torch cut or burned.
    (g) No joint bar shall be reconfigured by torch cutting.


<R05>
Sec. 213.352  Torch cut rail.

    (a) Except as a temporary repair in emergency situations no rail 
having a torch cut end shall be used. When a rail end with a torch cut 
is used in emergency situations, train speed over that rail shall not 
exceed the maximum allowable for Class 2 track. All torch cut rail ends 
in Class 6 shall be removed within six months of September 21, 1998.
    (b) Following the expiration of the time limits specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section, any torch cut rail end not removed shall 
be removed within 30 days of discovery. Train speed over that rail shall 
not exceed the maximum allowable for Class 2 track until removed.

Sec. 213.353  Turnouts, crossovers, and lift rail assemblies or other 

transition devices on moveable bridges.

    (a) In turnouts and track crossings, the fastenings must be intact 
and maintained so as to keep the components securely in place. Also, 
each switch, frog, and guard rail shall be kept free of obstructions 
that may interfere with the passage of wheels. Use of rigid rail 
crossings at grade is limited per Sec. 213.347.
    (b) Track shall be equipped with rail anchoring through and on each 
side of track crossings and turnouts, to restrain rail movement 
affecting the position of switch points and frogs. Elastic fasteners 
designed to restrict longitudinal rail movement are considered rail 
anchoring.
    (c) Each flangeway at turnouts and track crossings shall be at least 
1\1/2\ inches wide.
    (d) For all turnouts and crossovers, and lift rail assemblies or 
other transition devices on moveable bridges, the track owner shall

Sec. 213.357  Derails.

    (a) Each track, other than a main track, which connects with a Class 
7, 8 or 9 main track shall be equipped with a functioning derail of the 
correct size and type, unless railroad equipment on the track, because 
of grade characteristics cannot move to foul the main track.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, a derail is a device which 
will physically stop or divert movement of railroad rolling stock or 
other railroad on-track equipment past the location of the device.
    (c) Each derail shall be clearly visible. When in a locked position, 
a derail shall be free of any lost motion which would prevent it from 
performing its intended function.
    (d) Each derail shall be maintained to function as intended.
    (e) Each derail shall be properly installed for the rail to which it 
is applied.
    (f) If a track protected by a derail is occupied by standing 
railroad rolling stock, the derail shall be in derailing position.

<R05>
Sec. 213.359  Track stiffness.

    (a) Track shall have a sufficient vertical strength to withstand the 
maximum vehicle loads generated at maximum permissible train speeds, 
cant deficiencies and surface defects. For purposes of this section, 
vertical track strength is defined as the track capacity to constrain 
vertical deformations so that the track shall return following maximum 
load to a configuration in compliance with the vehicle/track interaction 
safety limits and geometry requirements of this subpart.
    (b) Track shall have sufficient lateral strength to withstand the 
maximum thermal and vehicle loads generated at maximum permissible train 
speeds, cant deficiencies and lateral alinement defects. For purposes of

    (a) All track shall be visually inspected in accordance with the 
schedule prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section by a person 
designated under Sec. 213.305.
    (b) Each inspection shall be made on foot or by riding over the 
track in a vehicle at a speed that allows the person making the 
inspection to visually inspect the track structure for compliance with 
this part. However, mechanical, electrical, and other track inspection 
devices may be used to supplement visual inspection. If a vehicle is 
used for visual inspection, the speed of the vehicle may not be more 
than 5 miles per hour when passing over track crossings and turnouts, 
otherwise, the inspection vehicle speed shall be at the sole discretion 
of the inspector, based on track conditions and inspection requirements. 
When riding over the track in a vehicle, the inspection will be subject 
to the following conditions--
    (1) One inspector in a vehicle may inspect up to two tracks at one 
time provided that the inspector's visibility remains unobstructed by 
any cause and that the second track is not centered more than 30 feet 
from the track upon which the inspector is riding;
    (2) Two inspectors in one vehicle may inspect up to four tracks at a 
time provided that the inspector's visibility remains unobstructed by 
any cause and that each track being inspected is centered within 39 feet 
from the track upon which the inspectors are riding;
    (3) Each main track is actually traversed by the vehicle or 
inspected on foot at least once every two weeks, and each siding is 
actually traversed by the vehicle or inspected on foot at least once 
every month. On high density commuter railroad lines where track time 
does not permit an on track vehicle inspection, and where track centers 
are 15 foot or less, the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3) will not 
apply; and
    (4) Track inspection records shall indicate which track(s) are 
traversed by the vehicle or inspected on foot as outlined in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section.
    (c) Each track inspection shall be made in accordance with the 
following schedule--

------------------------------------------------------------------------

9......................................  Three times per week.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) If the person making the inspection finds a deviation from the 
requirements of this part, the person shall immediately initiate 
remedial action.
    (e) Each switch, turnout, track crossing, and lift rail assemblies 
on moveable bridges shall be inspected on foot at least weekly. The 
inspection shall be accomplished in accordance with the Guidebook 
required under Sec. 213.353.
    (f) In track Classes 8 and 9, if no train traffic operates for a 
period of eight hours, a train shall be operated at a speed not to 
exceed 100 miles per hour over the track before the resumption of 
operations at the maximum authorized speed.

maintained for at least one year after the inspection covered by the 
record. The owner shall also designate one location, within 100 miles of 
each state in which they conduct operations, where copies of record 
which apply to those operations are either maintained or can be viewed 
following 10 days notice by the Federal Railroad Administration.
    (c) Rail inspection records shall specify the date of inspection, 
the location and nature of any internal defects found, the remedial 
action taken and the date thereof, and the location of any intervals of 
track not tested per Sec. 213.339(d). The owner shall retain a rail 
inspection record for at least two years after the inspection and for 
one year after remedial action is taken.
    (d) Each owner required to keep inspection records under this 
section shall make those records available for inspection and copying by 
the Federal Railroad Administrator.
    (e) For purposes of compliance with the requirements of this 
section, an owner of track may maintain and transfer records through 
electronic transmission, storage, and retrieval provided that--
    (1) The electronic system be designed such that the integrity of 
each record maintained through appropriate levels of security such as 
recognition of an electronic signature, or other means, which uniquely 
identify the initiating person as the author of that record. No two 
persons shall have the same electronic identity;
    (2) The electronic storage of each record shall be initiated by the 
person making the inspection within 24 hours following the completion of 
that inspection;
    (3) The electronic system shall ensure that each record cannot be 
modified in any way, or replaced, once the record is transmitted and 
stored;
    (4) Any amendment to a record shall be electronically stored apart 
from the record which it amends. Each amendment to a record shall be 
uniquely identified as to the person making the amendment;
    (5) The electronic system shall provide for the maintenance of 
inspection records as originally submitted without corruption or loss of 
data; and
    (6) Paper copies of electronic records and amendments to those 
records, that may be necessary to document compliance with this part, 
shall be made available for inspection and copying by the FRA and track 
inspectors responsible under Sec. 213.305. Such paper copies shall be 
made available to the track inspectors and at the locations specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (7) Track inspection records shall be kept available to persons who 
performed the inspection and to persons performing subsequent 
inspections.
    (f) Each vehicle/track interaction safety record required under 
Sec. 213.333 (g), and (m) shall be made available for inspection and 
copying by the FRA at the locations specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section.

Sec. Appendix C to Part 213--Statement of Agency Policy on the Safety of 

                            Railroad Bridges

    1. The structural integrity of bridges that carry railroad tracks is 
important to the safety of railroad employees and to the public. The 
responsibility for the safety of railroad bridges rests with the owner 
of the track carried by the bridge, together with any other party to 
whom that responsibility has been assigned by the track owner.
    2. The capacity of a bridge to safely support its traffic can be 
determined only by intelligent application of engineering principles and 
the laws of physics. Bridge owners should use, as FRA does, those 
principles to assess the integrity of railroad bridges.
    3. The long term ability of a structure to perform its function is 
an economic issue beyond the intent of this policy. In assessing a 
bridge's structural condition, FRA focuses on the present safety of the 
structure, rather than its appearance or long term usefulness.
    4. FRA inspectors conduct regular evaluations of railroad bridge 
inspection and management practices. The objective of these evaluations 
is to document the practices of the evaluated railroad and to disclose 
any program weaknesses that could affect the safety of the public or 
railroad employees. When the evaluation discloses problems, FRA seeks a 
cooperative resolution. If safety is jeopardized by a bridge owner's 
failure to resolve a bridge problem, FRA will use available legal means, 
including issuance of emergency orders, to protect the safety of 
railroad employees and the public.
    5. This policy statement addresses the integrity of bridges that 
carry railroad tracks.

[[Page 156]]

It does not address the integrity of other types of structures on 
railroad property (i.e., tunnels or bridges carrying highways) or other 
features over railroads (i.e., highway overpasses).
    6. The guidelines published in this statement are advisory, rather 
than regulatory, in nature. They indicate those elements FRA deems 
essential to successful bridge management programs. FRA uses the 
guidelines when evaluating bridge inspection and management practices.

                               Guidelines

    1. Responsibility for safety of railroad bridges
    (a) Track owner. The owner of the track on a bridge, or another 
person assuming responsibility for the compliance of that track with 
this Part under provisions of Sec. 213.5, is responsible for ensuring 
that the bridge is capable of safely carrying all railroad traffic 
operated on that track, and for specifying the maximum loads that may be 
operated over the bridge.
    (b) Divided ownership. Where the owner of the track on a bridge does 
not own the bridge, the track owner should ensure that the bridge owner 
is following a program that will maintain the integrity of the bridge. 
The track owner either should participate in the inspection of the 
bridge, or should obtain and review reports of inspections performed by 
the bridge owner. The track owner should maintain current information 
regarding loads that may be operated over the bridge, either from its 
own engineering evaluations or as provided by a competent engineer 
representing the bridge owner. Information on permissible loads may be 
communicated by the bridge owner either in terms of specific car and 
locomotive configurations and weights, or as values representing a 
standard railroad bridge rating reference system. The most common 
standard bridge rating reference system incorporated in the Manual for 
Railway Engineering of the American Railway Engineering and Maintenance 
of Way Association is the dimensional and proportional load 
configuration devised by Theodore Cooper. Other reference systems may be 
used where convenient, provided their effects can be defined in terms of 
shear, bending and pier reactions as necessary for a comprehensive 
evaluation and statement of the capacity of a bridge.
    (c) Other railroads. The owner of the track on a bridge should 
advise other railroads operating on that track of the maximum loads 
permitted on the bridge stated in terms of car and locomotive 
configurations and weights. No railroad should operate a load which 
exceeds those limits without specific authority from, and in accordance 
with restrictions placed by, the track owner.

                     2. Capacity of Railroad Bridges

    (a) Determination. The safe capacity of bridges should be determined 
by competent engineers using accepted principles of structural design 
and analysis.
    (b) Analysis. Proper analysis of a bridge means knowledge of the 
actual dimensions, materials and properties of the structural members of 
the bridge, their condition, and the stresses imposed in those members 
by the service loads.
    (c) Rating. The factors which were used for the design of a bridge 
can generally be used to determine and rate the load capacity of a 
bridge provided:
    (i) The condition of the bridge has not changed significantly, and
    (ii) The stresses resulting from the service loads can be correlated 
to the stresses for which the bridge was designed or rated.

                        3. Railroad Bridge Loads

    (a) Control of loads. The operating instructions for each railroad 
operating over bridges should include provisions to restrict the 
movement of cars and locomotives whose weight or configuration exceed 
the nominal capacity of the bridges.
    (b) Authority for exceptions. Equipment exceeding the nominal weight 
restriction on a bridge should be operated only under conditions 
determined by a competent engineer who has properly analyzed the 
stresses resulting from the proposed loads.
    (c) Operating conditions. Operating conditions for exceptional loads 
may include speed restrictions, restriction of traffic from adjacent 
multiple tracks, and weight limitations on adjacent cars in the same 
train.

                       4. Railroad Bridge Records

    (a) The organization responsible for the safety of a bridge should 
keep design, construction, maintenance and repair records readily 
accessible to permit the determination of safe loads. Having design or 
rating drawings and calculations that conform to the actual structure 
greatly simplifies the process of making accurate determinations of safe 
bridge loads.
    (b) Organizations acquiring railroad property should obtain original 
or usable copies of all bridge records and drawings, and protect or 
maintain knowledge of the location of the original records.

       5. Specifications for Design and Rating of Railroad Bridges

    (a) The recommended specifications for the design and rating of 
bridges are those found in the Manual for Railway Engineering published 
by the American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-way Association. 
These specifications incorporate recognized principles of structural 
design and analysis to provide for the safe and economic utilization

[[Page 157]]

of railroad bridges during their expected useful lives. These 
specifications are continually reviewed and revised by committees of 
competent engineers. Other specifications for design and rating, 
however, have been successfully used by some railroads and may continue 
to be suitable.
    (b) A bridge can be rated for capacity according to current 
specifications regardless of the specification to which it was 
originally designed.

               6. Periodic Inspections of Railroad Bridges

    (a) Periodic bridge inspections by competent inspectors are 
necessary to determine whether a structure conforms to its design or 
rating condition and, if not, the degree of nonconformity.
    (b) The prevailing practice throughout the railroad industry is to 
inspect railroad bridges at least annually. Inspections at more frequent 
intervals may be indicated by the nature or condition of a structure or 
intensive traffic levels.

              7. Underwater Inspections of Railroad Bridges

    (a) Inspections of bridges should include measuring and recording 
the condition of substructure support at locations subject to erosion 
from moving water.
    (b) Stream beds often are not visible to the inspector. Indirect 
measurements by sounding, probing, or any other appropriate means are 
necessary in those cases. A series of records of those readings will 
provide the best information in the event unexpected changes suddenly 
occur. Where such indirect measurements do not provide the necessary 
assurance of foundation integrity, diving inspections should be 
performed as prescribed by a competent engineer.

                        8. Seismic Considerations

    (a) Owners of bridges should be aware of the risks posed by 
earthquakes in the areas in which their bridges are located. Precautions 
should be taken to protect the safety of trains and the public following 
an earthquake.
    (b) Contingency plans for seismic events should be prepared in 
advance, taking into account the potential for seismic activity in an 
area.
    (c) The predicted attenuation of ground motion varies considerably 
within the United States. Local ground motion attenuation values and the 
magnitude of an earthquake both influence the extent of the area 
affected by an earthquake. Regions with low frequency of seismic events 
produce less data from which to predict attenuation factors. That 
uncertainty should be considered when designating the area in which 
precautions should be taken following the first notice of an earthquake. 
In fact, earthquakes in such regions might propagate their effects over 
much wider areas than earthquakes of the same magnitude occurring in 
regions with frequent seismic activity.

               9. Special Inspections of Railroad Bridges

    (a) A special bridge inspection should be performed after an 
occurrence that might have reduced the capacity of the bridge, such as a 
flood, an earthquake, a derailment, or an unusual impact.
    (b) When a railroad learns that a bridge might have suffered damage 
through an unusual occurrence, it should restrict train operations over 
the bridge until the bridge is inspected and evaluated.

                 10. Railroad Bridge Inspection Records

    (a) Bridge inspections should be recorded. Records should identify 
the structure inspected, the date of the inspection, the name of the 
inspector, the components inspected, and their condition.
    (b) Information from bridge inspection reports should be 
incorporated into a bridge management program to ensure that exceptions 
on the reports are corrected or accounted for. A series of inspection 
reports prepared over time should be maintained so as to provide a 
valuable record of trends and rates of degradation of bridge components. 
The reports should be structured to promote comprehensive inspections 
and effective communication between an inspector and an engineer who 
performs an analysis of a bridge.
    (c) An inspection report should be comprehensible to a competent 
person without interpretation by the reporting inspector.

              11. Railroad Bridge Inspectors and Engineers

    (a) Bridge inspections should be performed by technicians whose 
training and experience enable them to detect and record indications of 
distress on a bridge. Inspectors should provide accurate measurements 
and other information about the condition of the bridge in enough detail 
so that an engineer can make a proper evaluation of the safety of the 
bridge.
    (b) Accurate information about the condition of a bridge should be 
evaluated by an engineer who is competent to determine the capacity of 
the bridge. The inspector and the evaluator often are not the same 
individual. The quality of the bridge evaluation depends on the quality 
of the communication between them.

                       12. Scheduling Inspections

    (a) A bridge management program should include a means to ensure 
that each bridge

[[Page 158]]

under the program is inspected at the frequency prescribed for that 
bridge by a competent engineer.
    (b) Bridge inspections should be scheduled from an accurate bridge 
inventory list that includes the due date of the next inspection.

             13. Special Considerations for Railroad Bridges

    Railroad bridges differ from other types of bridges in the types of 
loads they carry, in their modes of failure and indications of distress, 
and in their construction details and components. Proper inspection and 
analysis of railroad bridges require familiarity with the loads, details 
and indications of distress that are unique to this class of structure. 
Particular care should be taken that modifications to railroad bridges, 
including retrofits for protection against the effects of earthquakes, 
are suitable for the structure to which they are to be applied. 
Modifications should not adversely affect the serviceability of the 
bridge nor its accessibility for periodic or special inspection.

                Subpart B_Bridge Worker Safety Standards


<R05>
Sec. 214.101  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of this subpart is to prevent accidents and 
casualties arising from the performance of work on railroad bridges.

[[Page 163]]

    (b) This subpart prescribes minimum railroad safety rules for 
railroad employees performing work on bridges. Each railroad and 
railroad contractor may prescribe additional or more stringent operating 
rules, safety rules, and other special instructions not inconsistent 
with this subpart.
    (c) These provisions apply to all railroad employees, railroads, and 
railroad contractors performing work on railroad bridges.
    (d) Any working conditions involving the protection of railroad 
employees working on railroad bridges not within the subject matter 
addressed by this chapter, including respiratory protection, hazard 
communication, hearing protection, welding and lead exposure standards, 
shall be governed by the regulations of the U.S. Department of Labor, 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 214.103  Fall protection, generally.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this 
section, when bridge workers work twelve feet or more above the ground 
or water surface, they shall be provided and shall use a personal fall 
arrest system or safety net system. All fall protection systems required 
by this section shall conform to the standards set forth in Sec. 
214.105 of this subpart.
    (b)(1) This section shall not apply if the installation of the fall 
arrest system poses a greater risk than the work to be performed. In any 
action brought by FRA to enforce the fall protection requirements, the 
railroad or railroad contractor shall have the burden of proving that 
the installation of such device poses greater exposure to risk than 
performance of the work itself.
    (2) This section shall not apply to bridge workers engaged in 
inspection of railroad bridges conducted in full compliance with the 
following conditions:
    (i) The railroad or railroad contractor has a written program in 
place that requires training in, adherence to, and use of safe 
procedures associated with climbing techniques and procedures to be 
used;
    (ii) The bridge worker to whom this exception applies has been 
trained and qualified according to that program to perform bridge 
inspections, has been previously and voluntarily designated to perform 
inspections under the provision of that program, and has accepted the 
designation;
    (iii) The bridge worker to whom this exception applies is familiar 
with the appropriate climbing techniques associated with all bridge 
structures the bridge worker is responsible for inspecting;
    (iv) The bridge worker to whom this exception applies is engaged 
solely in moving on or about the bridge or observing, measuring and 
recording the dimensions and condition of the bridge and its components; 
and
    (v) The bridge worker to whom this section applies is provided all 
equipment necessary to meet the needs of safety, including any 
specialized alternative systems required.
    (c) This section shall not apply where bridge workers are working on 
a railroad bridge equipped with walkways and railings of sufficient 
height, width, and strength to prevent a fall, so long as bridge workers 
do not work beyond the railings, over the side of the bridge, on ladders 
or other elevation devices, or where gaps or holes exist through which a 
body could fall. Where used in place of fall protection as provided for 
in Sec. 214.105, this paragraph (c) is satisfied by:
    (1) Walkways and railings meeting standards set forth in the 
American Railway Engineering Association's Manual for Railway 
Engineering; and
    (2) Roadways attached to railroad bridges, provided that bridge 
workers on the roadway deck work or move at a distance six feet or more 
from the edge of the roadway deck, or from an opening through which a 
person could fall.
    (d) This section shall not apply where bridge workers are performing 
repairs or inspections of a minor nature that are completed by working 
exclusively between the outside rails, including but not limited to, 
routine welding, spiking, anchoring, spot surfacing, and joint bolt 
replacement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ A penalty may be assessed against an individual only for a willful
  violation. Generally, when two or more violations of these regulations
  are discovered with respect to a single freight car that is placed or
  continued in service by a railroad, the appropriate penalties set
  forth above are aggregated up to a maximum of $16,000 per day.
  However, a failure to perform, with respect to a particular freight
  car, the predeparture inspection required by Sec.  215.13 of this
  part will be treated as a violation separate and distinct from, and in
  addition to, any substantive violative conditions found on the car.
  The Administrator reserves the right to assess a penalty of up to
  $27,000 for any violation where circumstances warrant. See 49 CFR part
  209, appendix A.
Failure to observe any condition for movement set forth in paragraphs
  (a) and (c) of Sec.  215.9 will deprive the railroad of the benefit
  of the movement-for-repair provision and make the railroad and any
  responsible individuals liable for penalty under the particular
  regulatory section(s) concerning the substantive defect(s) present on
  the freight car at the time of movement.
Maintenance-of-way equipment not stenciled in accordance with Sec.
  215.305 is subject to all requirements of this part. See Sec.
  215.3(c)(3).

   Sec. Appendix C to Part 215--FRA Freight Car Standards Defect Code

    The following defect code has been established for use by FRA and 
State inspectors to report defects observed during inspection of freight 
cars. The purpose of the code is to establish a uniform language among 
FRA, States, and the railroad industry that will facilitate 
communication, recordkeeping, and statistical analyses. The code may not 
be substituted for the description of defects on bad order tags affixed 
to cars being moved for repair under Sec. 215.9. However, it may be 
used to supplement that description.

Sec. 216.17  Appeals.

    (a) Upon receipt of a Special Notice prescribed in Sec. Sec. 
216.11, 216.13, 216.14, or 216.15, a railroad may appeal the decision of 
the Inspector to the FRA Regional Administrator for the region in which 
the notice was given. The appeal shall be made by letter or telegram. 
The FRA Regional Administrator assigns an inspector, other than the 
inspector from whose decision the appeal is being taken, to reinspect 
the railroad freight car, locomotive, railroad passenger equipment, or 
track. The reinspection will be made immediately. If upon reinspection, 
the railroad freight car, locomotive, or passenger equipment is found to 
be in serviceable condition, or the track is found to comply with the 
requirements for the class at which it was previously operated by the 
railroad, the FRA Regional Administrator or his or her agent will 
immediately notify the railroad, whereupon the restrictions of the 
Special Notice cease to be effective. If on reinspection the decision of 
the original inspector is sustained, the FRA Regional Administrator 
notifies the railroad that the appeal has been denied.
    (b) A railroad whose appeal to the FRA Regional Administrator has 
been denied may, within thirty (30) days from the denial, appeal to the 
Administrator. After affording an opportunity for informal oral hearing, 
the Administrator may affirm, set aside, or modify, in whole or in part, 
the action of the FRA Regional Administrator.
    (c) The requirements of a Special Notice issued under this subpart 
shall remain in effect and be observed by a railroad pending appeal to 
the FRA Regional Administrator or to the Administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 216.21  Notice of track conditions.

    (a) When an FRA Track Inspector or State Track Inspector finds track 
conditions which may require the issuance of an Emergency order removing 
the track from service under section 203, Public Law No. 91-458, 84 
Stat. 972 (45 U.S.C. 432), the Inspector may issue a notice to the 
railroad owning the track. The notice sets out and describes the 
conditions found by the Inspector and specifies the location of defects 
on the affected track segment. The Inspector provides a copy to the FRA 
Regional Track Engineer and the FRA Regional Administrator.
    (b) In the event the railroad immediately commences repairs on the 
affected track and so advises the FRA Regional Track Engineer, the 
Regional Track Engineer assigns an Inspector to reinspect the track 
immediately on the completion of repairs. If upon reinspection the 
Inspector determines that necessary repairs have been completed, he 
withdraws the Notice of Track Conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 216.23  Consideration of recommendation.

    Upon receipt of a Notice of Track Conditions issued under Sec.

                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 217.1  Purpose.

    Through the requirements of this part, the Federal Railroad 
Administration learns the condition of operating rules and practices 
with respect to trains and other rolling equipment in the railroad 
industry, and each railroad is required to instruct its employees in 
operating practices.


<R05>
Sec. 217.2  Preemptive effect.

    Normal State negligence standards apply where there is no Federal 
action covering the subject matter. Under 49 U.S.C. 20106 (section 
20106), issuance of the regulations in this part preempts any State law, 
regulation, or order covering the same subject matter, except an 
additional or more stringent law, regulation, or order that is necessary 
to eliminate or reduce an essentially local railroad safety or railroad 
security hazard; that is not incompatible with a law, regulation, or 
order of the United States Government; and that does not unreasonably 
burden interstate commerce. Section 20106 permits State tort actions 
arising from events or activities occurring on or after January 18, 
2002, for the following: violation of the Federal standard of care 
established by regulation or order issued by the Secretary of 
Transportation (with respect to railroad safety, such as these 
regulations) or the Secretary of Homeland Security (with respect to 
railroad security); a party's violation of, or failure to comply with, 
its own plan, rule, or standard that it created pursuant to a regulation 
or order issued by either of the two Secretaries; and a party's 
violation of a State standard that is necessary to eliminate or reduce 
an essentially local safety or security hazard, is not incompatible with 
a law, regulation, or order of the United States Government, and does 
not unreasonably burden interstate commerce. Nothing in section 20106 
creates a Federal cause of action on behalf of an injured party or 
confers Federal question jurisdiction for such State law causes of 
action.

                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 218.1  Purpose.

    This part prescribes minimum requirements for railroad operating 
rules and practices. Each railroad may prescribe additional or more 
stringent requirements in its operating rules, timetables, timetable 
special instructions, and other special instructions.


<R05>
Sec. 218.3  Application.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this part 
applies to railroads that operate rolling equipment on standard gage 
track which is part of the general railroad system of transportation.
    (b) This part does not apply to--
    (1) A railroad that operates only on track inside an installation 
which is not part of the general railroad system of transportation, or
    (2) Rapid transit operations in an urban area that are not connected 
with the general railroad system of transportation.

[44 FR 2175, Jan. 10, 1979, as amended at 53 FR 28599, July 28, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 218.4  Preemptive effect.

    Normal State negligence standards apply where there is no Federal 
action covering the subject matter. Under 49 U.S.C. 20106 (section 
20106), issuance of the regulations in this part preempts any State law, 
regulation, or order covering the same subject matter, except an 
additional or more stringent law, regulation, or order that is necessary 
to eliminate or reduce an essentially local railroad safety or railroad 
security hazard; that is not incompatible with a law, regulation, or 
order of the United States Government; and that does not unreasonably 
burden interstate commerce. Section 20106 permits State tort actions 
arising from events or activities occurring on or after January 18, 
2002, for the following: Violation of the Federal standard of care 
established by regulation or order issued the Secretary of 
Transportation (with respect to railroad safety, such as these 
regulations) or the Secretary of Homeland Security (with respect to 
railroad security); a party's violation of, or failure to comply with, 
its own plan, rule, or standard that it created pursuant to a regulation 
or order issued by either of the two Secretaries; and a party's 
violation of a State standard that is necessary to eliminate or reduce 
an essentially local safety or security hazard, is not incompatible with 
a law, regulation, or order of the United States Government, and does 
not unreasonably burden interstate commerce. Nothing in section 20106 
creates a Federal cause of action on behalf of an injured party or 
confers Federal question jurisdiction for such State law causes of 
action.

[73 FR 8498, Feb. 13, 2008]

other than main track--
    (a) A blue signal must be displayed at or near each manually 
operated switch providing access to that track;
    (b) Each manually operated switch providing access to the track on 
which the equipment is located must be lined against movement to that 
track and locked with an effective locking device; and
    (c) The person in charge of the workers must have notified the 
operator of any remotely controlled switch that work is to be performed 
and have been informed by the operator that each remotely controlled 
switch providing access to the track on which the equipment is located 
has been lined against movement to that track and locked as prescribed 
in Sec. 218.30.
    (d) If rolling equipment requiring blue signal protection as 
provided for

[[Page 218]]

in this section is on a track equipped with one or more crossovers, both 
switches of each crossover must be lined against movement through the 
crossover toward that rolling equipment, and the switch of each 
crossover that provides access to the rolling equipment must be 
protected in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b), 
or (c) of this section.
    (e) If the rolling equipment to be protected includes one or more 
locomotives, a blue signal must be attached to the controlling 
locomotive at a location where it is readily visible to the engineman or 
operator at the controls of that locomotive.


<R05>
Sec. 218.29  Alternate methods of protection.

    Instead of providing blue signal protection for workers in 
accordance with Sec. 218.27, the following methods for blue signal 
protection may be used:
    (a) When workers are on, under, or between rolling equipment in a 
locomotive servicing track area:
    (1) A blue signal must be displayed at or near each switch providing 
entrance to or departure from the area;
    (2) Each switch providing entrance to or departure from the area 
must be lined against movement to the area and locked with an effective 
locking device; and
    (3) A blue signal must be attached to each controlling locomotive at 
a location where it is readily visible to the engineman or operator at 
the controls of that locomotive;
    (4) If the speed within this area is resticted to not more than 5 
miles per hour a derail, capable of restricting access to that portion 
of a track within the area on which the rolling equipment is located, 
will fulfill the requirements of a manually operated switch in 
compliance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section when positioned at 
least 50 feet from the end of the equipment to be protected by the blue 
signal, when locked in a derailing position with an effective locking 
device, and when a blue signal is displayed at the derail;
    (5) A locomotive may be moved onto a locomotive servicing area track 
after the blue signal has been removed from the entrance switch to the 
area. However, the locomotive must be stopped short of coupling to 
another locomotive;
    (6) A locomotive may be moved off of a locomotive servicing area 
track after the blue signal has been removed from the controlling 
locomotive to be moved and from the area departure switch;
    (7) If operated by an authorized employee under the direction of the 
person in charge of the workers, a locomotive protected by blue signals 
may be repositioned within this area after the blue signal has been 
removed from the locomotive to be repositioned and the workers on the 
affected track have been notified of the movement; and
    (8) Blue signal protection removed for the movement of locomotives 
as provided in paragraphs (a) (5) and (6) of this section must be 
restored immediately after the locomotive has cleared the switch.
    (b) When workers are on, under, or between rolling equipment in a 
car shop repair track area:
    (1) A blue signal must be displayed at or near each switch providing 
entrance to or departure from the area; and
    (2) Each switch providing entrance to or departure from the area 
must be lined against movement to the area and locked with an effective 
locking device;
    (3) If the speed within this area is restricted to not more than 5 
miles per hour, a derail capable of restricting access to that portion 
of a track within the area on which the rolling equipment is located 
will fulfill the requirements of a manually operated switch in 
compliance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section when positioned at 
least 50 feet from the end of the equipment to be protected by the blue 
signal, when locked in a derailing position with an effective locking 
device and when a blue signal is displayed at the derail;
    (4) If operated by an authorized employee under the direction of the 
person in charge of the workemen, a car mover may be used to reposition 
rolling equipment within this area after workers on the affected track 
have been notified of the movement.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, 
when workers are on, under, or between rolling equipment on any track, 
other than a main track:

[[Page 219]]

    (1) A derail capable of restricting access to that portion of the 
track on which such equipment is located, will fulfill the requirements 
of a manually operated switch when positioned no less than 150 feet from 
the end so such equipment; and
    (2) Each derail must be locked in a derailing position with an 
effective locking device and a blue signal must be displayed at each 
derail.
    (d) When emergency repair work is to be done on, under, or between a 
locomotive or one or more cars coupled to a locomotive, and blue signals 
are not available, the engineman or operator at the controls of that 
locomotive must be notified and effective measures must be taken to 
protect the workers making the repairs.

protection shall be provided--
    (i) When a train is moving on the main track at less than one-half 
the maximum authorized speed (including slow order limits) in that 
territory, flag protection against following trains on the same track 
must be provided by a crew member by dropping off single lighted fusees 
at intervals that do not exceed the burning time of the fusee.
    (ii) When a train is moving on the main track at more than one-half 
the maximum authorized speed (including slow order limits) in that 
territory under circumstances in which it may be overtaken, crew members 
responsible for providing protection will take into consideration the 
grade, curvature of track, weather conditions, sight distance and 
relative speed of his train to following trains and will be governed 
accordingly in the use of fusees.
    (iii) When a train stops on main track, flag protection against 
following trains on the same track must be provided as follows: A crew 
member with flagman's signals must immediately go back at least the 
distance prescribed by timetable or other instructions for the territory 
and display one lighted fusee. The crew member may then return one-half 
of the distance to the crew member's train where the crew member must 
remain until the crew member has stopped the approaching train or is 
recalled. When recalled, the crew member must leave one lighted fusee 
and while returning to the crew member's train, the crew member must 
also place single lighted fusees at intervals that do not exceed the 
burning time of the fusee. When the train departs, a crew member must 
leave one lighted fusee and until the train resumes speed not less than 
one-half the maximum authorized speed (including slow order limits) in 
that territory, the crew member must drop off single lighted fusees at 
intervals that do not exceed the burning time of the fusee.
    (iv) When required by the railroad's operating rules, a forward crew 
member with flagman's signals must protect the front of the crew 
member's train against opposing movements by immediately going forward 
at least the distance prescribed by timetable or other instructions for 
the territory, displaying one lighted fusee, and remaining at that 
location until recalled.
    (v) Whenever a crew member is providing flag protection, he must not 
permit other duties to interfere with the protection of his train.
    (2) Flag protection against following trains on the same track is 
not required if--
    (i) The rear of the train is protected by at least two block 
signals;
    (ii) The rear of the train is protected by an absolute block;
    (iii) The rear of the train is within interlocking limits; or
    (iv) A train order specifies that flag protection is not required.
    (v) A railroad operates only one train at any given time.
    (b) Each railroad shall designate by timetable or other instruction 
for each territory the specific distance which a crew member providing 
flag protection must go out in order to provide adequate protection for 
his train.
    (c) Whenever the use of fusees is prohibited by a Federal, State or 
local fire regulation, each railroad operating within that jurisdiction 
shall provide alternate operating procedures to assure full protection 
of trains in lieu of flag protection required by this section.

challenging employee to comply with the directive until the challenge 
resulting from the good faith determination is resolved;
    (3) Provide that the railroad or employer may require the 
challenging employee to perform tasks unrelated to the challenge until 
the challenge is resolved;
    (4) Provide that the railroad or employer may direct an employee, 
other than the challenging employee, to perform the challenged task 
prior to the challenge being resolved as long as this other employee is 
informed of the challenge and does not also make a good faith 
determination that the challenged task would violate FRA regulations 
regarding the handling of equipment, switches, and fixed derails as 
required in this subpart, or a railroad's operating rules implementing 
the requirements of this subpart;
    (5) Provide that a challenge may be resolved by:
    (i) A railroad or employer officer's acceptance of the employee's

aspect;
    (B) Each signal governing movement into and through interlocking 
limits or controlled point limits shall be continuously observed by a 
member of that crew who is in a position to determine that the train's 
movement has occupied the circuit controlling that

[[Page 230]]

signal as evidenced by that signal assuming its most restrictive aspect; 
and
    (C) The movement does not exceed the train's length.
    (5) Shoving or pushing movements made in the direction of the 
circuited end of a designated departure track equipped with a shove 
light system, if all of the following conditions are met:

 Sec. Appendix B to Part 218--Statement of Agency Enforcement Policy on 

              Blue Signal Protection for Utility Employees

    The following examples of the application of the train or yard crew 
exclusion from required blue signal protection for utility employees are 
provided to clarify FRA's enforcement policy. In the first four 
examples, the utility employee is properly attached to and functioning 
as member of a train or yard crew and is excluded from blue signal 
protection, provided all the conditions specified in Sec. 218.22 are 
met:

    Example 1: A utility employee assists a train crew by adding or 
reducing railroad cars to or from the train. The utility employee may 
perform any duties which would normally be conducted by members of the 
train crew, i.e., setting or releasing handbrakes, coupling air hoses 
and other connections, prepare rail cars for coupling, and perform air 
brake tests.
    Example 2: A utility employee is assigned to assist a yard crew for 
the purpose of classifying and assembling railroad cars. The yard crew 
onboard their locomotive arrives at the location in the yard where the 
work is to be performed. At that time, the utility employee may attach 
himself to the yard crew and commence duties as a member of that yard 
crew.
    Example 3: A utility employee is assigned to inspect, test, remove 
and replace if necessary, a combination rear end marking device/end of 
train device on a through freight train. The utility employee attaches 
himself to the train crew after the arrival of the train and its crew at 
the location where this work is to be conducted. He may then perform 
duties as a member of that crew.
    Example 4: A railroad manager who properly attaches himself as a 
utility employee to a train or yard crew, in accordance with Sec. 
218.22, may then function as a member of the train or yard crew under 
the exclusion provided for train and yard crews.

    Note: In the last four examples, any railroad employee, including 
regularly assigned crew members, would need blue signal protection to 
perform the described function.

    Example 5: Prior to the arrival of a through freight train, a 
utility employee installs an end-of-train device on one end of a block 
of railroad cars that are scheduled to be picked up by the freight 
train.
    Example 6: A railroad employee attaches himself to a train or yard 
crew while the crew is in the ready room preparing to take charge of 
their train. Prior to the train crew leaving the ready room and taking 
charge of the equipment, the employee couples air hoses and other 
connections between the locomotives.
    Example 7: A railroad employee is attached to a train crew after the 
train crew has taken charge of the train. It is necessary for the 
employee to perform a repair on a rail car, such as replacing a brake 
shoe, in addition to those duties normally performed by train or yard 
crew members.
    Example 8: A train or yard crew, supplemented by three utility 
employees, has an assigned locomotive and train. The regular crew, 
including the engineer, has left the train to eat lunch. The utility 
employees have remained with the train and are coupling air hoses 
between rail cars in the train.

 Sec. Appendix C to Part 218--Statement of Agency Enforcement Policy on 

                                Tampering

    The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-342, enacted 
June 22, 1988) (``RSIA'') raised the maximum civil penalties available 
under the railroad safety laws and made individuals liable for willful 
violations of those laws. Section 21 of the RSIA requires that FRA adopt 
regulations addressing three related but distinct aspects of problems 
that can occur when safety devices are tampered with or disabled. It 
requires that FRA make it unlawful for (i) any individual to willfully 
tamper with or disable a device; (ii) any individual to knowingly 
operate or permit to be operated a train with a tampered or disabled 
device; and (iii) any railroad to operate such a train.
    Because the introduction of civil penalties against individuals 
brings FRA's enforcement of the rail safety laws into a new era and 
because the changes being introduced by this regulation are so 
significant, FRA believes that it is advisable to set forth the manner 
in which it will exercise its enforcement authority under this 
regulation.

                   Safety Devices Covered by This Rule

    FRA has employed a functional description of what constitutes a 
safety device under this rule. FRA's wording effectively identifies 
existing equipment and is sufficiently expansive to cover equipment that 
may appear in the future, particularly devices associated with advanced 
train control systems currently undergoing research testing.
    FRA has been advised by portions of the regulated community that its 
functional definition has some potential for confusing people who read 
the rule without the benefit of the preamble discussions concerning the 
meaning of this definition. Since this rule is specifically intended to 
preclude misconduct by individuals, FRA wants this rule to be easily 
comprehended by all who read it. To achieve that clarity, FRA has decide 
to specify which types of equipment it considers to be within the scope 
of this rule and provide some examples of equipment that is not covered. 
In addition, FRA is ready and willing to respond in writing to any 
inquiry about any other devices that a party believes are treated 
ambiguously under this rule. This regulation applies to a variety of 
devices including equipment known as ``event recorders,'' ``alerters,'' 
``deadman controls,'' ``automatic cab signals,'' ``cab signal 
whistles,'' ``automatic train stop equipment,'' and ``automatic train 
control equipment.'' FRA does not consider the following equipment to be 
covered by this rule: Radios; monitors for end-of-train devices; bells 
or whistles that are not connected to alerters, deadman pedals, or 
signal system devices; fans for controlling interior temperature of 
locomotive cabs; and locomotive performance monitoring devices, unless 
they record data such as train speed and air brake operations. Although 
FRA considers such devices beyond the scope of the regulation, this does 
not imply that FRA condones the disabling of such devices. FRA will not 
hesitate to include such devices at a later date should instances of 
tampering with these devices be discovered. FRA does not currently 
perceive a need to directly proscribe tampering with such devices 
because there is no history of these devices being subjected to 
tampering.

          Subsequent Operators of Trains With Disabled Devices

    Section 218.57 addresses instances in which one individual has 
tampered with a safety device and a second individual (a ``subsequent 
operator'') knowingly operates a train or permits it to be operated, 
notwithstanding the presence of the disabled or tampered-with unit. The 
most common occurrence addressed by this provision is the situation in 
which a train crew encounters a locomotive with a safety device that has 
been tampered with prior to the crew's assuming responsibility for the 
locomotive. FRA has structured this provision and its attendant 
enforcement policy to reflect the fact that instances in which one 
individual encounters a locomotive that someone else has tampered with 
are relatively infrequent occurrences.
    FRA's regulatory prohibition for subsequent operator conduct 
reflects the legal standard for individual culpability set forth in the 
RSIA. Under the relevant statutory standard (``knowingly operates or 
permits to be operated a train on which such devices have been tampered 
with or disabled by another person'')--now incorporated into Sec. 
218.57--individuals could be held to a simple negligence standard of 
conduct, i.e., a standard of reasonable care under the circumstances. 
FRA's conclusion about the proper interpretation of the word 
``knowingly'' stems from both normal canons of statutory construction 
and analysis of decisional law concerning the use of similar statutory 
constructs in the civil penalty context. It is also consistent with 
other Departmental interpretations of the word as used in similar 
contexts. (See 49 CFR 107.299, defining ``knowingly'' under the 
Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, 49 App. U.S.C. 1801 et seq.)
    Under that statutory language, the responsible members of the crew 
could be culpable if either (1) due to their failure to exercise 
reasonable care, they failed to determine that the safety device was not 
functioning, or (2) having ascertained that the device was not 
functioning, still elected to operate the train. Similarly, railroad 
supervisors who

[[Page 236]]

permit or direct that a train with a disabled device be operated after 
having learned that the safety device is not functioning or after having 
failed to use reasonable care in the performance of their duties could 
also be subject to sanction.
    However, as a matter of enforcement policy, application of a 
negligence standard in this particular context presently appears 
unwarranted. We have seen no evidence of an employee's negligent failure 
to detect another employee's tampering having caused a safety problem. 
FRA can effectively attack the known dimensions of the tampering problem 
by employing an enforcement policy that limits its enforcement actions 
to situations where individuals clearly had actual knowledge of the 
disabled device and intentionally operated the train notwithstanding 
that knowledge.
    Therefore, FRA will not take enforcement action against an 
individual under Sec. 218.57 absent a showing of such actual knowledge 
of the facts. Actual, subjective knowledge need not be demonstrated. It 
will suffice to show objectively that the alleged violator must have 
known the facts based on reasonable inferences drawn from the 
circumstances. For example, it is reasonable to infer that a person 
knows about something plainly in sight on the locomotive he is 
operating. Also, unlike the case where willfulness must be shown (see 
FRA's statement of policy at 49 CFR part 209, appendix A), knowledge of 
or reckless disregard for the law need not be shown to make out a 
violation of Sec. 218.57. The knowledge relevant here is knowledge of 
the facts constituting the violation, not knowledge of the law.
    Should FRA receive evidence indicating that a stricter enforcement 
policy is necessary to address the tampering problem, it will revise its 
enforcement policy to permit enforcement actions based only on a showing 
of the subsequent operator's negligent failure to detect the tampering, 
as the relevant provision of the RSIA permits it to do now. Any such 
change in enforcement policy will become effective only after 
publication of a revised version of this appendix.

    Sec. Appendix D to Part 218--Requirements and Considerations for 

             Implementing Technology Aided Point Protection

                              Introduction

    This appendix provides further explanation and requirements for 
exercising the option to provide point protection with the aid of 
technology as permitted in Sec. 218.99(b)(3)(i). The regulation permits 
the visual determination necessary to provide point protection, i.e., a 
determination that the track is clear, for a shoving or pushing movement 
to ``be made with the aid of monitored cameras or other technological 
means, provided that it and the procedures for use provide an equivalent 
level of protection to that of a direct visual determination by a 
crewmember or other qualified employee properly positioned to make the 
observation as prescribed in this section and appendix D to this part.'' 
This appendix addresses the general requirements and considerations for 
all technology aided point protection as well as specific additional 
requirements for those operations involving remote control operations at 
public highway-rail grade crossings, private highway-rail grade 
crossings outside the physical confines of a railroad yard, pedestrian 
crossings outside the physical confines of a railroad yard, and yard 
Access Crossings.

               I. General Requirements and Considerations

    A. Although railroading is now one of the nation's older forms of 
mechanized transportation, equipment, components and operations all have 
evolved through new and improved technologies. Installing cameras in 
yards so that a location could be remotely monitored from somewhere else 
has become a railroading reality as cameras have become smaller, less 
expensive, and have increased resolution. It is possible to set up these 
cameras and monitors so that they provide at least an equivalent level 
of safety to that of an employee protecting the point. Part 218, subpart 
F permits such an operation to substitute for an employee's direct 
visual determination where the technology provides an equivalent level 
of protection to that of a direct visual determination. See Sec. 
218.99(b)(3)(i). Of course, to provide an equivalent level of 
protection, an employee needs to be properly qualified (see Sec. 
218.95(a)(2)) and the technology must work as intended. Most 
malfunctions of the technology should be detectable, and result in 
abandoning the use of the technology for determining point protection 
until the malfunction can be corrected.
    B. The substitution of such technology for a direct visual 
determination is dependent on many factors. Each situation will have its 
own particular factual circumstances that shall require consideration in 
determining whether an equivalent level of safety can be achieved. For 
instance, with regard to the basic camera setup, a railroad shall 
consider whether an operator must see in color (largely a necessity if 
viewing signals), the width of the angle of view, the size and location 
of the monitor, whether the technology is for day-time use only, and 
whether its use should be limited to fair weather conditions. However, 
under all circumstances, the monitor shall display sufficient 
information to

[[Page 237]]

enable the viewer to make a determination that the track ahead of the 
shoving or pushing move is clear pursuant to the definition of ``track 
is clear'' in Sec. 218.93.
    C. Each railroad that chooses to implement such camera/monitor 
setups shall implement attendant procedures and qualify each employee 
who will be utilizing the technology. Railroads shall ensure that any 
monitored camera has sufficient resolution and real time coverage to 
provide protection equal to a direct visual determination. See Sec. 
218.99(b)(3)(i). Concerning attendant procedures, one such procedure may 
be for an employee viewing a monitor to communicate updates to the 
locomotive engineer or controlling crewmember at appropriate intervals. 
FRA equates the employee monitoring the camera to the employee 
controlling the movement who must not engage in any task unrelated to 
the oversight of the movement; thus, each railroad utilizing such 
cameras shall implement attendant procedures limiting any of the 
monitoring employee's ancillary duties that might distract from the 
employee's ability to visually determine that the track is clear and 
provide continuous communication to the employee controlling the 
movement.
    D. There is also the consideration of whether the person viewing the 
monitor is the locomotive engineer, remote control operator, other 
crewmember or other qualified person, such as a yardmaster. If the 
monitor is not being viewed by the operator who is controlling the 
movement, then, there shall be a clear understanding and channel of 
communication between the operator and the employee who is viewing the 
monitor--as the latter would be protecting the movement. Providing an 
equivalent level of protection to that of a direct visual determination 
requires a thorough job briefing in which there is an understanding of 
who is observing the movement, what is the observer's range of vision, 
at what locomotive speed can the observation be made and how information 
will be conveyed to the operator/engineer, if that person is not the one 
viewing the monitor.
    E. There may be occasions when a railroad finds it advantageous to 
use a non-crewmember, e.g., a yardmaster, to provide point protection, 
line switches, or check the status of a derail for a remote control 
crew; however, several potential problems may result when non-
crewmembers are used to carry out some crewmember functions. Of foremost 
concern is the great potential for an error in communication or a 
misunderstanding between the non-crewmember and the crewmembers 
regarding the activity or status of equipment. A yardmaster who is 
occupied with his or her other responsibilities might not give the task 
the attention it deserves, or could be distracted and give an incorrect 
answer to a question by a crewmember (e.g., ``is the move lined?''). The 
result could be that the task does not get completed or there is an 
error in task execution. Further, the crewmembers might not have any 
alternative way of determining that there is a problem with the point 
protection provided by the non-crewmember until it is too late. 
Consequently, to the extent they will be called upon to perform these 
duties, each railroad shall include yardmasters and other non-
crewmembers in any operating rule promulgated in accordance with Sec. 
218.99(b)(2).

II. Additional Requirements for Remote Control Locomotive Operations at 
  Highway-Rail Grade Crossings, Pedestrian Crossings, and Yard Access 
                                Crossings

    A. In addition to the general requirements and considerations for 
all technology aided point protection in lieu of direct visual 
determinations, additional requirements are necessary to address 
concerns specific to the use of camera/monitor setups for remote control 
locomotive operations to protect the point at highway-rail grade 
crossings, pedestrian crossings, and yard access crossings. Railroad 
operating rules currently permit a movement to travel over a crossing 
without the physical presence of a crewmember if a crossing is equipped 
with gates, if it can be determined that the gates are in the fully 
lowered position, and if the crossing is clear of vehicles and 
pedestrians. Remote control movements at highway-rail grade crossings, 
pedestrian crossings, and yard access crossings that utilize camera/
monitor setups pose a greater direct risk to members of the general 
public than yard movements utilizing camera/monitor setups to check 
whether a track is clear. In addition, such setups can rapidly develop 
problems with motor vehicles and pedestrians unaccustomed to railroad 
operating rules and procedures. For these reasons, additional safeguards 
are necessary.
    B. In consideration of the dangers posed by the use of camera/
monitor setups for remote control locomotive operations at highway-rail 
grade crossings, pedestrian crossings, and yard access crossings, the 
following procedures shall be complied with in order to establish an 
equivalent means of safety in accordance with Sec. 218.99(b)(3)(i):
    1. Before camera-assisted remote control locomotive operations are 
permitted at highway-rail grade crossings, pedestrian crossings, and 
yard access crossings, a Crossing Diagnostic Team shall evaluate the 
crossing. The diagnostic team shall have representatives from the 
railroad, FRA, the State department of transportation (or another State 
agency having jurisdiction over the highway-rail grade crossing, 
pedestrian crossing, or yard access crossing), and local government

[[Page 238]]

authorities. The diagnostic team shall evaluate the suitability of each 
crossing for remote camera operations. Among the factors it shall 
consider are the following: the average annual daily traffic counts; the 
number of highway lanes; highway speed limits; the presence of adjacent 
signalized highway intersections; the number of railroad tracks; the 
angle of the roadway intersection; the volume of school bus, transit 
bus, emergency vehicle, commercial motor vehicle, and hazardous 
materials traffic over the crossing; the minimum remote control 
locomotive operator sight distances of roadway approaches to the 
crossing; and other relevant factors that could affect the safety of the 
crossing. The diagnostic team shall also consider the appropriate number 
of cameras and appropriate camera angles needed to provide for the 
remote operation of remote control locomotives over the crossing. The 
diagnostic team shall agree to a written diagnostic evaluation summary 
of the factors considered and shall provide the railroad with agreed 
upon parameters by which the camera-assisted remote control operation 
may continue in operation if the factors required for suitability 
change; thus, any change in the factors considered by the diagnostic 
team outside of the acceptable parameters shall require the railroad to 
receive a revised evaluation approval from a diagnostic team before 
continuing any such operation. In addition, any of the Federal, State, 
or local governmental authorities may trigger review of a prior 
evaluation approval at any time there is a question of the suitability 
of the operation. It is possible that, of the requirements listed below, 
requirements numbered 2, 4, 5, and 6 would be unnecessary at highway-
rail grade crossings or yard access crossings equipped with approved 
supplemental safety devices (see 49 CFR part 222, app. A) that prevent 
motorists from driving around lowered gates; under such circumstances, 
the diagnostic team shall make such determinations. If a Crossing 
Diagnostic Team, as described in this paragraph, evaluated a crossing 
for the factors described herein, prior to April 14, 2008, another 
diagnostic team evaluation is not required to comply with this rule; 
however, the requirements listed below shall still apply to any such 
remotely controlled movements over that crossing.
    2. Camera-assisted remote control locomotive operations shall only 
be permitted at crossings equipped with flashing lights, gates, and 
constant warning time train detection systems where appropriate, based 
on train speeds.
    3. A crewmember or other qualified employee shall not view the 
monitor in place of the remote control operator, as is permitted for 
other shoving or pushing movements. See Sec. 218.99(b)(3). For purposes 
of remote control locomotive operations with camera/monitor setups to 
protect the point at highway-rail grade crossings, pedestrian crossings, 
and yard access crossings, the remote control operator controlling the 
movement shall view the monitor during such operations.
    4. The cameras shall be arranged to give the remote control 
locomotive operator controlling the movement a view of the rail 
approaches to the crossing from each direction so that the operator can 
accurately judge the end of the movement's proximity to the crossing.
    5. The cameras shall be arranged to give the remote control 
locomotive operator a clear view to determine the speed and driver 
behavior (e.g., driving erratically) of any approaching motor vehicles.
    6. Either the camera resolution shall be sufficient to determine 
whether the flashing lights and gates are working as intended or the 
crossing shall be equipped with a remote health monitoring system that 
is capable of notifying the remote control locomotive operator 
immediately if the flashing lights and gates are not working as 
intended.
    7. The railroad shall notify the Associate Administrator for Safety 
in writing when this type of protection has been installed and activated 
at a crossing.

                             III. Conclusion

    The technology used to aid point protection will undoubtedly develop 
and improve over time. FRA encourages the use and development of this 
technology as is evidenced by the option in this rule to utilize such 
technology. Meanwhile, as a regulating body, FRA cannot determine 
whether a new technology to aid point protection provides an equivalent 
level of protection to that of a direct visual determination unless we 
are made aware of the new technology. Consequently, aside from the 
camera/monitor setups described in this appendix, each railroad that 
intends to implement a technology used to aid point protection shall 
notify the Associate Administrator for Safety in writing of the 
technology to be used prior to implementation.

Administrator for Safety may impose conditions deemed necessary.
    (b) Alternative programs. (1) Upon FRA's recognition of a foreign 
railroad's workplace testing program as compatible with the return-to-
service requirements in subpart B and the requirements of subparts E, F, 
and G of this part, the foreign railroad must comply with either the 
enumerated provisions of part 219 or with the standards of the 
recognized program, and any imposed conditions, with respect to its 
employees whose primary reporting point is outside the United States and 
who perform train or dispatching service in the United States. The 
foreign railroad must also, with respect to its final applicants for, or 
its employees seeking to transfer for the first time to, duties 
involving such train or dispatching service in the United States, comply 
with either subpart E of this part or the standards of the recognized 
program.
    (2) The foreign railroad must comply with subparts A, B (other than 
the return-to-service provisions in Sec. 219.104(d)), C, reasonable 
suspicion testing in subpart D, and subparts I and J. Drug or alcohol 
testing required by these subparts must be conducted in compliance with

testing programs. Each petition for recognition of a foreign workplace 
testing program shall contain:
    (1) The name, title, address, and telephone number of the primary 
person to be contacted with regard to review of the petition;
    (2) The requirements of the foreign railroad workplace testing 
program to be considered for recognition;
    (3) Appropriate data or records, or both, for FRA to consider in 
determining whether the foreign railroad workplace testing program is 
equivalent to the minimum standards contained in this part and provides 
at least an equivalent level of safety.
    (d) Federal Register notice. FRA will publish a notice in the 
Federal Register concerning each petition under paragraph (c) of this 
section that it receives.
    (e) Comment. Not later than 30 days from the date of publication of 
the notice in the Federal Register concerning a petition under paragraph 
(c) of this section, any person may comment on the petition.
    (1) A comment shall set forth specifically the basis upon which it 
is made, and contain a concise statement of the interest of the 
commenter in the proceeding.
    (2) Any comment on a petition should reference the FRA docket and 
notice numbers. A commenter may submit a comment and related material by 
only one of the following methods:
    (i) Web site: http://dms.dot.gov. Follow the instructions for 
submitting comments on the DOT electronic docket site.

complies with the requirements of this section and that the foreign 
railroad's workplace testing program is compatible with the minimum 
standards of this part, the petition will be granted, normally

[[Page 242]]

within 90 days of its receipt. If the petition is neither granted nor 
denied within 90 days, the petition remains pending for decision. FRA 
may attach special conditions to the approval of any petition. Following 
the approval of a petition, FRA may reopen consideration of the petition 
for cause.
    (2) If FRA finds that the petition does not comply with the 
requirements of this section or that the foreign railroad's workplace 
testing program is not compatible with the minimum standards of this 
part, the petition will be denied, normally within 90 days of its 
receipt.
    (3) When FRA grants or denies a petition, or reopens consideration 
of the petition, written notice is sent to the petitioner and other 
interested parties.
    (g) Program recognition. If its program has been recognized, the 
foreign railroad shall maintain a letter on file indicating that it has

    As used in this part--
    Accident or incident reportable under part 225 does not include a 
case that is classified as ``covered data'' under Sec. 225.5 of this 
chapter (i.e., employee injury/illness cases reportable exclusively 
because a physician or other licensed health care professional either 
made a one-time topical application of a prescription-strength 
medication to the employee's injury or made a written recommendation 
that the employee: Take one or more days away from work when the 
employee instead reports to work (or would have reported had he or she 
been scheduled) and takes no days away from work in connection with the 
injury or illness; work restricted duty for one or more days when the 
employee instead works unrestricted (or would have worked unrestricted 
had he or she been scheduled) and takes no other days of restricted work 
activity in connection with the injury or illness; or take over-the-
counter medication at a dosage equal to or greater than the minimum 
prescription strength, whether or not the employee actually takes the 
medication).
    Class I, Class II, and Class III have the meaning assigned by 
regulations of the Surface Transportation Board (49 CFR part 1201; 
General Instructions 1-1).
    Controlled substance has the meaning assigned by 21 U.S.C. 802, and 
includes all substances listed on Schedules I through V as they may be 
revised from time to time (21 CFR Parts 1301-1316).
    Covered employee means a person who has been assigned to perform 
service in the United States subject to the hours of service laws (49 
U.S.C. ch. 211) during a duty tour, whether or not the person has 
performed or is currently performing such service, and any person who 
performs such service. (An employee is not ``covered'' within the 
meaning of this part exclusively by reason of being an employee for 
purposes of 49 U.S.C. 21106.) For the purposes of pre-employment testing 
only, the term ``covered employee'' includes a person applying to 
perform covered service in the United States.
    Covered service means service in the United States that is subject 
to the hours of service laws at 49 U.S.C. 21103, 21104, or 21105, but 
does not include any period the employee is relieved of all 
responsibilities and is free to come and go without restriction.
    Co-worker means another employee of the railroad, including a 
working supervisor directly associated with a yard or train crew, such 
as a conductor or yard foreman, but not including any other railroad 
supervisor, special agent, or officer.

inspector acting under Part 212 of this chapter), the Chief Counsel of 
FRA, or the Chief Counsel's delegate.
    General railroad system of transportation means the general railroad 
system of transportation in the United States.
    Hazardous material means a commodity designated as a hazardous 
material by Part 172 of this title.
    Impact accident means a train accident (i.e., a rail equipment 
accident involving damage in excess of the current reporting threshold 
(see Sec. 225.19(e) of this chapter)) consisting of a head-on 
collision, a rear-end collision, a side collision (including a collision 
at a railroad crossing at grade), a switching collision, or impact with 
a deliberately-placed obstruction such as a bumping post. The following 
are not impact accidents:
    (1) An accident in which the derailment of equipment causes an 
impact with other rail equipment;
    (2) Impact of rail equipment with obstructions such as fallen trees,

operation of equipment in violation of clearance limitations.
    Independent with respect to a medical facility, means not under the 
ownership or control of the railroad and not operated or staffed by a 
salaried officer or employee of the railroad. The fact that the railroad 
pays for services rendered by a medical facility or laboratory, selects 
that entity for performing tests under this part, or has a standing 
contractual relationship with that entity to perform tests under this 
part or perform other medical examinations or tests of railroad 
employees does not, by itself, remove the facility from this definition.
    Medical facility means a hospital, clinic, physician's office, or 
laboratory where toxicological specimens can be collected according to 
recognized professional standards.
    Medical practitioner means a physician or dentist licensed or 
otherwise authorized to practice by the state.

    Positive rate for random drug testing means the number of verified 
positive results for random drug tests conducted under this part plus 
the number of refusals of random drug tests required by this part, 
divided by the total number of random drug tests results (i.e., 
positives, negatives, and refusals) under this part.
    Possess means to have on one's person or in one's personal effects 
or under one's control. However, the concept of possession as used in 
this part does not include control by virtue of presence in the 
employee's personal residence or other similar location off of railroad 
property.
    Railroad means any form of nonhighway ground transportation that 
runs on rails or electromagnetic guideways, and any person providing 
such transportation, including--
    (1) Commuter or other short-haul railroad passenger service in a 
metropolitan or suburban area and commuter railroad service that was 
operated by the Consolidated Rail Corporation on January 1, 1979; and
    (2) High speed ground transportation systems that connect 
metropolitan areas, without regard to whether those systems use new 
technologies not associated with traditional railroads; but does not 
include rapid transit operations in an urban area that are not

[[Page 244]]

connected to the general railroad system of transportation.
    Railroad property damage or damage to railroad property refers to 
damage to railroad property, including railroad on-track equipment, 
signals, track, track structures (including bridges and tunnels), or 
roadbed, including labor costs and all other costs for repair or 
replacement in kind. Estimated cost for replacement of railroad property 
must be calculated as described in the FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/
Incident Reports. (See Sec. 225.21 of this chapter.) However, 
replacement of passenger equipment is calculated based on the cost of 
acquiring a new unit for comparable service.
    Reportable injury means an injury reportable under part 225 of this 
chapter except for an injury that is classified as ``covered data'' 
under Sec. 225.5 of this chapter (i.e., employee injury/illness cases 
reportable exclusively because a physician or other licensed health care 
professional either made a one-time topical application of a 
prescription-strength medication to the employee's injury or made a 
written recommendation that the employee: Take one or more days away 
from work when the employee instead reports to work (or would have 
reported had he or she been scheduled) and takes no days away from work 
in connection with the injury or illness; work restricted duty for one 
or more days when the employee instead works unrestricted (or would have 
worked unrestricted had he or she been scheduled) and takes no other 
days of restricted work activity in connection with the injury or 
illness; or take over-the-counter medication at a dosage equal to or 
greater than the minimum prescription strength, whether or not the 
employee actually takes the medication.

Sec. 219.7  Waivers.

    (a) A person subject to a requirement of this part may petition the 
FRA for a waiver of compliance with such requirement.
    (b) Each petition for waiver under this section must be filed in a 
manner and contain the information required by Part 211 of this chapter. 
A petition for waiver of the Part 40 prohibition against stand down of 
an employee before the Medical Review Officer has completed the 
verification must also comply with Sec. 40.21 of this title.
    (c) If the FRA Administrator finds that waiver of compliance is in 
the public interest and is consistent with railroad safety, the 
Administrator may grant the waiver subject to any necessary conditions.
    (d) Special dispensation for employees performing train or 
dispatching service on existing cross-border operations. If a foreign 
railroad requests a waiver not

[[Page 245]]

later than August 10, 2004, for an existing cross-border operation, 
subparts E, F, and G of this part shall not apply to train or 
dispatching service on that operation in the United States performed by 
an employee of a foreign railroad whose primary reporting point is 
outside the United States, until the railroad's waiver request is acted 
upon by FRA.
    (e) Waiver requests for employees performing train or dispatching 
service on new or expanded cross-border operations. A foreign railroad 
seeking a waiver from subparts E, F, and G of this part for its 
employees performing train or dispatching service on a new cross-border 
operation that proceeds more than 10 route miles into the United States, 
or a formerly excepted cross-border operation that expands beyond the 10 
mile limited haul exception in paragraph (d) of this section, must file 
a petition not later than 90 days before commencing the subject 
operation. FRA will attempt to decide on such petitions within 90 days. 
If no action is taken on the petition within 90 days, the petition 
remains pending for decision and the cross-border crew assignments on 
the operation covered by the petition will be subject to subparts E, F, 
and G until FRA grants the petition should the petitioner commence the 
proposed operation.

<R05>
Sec. 219.9  Responsibility for compliance.

    (a) Any person (an entity of any type covered under 1 U.S.C. 1, 
including but not limited to the following: A railroad; a manager, 
supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of a railroad; any 
owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, or 
facilities; any independent contractor providing goods or services to a 
railroad; and any employee of such owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee, 
or independent contractor) who violates any requirement of this part or 
causes the violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil 
penalty of at least $550 and not more than $16,000 per violation, except 
that: Penalties may be assessed against individuals only for willful 
violations; where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated 
violations has created an imminent hazard of death or injury, or has 
caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $27,000 per violation 
may be assessed; and the standard of liability for a railroad will vary 
depending upon the requirement involved. See, e.g., Sec. 219.105, which 
must be construed to qualify the responsibility of a railroad for the 
unauthorized conduct of an employee that violates Sec. 219.101 or Sec. 
219.102 (while imposing a duty of due diligence to prevent such 
conduct). Each day a violation continues constitutes a separate offense. 
See Appendix A to this part for a statement of agency civil penalty 
policy.
    (b)(1) In the case of joint operations, primary responsibility for 
compliance with this part with respect to determination of events 
qualifying for breath or body fluid testing under Subparts C and D of 
this part rests with the host railroad, and all affected employees must 
be responsive to direction from the host railroad consistent with this 
part. However, nothing in this paragraph (b)(1) restricts the ability of 
the railroads to provide for an appropriate assignment of responsibility 
for compliance with this part as among those railroads through a joint 
operating agreement or other binding contract. FRA reserves the right to 
bring an enforcement action for noncompliance with applicable portions 
of this part against the host railroad, the employing railroad, or both.
    (2) Where an employee of one railroad is required to participate in 
breath or body fluid testing under Subpart C or D of this part and is 
subsequently subject to adverse action alleged to have arisen out of the 
required test (or alleged refusal thereof), necessary witnesses and 
documents available to the other railroad must be made available to the 
employee on a reasonable basis.
    (c) Any independent contractor or other entity that performs covered 
service for a railroad has the same responsibilities as a railroad under 
this part, with respect to its employees who perform covered service. 
The entity's responsibility for compliance with this part may be 
fulfilled either directly by that entity or by the railroad's treating 
the entity's employees who perform covered service as if they were its 
own

[[Page 246]]

employees for purposes of this part. The responsibility for compliance 
must be clearly spelled out in the contract between the railroad and the 
other entity or in another document. In the absence of such a clear 
delineation of responsibility, FRA will hold the railroad and the other 
entity jointly and severally liable for compliance.

<R05>
Sec. 219.11  General conditions for chemical tests.

    (a) Any employee who performs covered service for a railroad is 
deemed to have consented to testing as required in subparts B, C, D, and 
G of this part; and consent is implied by performance of such service.
    (b)(1) Each such employee must participate in such testing, as 
required under the conditions set forth in this part by a representative 
of the railroad.
    (2) In any case where an employee has sustained a personal injury 
and is subject to alcohol or drug testing under this part, necessary 
medical treatment must be accorded priority over provision of the breath 
or body fluid specimen(s).
    (3) Failure to remain available following an accident or casualty as 
required by company rules (i.e., being absent without leave) is 
considered a refusal to participate in testing, without regard to any 
subsequent provision of specimens.
    (c) A covered employee who is required to be tested under subpart C 
or D of this part and who is taken to a medical facility for observation 
or treatment after an accident or incident is deemed to have consented 
to the release to FRA of the following:
    (1) The remaining portion of any body fluid specimen taken by the 
treating facility within 12 hours of the accident or incident that is 
not required for medical purposes, together with any normal medical 
facility record(s) pertaining to the taking of such specimen;
    (2) The results of any laboratory tests for alcohol or any drug 
conducted by or for the treating facility on such specimen;
    (3) The identity, dosage, and time of administration of any drugs 
administered by the treating facility prior to the time specimens were 
taken by the treating facility or prior to the time specimens were taken 
in compliance with this part; and
    (4) The results of any breath tests for alcohol conducted by or for 
the treating facility.
    (d) An employee required to participate in body fluid testing under 
subpart C of this part (post-accident toxicological testing) or testing 
subject to subpart H of this part shall, if requested by the 
representative of the railroad or the medical facility (including, under 
subpart H of this part, a non-medical contract collector), evidence 
consent to taking of specimens, their release for toxicological analysis 
under pertinent provisions of this part, and release of the test results 
to the railroad's Medical Review Officer by promptly executing a consent 
form, if required by the medical facility. The employee is not required 
to execute any document or clause waiving rights that the employee would 
otherwise have against the employer, and any such waiver is void. The 
employee may not be required to waive liability with respect to 
negligence on the part of any person participating in the collection, 
handling or analysis of the specimen or to indemnify any person for the 
negligence of others. Any consent provided consistent with this section 
may be construed to extend only to those actions specified in this 
section.
    (e) Nothing in this part may be construed to authorize the use of 
physical coercion or any other deprivation of liberty in order to compel 
breath or body fluid testing.
    (f) Any railroad employee who performs service for a railroad is 
deemed to have consented to removal of body fluid and/or tissue 
specimens necessary for toxicological analysis from the remains of such 
employee, if such employee dies within 12 hours of an accident or 
incident described in subpart C of this part as a result of such event. 
This consent is specifically required of employees not in covered 
service, as well as employees in covered service.
    (g) Each supervisor responsible for covered employees (except a 
working

[[Page 247]]

supervisor within the definition of co-worker under this part) must be 
trained in the signs and symptoms of alcohol and drug influence, 
intoxication and misuse consistent with a program of instruction to be 
made available for inspection upon demand by FRA. Such a program shall, 
at a minimum, provide information concerning the acute behavioral and 
apparent physiological effects of alcohol and the major drug groups on 
the controlled substances list. The program must also provide training 
on the qualifying criteria for post-accident testing contained in 
subpart C of this part, and the role of the supervisor in post-accident 
collections described in subpart C and Appendix C of this part. The 
duration of such training may not be less than 3 hours.
    (h) Nothing in this subpart restricts any discretion available to 
the railroad to request or require that an employee cooperate in 
additional body fluid testing. However, no such testing may be performed 
on urine or blood specimens provided under this part. For purposes of 
this paragraph (h), all urine from a void constitutes a single specimen.
    (i) A railroad required or authorized to conduct testing under this 
part may conduct all such testing in the United States. A foreign 
railroad required to conduct testing under this part may conduct such 
tests in its home country, provided that it otherwise complies with the 
requirements of this part.

Sec. 219.13  Preemptive effect.

    (a) Under section 20106 of title 49, United States Code, issuance of 
the regulations in this part preempts any State law, rule, regulation, 
order or standard covering the same subject matter, except a provision 
directed at a local hazard that is consistent with this part and that 
does not impose an undue burden on interstate commerce.
    (b) FRA does not intend by issuance of the regulations in this part 
to preempt provisions of State criminal law that impose sanctions for 
reckless conduct that leads to actual loss of life, injury or damage to 
property, whether such provisions apply specifically to railroad 
employees or generally to the public at large.

    Nothing in this part--
    (a) Restricts the power of FRA to conduct investigations under 
sections 20107, 20108, 20111, and 20112 of title 49, United States Code; 
or
    (b) Creates a private right of action on the part of any person for

noncompliance with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 219.19  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 219.21  Information collection.

    (a) The information collection requirements of this part have been 
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) and have been 
assigned OMB control number 2130-0526.
    (b) The information collection requirements are found in the 
following sections: 219.7, 219.23, 219.104, 219.201, 219.203, 219.205, 
219.207, 219.209, 219.211, 219.213, 219.303, 219.401, 219.403, 219.405,

219.803, 219.901, and 219.903.


<R05>
Sec. 219.23  Railroad policies.

    (a) Whenever a breath or body fluid test is required of an employee 
under this part, the railroad must provide clear and unequivocal written 
notice to the employee that the test is being required under FRA 
regulations. Use of the mandated DOT form for drug or alcohol testing 
satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (a).
    (b) Whenever a breath or body fluid test is required of an employee 
under this part, the railroad must provide clear, unequivocal written 
notice of the basis or bases upon which the test is required (e.g., 
reasonable suspicion, violation of a specified operating/safety rule 
enumerated in subpart D of this part, random selection, follow-up, 
etc.). Completion of the DOT alcohol or drug testing form indicating the 
basis of the test (prior to providing a copy to the employee) satisfies 
the requirement of

[[Page 248]]

this paragraph (b). Use of the DOT form for non-Federal tests is 
prohibited.
    (c) Use of approved forms for mandatory post-accident toxicological 
testing under subpart C of this part provides the notifications required 
under this section with respect to such tests. Use of those forms for 
any other test is prohibited.
    (d) Each railroad must provide educational materials that explain 
the requirements of this part, and the railroad's policies and 
procedures with respect to meeting those requirements.
    (1) The railroad must ensure that a copy of these materials is 
distributed to each covered employee prior to the start of alcohol 
testing under the railroad's alcohol misuse prevention program and to 
each person subsequently hired for or transferred to a covered position.
    (2) Each railroad must provide written notice to representatives of 
employee organizations of the availability of this information.
    (e) Required content. The materials to be made available to 
employees must include detailed discussion of at least the following:
    (1) The identity of the person designated by the railroad to answer 
employee questions about the materials.
    (2) The classes or crafts of employees who are subject to the 
provisions of this part.
    (3) Sufficient information about the safety-sensitive functions 
performed by those employees to make clear that the period of the work 
day the covered employee is required to be in compliance with this part 
is that period when the employee is on duty and is required to perform 
or is available to perform covered service.
    (4) Specific information concerning employee conduct that is 
prohibited under subpart B of this part.
    (5) In the case of a railroad utilizing the accident/incident and 
rule violation reasonable cause testing authority provided by this part, 
prior notice (which may be combined with the notice required by 
Sec. Sec. 219.601(d)(1) and 219.607(d)(1)), to covered employees of the 
circumstances under which they will be subject to testing.
    (6) The circumstances under which a covered employee will be tested 
under this part.
    (7) The procedures that will be used to test for the presence of 
alcohol and controlled substances, protect the employee and the 
integrity of the testing processes, safeguard the validity of the test 
results, and ensure that those results are attributed to the correct 
employee.
    (8) The requirement that a covered employee submit to alcohol and 
drug tests administered in accordance with this part.
    (9) An explanation of what constitutes a refusal to submit to an 
alcohol or drug test and the attendant consequences.
    (10) The consequences for covered employees found to have violated 
Subpart B of this part, including the requirement that the employee be 
removed immediately from covered service, and the procedures under Sec. 
219.104.
    (11) The consequences for covered employees found to have an alcohol 
concentration of .02 or greater but less than .04.
    (12) Information concerning the effects of alcohol misuse on an 
individual's health, work, and personal life; signs and symptoms of an 
alcohol problem (the employee's or a coworker's); and available methods 
of evaluating and resolving problems associated with the misuse of 
alcohol, including utilization of the procedures set forth in subpart E 
of this part and the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of 
substance abuse professionals and counseling and treatment programs.
    (f) Optional provisions. The materials supplied to employees may 
also include information on additional railroad policies with respect to 
the use or possession of alcohol and drugs, including any consequences 
for an employee found to have a specific alcohol concentration, that are 
based on the railroad's authority independent of this part. Any such 
additional policies or consequences must be clearly and obviously 
described as being based on independent authority.

<R04>
                         Subpart B_Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 219.101  Alcohol and drug use prohibited.

    (a) Prohibitions. Except as provided in Sec. 219.103--
    (1) No employee may use or possess alcohol or any controlled 
substance while assigned by a railroad to perform covered service.
    (2) No employee may report for covered service, or go or remain on 
duty in covered service while--
    (i) Under the influence of or impaired by alcohol;
    (ii) Having .04 or more alcohol concentration in the breath or 
blood; or
    (iii) Under the influence of or impaired by any controlled 
substance.
    (3) No employee may use alcohol for whichever is the lesser of the 
following periods:
    (i) Within four hours of reporting for covered service; or
    (ii) After receiving notice to report for covered service.
    (4) No employee tested under the provisions of this part whose test 
result indicates an alcohol concentration of .02 or greater but less 
than .04 may perform or continue to perform covered service functions 
for a railroad, nor may a railroad permit the employee to perform or 
continue to perform covered service, until the start of the employee's 
next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than eight hours 
following administration of the test.
    (5) If an employee tested under the provisions of this part has a 
test result indicating an alcohol concentration below 0.02, the test 
must be considered negative and is not evidence of alcohol misuse. A 
railroad may not use a federal test result below 0.02 either as evidence 
in a company proceeding or as a basis for subsequent testing under 
company authority. A railroad may take further action to compel 
cooperation in other breath or body fluid testing only if it has an 
independent basis for doing so.
    (b) Controlled substance. ``Controlled substance'' is defined by 
Sec. 219.5. Controlled substances are grouped as follows: marijuana, 
narcotics (such as heroin and codeine), stimulants (such as cocaine and 
amphetamines), depressants (such as barbiturates and minor 
tranquilizers), and hallucinogens (such as the drugs known as PCP and 
LSD). Controlled substances include illicit drugs (Schedule I), drugs 
that are required to be distributed only by a medical practitioner's 
prescription or other authorization (Schedules II through IV, and some 
drugs on Schedule V), and certain preparations for which distribution is 
through documented over the counter sales (Schedule V only).
    (c) Railroad rules. Nothing in this section restricts a railroad 
from imposing an absolute prohibition on the presence of alcohol or any 
drug in the body fluids of persons in its employ, whether in furtherance 
of the purpose of this part or for other purposes.
    (d) Construction. This section may not be construed to prohibit the 
presence of an unopened container of an alcoholic beverage in a private 
motor vehicle that is not subject to use in the business of the 
railroad; nor may it be construed to restrict a railroad from 
prohibiting such presence under its own rules.


<R05>
Sec. 219.102  Prohibition on abuse of controlled substances.

    No employee who performs covered service may use a controlled 
substance at any time, whether on duty or off duty, except as permitted 
by Sec. 219.103.


<R05>
Sec. 219.103  Prescribed and over-the-counter drugs.

    (a) This subpart does not prohibit the use of a controlled substance 
(on Schedules II through V of the controlled substance list) prescribed 
or authorized by a medical practitioner, or possession incident to such 
use, if--
    (1) The treating medical practitioner or a physician designated by 
the railroad has made a good faith judgment, with notice of the 
employee's assigned duties and on the basis of the available medical 
history, that use of the substance by the employee at the prescribed or 
authorized dosage level is consistent with the safe performance of the 
employee's duties;
    (2) The substance is used at the dosage prescribed or authorized; 
and
    (3) In the event the employee is being treated by more than one 
medical practitioner, at least one treating medical practitioner has 
been informed of all

[[Page 250]]

medications authorized or prescribed and has determined that use of the 
medications is consistent with the safe performance of the employee's 
duties (and the employee has observed any restrictions imposed with 
respect to use of the medications in combination).
    (b) This subpart does not restrict any discretion available to the 
railroad to require that employees notify the railroad of therapeutic 
drug use or obtain prior approval for such use.


<R05>
Sec. 219.104  Responsive action.

    (a) Removal from covered service. (1) If the railroad determines 
that an employee has violated Sec. 219.101 or Sec. 219.102, or the 
alcohol or controlled substances misuse rule of another DOT agency, the 
railroad must immediately remove the employee from covered service and 
the procedures described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section 
apply.
    (2) If an employee refuses to provide breath or a body fluid 
specimen or specimens when required to by the railroad under a mandatory 
provision of this part, the railroad must immediately remove the 
employee from covered service, and the procedures described in 
paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section apply.
    (3)(i) This section does not apply to actions based on breath or 
body fluid tests for alcohol or drugs that are conducted exclusively 
under authority other than that provided in this part (e.g., testing 
under a company medical policy, for-cause testing policy wholly 
independent of subpart D of this part, or testing under a labor 
agreement).
    (ii) This section and the information requirements listed in Sec. 
219.23 do not apply to applicants who refuse to submit to a pre-
employment test or who have a pre-employment test with a result 
indicating the misuse of alcohol or controlled substances.
    (b) Notice. Prior to or upon withdrawing the employee from covered 
service under this section, the railroad must provide notice to the 
employee of the reason for this action.
    (c) Hearing procedures. (1) If the employee denies that the test 
result is valid evidence of alcohol or drug use prohibited by this 
subpart, the employee may demand and must be provided an opportunity for 
a prompt post-suspension hearing before a presiding officer other than 
the charging official. This hearing may be consolidated with any 
disciplinary hearing arising from the same accident or incident (or 
conduct directly related thereto), but the presiding officer must make 
separate findings as to compliance with Sec. Sec. 219.101 and 219.102.
    (2) The hearing must be convened within the period specified in the 
applicable collective bargaining agreement. In the absence of an 
agreement provision, the employee may demand that the hearing be 
convened within 10 calendar days of the suspension or, in the case of an 
employee who is unavailable due to injury, illness, or other sufficient 
cause, within 10 days of the date the employee becomes available for 
hearing.
    (3) A post-suspension proceeding conforming to the requirements of 
an applicable collective bargaining agreement, together with the 
provisions for adjustment of disputes under sec. 3 of the Railway Labor 
Act (49 U.S.C. 153), satisfies the procedural requirements of this 
paragraph (c).
    (4) Nothing in this part may be deemed to abridge any additional 
procedural rights or remedies not inconsistent with this part that are 
available to the employee under a collective bargaining agreement, the 
Railway Labor Act, or (with respect to employment at will) at common law 
with respect to the removal or other adverse action taken as a 
consequence of a positive test result in a test authorized or required 
by this part.
    (5) Nothing in this part restricts the discretion of the railroad to 
treat an employee's denial of prohibited alcohol or drug use as a waiver 
of any privilege the employee would otherwise enjoy to have such 
prohibited alcohol or drug use treated as a non-disciplinary matter or 
to have discipline held in abeyance.
    (d) The railroad must comply with the return-to-service and follow-
up testing requirements, and the Substance Abuse Professional conflict-
of-interest prohibitions, contained in Sec. Sec. 40.305, 40.307, and 
40.299 of this title, respectively.

<R05>
Sec. 219.105  Railroad's duty to prevent violations.

    (a) A railroad may not, with actual knowledge, permit an employee to 
go or remain on duty in covered service in violation of the prohibitions 
of Sec. 219.101 or Sec. 219.102. As used in this section, the 
knowledge imputed to the railroad must be limited to that of a railroad 
management employee (such as a supervisor deemed an ``officer,'' whether 
or not such person is a corporate officer) or a supervisory employee in 
the offending employee's chain of command.
    (b) A railroad must exercise due diligence to assure compliance with 
Sec. Sec. 219.101 and 219.102 by each covered employee.


<R05>
Sec. 219.107  Consequences of unlawful refusal.

    (a) An employee who refuses to provide breath or a body fluid 
specimen or specimens when required to by the railroad under a mandatory 
provision of this part must be deemed disqualified for a period of nine 
(9) months.
    (b) Prior to or upon withdrawing the employee from covered service 
under this section, the railroad must provide notice of the reason for 
this action, and the procedures described in Sec. 219.104(c) apply.
    (c) The disqualification required by this section applies with 
respect to employment in covered service by any railroad with notice of 
such disqualification.
    (d) The requirement of disqualification for nine (9) months does not 
limit any discretion on the part of the railroad to impose additional 
sanctions for the same or related conduct.
    (e) Upon the expiration of the 9-month period described in this 
section, a railroad may permit the employee to return to covered service 
only under the same conditions specified in Sec. 219.104(d), and the 
employee must be subject to follow-up tests, as provided by that 
section.

              Subpart C_Post-Accident Toxicological Testing


<R05>
Sec. 219.201  Events for which testing is required.

    (a) List of events. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, post-accident toxicological tests must be conducted after any 
event that involves one or more of the circumstances described in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section:
    (1) Major train accident. Any train accident (i.e., a rail equipment 
accident involving damage in excess of the current reporting threshold) 
that involves one or more of the following:
    (i) A fatality;
    (ii) A release of hazardous material lading from railroad equipment 
accompanied by--
    (A) An evacuation; or
    (B) A reportable injury resulting from the hazardous material 
release (e.g., from fire, explosion, inhalation, or skin contact with 
the material); or
    (iii) Damage to railroad property of $1,000,000 or more.
    (2) Impact accident. An impact accident (i.e., a rail equipment 
accident defined as an ``impact accident'' in Sec. 219.5) that involves 
damage in excess of the current reporting threshold, resulting in--
    (i) A reportable injury; or
    (ii) Damage to railroad property of $150,000 or more.
    (3) Fatal train incident. Any train incident that involves a 
fatality to any on-duty railroad employee.
    (4) Passenger train accident. Reportable injury to any person in a 
train accident (i.e., a rail equipment accident involving damage in 
excess of the current reporting threshold) involving a passenger train.
    (b) Exceptions. No test may be required in the case of a collision 
between railroad rolling stock and a motor vehicle or other highway 
conveyance at a rail/highway grade crossing. No test may be required in 
the case of an accident/incident the cause and severity of which are 
wholly attributable to a natural cause (e.g., flood, tornado, or other 
natural disaster) or to vandalism or trespasser(s), as determined on the 
basis of objective

[[Page 252]]

and documented facts by the railroad representative responding to the 
scene.
    (c) Good faith determinations. (1)(i) The railroad representative 
responding to the scene of the accident/incident must determine whether 
the accident/incident falls within the requirements of paragraph (a) of 
this section or is within the exception described in paragraph (b) of 
this section. It is the duty of the railroad representative to make 
reasonable inquiry into the facts as necessary to make such 
determinations. In making such inquiry, the railroad representative must 
consider the need to obtain specimens as soon as practical in order to 
determine the presence or absence of impairing substances reasonably 
contemporaneous with the accident/incident. The railroad representative 
satisfies the requirement of this section if, after making reasonable 
inquiry, the representative exercises good faith judgement in making the 
required determinations.
    (ii) The railroad representative making the determinations required 
by this section may not be a person directly involved in the accident/
incident. This section does not prohibit consultation between the 
responding railroad representative and higher level railroad officials; 
however, the responding railroad representative must make the factual 
determinations required by this section.
    (iii) Upon specific request made to the railroad by the Associate 
Administrator for Safety, FRA (or the Associate Administrator's 
delegate), the railroad must provide a report describing any decision by 
a person other than the responding railroad representative with respect 
to whether an accident/incident qualifies for testing. This report must 
be affirmed by the decision maker and must be provided to FRA within 72 
hours of the request. The report must include the facts reported by the 
responding railroad representative, the basis upon which the testing 
decision was made, and the person making the decision.
    (iv) Any estimates of railroad property damage made by persons not 
at the scene must be based on descriptions of specific physical damage 
provided by the on-scene railroad representative.
    (v) In the case of an accident involving passenger equipment, a host 
railroad may rely upon the damage estimates provided by the passenger 
railroad (whether present on scene or not) in making the decision 
whether testing is required, subject to the same requirement that 
visible physical damage be specifically described.
    (2) A railroad must not require an employee to provide blood or 
urine specimens under the authority or procedures of this subject unless 
the railroad has made the determinations required by this section, based 
upon reasonable inquiry and good faith judgment. A railroad does not act 
in excess of its authority under this subpart if its representative has 
made such reasonable inquiry and exercised such good faith judgment, but 
it is later determined, after investigation, that one or more of the 
conditions thought to have required testing were not, in fact, present. 
However, this section does not excuse the railroad for any error arising 
from a mistake of law (e.g., application of testing criteria other than 
those contained in this part).
    (3) A railroad is not in violation of this subpart if its 
representative has made such reasonable inquiry and exercised such good 
faith judgment but nevertheless errs in determining that post-accident 
testing is not required.
    (4) An accident/incident with respect to which the railroad has made 
reasonable inquiry and exercised good faith judgment in determining the 
facts necessary to apply the criteria contained in paragraph (a) of this 
section is deemed a qualifying event for purposes of specimen analysis, 
reporting, and other purposes.
    (5) In the event specimens are collected following an event 
determined by FRA not to be a qualifying event within the meaning of 
this section, FRA directs its designated laboratory to destroy any 
specimen material submitted and to refrain from disclosing to any person 
the results of any analysis conducted.


<R05>
Sec. 219.203  Responsibilities of railroads and employees.

    (a) Employees tested. (1)(i) Following each accident and incident 
described in Sec. 219.201, the railroad (or railroads)

[[Page 253]]

must take all practicable steps to assure that all covered employees of 
the railroad directly involved in the accident or incident provide blood 
and urine specimens for toxicological testing by FRA. Such employees 
must cooperate in the provision of specimens as described in this part 
and Appendix C to this part.
    (ii) If the conditions for mandatory toxicological testing exist, 
the railroad may also require employees to provide breath for testing in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in part 40 of this title and in 
this part, if such testing does not interfere with timely collection of 
required specimens.
    (2) Such employees must specifically include each and every 
operating employee assigned as a crew member of any train involved in 
the accident or incident. In any case where an operator, dispatcher, 
signal maintainer or other covered employee is directly and 
contemporaneously involved in the circumstances of the accident/
incident, those employees must also be required to provide specimens.
    (3) An employee must be excluded from testing under the following 
circumstances: In any case of an accident/incident for which testing is 
mandated only under Sec. 219.201(a)(2) (an ``impact accident''), Sec. 
219.201(a)(3) (``fatal train incident''), or Sec. 219.201(a)(4) (a 
``passenger train accident with injury'') if the railroad representative 
can immediately determine, on the basis of specific information, that 
the employee had no role in the cause(s) or severity of the accident/
incident. The railroad representative must consider any such information 
immediately available at the time the qualifying event determination is 
made under Sec. 219.201.
    (4) The following provisions govern accidents/incidents involving 
non-covered employees:
    (i) Surviving non-covered employees are not subject to testing under 
this subpart.
    (ii) Testing of the remains of non-covered employees who are fatally 
injured in train accidents and incidents is required.
    (b) Timely specimen collection. (1) The railroad must make every 
reasonable effort to assure that specimens are provided as soon as 
possible after the accident or incident.
    (2) This paragraph (b) must not be construed to inhibit the 
employees required to be tested from performing, in the immediate 
aftermath of the accident or incident, any duties that may be necessary 
for the preservation of life or property. However, where practical, the 
railroad must utilize other employees to perform such duties.
    (3) In the case of a passenger train which is in proper condition to 
continue to the next station or its destination after an accident or 
incident, the railroad must consider the safety and convenience of 
passengers in determining whether the crew is immediately available for 
testing. A relief crew must be called to relieve the train crew as soon 
as possible.
    (4) Covered employees who may be subject to testing under this 
subpart must be retained in duty status for the period necessary to make 
the determinations required by Sec. 219.201 and this section and (as 
appropriate) to complete the specimen collection procedure. An employee 
may not be recalled for testing under this subpart if that employee has 
been released from duty under the normal procedures of the railroad, 
except that an employee may be immediately recalled for testing if--
    (i) The employee could not be retained in duty status because the 
employee went off duty under normal carrier procedures prior to being 
contacted by a railroad supervisor and instructed to remain on duty 
pending completion of the required determinations (e.g., in the case of 
a dispatcher or signal maintainer remote from the scene of an accident 
who was unaware of the occurrence at the time the employee went off 
duty);
    (ii) The railroad's preliminary investigation (contemporaneous with 
the determination required by Sec. 219.201) indicates a clear 
probability that the employee played a major role in the cause or 
severity of the accident/incident; and
    (iii) The accident/incident actually occurred during the employee's 
duty tour. An employee who has been transported to receive medical care 
is not released from duty for purposes of this

[[Page 254]]

section. Nothing in this section prohibits the subsequent testing of an 
employee who has failed to remain available for testing as required 
(i.e., who is absent without leave); but subsequent testing does not 
excuse such refusal by the employee timely to provide the required 
specimens.
    (c) Place of specimen collection. (1) Employees must be transported 
to an independent medical facility where the specimens must be obtained. 
The railroad must pre-designate for such testing one or more such 
facilities in reasonable proximity to any location where the railroad 
conducts operations. Designation must be made on the basis of the 
willingness of the facility to conduct specimen collection and the 
ability of the facility to complete specimen collection promptly, 
professionally, and in accordance with pertinent requirements of this 
part. In all cases blood may be drawn only by a qualified medical 
professional or by a qualified technician subject to the supervision of 
a qualified medical professional.
    (2) In the case of an injured employee, the railroad must request 
the treating medical facility to obtain the specimens.
    (d) Obtaining cooperation of facility. (1) In seeking the 
cooperation of a medical facility in obtaining a specimen under this 
subpart, the railroad shall, as necessary, make specific reference to 
the requirements of this subpart.
    (2) If an injured employee is unconscious or otherwise unable to 
evidence consent to the procedure and the treating medical facility 
declines to obtain blood specimens after having been acquainted with the 
requirements of this subpart, the railroad must immediately notify the 
duty officer at the National Response Center (NRC) at (800) 424-8801 or 
(800) 424-8802, stating the employee's name, the medical facility, its 
location, the name of the appropriate decisional authority at the 
medical facility, and the telephone number at which that person can be 
reached. FRA will then take appropriate measures to assist in obtaining 
the required specimen.
    (e) Discretion of physician. Nothing in this subpart may be 
construed to limit the discretion of a physician to determine whether 
drawing a blood specimen is consistent with the health of an injured 
employee or an employee afflicted by any other condition that may 
preclude drawing the specified quantity of blood.


<R05>
Sec. 219.205  Specimen collection and handling.

    (a) General. Urine and blood specimens must be obtained, marked, 
preserved, handled, and made available to FRA consistent with the 
requirements of this subpart, and the technical specifications set forth 
in Appendix C to this part.
    (b) Information requirements. In order to process specimens, analyze 
the significance of laboratory findings, and notify the railroads and 
employees of test results, it is necessary to obtain basic information 
concerning the accident/incident and any treatment administered after 
the accident/incident. Accordingly, the railroad representative must 
complete the information required by Form FRA 6180.73 (revised) for 
shipping with the specimens. Each employee subject to testing must 
cooperate in completion of the required information on Form FRA F 
6180.74 (revised) for inclusion in the shipping kit and processing of 
the specimens. The railroad representative must request an appropriate 
representative of the medical facility to complete the remaining portion 
of the information on each Form 6180.74. One Form 6180.73 must be 
forwarded in the shipping kit with each group of specimens. One Form 
6180.74 must be forwarded in the shipping kit for each employee who 
provides specimens. Forms 6180.73 and 6180.74 may be ordered from the 
laboratory specified in Appendix B to this part; the forms are also 
provided to railroads free of charge in the shipping kit. (See paragraph 
(c) of this section.)
    (c) Shipping kit. (1) FRA and the laboratory designated in Appendix 
B to this part make available for purchase a limited number of standard 
shipping kits for the purpose of routine handling of toxicological 
specimens under this subpart. Whenever possible, specimens must be 
placed in the shipping kit prepared for shipment according to the 
instructions provided in the kit and Appendix C to this part.

[[Page 255]]

    (2) Kits may be ordered directly from the laboratory designated in 
Appendix B to this part.
    (3) FRA maintains a limited number of kits at its field offices. A 
Class III railroad may utilize kits in FRA's possession, rather than 
maintaining such kits on its property.
    (d) Shipment. Specimens must be shipped as soon as possible by pre-
paid air express or air freight (or other means adequate to ensure 
delivery within twenty-four (24) hours from time of shipment) to the 
laboratory designated in Appendix B to this part. Where express courier 
pickup is available, the railroad must request the medical facility to 
transfer the sealed toxicology kit directly to the express courier for 
transportation. If courier pickup is not available at the medical 
facility where the specimens are collected or for any other reason 
prompt transfer by the medical facility cannot be assured, the railroad 
must promptly transport the sealed shipping kit holding the specimens to 
the most expeditious point of shipment via air express, air freight or 
equivalent means. The railroad must maintain and document secure chain 
of custody of the kit from release by the medical facility to delivery 
for transportation, as described in Appendix C to this part.


<R05>
Sec. 219.206  FRA access to breath test results.

    Documentation of breath test results must be made available to FRA 
consistent with the requirements of this subpart, and the technical 
specifications set forth in Appendix C to this part.


<R05>
Sec. 219.207  Fatality.

    (a) In the case of an employee fatality in an accident or incident 
described in Sec. 219.201, body fluid and/or tissue specimens must be 
obtained from the remains of the employee for toxicological testing. To 
ensure that specimens are timely collected, the railroad must 
immediately notify the appropriate local authority (such as a coroner or 
medical examiner) of the fatality and the requirements of this subpart, 
making available the shipping kit and requesting the local authority to 
assist in obtaining the necessary body fluid or tissue specimens. The 
railroad must also seek the assistance of the custodian of the remains, 
if a person other than the local authority.
    (b) If the local authority or custodian of the remains declines to 
cooperate in obtaining the necessary specimens, the railroad must 
immediately notify the duty officer at the National Response Center 
(NRC) at (800) 424-8801 or (800) 424-8802 by providing the following 
information:
    (1) Date and location of the accident or incident;
    (2) Railroad;
    (3) Name of the deceased;
    (4) Name and telephone number of custodian of the remains; and
    (5) Name and telephone number of local authority contacted.
    (c) A coroner, medical examiner, pathologist, Aviation Medical 
Examiner, or other qualified professional is authorized to remove the 
required body fluid and/or tissue specimens from the remains on request 
of the railroad or FRA pursuant to this part; and, in so acting, such 
person is the delegate of the FRA Administrator under sections 20107 and 
20108 of title 49, United States Code (but not the agent of the 
Secretary for purposes of the Federal Tort Claims Act (chapter 171 of 
title 28, United States Code). Such qualified professional may rely upon 
the representations of the railroad or FRA representative with respect 
to the occurrence of the event requiring that toxicological tests be 
conducted and the coverage of the deceased employee under this part.
    (d) Appendix C to this part specifies body fluid and tissue 
specimens required for toxicological analysis in the case of a fatality.


<R05>
Sec. 219.209  Reports of tests and refusals.

    (a)(1) A railroad that has experienced one or more events for which 
specimens were obtained must provide prompt telephonic notification 
summarizing such events. Notification must immediately be provided to 
the duty officer at the National Response Center (NRC) at (800) 424-8802 
and to the Office of Safety, FRA, at (202) 493-6313.
    (2) Each telephonic report must contain:
    (i) Name of railroad;

[[Page 256]]

    (ii) Name, title and telephone number of person making the report;
    (iii) Time, date and location of the accident/incident;
    (iv) Brief summary of the circumstances of the accident/incident, 
including basis for testing; and
    (v) Number, names and occupations of employees tested.
    (b) If the railroad is unable, as a result of non-cooperation of an 
employee or for any other reason, to obtain a specimen and cause it to 
be provided to FRA as required by this subpart, the railroad must make a 
concise narrative report of the reason for such failure and, if 
appropriate, any action taken in response to the cause of such failure. 
This report must be appended to the report of the accident/incident 
required to be submitted under Part 225 of this chapter.
    (c) If a test required by this section is not administered within 
four hours following the accident or incident, the railroad must prepare 
and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the test was not 
promptly administered. Records must be submitted to FRA upon request of 
the FRA Associate Administrator for Safety.


<R05>
Sec. 219.211  Analysis and follow-up.

    (a) The laboratory designated in Appendix B to this part undertakes 
prompt analysis of specimens provided under this subpart, consistent 
with the need to develop all relevant information and produce a complete 
report. Specimens are analyzed for alcohol and controlled substances 
specified by FRA under protocols specified by FRA, summarized in 
Appendix C to this part, which have been submitted to Health and Human 
Services for acceptance. Specimens may be analyzed for other impairing 
substances specified by FRA as necessary to the particular accident 
investigation.
    (b) Results of post-accident toxicological testing under this 
subpart are reported to the railroad's Medical Review Officer and the 
employee. The MRO and the railroad must treat the test results and any 
information concerning medical use or administration of drugs provided 
under this subpart in the same confidential manner as if subject to 
subpart H of this part, except where publicly disclosed by FRA or the 
National Transportation Safety Board.
    (c) With respect to a surviving employee, a test reported as 
positive for alcohol or a controlled substance by the designated 
laboratory must be reviewed by the railroad's Medical Review Officer 
with respect to any claim of use or administration of medications 
(consistent with Sec. 219.103) that could account for the laboratory 
findings. The Medical Review Officer must promptly report the results of 
each review to the Associate Administrator for Safety, FRA, Washington, 
DC 20590. Such report must be in writing and must reference the 
employing railroad, accident/incident date, and location, and the 
envelope must be marked ``ADMINISTRATIVELY CONFIDENTIAL: ATTENTION 
ALCOHOL/DRUG PROGRAM MANAGER.'' The report must state whether the MRO 
reported the test result to the employing railroad as positive or 
negative and the basis of any determination that analytes detected by 
the laboratory derived from authorized use (including a statement of the 
compound prescribed, dosage/frequency, and any restrictions imposed by 
the authorized medical practitioner). Unless specifically requested by 
FRA in writing, the Medical Review Officer may not disclose to FRA the 
underlying physical condition for which any medication was authorized or 
administered. The FRA is not bound by the railroad Medical Review 
Officer's determination, but that determination will be considered by 
FRA in relation to the accident/incident investigation and with respect 
to any enforcement action under consideration.
    (d) To the extent permitted by law, FRA treats test results 
indicating medical use of controlled substances consistent with Sec. 
219.103 (and other information concerning medically authorized drug use 
or administration provided incident to such testing) as administratively 
confidential and withholds public disclosure, except where it is 
necessary to consider this information in an accident investigation in 
relation to determination of probable cause. (However, as further 
provided in this section, FRA may provide results

[[Page 257]]

of testing under this subpart and supporting documentation to the 
National Transportation Safety Board.)
    (e) An employee may respond in writing to the results of the test 
prior to the preparation of any final investigation report concerning 
the accident or incident. An employee wishing to respond may do so by 
letter addressed to the Alcohol/Drug Program Manager, Office of Safety, 
FRA, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, DC 20590 within 45 days of 
receipt of the test results. Any such submission must refer to the 
accident date, railroad and location, must state the position occupied 
by the employee on the date of the accident/incident, and must identify 
any information contained therein that the employee requests be withheld 
from public disclosure on grounds of personal privacy (but the decision 
whether to honor such request will be made by the FRA on the basis of 
controlling law).
    (f)(1) The toxicology report may contain a statement of 
pharmacological significance to assist FRA and other parties in 
understanding the data reported. No such statement may be construed as a 
finding of probable cause in the accident or incident.
    (2) The toxicology report is a part of the report of the accident/
incident and therefore subject to the limitation of 49 U.S.C. 20903 
(prohibiting use of the report for any purpose in a civil action for 
damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report).
    (g)(1) It is in the public interest to ensure that any railroad 
disciplinary actions that may result from accidents and incidents for 
which testing is required under this subpart are disposed of on the 
basis of the most complete and reliable information available so that 
responsive action will be appropriate. Therefore, during the interval 
between an accident or incident and the date that the railroad receives 
notification of the results of the toxicological analysis, any provision 
of collective bargaining agreements establishing maximum periods for 
charging employees with rule violations, or for holding an 
investigation, may not be deemed to run as to any offense involving the 
accident or incident (i.e., such periods must be tolled).
    (2) This provision may not be construed to excuse the railroad from 
any obligation to timely charge an employee (or provide other actual 
notice) where the railroad obtains sufficient information relating to 
alcohol or drug use, impairment or possession or other rule violations 
prior to the receipt to toxicological analysis.
    (3) This provision does not authorize holding any employee out of 
service pending receipt of toxicological analysis; nor does it restrict 
a railroad from taking such action in an appropriate case.
    (h) Except as provided in Sec. 219.201 (with respect to non-
qualifying events), each specimen (including each split specimen) 
provided under this subpart is retained for not less than three months 
following the date of the accident or incident (two years from the date 
of the accident or incident in the case of a specimen testing positive 
for alcohol or a controlled substance). Post-mortem specimens may be 
made available to the National Transportation Safety Board (on request).
    (i) An employee (donor) may, within 60 days of the date of the 
toxicology report, request that his or her split specimen be tested by 
the designated laboratory or by another laboratory certified by Health 
and Human Services under that Department's Guidelines for Federal 
Workplace Drug Testing Programs that has available an appropriate, 
validated assay for the fluid and compound declared positive. Since some 
analytes may deteriorate during storage, detected levels of the compound 
shall, as technically appropriate, be reported and considered 
corroborative of the original test result. Any request for a retest 
shall be in writing, specify the railroad, accident date and location, 
be signed by the employee/donor, be addressed to the Associate 
Administrator for Safety, Federal Railroad Administration, Washington, 
DC 20590, and be designated ``ADMINISTRATIVELY CONFIDENTIAL: ATTENTION 
ALCOHOL/DRUG PROGRAM MANAGER.'' The expense of any employee-requested 
split specimen test at a laboratory other than the laboratory designated 
under this subpart shall be borne by the employee.

[[Page 258]]


<R05>
Sec. 219.213  Unlawful refusals; consequences.

    (a) Disqualification. An employee who refuses to cooperate in 
providing breath, blood or urine specimens following an accident or 
incident specified in this subpart must be withdrawn from covered 
service and must be deemed disqualified for covered service for a period 
of nine (9) months in accordance with the conditions specified in Sec. 
219.107.
    (b) Procedures. Prior to or upon withdrawing the employee from 
covered service under this section, the railroad must provide notice of 
the reason for this action and an opportunity for hearing before a 
presiding officer other than the charging official. The employee is 
entitled to the procedural protection set out in Sec. 219.104(d).
    (c) Subject of hearing. The hearing required by this section must 
determine whether the employee refused to submit to testing, having been 
requested to submit, under authority of this subpart, by a 
representative of the railroad. In determining whether a 
disqualification is required, the hearing official shall, as 
appropriate, also consider the following:
    (1) Whether the railroad made a good faith determination, based on 
reasonable inquiry, that the accident or incident was within the 
mandatory testing requirements of this subpart; and
    (2) In a case where a blood test was refused on the ground it would 
be inconsistent with the employee's health, whether such refusal was 
made in good faith and based on medical advice.


<R04>
                       Subpart D_Testing for Cause


<R05>
Sec. 219.300  Mandatory reasonable suspicion testing.

    (a) Requirements. (1) A railroad must require a covered employee to 
submit to an alcohol test when the railroad has reasonable suspicion to 
believe that the employee has violated any prohibition of subpart B of 
this part concerning use of alcohol. The railroad's determination that 
reasonable suspicion exists to require the covered employee to undergo 
an alcohol test must be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable 
observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or body odors 
of the employee.
    (2) A railroad must require a covered employee to submit to a drug 
test when the railroad has reasonable suspicion to believe that the 
employee has violated the prohibitions of subpart B of this part 
concerning use of controlled substances. The railroad's determination 
that reasonable suspicion exists to require the covered employee to 
undergo a drug test must be based on specific, contemporaneous, 
articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or 
body odors of the employee. Such observations may include indications of 
the chronic and withdrawal effects of drugs.
    (b)(1) With respect to an alcohol test, the required observations 
must be made by a supervisor trained in accordance with Sec. 219.11(g). 
The supervisor who makes the determination that reasonable suspicion 
exists may not conduct testing on that employee.
    (2) With respect to a drug test, the required observations must be 
made by two supervisors, at least one of whom is trained in accordance 
with Sec. 219.11(g).
    (c) Nothing in this section may be construed to require the conduct 
of alcohol testing or drug testing when the employee is apparently in 
need of immediate medical attention.
    (d)(1) If a test required by this section is not administered within 
two hours following the determination under this section, the railroad 
must prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the test 
was not properly administered. If a test required by this section is not 
administered within eight hours of the determination under this section, 
the railroad must cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and must 
state in the record the reasons for not administering the test. Records 
must be submitted to FRA upon request of the FRA Administrator.
    (2) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 219.301  Testing for reasonable cause.

    (a) Authorization. A railroad may, under the conditions specified in 
this subpart, require any covered employee, as a condition of employment 
in covered service, to cooperate in breath or

[[Page 259]]

body fluid testing, or both, to determine compliance with Sec. Sec. 
219.101 and 219.102 or a railroad rule implementing the requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 219.101 and 219.102. This authority is limited to testing 
after observations or events that occur during duty hours (including any 
period of overtime or emergency service). The provisions of this subpart 
apply only when, and to the extent that, the test in question is 
conducted in reliance upon the authority conferred by this section. 
Section 219.23 prescribes the notice to an employee that is required 
when an employee is required to provide a breath or body fluid specimen 
under this part. A railroad may not require an employee to be tested 
under the authority of this subpart unless reasonable cause, as defined 
in this section, exists with respect to that employee.
    (b) For cause breath testing. In addition to reasonable suspicion as 
described in Sec. 219.300, the following circumstances constitute cause 
for the administration of alcohol tests under this section:
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) Accident/incident. The employee has been involved in an accident 
or incident reportable under Part 225 of this chapter, and a supervisory 
employee of the railroad has a reasonable belief, based on specific, 
articulable facts, that the employee's acts or omissions contributed to 
the occurrence or severity of the accident or incident; or
    (3) Rule violation. The employee has been directly involved in one 
of the following operating rule violations or errors:
    (i) Noncompliance with a train order, track warrant, timetable, 
signal indication, special instruction or other direction with respect 
to movement of a train that involves--
    (A) Occupancy of a block or other segment of track to which entry 
was not authorized;
    (B) Failure to clear a track to permit opposing or following 
movement to pass;
    (C) Moving across a railroad crossing at grade without 
authorization; or
    (D) Passing an absolute restrictive signal or passing a restrictive 
signal without stopping (if required);
    (ii) Failure to protect a train as required by a rule consistent 
with Sec. 218.37 of this chapter (including failure to protect a train 
that is fouling an adjacent track, where required by the railroad's 
rules);
    (iii) Operation of a train at a speed that exceeds the maximum 
authorized speed by at least ten (10) miles per hour or by fifty percent 
(50%) of such maximum authorized speed, whichever is less;
    (iv) Alignment of a switch in violation of a railroad rule, failure 
to align a switch as required for movement, operation of a switch under 
a train, or unauthorized running through a switch;
    (v) Failure to apply or stop short of derail as required;
    (vi) Failure to secure a hand brake or failure to secure sufficient 
hand brakes, as required;
    (vii) Entering a crossover before both switches are lined for 
movement; or
    (viii) In the case of a person performing a dispatching function or 
block operator function, issuance of a train order or establishment of a 
route that fails to provide proper protection for a train.
    (c) For cause drug testing. In addition to reasonable suspicion as 
described in Sec. 219.300, each of the conditions set forth in 
paragraphs (b)(2) (``accident/incident'') and (b)(3) (``rule 
violation'') of this section as constituting cause for alcohol testing 
also constitutes cause with respect to drug testing.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Limitation for subpart C events. The compulsory drug testing 
authority conferred by this section does not apply with respect to any 
event subject to post-accident toxicological testing as required by 
Sec. 219.201. However, use of compulsory breath test authority is 
authorized in any case where breath test results can be obtained in a 
timely manner at the scene of the accident and conduct of such tests 
does not materially impede the collection of specimens under Subpart C 
of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 219.302  Prompt specimen collection; time limitation.

    (a) Testing under this subpart may only be conducted promptly 
following the observations or events upon which

[[Page 260]]

the testing decision is based, consistent with the need to protect life 
and property.
    (b) No employee may be required to participate in alcohol or drug 
testing under this section after the expiration of an eight-hour period 
from--
    (1) The time of the observations or other events described in this 
section; or
    (2) In the case of an accident/incident, the time a responsible 
railroad supervisor receives notice of the event providing reasonable 
cause for conduct of the test.
    (c) An employee may not be tested under this subpart if that 
employee has been released from duty under the normal procedures of the 
railroad. An employee who has been transported to receive medical care 
is not released from duty for purposes of this section. Nothing in this 
section prohibits the subsequent testing of an employee who has failed 
to remain available for testing as required (i.e., who is absent without 
leave).
    (d) As used in this subpart, a ``responsible railroad supervisor'' 
means any responsible line supervisor (e.g., a trainmaster or road 
foreman of engines) or superior official in authority over the employee 
to be tested.
    (e) In the case of a drug test, the eight-hour requirement is 
satisfied if the employee has been delivered to the collection site 
(where the collector is present) and the request has been made to 
commence collection of the drug testing specimens within that period.
    (f) [Reserved]
    (g) Section 219.23 prescribes the notice to an employee that is 
required to provide breath or a body fluid specimen under this part.


<R04>
             Subpart E_Identification of Troubled Employees


<R05>
Sec. 219.401  Requirement for policies.

    (a) The purpose of this subpart is to prevent the use of alcohol and 
drugs in connection with covered service.
    (b) Each railroad must adopt, publish and implement--
    (1) A policy designed to encourage and facilitate the identification 
of those covered employees who abuse alcohol or drugs as a part of a 
treatable condition and to ensure that such employees are provided the 
opportunity to obtain counseling or treatment before those problems 
manifest themselves in detected violations of this part (hereafter 
``voluntary referral policy''); and
    (2) A policy designed to foster employee participation in preventing 
violations of this subpart and encourage co-worker participation in the 
direct enforcement of this part (hereafter ``co-worker report policy'').
    (c) A railroad may comply with this subpart by adopting, publishing 
and implementing policies meeting the specific requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 219.403 and 219.405 or by complying with Sec. 219.407.
    (d) If a railroad complies with this part by adopting, publishing 
and implementing policies consistent with Sec. Sec. 219.403 and 
219.405, the railroad must make such policies, and publications 
announcing such policies, available for inspection and copying by FRA.
    (e) Nothing in this subpart may be construed to--
    (1) Require payment of compensation for any period an employee is 
out of service under a voluntary referral or co-worker report policy;
    (2) Require a railroad to adhere to a voluntary referral or co-
worker report policy in a case where the referral or report is made for 
the purpose, or with the effect, of anticipating the imminent and 
probable detection of a rule violation by a supervising employee; or
    (3) Limit the discretion of a railroad to dismiss or otherwise 
discipline an employee for specific rule violations or criminal 
offenses, except as specifically provided by this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 219.403  Voluntary referral policy.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes minimum standards for voluntary 
referral policies. Nothing in this section restricts a railroad from 
adopting, publishing and implementing a voluntary referral policy that 
affords more favorable conditions to employees troubled by alcohol or 
drug abuse problems, consistent with the railroad's responsibility to 
prevent violations of Sec. Sec. 219.101 and 219.102.
    (b) Required provisions. A voluntary referral policy must include 
the following provisions:

[[Page 261]]

    (1) A covered employee who is affected by an alcohol or drug use 
problem may maintain an employment relationship with the railroad if, 
before the employee is charged with conduct deemed by the railroad 
sufficient to warrant dismissal, the employee seeks assistance through 
the railroad for the employee's alcohol or drug use problem or is 
referred for such assistance by another employee or by a representative 
of the employee's collective bargaining unit. The railroad must specify 
whether, and under what circumstances, its policy provides for the 
acceptance of referrals from other sources, including (at the option of 
the railroad) supervisory employees.
    (2) Except as may be provided under paragraph (c) of this section, 
the railroad treats the referral and subsequent handling, including 
counseling and treatment, as confidential.
    (3) The railroad will, to the extent necessary for treatment and 
rehabilitation, grant the employee a leave of absence from the railroad 
for the period necessary to complete primary treatment and establish 
control over the employee's alcohol or drug problem. The policy must 
allow a leave of absence of not less than 45 days, if necessary for the 
purpose of meeting initial treatment needs.
    (4) Except as may be provided under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, the employee will be returned to service on the recommendation 
of the substance abuse professional. Approval to return to service may 
not be unreasonably withheld.
    (5) With respect to a certified locomotive engineer or a candidate 
for certification, the railroad must meet the requirements of Sec. 
240.119(e) of this chapter.
    (c) Optional provisions. A voluntary referral policy may include any 
of the following provisions, at the option of the railroad:
    (1) The policy may provide that the rule of confidentiality is 
waived if--
    (i) The employee at any time refuses to cooperate in a recommended 
course of counseling or treatment; and/or
    (ii) The employee is later determined, after investigation, to have 
been involved in an alcohol or drug-related disciplinary offense growing 
out of subsequent conduct.
    (2) The policy may require successful completion of a return-to-
service medical examination as a further condition on reinstatement in 
covered service.
    (3) The policy may provide that it does not apply to an employee who 
has previously been assisted by the railroad under a policy or program 
substantially consistent with this section or who has previously elected 
to waive investigation under Sec. 219.405 (co-worker report policy).
    (4) The policy may provide that, in order to invoke its benefits, 
the employee must report to the contact designated by the railroad 
either:
    (i) During non-duty hours (i.e., at a time when the employee is off 
duty); or
    (ii) While unimpaired and otherwise in compliance with the 
railroad's alcohol and drug rules consistent with this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 219.405  Co-worker report policy.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes minimum standards for co-worker 
report policies. Nothing in this section restricts a railroad from 
adopting, publishing and implementing a policy that affords more 
favorable conditions to employees troubled by alcohol or drug abuse 
problems, consistent with the railroad's responsibility to prevent 
violations of Sec. Sec. 219.101 and 219.102.
    (b) Employment relationship. A co-worker report policy must provide 
that a covered employee may maintain an employment relationship with the 
railroad following an alleged first offense under this part or the 
railroad's alcohol and drug rules, subject to the conditions and 
procedures contained in this section.
    (c) General conditions and procedures. (1) The alleged violation 
must come to the attention of the railroad as a result of a report by a 
co-worker that the employee was apparently unsafe to work with or was, 
or appeared to be, in violation of this part or the railroad's alcohol 
and drug rules.
    (2) If the railroad representative determines that the employee is 
in violation, the railroad may immediately remove the employee from 
service in accordance with its existing policies and procedures.

[[Page 262]]

    (3) The employee must elect to waive investigation on the rule 
charge and must contact the substance abuse professional within a 
reasonable period specified by the policy.
    (4) The substance abuse professional must schedule necessary 
interviews with the employee and complete an evaluation within 10 
calendar days of the date on which the employee contacts the 
professional with a request for evaluation under the policy, unless it 
becomes necessary to refer the employee for further evaluation. In each 
case, all necessary evaluations must be completed within 20 days of the 
date on which the employee contacts the professional.
    (d) When treatment is required. If the substance abuse professional 
determines that the employee is affected by psychological or chemical 
dependence on alcohol or a drug or by another identifiable and treatable 
mental or physical disorder involving the abuse of alcohol or drugs as a 
primary manifestation, the following conditions and procedures apply:
    (1) The railroad must, to the extent necessary for treatment and 
rehabilitation, grant the employee a leave of absence from the railroad 
for the period necessary to complete primary treatment and establish 
control over the employee's alcohol or drug problem. The policy must 
allow a leave of absence of not less than 45 days, if necessary for the 
purpose of meeting initial treatment needs.
    (2) The employee must agree to undertake and successfully complete a 
course of treatment deemed acceptable by the substance abuse 
professional.
    (3) The railroad must promptly return the employee to service, on 
recommendation of the substance abuse professional, when the employee 
has established control over the substance abuse problem. Return to 
service may also be conditioned on successful completion of a return-to-
service medical examination. Approval to return to service may not be 
unreasonably withheld.
    (4) Following return to service, the employee, as a further 
condition on withholding of discipline, may, as necessary, be required 
to participate in a reasonable program of follow-up treatment for a 
period not to exceed 60 months from the date the employee was originally 
withdrawn from service.
    (e) When treatment is not required. If the substance abuse 
professional determines that the employee is not affected by an 
identifiable and treatable mental or physical disorder--
    (1) The railroad must return the employee to service within 5 days 
after completion of the evaluation.
    (2) During or following the out-of-service period, the railroad may 
require the employee to participate in a program of education and 
training concerning the effects of alcohol and drugs on occupational or 
transportation safety.
    (f) Follow-up tests. A railroad may conduct return-to-service and/or 
follow-up tests (as described in Sec. 219.104) of an employee who 
waives investigation and is determined to be ready to return to service 
under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 219.407  Alternate policies.

    (a) In lieu of a policy under Sec. 219.403 (voluntary referral) or 
Sec. 219.405 (co-worker report), or both, a railroad may adopt, publish 
and implement, with respect to a particular class or craft of covered 
employees, an alternate policy or policies having as their purpose the 
prevention of alcohol or drug use in railroad operations, if such policy 
or policies have the written concurrence of the recognized 
representatives of such employees.
    (b) The concurrence of recognized employee representatives in an 
alternate policy may be evidenced by a collective bargaining agreement 
or any other document describing the class or craft of employees to 
which the alternate policy applies. The agreement or other document must 
make express reference to this part and to the intention of the railroad 
and employee representatives that the alternate policy applies in lieu 
of the policy required by Sec. 219.403, Sec. 219.405, or both.
    (c) The railroad must file the agreement or other document described 
in paragraph (b) of this section with the Associate Administrator for 
Safety, FRA. If the alternate policy is amended or revoked, the railroad 
must file a

[[Page 263]]

notice of such amendment or revocation at least 30 days prior to the 
effective date of such action.
    (d) This section does not excuse a railroad from adopting, 
publishing and implementing the policies required by Sec. Sec. 219.403 
and 219.405 with respect to any group of covered employees not within 
the coverage of an appropriate alternate policy.


<R04>
                     Subpart F_Pre-Employment Tests


<R05>
Sec. 219.501  Pre-employment drug testing.

    (a) Prior to the first time a covered employee performs covered 
service for a railroad, the employee must undergo testing for drugs. No 
railroad may allow a covered employee to perform covered service, unless 
the employee has been administered a test for drugs with a result that 
did not indicate the misuse of controlled substances. This requirement 
applies to final applicants for employment and to employees seeking to 
transfer for the first time from non-covered service to duties involving 
covered service.
    (b) As used in subpart H of this part with respect to a test 
required under this subpart, the term covered employee includes an 
applicant for pre-employment testing only. In the case of an applicant 
who declines to be tested and withdraws the application for employment, 
no record may be maintained of the declination.


<R05>
Sec. 219.502  Pre-employment alcohol testing.

    (a) A railroad may, but is not required to, conduct pre-employment 
alcohol testing under this part. If a railroad chooses to conduct pre-
employment alcohol testing, the railroad must comply with the following 
requirements:
    (1) It must conduct a pre-employment alcohol test before the first 
performance of safety-sensitive functions by every covered employee 
(whether a new employee or someone who has transferred to a position 
involving the performance of safety-sensitive functions).
    (2) It must treat all safety-sensitive employees performing safety-
sensitive functions the same for the purpose of pre-employment alcohol 
testing (i.e., it must not test some covered employees and not others).
    (3) It must conduct the pre-employment tests after making a 
contingent offer of employment or transfer, subject to the employee 
passing the pre-employment alcohol test.
    (4) It must conduct all pre-employment alcohol tests using the 
alcohol testing procedures of part 40 of this title.
    (5) It must not allow a covered employee to begin performing safety-
sensitive functions unless the result of the employee's test indicates 
an alcohol concentration of less than 0.04.
    (b) As used in subpart H of this part, with respect to a test 
authorized under this subpart, the term covered employee includes an 
applicant for pre-employment testing only. In the case of an applicant 
who declines to be tested and withdraws the application for employment, 
no record may be maintained of the declination.


<R05>
Sec. 219.503  Notification; records.

    The railroad must provide for medical review of drug test results as 
provided in subpart H of this part. The railroad must notify the 
applicant of the results of the drug and alcohol tests in the same 
manner as provided for employees in subpart H of this part. Records must 
be maintained confidentially and be retained in the same manner as 
required under subpart J of this part for employee test records, except 
that such records need not reflect the identity of an applicant whose 
application for employment in covered service was denied.


<R05>
Sec. 219.505  Refusals.

    An applicant who has refused to submit to pre-employment testing 
under this section may not be employed in covered service based upon the 
application and examination with respect to which such refusal was made. 
This section does not create any right on the part of the applicant to 
have a subsequent application considered; nor does it restrict the 
discretion of the railroad to entertain a subsequent application for 
employment from the same person.

[[Page 264]]


<R04>
           Subpart G_Random Alcohol and Drug Testing Programs


<R05>
Sec. 219.601  Railroad random drug testing programs.

    (a) Submission. Each railroad must submit for FRA approval a random 
testing program meeting the requirements of this subpart. A railroad 
commencing operations must submit such a program not later than 30 days 
prior to such commencement. The program must be submitted to the 
Associate Administrator for Safety, FRA, for review and approval by the 
FRA Administrator. If, after approval, a railroad desires to amend the 
random testing program implemented under this subpart, the railroad must 
file with FRA a notice of such amendment at least 30 days prior to the 
intended effective date of such action. A railroad already subject to 
this subpart that becomes subject to this subpart with respect to one or 
more additional employees must amend its program not later than 60 days 
after these employees become subject to this subpart and file with FRA a 
notice of such amendment at least 30 days prior to the intended 
effective date of such action. A program responsive to the requirements 
of this section or any amendment to the program may not be implemented 
prior to approval.
    (b) Form of programs. Random testing programs submitted by or on 
behalf of each railroad under this subpart must meet the following 
criteria, and the railroad and its managers, supervisors, officials and 
other employees and agents must conform to such criteria in implementing 
the program:
    (1) Selection of covered employees for testing must be made by a 
method employing objective, neutral criteria which ensure that every 
covered employee has a substantially equal statistical chance of being 
selected within a specified time frame. The method may not permit 
subjective factors to play a role in selection, i.e., no employee may be 
selected as the result of the exercise of discretion by the railroad. 
The selection method must be capable of verification with respect to the 
randomness of the selection process, and any records necessary to 
document random selection must be retained for not less than 24 months 
from the date upon which the particular specimens were collected.
    (2)(i) The program must select for testing a sufficient number of 
employees so that, during the first 12 months--
    (A) The random testing program is spread reasonably through the 12-
month period.
    (B) [Reserved]
    (ii) To calculate the total number of covered employees eligible for 
random testing throughout the year, as a railroad, you must add the 
total number of covered employees eligible for testing during each 
random testing period for the year and divide that total by the number 
of random testing periods. Covered employees, and only covered 
employees, are to be in a railroad's random testing pool, and all 
covered employees must be in the random pool. If you are a railroad 
conducting random testing more often than once per month (e.g., you 
select daily, weekly, bi-weekly), you do not need to compute this total 
number of covered employees rate more than on a once per month basis.
    (iii) As a railroad, you may use a service agent (e.g., C/TPA) to 
perform random selections for you, and your covered employees may be 
part of a larger random testing pool of covered employees. However, you 
must ensure that the service agent you use is testing at the appropriate 
percentage established for your industry and that only covered employees 
are in the random testing pool.
    (3) Railroad random testing programs must ensure to the maximum 
extent practicable that each employee perceives the possibility that a 
random test may be required on any day the employee reports for work.
    (4) Notice of an employee's selection may not be provided until the 
duty tour in which testing is to be conducted, and then only so far in 
advance as is reasonably necessary to ensure the employee's presence at 
the time and place set for testing.
    (5) The program must include testing procedures and safeguards, and 
procedures for action based on positive test results, consistent with 
this part.

[[Page 265]]

    (6) An employee must be subject to testing only while on duty. Only 
employees who perform covered service for the railroad are subject to 
testing under this part. In the case of employees who during some duty 
tours perform covered service and during others do not, the railroad 
program must specify the extent to which, and the circumstances under 
which they are to be subject to testing. To the extent practical within 
the limitations of this part and in the context of the railroad's 
operations, the railroad program must provide that employees are subject 
to the possibility of random testing on any day they actually perform 
covered service.
    (7) Each time an employee is notified for random drug testing the 
employee will be informed that selection was made on a random basis.
    (c) Approval. The Associate Administrator for Safety, FRA, will 
notify the railroad in writing whether the program is approved as 
consistent with the criteria set forth in this part. If the Associate 
Administrator for Safety determines that the program does not conform to 
those criteria, the Associate Administrator for Safety will inform the 
railroad of any matters preventing approval of the program, with 
specific explanation as to necessary revisions. The railroad must 
resubmit its program with the required revisions within 30 days of such 
notice. Failure to resubmit the program with the necessary revisions 
will be considered a failure to implement a program under this subpart.
    (d) Implementation. (1) No later than 45 days prior to commencement 
of random testing, the railroad must publish to each of its covered 
employees, individually, a written notice that he or she will be subject 
to random drug testing under this part. Such notice must state the date 
for commencement of the program, must state that the selection of 
employees for testing will be on a strictly random basis, must describe 
the consequences of a determination that the employee has violated Sec. 
219.102 or any applicable railroad rule, and must inform the employee of 
the employee's rights under subpart E of this part. A copy of the notice 
must be provided to each new covered employee on or before the 
employee's initial date of service. Since knowledge of Federal law is 
presumed, nothing in this paragraph (d)(1) creates a defense to a 
violation of Sec. 219.102.
    (2) A railroad commencing operations must submit a random testing 
program 60 days after doing so. The railroad must implement its approved 
random testing program not later than the expiration of 60 days from 
approval by the Administrator.

[66 FR 41973, Aug. 9, 2001, as amended at 68 FR 75463, Dec. 31, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 219.602  FRA Administrator's determination of random drug testing rate.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this 
section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing must 
be 50 percent of covered employees.
    (b) The FRA Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the 
minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the 
reported positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for 
this determination is drawn from the drug MIS reports required by this 
part. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator 
considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain 
additional information or reports from railroads, and may make 
appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive rate. 
Each year, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the 
minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered 
employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug 
testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year 
following publication.
    (c) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing 
is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of 
all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data 
received under the reporting requirements of Sec. 219.800 for two 
consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is 
less than 1.0 percent.
    (d) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing 
is 25 percent, and the data received under

[[Page 266]]

the reporting requirements of Sec. 219.800 for any calendar year 
indicate that the reported positive rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 
percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage 
rate for random drug testing to 50 percent of all covered employees.
    (e) Selection of covered employees for testing must be made by a 
method employing objective, neutral criteria which ensures that every 
covered employee has a substantially equal statistical chance of being 
selected within a specified time frame. The method may not permit 
subjective factors to play a role in selection, i.e., no employee may be 
selected as a result of the exercise of discretion by the railroad. The 
selection method must be capable of verification with respect to the 
randomness of the selection process.
    (f) The railroad must randomly select a sufficient number of covered 
employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an annual rate 
not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing 
determined by the Administrator. If the railroad conducts random drug 
testing through a consortium, the number of employees to be tested may 
be calculated for each individual railroad or may be based on the total 
number of covered employees covered by the consortium who are subject to 
random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage rate under 
this part or any DOT agency drug testing rule.
    (g) Each railroad must ensure that random drug tests conducted under 
this part are unannounced and that the dates for administering random 
tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
    (h) If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing 
under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same 
railroad, the employee must be subject to random drug testing at the 
percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency 
regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function.
    (i) If a railroad is required to conduct random drug testing under 
the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the railroad may--
    (1) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool 
containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same 
required rate; or
    (2) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest 
percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to 
which the railroad is subject.

<R05>
Sec. 219.603  Participation in drug testing.

    A railroad shall, under the conditions specified in this subpart and 
subpart H of this part, require a covered employee selected through the 
random testing program to cooperate in urine testing to determine 
compliance with Sec. 219.102, and the employee must provide the 
required specimen and complete the required paperwork and 
certifications. Compliance by the employee may be excused only in the 
case of a documented medical or family emergency.


<R05>
Sec. 219.605  Positive drug test results; procedures.

    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) Procedures for administrative handling by the railroad in the 
event a specimen provided under this subpart is reported as positive by 
the MRO are set forth in Sec. 219.104. The responsive action required 
in Sec. 219.104 is not stayed pending the result of a retest or split 
specimen test.


<R05>
Sec. 219.607  Railroad random alcohol testing programs.

    (a) Each railroad must submit for FRA approval a random alcohol 
testing program meeting the requirements of this subpart. A railroad 
commencing operations must submit a random alcohol testing program not 
later than 30 days prior to such commencement. The program must be 
submitted to the Associate Administrator for Safety, FRA, for review and 
approval. If, after approval, a railroad desires to amend the random 
alcohol testing program implemented under this subpart, the railroad 
must file with FRA a notice of such amendment at least 30 days prior to

[[Page 267]]

the intended effective date of such action. A program responsive to the 
requirements of this section or any amendment to the program may not be 
implemented prior to approval.
    (b) Form of programs. Random alcohol testing programs submitted by 
or on behalf of each railroad under this subpart must meet the following 
criteria, and the railroad and its managers, supervisors, officials and 
other employees and agents must conform to such criteria in implementing 
the program:
    (1) As a railroad, to calculate the total number of covered 
employees eligible for random testing throughout the year, you must add 
the total number of covered employees eligible for testing during each 
random testing period for the year and divide that total by the number 
of random testing periods. Covered employees, and only covered 
employees, are to be in a railroad's random testing pool, and all 
covered employees must be in the random pool. If you are a railroad 
conducting random testing more often than once per month (e.g., you 
select daily, weekly, bi-weekly), you do not need to compute this total 
number of covered employees rate more than on a once per month basis.
    (i) As a railroad, you may use a service agent (e.g., C/TPA) to 
perform random selections for you, and your covered employees may be 
part of a larger random testing pool of covered employees. However, you 
must ensure that the service agent you use is testing at the appropriate 
percentage established for your industry and that only covered employees 
are in the random testing pool.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (2) The program must include testing procedures and safeguards, and, 
consistent with this part, procedures for action based on tests where 
the employee is found to have violated Sec. 219.101.
    (3) The program must ensure that random alcohol tests conducted 
under this part are unannounced and that the dates for administering 
random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
    (4) The program must ensure to the maximum extent practicable that 
each covered employee perceives the possibility that a random alcohol 
test may be required at any time the employee reports for work and at 
any time during the duty tour (except any period when the employee is 
expressly relieved of any responsibility for performance of covered 
service).
    (5) An employee may be subject to testing only while on duty. Only 
employees who perform covered service for the railroad may be subject to 
testing under this part. In the case of employees who during some duty 
tours perform covered service and during others do not, the railroad 
program may specify the extent to which, and the circumstances under 
which they are subject to testing. To the extent practical within the 
limitations of this part and in the context of the railroad's 
operations, the railroad program must provide that employees are subject 
to the possibility of random testing on any day they actually perform 
covered service.
    (6) Testing must be conducted promptly, as provided in Sec. 
219.701(b)(1).
    (7) Each time an employee is notified for random alcohol testing the 
employee must be informed that selection was made on a random basis.
    (8) Each railroad must ensure that each covered employee who is 
notified of selection for random alcohol testing proceeds to the test 
site immediately; provided, however, that if the employee is performing 
a safety-sensitive function at the time of the notification, the 
railroad must instead ensure that the employee ceases to perform the 
safety-sensitive function and proceeds to the testing site as soon as 
possible.
    (c) Implementation. (1) No later than 45 days prior to commencement 
of random alcohol testing, the railroad must publish to each of its 
covered employees, individually, a written notice that the employee will 
be subject to random alcohol testing under this part. Such notice must 
state the date for commencement of the program, must state that the 
selection of employees for testing will be on a strictly random basis, 
must describe the consequences of a determination that the employee has 
violated Sec. 219.101 or any applicable railroad rule, and must inform 
the employee of the employee's rights under subpart E of this part. A 
copy of the

[[Page 268]]

notice must be provided to each new covered employee on or before the 
employee's initial date of service. Since knowledge of Federal law is 
presumed, nothing in this paragraph (c)(1) creates a defense to a 
violation of Sec. 219.101. This notice may be combined with the notice 
or policy statement required by Sec. 219.23.
    (2) A railroad commencing operations must submit a random testing 
program 60 days after doing so. The railroad must implement its approved 
random testing program not later than the expiration of 60 days from 
approval by the Administrator.

Sec. 219.608  FRA Administrator's determination of random alcohol testing 

rate.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this 
section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing 
must be 25 percent of covered employees.
    (b) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum 
annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is based on the 
violation rate for the entire industry. All information used for the 
determination is drawn from the alcohol MIS reports required by this 
part. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator 
considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain 
additional information or reports from employers, and may make 
appropriate modifications in calculating the industry violation rate. 
Each year, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the 
minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing of covered 
employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year 
following publication.
    (c)(1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 25 percent or more, the Administrator may lower this rate to 
10 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that 
the data received under the reporting requirements of Sec. 219.800 for 
two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less 
than 0.5 percent.
    (2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 
percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that 
the data received under the reporting requirements of Sec. 219.800 for 
two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less 
than 1.0 percent but equal to or greater than 0.5 percent.
    (d)(1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 10 percent, and the data received under the reporting 
requirements of Sec. 219.800 for that calendar year indicate that the 
violation rate is equal to or greater than 0.5 percent, but less than 
1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual 
percentage rate for random alcohol testing to 25 percent of all covered 
employees.
    (2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 25 percent or less, and the data received under the reporting 
requirements of Sec. 219.800 for any calendar year indicate that the 
violation rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the 
Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for 
random alcohol testing to 50 percent of all covered employees.
    (e) The railroad must randomly select and test a sufficient number 
of covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an 
annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random 
alcohol testing determined by the Administrator. If the railroad 
conducts random alcohol testing through a consortium, the number of 
employees to be tested may be calculated for each individual employer or 
may be based on the total number of covered employees covered by the 
consortium who are subject to random testing at the same minimum annual 
percentage rate under this part or any DOT agency alcohol testing rule.
    (f) If a railroad is required to conduct random alcohol testing 
under the alcohol testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the 
railroad may--

[[Page 269]]

    (1) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool 
containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same 
required rate; or
    (2) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest 
percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to 
which the railroad is subject.

Sec. 219.609  Participation in alcohol testing.

    A railroad must, under the conditions specified in this subpart and 
subpart H of this part, require a covered employee selected through the 
random testing program to cooperate in breath testing to determine 
compliance with Sec. 219.101, and the employee must provide the 
required breath and complete the required paperwork and certifications. 
Compliance by the employee may be excused only in the case of a 
documented medical or family emergency.

              Subpart H_Drug and Alcohol Testing Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 219.701  Standards for drug and alcohol testing.

    (a) Drug testing required or authorized by subparts B, D, F, and G 
of this part must be conducted in compliance with all applicable 
provisions of the Department of Transportation Procedures for 
Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs (part 40 of 
this title).
    (b) Alcohol testing required or authorized by subparts B, D, F, and 
G of this part must be conducted in compliance with all applicable 
provisions of the Department of Transportation Procedures for 
Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs (part 40 of 
this title).
    (c) Each covered employee who is notified of selection for testing 
and who is not performing covered service at the time of notification 
must proceed to the testing site immediately. The railroad must ensure 
that an employee who is performing covered service at the time of 
notification shall, as soon as possible without affecting safety, cease 
to perform covered service and proceed to the testing site.


<R04>
                         Subpart I_Annual Report


<R05>
Sec. 219.800  Annual reports.

    (a) Each railroad that has a total of 400,000 or more employee hours 
(including hours worked by all employees of the railroad, regardless of 
occupation, not only while in the United States but also while outside 
the United States) must submit to FRA by March 15 of each year a report 
covering the previous calendar year (January 1-December 31), summarizing 
the results of its alcohol misuse prevention program. As used in this 
paragraph, the term ``employees of the railroad'' includes individuals 
who perform service for the railroad, including not only individuals who 
receive direct monetary compensation from the railroad for performing a 
service for the railroad, but also such individuals as employees of a 
contractor to the railroad who perform a service for the railroad.
    (b) As a railroad, you must use the Management Information System 
(MIS) form and instructions as required by 49 CFR part 40 (at Sec. 
40.25 and appendix H to part 40). You may also use the electronic 
version of the MIS form provided by the DOT. The Administrator may 
designate means (e.g., electronic program transmitted via the Internet), 
other than hard-copy, for MIS form submission to FRA. For information on 
where to submit MIS forms and for the electronic version of the form, 
see: http://www.fra.dot.gov/Content3.asp?P=504.
    (c) Each railroad shall ensure the accuracy and timeliness of each 
report submitted.
    (d) As a railroad, if you have a covered employee who performs 
multi-DOT agency functions (e.g., an employee drives a commercial motor 
vehicle and performs switchman duties for

[[Page 270]]

you), count the employee only on the MIS report for the DOT agency under 
which he or she is random tested. Normally, this will be the DOT agency 
under which the employee performs more than 50% of his or her duties. 
Railroads may have to explain the testing data for these employees in 
the event of a DOT agency inspection or audit.
    (e) A service agent (e.g., a consortium/third party administrator) 
may prepare the MIS report on behalf of a railroad. However, a railroad 
official (e.g., a designated employee representative) must certify the 
accuracy and completeness of the MIS report, no matter who prepares it.

\1\ A penalty may be assessed against an individual only for a willful
  violation. The FRA Administrator reserves the right to assess a
  penalty of up to $27,000 for any violation, including ones not listed
  in this penalty schedule, where circumstances warrant. See 49 CFR Part
  209, appendix A.
\2\ The penalty schedule uses section numbers from 49 CFR Part 219; and
  if more than one item is listed as a type of violation of a given
  section, each item is also designated by a ``penalty code'' (e.g.,
  ``A''), which is used to facilitate assessment of civil penalties. For
  convenience, penalty citations will cite the CFR section and the
  penalty code, if any (e.g., ``Sec. 219.11A'') FRA reserves the right,
  should litigation become necessary, to substitute in its complaint the

 Sec. Appendix C to Part 219--Post-Accident Testing Specimen Collection

    1.0 General.
    This appendix prescribes procedures for collection of specimens for 
mandatory post-accident testing pursuant to Subpart C of this part. 
Collection of blood and urine specimens is required to be conducted at 
an independent medical facility.

(Surviving Employees)

    2.0 Surviving Employees.
    This unit provides detailed procedures for collecting post-accident 
toxicological specimens from surviving employees involved in train 
accidents and train incidents, as required by Subpart C of this part. 
Subpart C specifies qualifying events and employees required to be 
tested.
    2.1 Collection Procedures; General.
    a. All forms and supplies necessary for collection and transfer of 
blood and urine specimens for three surviving employees can be found in 
the FRA post-accident shipping box, which is made available to the 
collection site by the railroad representative.
    b. Each shipping box contains supplies for blood/urine collections 
from three individuals, including instructions and necessary forms. The 
railroad is responsible for ensuring that materials are fresh, complete 
and meet FRA requirements.
    2.1.1 Responsibility of the Railroad Representative.
    a. In the event of an accident/incident for which testing is 
required under Subpart C of this part, the railroad representative shall 
follow the designated set of instructions, and, upon arrival at the 
independent medical facility, promptly present to the collection 
facility representative a post-accident shipping box or boxes with all 
remaining sets of instructions. (Each box contains supplies to collect 
specimens from three employees.) The railroad representative shall 
request the collection facility representative to review the 
instructions provided and, through qualified personnel, provide for 
collection of the specimens according to the procedures set out.
    b. The railroad representative shall undertake the following 
additional responsibilities--
    1. Complete Form FRA 6180.73 (revised), Accident Information 
Required for Post-Accident Toxicological Testing (49 CFR Part 219), 
describing the testing event and identifying the employees whose 
specimens are to be deposited in the shipping box.
    2. As necessary to verify the identity of individual employees, 
affirm the identity of each employee to the medical facility personnel.
    3. Consistent with the policy of the collection facility, monitor 
the progress of the collection procedure.
    Warning: Monitor but do not directly observe urination or otherwise 
disturb the privacy of urine or blood collection. Do not handle specimen 
containers, bottles or tubes (empty or full). Do not become part of the 
collection process.
    2.1.2 Employee Responsibility.
    a. An employee who is identified for post-accident toxicological 
testing shall cooperate in testing as required by the railroad and 
personnel of the independent medical facility. Such cooperation will 
normally consist of the following, to be performed as requested:
    1. Provide a blood specimen, which a qualified medical professional 
or technician will draw using a single-use sterile syringe. The employee 
should be seated for this procedure.
    2. Provide, in the privacy of an enclosure, a urine specimen into a 
plastic collection cup. Deliver the cup to the collector.
    3. Do not let the blood and urine specimens that you provided leave 
your sight until they have been properly sealed and initialed by you.
    4. Certify the statement in Step 4 of the Post-Accident Testing 
Blood/Urine Custody and Control Form (49 CFR 219) (Form FRA F 6180.74 
(revised)).
    5. If required by the medical facility, complete a separate consent 
form for taking of the specimens and their release to FRA for analysis 
under the FRA rule.
    Note: The employee may not be required to complete any form that 
contains any waiver of rights the employee may have in the employment 
relationship or that releases or holds harmless the medical facility 
with respect to negligence in the collection.
    2.2 The Collection.
    Exhibit C-1 contains instructions for collection of specimens for 
post-accident toxicology from surviving employees. These instructions 
shall be observed for each collection. Instructions are also contained 
in each

[[Page 275]]

post-accident shipping box and shall be provided to collection facility 
personnel involved in the collection and/or packaging of specimens for 
shipment.
(Post Mortem Collection)

    3.0 Fatality.
    This unit provides procedures for collecting post-accident body 
fluid/tissue specimens from the remains of employees killed in train 
accidents and train incidents, as required by Subpart C of this part. 
Subpart C specifies qualifying events and employees required to be 
tested.
    3.1 Collection.
    In the event of a fatality for which testing is required under 
Subpart C of this part, the railroad shall promptly make available to 
the custodian of the remains a post-accident shipping box. The railroad 
representative shall request the custodian to review the instructions 
contained in the shipping box and, through qualified medical personnel, 
to provide the specimens as indicated.

(Surviving Employees and Fatalities)

    4.0 Shipment.
    a. The railroad is responsible for arranging overnight 
transportation of the sealed shipping box containing the specimens. When 
possible without incurring delay, the box should be delivered directly 
from the collection personnel providing the specimens to an overnight 
express service courier. If it becomes necessary for the railroad to 
transport the box from point of collection to point of shipment, then--
    1. Individual kits and the shipping box shall be sealed by 
collection personnel before the box is turned over to the railroad 
representative;
    2. The railroad shall limit the number of persons handling the 
shipping box to the minimum necessary to provide for transportation;
    3. If the shipping box cannot immediately be delivered to the 
express carrier for transportation, it shall be maintained in secure 
temporary storage; and
    4. The railroad representatives handling the box shall document 
chain of custody of the shipping box and shall make available such 
documentation to FRA on request.

 Exhibit C-1--Instructions for Collection of Blood and Urine Specimens: 
              Mandatory Post-Accident Toxicological Testing

                               A. Purpose

    These instructions are for the use of personnel of collection 
facilities conducting collection of blood and urine specimens from 
surviving railroad employees following railroad accidents and casualties 
that qualify for mandatory alcohol/drug testing. The Federal Railroad 
Administration appreciates the participation of medical facilities in 
this important public safety program.

                        B. Prepare for Collection

    a. Railroad employees have consented to provision of specimens for 
analysis by the Federal Railroad Administration as a condition of 
employment (49 CFR 219.11). A private, controlled area should be 
designated for collection of specimens and completion of paperwork.
    b. Only one specimen should be collected at a time, with each 
employee's blood draw or urine collection having the complete attention 
of the collector until the specific specimen has been labeled, sealed 
and documented.
    c. Please remember two critical rules for the collections:
    d. All labeling and sealing must be done in the sight of the donor, 
with the specimen never having left the donor's presence until the 
specimen has been labeled, sealed and initialed by the donor.
    e. Continuous custody and control of blood and urine specimens must 
be maintained and documented on the forms provided. In order to do this, 
it is important for the paperwork and the specimens to stay together.
    f. To the extent practical, blood collection should take priority 
over urine collection. To limit steps in the chain of custody, it is 
best if a single collector handles both collections from a given 
employee.
    g. You will use a single Post-Accident Testing Blood/Urine Custody 
and Control Form (FRA Form 6108.74 (revised)), consisting of six Steps 
to complete the collection for each employee. We will refer to it as the 
Control Form.

                          C. Identify the Donor

    a. The employee donor must provide photo identification to each 
collector, or lacking this, be identified by the railroad 
representative.
    b. The donor should remove all unnecessary outer garments such as 
coats or jackets, but may retain valuables, including a wallet. Donors 
should not be asked to disrobe, unless necessary for a separate physical 
examination required by the attending physician.

                              D. Draw Blood

    a. Assemble the materials for collecting blood from each employee: 
two 10 ml grey-stoppered blood tubes and the Control Form.
    b. Ask the donor to complete STEP 1 on the Control Form.
    c. With the donor seated, draw two (2) 10 ml tubes of blood using 
standard medical procedures (sterile, single-use syringe into evacuated 
gray-top tubes provided). CAUTION: Do not use alcohol or an alcohol-
based swab to cleanse the venipuncture site.

[[Page 276]]

    d. Once both tubes are filled and the site of venipuncture is 
protected, immediately--
    1. Seal and label each tube by placing a numbered blood specimen 
label from the label set on the Control Form over the top of the tube 
and securing it down the sides.
    2. Ask the donor to initial each label. Please check to see that the 
initials match the employee's name and note any discrepancies in the 
``Remarks'' block of the Control Form.
    3. As collector, sign and date each blood tube label at the place 
provided.
    4. Skip to STEP 5 and initiate chain of custody for the blood tubes 
by filling out the first line of the block to show receipt of the blood 
specimens from the donor.
    5. Complete STEP 2 on the form.
    6. Return the blood tubes into the individual kit. Keep the 
paperwork and specimens together. If another collector will be 
collecting the urine specimen from this employee, transfer both the form 
and the individual kit with blood tubes to that person, showing the 
transfer of the blood tubes on the second line of STEP 5 (the chain of 
custody block).

                            E. Collect Urine

    a. The urine collector should assemble at his/her station the 
materials for collecting urine from each employee: one plastic 
collection cup with temperature device affixed enclosed in a heat-seal 
bag (with protective seal intact), two 90 ml urine specimen bottles with 
caps and one biohazard bag (with absorbent) also enclosed in a heat-seal 
bag (with protective seal intact), and the Control Form. Blood specimens 
already collected must remain in the collector's custody and control 
during this procedure.
    b. After requiring the employee to wash his/her hands, the collector 
should escort the employee directly to the urine collection area. To the 
extent practical, all sources of water in the collection area should be 
secured and a bluing agent (provided in the box) placed in any toilet 
bowl, tank, or other standing water.
    c. The employee will be provided a private place in which to void. 
Urination will not be directly observed. If the enclosure contains a 
source of running water that cannot be secured or any material (soap, 
etc.) that could be used to adulterate the specimen, the collector 
should monitor the provision of the specimen from outside the enclosure. 
Any unusual behavior or appearance should be noted in the remarks 
section of the Control Form or on the back of that form.
    d. The collector should then proceed as follows:
    e. Unwrap the collection cup in the employee's presence and hand it 
to the employee (or allow the employee to unwrap it).
    f. Ask the employee to void at least 60 ml into the collection cup 
(at least to the line marked).
    g. Leave the private enclosure.

IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH URINATION OR Specimen QUANTITY, SEE THE 
``TROUBLE BOX'' AT THE BACK OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS.

    h. Once the void is complete, the employee should exit the private 
enclosure and deliver the specimen to the collector. Both the collector 
and the employee must proceed immediately to the labeling/sealing area, 
with the specimen never leaving the sight of the employee before being 
sealed and labeled.
    i. Upon receipt of the specimen, proceed as follows:
    1. In the full view of the employee, remove the wrapper from the two 
urine specimen bottles. Transfer the urine from the collection cup into 
the specimen bottles (at least 30 ml in bottle A and at least 15 ml in 
bottle B).
    2. As you pour the specimen into the specimen bottles, please 
inspect for any unusual signs indicating possible adulteration or 
dilution. Carefully secure the tops. Note any unusual signs under 
``Remarks'' at STEP 3 of the Control Form.
    3. Within 4 minutes after the void, measure the temperature of the 
urine by reading the strip on the bottle. Mark the result at STEP 3 of 
the Control Form.

IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE URINE Specimen, SEE THE ``TROUBLE BOX'' 
AT THE BACK OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS.

    4. Remove the urine bottle labels from the Control Form. The labels 
are marked ``A'' and ``B.'' Place each label as marked over the top of 
its corresponding bottle, and secure the label to the sides of the 
bottle.
    5. Ask the donor to initial each label. Please check to see that the 
initials match the employee name and note any discrepancy in the 
``Remarks'' block of STEP 3.
    6. As collector, sign and date each urine label.
    7. Skip to STEP 5 and initiate chain-of-custody by showing receipt 
of the urine specimens from the donor. (If you collected the blood, a 
check under ``urine'' will suffice. If someone else collected the blood, 
first make sure transfer of the blood to you is documented. Then, using 
the next available line, show ``Provide specimens'' under purpose, 
``Donor'' under ``released by,'' check under ``urine'' and place your 
name, signature and date in the space provided.)
    8. Complete the remainder of STEP 3 on the Control Form.
    9. Have the employee complete STEP 4 on the Control Form.
    10. Place the filled urine bottles in the individual employee kit. 
Keep the paperwork and specimens together. If another collector

[[Page 277]]

will be collecting the blood specimen from this employee, transfer both 
the form and the kit to that person, showing the transfer of the urine 
specimens on the next available line of STEP 5 (the chain of custody 
block).

                   F. Seal the Individual Employee Kit

    a. The blood and urine specimens have now been collected for this 
employee. The blood/urine specimens will now be sealed into the 
individual employee kit, while all paperwork will be retained for 
further completion. After rechecking to see that each specimen is 
properly labeled and initialed, close the plastic bag to contain any 
leakage in transportation, and apply the kit security seal to the small 
individual kit. As collector, sign and date the kit seal.
    b. Before collecting specimens from the next employee, complete the 
next line on the chain-of-custody block showing release of the blood and 
urine by yourself for the purpose of ``Shipment'' and receipt by the 
courier service or railroad representative that will provide 
transportation of the box, together with the date.

                    G. Complete Treatment Information

    Complete STEP 6 of the Control Form. Mark the box if a breath 
alcohol test was conducted under FRA authority.

                     H. Prepare the Box for Shipment

    a. Sealed individual employee kits should be retained in secure 
storage if there will be a delay in preparation of the shipping box. The 
shipping box shall be prepared and sealed by a collection facility 
representative as follows:
    1. Inspect STEP 5 of each Control Form to ensure chain-of-custody is 
continuous and complete for each fluid (showing specimens released for 
shipment). Retain the medical facility copy of each Control Form and the 
Accident Information form for your records.
    2. Place sealed individual employee kits in the shipping box. Place 
all forms in zip-lock bag and seal securely. Place bag with forms and 
unused supplies in shipping box.
    3. Affix the mailing label provided to the outside of the shipping 
box.

                             I. Ship the Box

    a. The railroad must arrange to have the box shipped overnight air 
express or (if express service is unavailable) by air freight, prepaid, 
to FRA's designated laboratory. Whenever possible without incurring 
delay, the collector should deliver the box directly into the hands of 
the express courier or air freight representative.
    b. Where courier pickup is not immediately available at the 
collection facility where the specimens are taken, the railroad is 
required to transport the shipping box for expeditious shipment by air 
express, air freight or equivalent means.
    c. If the railroad is given custody of the box to arrange shipment, 
please record the name of the railroad official taking custody on the 
copy of Form 6180.73 retained by the collection site.

                             ``TROUBLE BOX''

    1. Problem: The employee claims an inability to urinate, either 
because he/she has recently voided or because of anxiety concerning the 
collection.
    Action: The employee may be offered moderate quantities of liquid to 
assist urination. If the employee continues to claim inability after 4 
hours, the urine collection should be discontinued, but the blood 
specimens should be forwarded and all other procedures followed. Please 
note in area provided for remarks what explanation was provided by the 
employee.
    2. Problem: The employee cannot provide approximately 60 ml. of 
specimen.
    Action: The employee should remain at the collection facility until 
as much as possible of the required amount can be given (up to 4 hours). 
The employee should be offered moderate quantities of liquids to aid 
urination. The first bottle, if it contains any quantity of urine, 
should be sealed and securely stored with the blood tubes and Control 
Form pending shipment. A second bottle should then be used for the 
subsequent void (using a second Control Form with the words ``SECOND 
VOID--FIRST Specimen INSUFFICIENT'' in the remarks block and labels from 
that form). However, if after 4 hours the donor's second void is also 
insufficient or contains no more than the first insufficient void, 
discard the second void and send the first void to the laboratory.
    3. Problem: The urine temperature is outside the normal range of 32 
deg.-38 deg.C/90 deg.-100 deg.F, and a suitable medical explanation 
cannot be provided by an oral temperature or other means; or
    4. Problem: The collector observes conduct clearly and unequivocally 
indicating an attempt to substitute or adulterate the specimen (e.g., 
substitute urine in plain view, blue dye in specimen presented, etc.) 
and a collection site supervisor or the railroad representative agrees 
that the circumstances indicate an attempt to tamper with the specimen.
    Action (for either Problem No. 3 or Problem No. 4): Document the 
problem on the Control Form.
    i. If the collection site supervisor or railroad representative 
concurs that the temperature of the specimen, or other clear and 
unequivocal evidence, indicates a possible attempt to substitute or 
alter the specimen, another void must be taken under direct observation 
by a collector of the same gender.
    ii. If a collector of the same sex is not available, do NOT proceed 
with this step.

[[Page 278]]

    iii. If a collector of the same gender is available, proceed as 
follows: A new Control Form must be initiated for the second void. The 
original suspect specimen should be marked ``Void'' and the follow-up 
void should be marked ``Void 2,'' with both voids being sent to the 
laboratory and the incident clearly detailed on the Control Form.

   Exhibit C-2--Instructions for Collection of Post Mortem Specimens: 
             Employee Killed in a Railroad Accident/Incident

    To the Medical Examiner, Coroner, or Pathologist:
    a. In compliance with Federal safety regulations (49 CFR Part 219), 
a railroad representative has requested that you obtain specimens for 
toxicology from the remains of a railroad employee who was killed in a 
railroad accident or incident. The deceased consented to the taking of 
such specimens, as a matter of Federal law, by performing service on the 
railroad (49 CFR 219.11(f)).
    b. Your assistance is requested in carrying out this program of 
testing, which is important to the protection of the public safety and 
the safety of those who work on the railroads.

                              A. Materials:

    The railroad will provide you a post-accident shipping box that 
contains necessary supplies. If the box is not immediately available, 
please proceed using supplies available to you that are suitable for 
forensic toxicology.

             B. Specimens requested, in order of preference:

    a. Blood--20 milliliters or more. Preferred sites: intact femoral 
vein or artery or peripheral vessels (up to 10 ml, as available) and 
intact heart (20 ml). Deposit blood in gray-stopper tubes individually 
by site and shake to mix specimen and preservative.
    Note: If uncontaminated blood is not available, bloody fluid or 
clots from body cavity may be useful for qualitative purposes; but do 
not label as blood. Please indicate source and identity of specimen on 
label of tube.
    b. Urine--as much as 100 milliliters, if available. Deposit into 
plastic bottles provided.
    c. Vitreous fluid--all available, deposited into smallest available 
tube (e.g., 3 ml) with 1% sodium fluoride, or gray-stopper tube 
(provided). Shake to mix specimen and preservative.
    d. If available at autopsy, organs--50 to 100 grams each of two or 
more of the following in order preference, as available: liver, bile, 
brain, kidney, spleen, and/or lung. Specimens should be individually 
deposited into zip-lock bags or other clean, single use containers 
suitable for forensic specimens.
    e. If vitreous or urine is not available, please provide--
    1. Spinal fluid--all available, in 8 ml container (if available) 
with sodium fluoride or in gray-stopper tube; or, if spinal fluid cannot 
be obtained,
    2. Gastric content--up to 100 milliliters, as available, into 
plastic bottle.

                         C. Specimen collection:

    a. Sampling at time of autopsy is preferred so that percutaneous 
needle puncturing is not necessary. However, if autopsy will not be 
conducted or is delayed, please proceed with sampling.
    b. Blood specimens should be taken by sterile syringe and deposited 
directly into evacuated tube, if possible, to avoid contamination of 
specimen or dissipation of volatiles (ethyl alcohol).
    Note: If only cavity fluid is available, please open cavity to 
collect specimen. Note condition of cavity.
    c. Please use smallest tubes available to accommodate available 
quantity of fluid specimen (with 1% sodium fluoride).

                  D. Specimen identification, sealing:

    a. As each specimen is collected, seal each blood tube and each 
urine bottle using the respective blood tube or urine bottle using the 
identifier labels from the set provided with the Post-Accident Testing 
Blood/Urine Custody and Control Form (49 CFR part 219) (Form FRA F 
6180.74 (revised)). Make sure the unique identification number on the 
labels match the pre-printed number on the Control Form. Please label 
other specimens with name and specimen set identification numbers. You 
may use labels and seals from any of the extra forms, but annotate them 
accordingly.
    b. Annotate each label with specimen description and source (as 
appropriate) (e.g., blood, femoral vein).
    c. Please provide copy of any written documentation regarding 
condition of body and/or sampling procedure that is available at the 
time specimens are shipped.

                              E. Handling:

    a. If specimens cannot be shipped immediately as provided below, 
specimens other than blood may be immediately frozen. Blood specimens 
should be refrigerated, but not frozen.
    b. All specimens and documentation should be secured from 
unauthorized access pending delivery for transportation.

                             F. Information:

    a. If the railroad has not already done so, please place the name of 
the subject at the top of the Control Form (STEP 1). You are requested 
to complete STEP 2 of the form,

[[Page 279]]

annotating it by writing the word ``FATALITY,'' listing the specimens 
provided, providing any further information under ``Remarks'' or at the 
bottom of the form. If it is necessary to transfer custody of the 
specimens from the person taking the specimens prior to preparing the 
box for shipment, please use the blocks provided in STEP 5 to document 
transfer of custody.
    b. The railroad representative will also provide Accident 
Information Required for Post-Accident Toxicological Testing (49 CFR 
Part 219), Form FRA 6180.73 (revised). Both forms should be placed in 
the shipping box when completed; but you may retain the designated 
medical facility copy of each form for your records.

                      G. Packing the shipping box:

    a. Place urine bottles and blood tubes in the sponge liner in the 
individual kit, close the biohazard bag zipper, close the kit and apply 
the kit custody seal to the kit. You may use additional kits for each 
tissue specimen, being careful to identify specimen by tissue, name of 
deceased, and specimen set identification number. Apply kit security 
seals to individual kits and initial across all seals. Place all forms 
in the zip-lock bag and seal securely.
    b. Place the bag in the shipping box. Do not put forms in with the 
specimens. Seal the shipping box with the seal provided and initial and 
date across the seal.
    c. Affix the mailing label to the outside of the box.

                          H. Shipping the box:

    a. The railroad must arrange to have the box shipped overnight air 
express or (if express service is unavailable) by air freight, prepaid, 
to FRA's designated laboratory. When possible, but without incurring 
delay, deliver the sealed shipping box directly to the express courier 
or the air freight representative.
    b. If courier pickup is not immediately available at your facility, 
the railroad is required to transport the sealed shipping box to the 
nearest point of shipment via air express, air freight or equivalent 
means.
    c. If the railroad receives the sealed shipping box to arrange 
shipment, please record under ``Supplemental Information'' on the 
Control Form, the name of the railroad official taking custody.

                                I. Other:

    FRA requests that the person taking the specimens annotate the 
Control Form under ``Supplemental Information'' if additional 
toxicological analysis will be undertaken with respect to the fatality. 
FRA reports are available to the coroner or medical examiner on request.

Sec. 220.31  Initiating a radio transmission.

            Before transmitting by radio, an employee shall:

    (a) Listen to ensure that the channel on which the employee intends 
to transmit is not already in use;
    (b) Identify the employee's station in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 220.27; and
    (c) Verify that the employee has made radio contact with the person 
or station with whom the employee intends to communicate by listening 
for an acknowledgment. If the station acknowledging the employee's 
transmission fails to identify itself properly, the employee shall 
require a proper identification before proceeding with the transmission.


<R05>
Sec. 220.33  Receiving a radio transmission.

    (a) Upon receiving a radio call, an employee shall promptly 
acknowledge the call, identifying the employee's station in accordance 
with the requirements of Sec. 220.27 and stand by to receive. An 
employee need not attend the radio during the time that this would 
interfere with other immediate duties relating to the safety of railroad 
operations.
    (b) An employee who receives a transmission shall repeat it to the 
transmitting party unless the communication:
    (1) Relates to yard switching operations;
    (2) Is a recorded message from an automatic alarm device; or
    (3) Is general in nature and does not contain any information, 
instruction or advice which could affect the safety of a railroad 
operation.


<R05>
Sec. 220.35  Ending a radio transmission.

    (a) Except for transmissions relating to yard switching operations, 
at the close of each transmission to which a response is expected, the 
transmitting employee shall say ``over'' to indicate to the receiving 
employee that the transmission is ended.
    (b) Except for transmissions relating to yard switching operations, 
at the close of each transmission to which no response is expected, the 
transmitting employee shall state the employee's identification followed 
by the word ``out'' to indicate to the receiving employee that the 
exchange of transmissions is complete.


<R05>
Sec. 220.37  Testing radio and wireless communication equipment.

    (a) Each radio, and all primary and redundant wireless communication 
equipment used under Sec. Sec. 220.9 and 220.11, shall be tested as 
soon as practicable to ensure that the equipment functions as intended 
prior to the commencement of the work assignment.
    (b) The test of a radio shall consist of an exchange of voice 
transmissions with another radio. The employee receiving the 
transmission shall advise the employee conducting the test of the 
clarity of the transmission.


<R05>
Sec. 220.38  Communication equipment failure.

    (a) Any radio or wireless communication device found not to be 
functioning as intended when tested pursuant to Sec. 220.37 shall be 
removed from service and the dispatcher or other employee designated by 
the railroad shall be so notified as soon as practicable.
    (b) If a radio or wireless communication device fails on the 
controlling locomotive en route, the train may continue until the 
earlier of--
    (1) The next calendar day inspection, or
    (2) The nearest forward point where the radio or wireless 
communication device can be repaired or replaced.


<R05>
Sec. 220.39  Continuous radio monitoring.

    Each radio used in a railroad operation shall be turned on to the 
appropriate channel as designated in Sec. 220.23 and adjusted to 
receive communications.

<R05>
Sec. 220.41  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 220.43  Radio communications consistent with federal regulations and 

railroad operating rules.

    Radio communication shall not be used in connection with a railroad 
operation in a manner which conflicts with the requirements of this 
part, Federal Communication Commission regulations, or the railroad's 
operating rules. The use of citizen band radios for railroad operating 
purposes is prohibited.


<R05>
Sec. 220.45  Radio communication shall be complete.

    Any radio communication which is not fully understood or completed 
in accordance with the requirements of this part and the operating rules 
of the railroad, shall not be acted upon and shall be treated as though 
not sent.


<R05>
Sec. 220.47  Emergency radio transmissions.

    An initial emergency radio transmission shall be preceded by the 
word ``emergency,'' repeated three times. An emergency transmission 
shall have priority over all other transmissions and the frequency or 
channel shall be kept clear of non-emergency traffic for the duration of 
the emergency communication.


<R05>
Sec. 220.49  Radio communication used in shoving, backing or pushing 

movements.

    When radio communication is used in connection with the shoving, 
backing or pushing of a train, locomotive, car, or on-track equipment, 
the employee directing the movement shall specify the distance of the 
movement, and the movement shall stop in one-half the remaining distance 
unless additional instructions are received. If the instructions are not 
understood, the movement shall be stopped immediately and may not be 
resumed until the misunderstanding has been resolved, radio contact has 
been restored, or communication has been achieved by hand signals or 
other procedures in accordance with the operating rules of the railroad.


<R05>
Sec. 220.51  Radio communications and signal indications.

    (a) No information may be given by radio to a train or engine crew 
about the position or aspect displayed by a fixed signal. However, a 
radio may be used by a train crew member to communicate information 
about the position or aspect displayed by a fixed signal to other 
members of the same crew.
    (b) Except as provided in the railroad's operating rules, radio 
communication shall not be used to convey instructions which would have 
the effect of overriding the indication of a fixed signal.


<R05>
Sec. 220.61  Radio transmission of mandatory directives.

    (a) Each mandatory directive may be transmitted by radio only when 
authorized by the railroad's operating rules. The directive shall be 
transmitted in accordance with the railroad's operating rules and the 
requirements of this part.
    (b) The procedure for transmission of a mandatory directive is as 
follows:
    (1) The train dispatcher or operator shall call the addressees of 
the mandatory directive and state the intention to transmit the 
mandatory directive.
    (2) Before the mandatory directive is transmitted, the employee to 
receive and copy shall state the employee's name, identification, 
location, and readiness to receive and copy. An employee operating the 
controls of moving equipment shall not receive and copy mandatory 
directives. A mandatory directive shall not be transmitted to employees 
on moving equipment, if such directive cannot be received and copied 
without impairing safe operation of the equipment.
    (3) A mandatory directive shall be copied in writing by the 
receiving employee in the format prescribed in the railroad's operating 
rules.
    (4) After the mandatory directive has been received and copied, it 
shall be immediately repeated in its entirety. After verifying the 
accuracy of the repeated mandatory directive, the train dispatcher or 
operator shall then state the time and name of the employee designated 
by the railroad who is authorized to issue mandatory directives.

[[Page 286]]

An employee copying a mandatory directive shall then acknowledge by 
repeating the time and name of the employee so designated by the 
railroad.
    (5)(i) For train crews, before a mandatory directive is acted upon, 
the conductor and engineer shall each have a written copy of the 
mandatory directive and make certain that the mandatory directive is 
read and understood by all members of the crew who are responsible for 
the operation of the train. Mandatory directives which have been 
fulfilled or canceled shall be marked with an ``X'' or in accordance 
with the railroad's operating rules, and retained for the duration of 
the train crew's work assignment.
    (ii) For on-track equipment, before a mandatory directive is acted 
upon, the employee responsible for on-track safety shall have a written 
copy of the mandatory directive, and make certain that the mandatory 
directive is acknowledged by all employees who are responsible for 
executing that mandatory directive. The employee responsible for on-
track safety shall retain a copy of the mandatory directive while it is 
in effect.
    (6) A mandatory directive which has not been completed or which does 
not comply with the requirements of the railroad's operating rules and 
this part, may not be acted upon and shall be treated as though not 
sent. Information contained in a mandatory directive may not be acted 
upon by persons other than those to whom the mandatory directive is 
addressed.

    Editorial Note: At 63 FR 11621, Mar. 10, 1998, an amendment was 
published amending footnote 1 to appendix A of part 220. The amendment 
could not be incorporated because footnote 1 to appendix A of part 220 
does not exist in 49 CFR parts 200 to 399, revised as of Oct. 1, 1997.


<R05>
   Sec. Appendix B to Part 220--Recommended Pronunciation of Numerals

    To distinguish numbers from similar sounding words, the word 
``figures''should be used preceding such numbers. Numbers should be 
pronounced as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Number                               Spoken
------------------------------------------------------------------------

2........................................  TOO.
3........................................  THUH-REE-.
4........................................  FO-WER.
5........................................  FI-YIV.
6........................................  SIX.
7........................................  SEVEN.
8........................................  ATE.
9........................................  NINER.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (The figure ZERO should be written as ``0'' to distinguish it from 
the letter ``O''. The figure ONE should be underlined to distinguish it 
from the letter ``I''. When railroad rules require that numbers be 
spelled, these principles do not apply.)
    The following examples illustrate the recommended pronunciation of 
numerals:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Number                               Spoken

                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 222.1  What is the purpose of this regulation?

    The purpose of this part is to provide for safety at public highway-
rail grade crossings by requiring locomotive horn use at public highway-
rail grade crossings except in quiet zones established and maintained in 
accordance with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 222.3  What areas does this regulation cover?

    (a) This part prescribes standards for sounding locomotive horns 
when locomotives approach and pass through public highway-rail grade 
crossings. This part also provides standards for the creation and 
maintenance of quiet zones within which locomotive horns need not be 
sounded.
    (b) The provisions of this part are separate and severable from one 
another. If any provision is stayed or determined to be invalid, it is 
the intent of FRA that the remaining provisions shall continue in 
effect.
    (c) This part does not apply to any Chicago Region highway-rail 
grade crossing where the railroad was excused from sounding the 
locomotive horn by the Illinois Commerce Commission, and where the 
railroad did not sound the horn, as of December 18, 2003.


<R05>
Sec. 222.5  What railroads does this regulation apply to?

    This part applies to all railroads except:
    (a) A railroad that exclusively operates freight trains only on 
track which is not part of the general railroad system of 
transportation;
    (b) Passenger railroads that operate only on track which is not part 
of the general railroad system of transportation and that operate at a 
maximum speed of 15 miles per hour over public highway-rail grade 
crossings; and
    (c) Rapid transit operations within an urban area that are not 
connected to the general railroad system of transportation. See 49 CFR 
part 209, appendix A for the definitive statement of the meaning of the 
preceding sentence.


<R05>
Sec. 222.7  What is this regulation's effect on State and local laws and 

ordinances?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, issuance of 
this part preempts any State law, rule, regulation, or order governing 
the sounding of the locomotive horn at public highway-rail grade 
crossings, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 20106.
    (b) This part does not preempt any State law, rule, regulation, or 
order governing the sounding of locomotive audible warning devices at 
any highway-rail grade crossing described in Sec. 222.3(c) of this 
part.
    (c) Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 222.25 and 222.27, this part 
does not preempt any State law, rule, regulation, or order governing the 
sounding of locomotive horns at private highway-rail grade crossings or 
pedestrian crossings.
    (d) Inclusion of SSMs and ASMs in this part or approved subsequent 
to issuance of this part does not constitute federal preemption of State 
law regarding whether those measures may be used for traffic control. 
Individual

[[Page 294]]

states may continue to determine whether specific SSMs or ASMs are 
appropriate traffic control measures for that State, consistent with 
Federal Highway Administration regulations and the MUTCD. However, 
except for the SSMs and ASMs implemented at highway-rail grade crossings 
described in Sec. 222.3(c) of this part, inclusion of SSMs and ASMs in 
this part does constitute federal preemption of State law concerning the 
sounding of the locomotive horn in relation to the use of those 
measures.
    (e) Issuance of this part does not constitute federal preemption of 
administrative procedures required under State law regarding the 
modification or installation of engineering improvements at highway-rail 
grade crossings.


<R05>
Sec. 222.9  Definitions.

    As used in this part--
    Administrator means the Administrator of the Federal Railroad 
Administration or the Administrator's delegate.
    Alternative safety measures (ASM) means a safety system or 
procedure, other than an SSM, established in accordance with this part 
which is provided by the appropriate traffic control authority or law 
enforcement authority and which, after individual review and analysis by 
the Associate Administrator, is determined to be an effective substitute 
for the locomotive horn in the prevention of highway-rail casualties at 
specific highway-rail grade crossings. Appendix B to this part lists 
such measures.
    Associate Administrator means the Associate Administrator for Safety 
of the Federal Railroad Administration or the Associate Administrator's 
delegate.
    Channelization device means a traffic separation system made up of a 
raised longitudinal channelizer, with vertical panels or tubular 
delineators, that is placed between opposing highway lanes designed to 
alert or guide traffic around an obstacle or to direct traffic in a 
particular direction. ``Tubular markers'' and ``vertical panels'', as 
described in the MUTCD, are acceptable channelization devices for 
purposes of this part. Additional design specifications are determined 
by the standard traffic design specifications used by the governmental 
entity constructing the channelization device.
    Chicago Region means the following six counties in the State of 
Illinois: Cook, DuPage, Lake, Kane, McHenry and Will.
    Crossing Corridor Risk Index means a number reflecting a measure of 
risk to the motoring public at public grade crossings along a rail 
corridor, calculated in accordance with the procedures in appendix D of 
this part, representing the average risk at each public crossing within 
the corridor. This risk level is determined by averaging among all 
public crossings within the corridor, the product of the number of 
predicted collisions per year and the predicted likelihood and severity 
of casualties resulting from those collisions at each public crossing 
within the corridor.
    Diagnostic team as used in this part, means a group of knowledgeable 
representatives of parties of interest in a highway-rail grade crossing, 
organized by the public authority responsible for that crossing, who, 
using crossing safety management principles, evaluate conditions at a 
grade crossing to make determinations or recommendations for the public 
authority concerning safety needs at that crossing.
    Effectiveness rate means a number between zero and one which 
represents the reduction of the likelihood of a collision at a public 
highway-rail grade crossing as a result of the installation of an SSM or 
ASM when compared to the same crossing equipped with conventional active 
warning systems of flashing lights and gates. Zero effectiveness means 
that the SSM or ASM provides no reduction in the probability of a 
collision, while an effectiveness rating of one means that the SSM or 
ASM is totally effective in eliminating collision risk. Measurements 
between zero and one reflect the percentage by which the SSM or ASM 
reduces the probability of a collision.
    FRA means the Federal Railroad Administration.
    Grade Crossing Inventory Form means the U.S. DOT National Highway-
Rail Grade Crossing Inventory Form, FRA Form F6180.71. This form is 
available through the FRA's Office of Safety, or

    Intermediate Partial Quiet Zone means a segment of a rail line 
within which is situated one or a number of consecutive public highway-
rail grade crossings at which State statutes or local ordinances 
restricted the routine sounding of locomotive horns for a specified 
period of time during the evening or nighttime hours, or at which 
locomotive horns did not sound due to formal or informal agreements 
between the community and the railroad or railroads for a specified 
period of time during the evening and/or nighttime hours, and at which 
such statutes, ordinances or agreements were in place and enforced or 
observed as of December 18, 2003, but not as of October 9, 1996.
    Intermediate Quiet Zone means a segment of a rail line within which 
is situated one or a number of consecutive public highway-rail grade 
crossings at which State statutes or local ordinances restricted the

signal.
    Locomotive horn means a locomotive air horn, steam whistle, or 
similar audible warning device (see 49 CFR 229.129) mounted on a 
locomotive or control cab car. The terms ``locomotive horn'', ``train 
whistle'', ``locomotive whistle'', and ``train horn'' are used 
interchangeably in the railroad industry. For purposes of this part, 
locomotive horns used in rapid transit operations must be suitable for 
street usage and/or designed in accordance with State law requirements.
    Median means the portion of a divided highway separating the travel 
ways for traffic in opposite directions.
    MUTCD means the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices published 
by the Federal Highway Administration.

average level of risk to the motoring public at public highway-rail 
grade crossings equipped with flashing lights and gates and at which 
locomotive horns are sounded. For purposes of this rule, a risk level 
above the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold represents a significant 
risk with respect to loss of life or serious personal injury. The 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold is calculated in accordance with 
the procedures in appendix D of this part. Unless otherwise indicated, 
references in this part to the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold 
reflect its level as last published by FRA in the Federal Register.
    New Partial Quiet Zone means a segment of a rail line within which 
is situated one or a number of consecutive public highway-rail crossings 
at which locomotive horns are not routinely sounded between the hours of 
10 p.m. and 7 a.m., but are routinely sounded during the remaining 
portion of the day, and which does not qualify as a Pre-Rule Partial 
Quiet Zone or an Intermediate Partial Quiet Zone.
    New Quiet Zone means a segment of a rail line within which is 
situated one or a number of consecutive public highway-rail grade 
crossings at which routine sounding of locomotive horns is restricted 
pursuant to this part and which does not qualify as either a Pre-Rule

motor vehicle from leaving the roadway. Non-traversable curbs are used 
at locations where highway speeds do not exceed 40

[[Page 296]]

miles per hour and are at least six inches high. Additional design 
specifications are determined by the standard traffic design 
specifications used by the governmental entity constructing the curb.
    Partial Quiet Zone means a segment of a rail line within which is 
situated one or a number of consecutive public highway-rail grade 
crossings at which locomotive horns are not routinely sounded for a 
specified period of time during the evening and/or nighttime hours.
    Pedestrian grade crossing means, for purposes of this part, a 
separate designed sidewalk or pathway where pedestrians, but not 
vehicles, cross railroad tracks. Sidewalk crossings contiguous with, or 
separate but adjacent to, public highway-rail grade crossings are 
presumed to be part of the public highway-rail grade crossing and are 
not considered pedestrian grade crossings.
    Power-out indicator means a device which is capable of indicating to 
trains approaching a grade crossing equipped with an active warning 
system whether commercial electric power is activating the warning 
system at that crossing. This term includes remote health monitoring of 
grade crossing warning systems if such monitoring system is equipped to 
indicate power status.
    Pre-existing Modified Supplementary Safety Measure (Pre-existing 
Modified SSM) means a safety system or procedure that is listed in 
appendix A to this Part, but is not fully compliant with the standards 
set forth therein, which was installed before December 18, 2003 by the 
appropriate traffic control or law enforcement authority responsible for 
safety at the highway-rail grade crossing. The calculation of risk 
reduction credit for pre-existing modified SSMs is addressed in appendix 
B of this part.
    Pre-existing Supplementary Safety Measure (Pre-existing SSM) means a 
safety system or procedure established in accordance with this part 
before December 18, 2003 which was provided by the appropriate traffic 
control or law enforcement authority responsible for safety at the 
highway-rail grade crossing. These safety measures must fully comply 
with the SSM requirements set forth in appendix A of this part. The 
calculation of risk reduction credit for qualifying pre-existing SSMs is 
addressed in appendix A.
    Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone means a segment of a rail line within 
which is situated one or a number of consecutive public highway-rail 
crossings at which State statutes or local ordinances restricted the 
routine sounding of locomotive horns for a specified period of time 
during the evening and/or nighttime hours, or at which locomotive horns 
did not sound due to formal or informal agreements between the community 
and the railroad or railroads for a specified period of time during the 
evening and/or nighttime hours, and at which such statutes, ordinances 
or agreements were in place and enforced or observed as of October 9, 
1996 and on December 18, 2003.

situated one or a number of consecutive public highway-rail crossings at 
which State statutes or local ordinances restricted the routine sounding 
of locomotive horns, or at which locomotive horns did not sound due to 
formal or informal agreements between the community and the railroad or 
railroads, and at which such statutes, ordinances or agreements were in 
place and enforced or observed as of October 9, 1996 and on December 18, 
2003.
    Private highway-rail grade crossing means, for purposes of this 
part, a highway-rail grade crossing which is not a public highway-rail 
grade crossing.
    Public authority means the public entity responsible for traffic 
control or law enforcement at the public highway-rail grade or 
pedestrian crossing.
    Public highway-rail grade crossing means, for purposes of this part, 
a location where a public highway, road, or street, including associated 
sidewalks or pathways, crosses one or more railroad tracks at grade. If 
a public authority maintains the roadway on both sides of the crossing, 
the crossing is considered a public crossing for purposes of this part.
    Quiet zone means a segment of a rail line, within which is situated 
one or a number of consecutive public highway-

[[Page 297]]

rail crossings at which locomotive horns are not routinely sounded.
    Quiet Zone Risk Index means a measure of risk to the motoring public 
which reflects the Crossing Corridor Risk Index for a quiet zone, after 
adjustment to account for increased risk due to lack of locomotive horn 
use at the crossings within the quiet zone (if horns are presently 
sounded at the crossings) and reduced risk due to implementation, if 
any, of SSMs and ASMs with the quiet zone. The calculation of the Quiet 
Zone Risk Index, which is explained in appendix D of this part, does not 
differ for partial quiet zones.
    Railroad means any form of non-highway ground transportation that 
runs on rails or electromagnetic guideways and any entity providing such 
transportation, including:
    (1) Commuter or other short-haul railroad passenger service in a 
metropolitan or suburban area and commuter railroad service that was 
operated by the Consolidated Rail Corporation on January 1, 1979; and
    (2) High speed ground transportation systems that connect 
metropolitan areas, without regard to whether those systems use new 
technologies not associated with traditional railroads; but does not 
include rapid transit operations in an urban area that are not connected 
to the general railroad system of transportation.
    Recognized State agency means, for purposes of this part, a State 
agency, responsible for highway-rail grade crossing safety or highway 
and road safety, that has applied for and been approved by FRA as a 
participant in the quiet zone development process.
    Relevant collision means a collision at a highway-rail grade 
crossing between a train and a motor vehicle, excluding the following: a 
collision resulting from an activation failure of an active grade 
crossing warning system; a collision in which there is no driver in the 
motor vehicle; or a collision in which the highway vehicle struck the 
side of the train beyond the fourth locomotive unit or rail car. With 
respect to Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones, a relevant collision shall not 
include collisions that occur during the time period within which the 
locomotive horn is routinely sounded.
    Risk Index With Horns means a measure of risk to the motoring public 
when locomotive horns are routinely sounded at every public highway-rail 
grade crossing within a quiet zone. In Pre-Rule Quiet Zones and Pre-Rule 
Partial Quiet Zones, the Risk Index With Horns is determined by 
adjusting the Crossing Corridor Risk Index to account for the decreased 
risk that would result if locomotive horns were routinely sounded at 
each public highway-rail grade crossing.
    Supplementary safety measure (SSM) means a safety system or 
procedure established in accordance with this part which is provided by 
the appropriate traffic control authority or law enforcement authority 
responsible for safety at the highway-rail grade crossing, that is 
determined by the Associate Administrator to be an effective substitute 
for the locomotive horn in the prevention of highway-rail casualties. 
Appendix A of this part lists such SSMs.
    Waiver means a temporary or permanent modification of some or all of 
the requirements of this part as they apply to a specific party under a 
specific set of facts. Waiver does not refer to the process of 
establishing quiet zones or approval of quiet zones in accordance with 
the provisions of this part.
    Wayside horn means a stationary horn located at a highway rail grade 
crossing, designed to provide, upon the approach of a locomotive or 
train, audible warning to oncoming motorists of the approach of a train.

Sec. 222.11  What are the penalties for failure to comply with this 

regulation?

    Any person who violates any requirement of this part or causes the 
violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil penalty of least 
$550 and not more than $16,000 per violation, except that: Penalties may 
be assessed against individuals only for willful violations, and, where 
a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violations has 
created an imminent hazard of death or injury to persons, or has caused 
death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $27,000 per violation may be

[[Page 298]]

assessed. Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate 
offense. Any person who knowingly and willfully falsifies a record or 
report required by this part may be subject to criminal penalties under 
49 U.S.C. 21311. Appendix G of this part contains a schedule of civil 
penalty amounts used in connection with this part.

<R05>
Sec. 222.13  Who is responsible for compliance?

    Any person, including but not limited to a railroad, contractor for 
a railroad, or a local or State governmental entity that performs any 
function covered by this part, must perform that function in accordance 
with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 222.15  How does one obtain a waiver of a provision of this regulation?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, two parties 
must jointly file a petition (request) for a waiver. They are the 
railroad owning or controlling operations over the railroad tracks 
crossing the public highway-rail grade crossing and the public authority 
which has jurisdiction over the roadway crossing the railroad tracks.
    (b) If the railroad and the public authority cannot reach agreement 
to file a joint petition, either party may file a request for a waiver; 
however, the filing party must specify in its petition the steps it has 
taken in an attempt to reach agreement with the other party, and explain 
why applying the requirement that a joint submission be made in that 
instance would not be likely to contribute significantly to public 
safety. If the Associate Administrator determines that applying the 
requirement for a jointly filed submission to that particular petition 
would not be likely to significantly contribute to public safety, the 
Associate Administrator shall waive the requirement for joint submission 
and accept the petition for consideration. The filing party must also 
provide the other party with a copy of the petition filed with FRA.
    (c) Each petition for waiver must be filed in accordance with 49 CFR 
part 211.
    (d) If the Administrator finds that a waiver of compliance with a 
provision of this part is in the public interest and consistent with the 
safety of highway and railroad users, the Administrator may grant the 
waiver subject to any conditions the Administrator deems necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 222.17  How can a State agency become a recognized State agency?

    (a) Any State agency responsible for highway-rail grade crossing 
safety and/or highway and road safety may become a recognized State 
agency by submitting an application to the Associate Administrator that 
contains:
    (1) A detailed description of the proposed scope of involvement in 
the quiet zone development process;
    (2) The name, address, and telephone number of the person(s) who may 
be contacted to discuss the State agency application; and
    (3) A statement from State agency counsel which affirms that the 
State agency is authorized to undertake the responsibilities proposed in 
its application.
    (b) The Associate Administrator will approve the application if, in 
the Associate Administrator's judgment, the proposed scope of State 
agency involvement will facilitate safe and effective quiet zone 
development. The Associate Administrator may include in any decision of 
approval such conditions as he/she deems necessary and appropriate.


<R04>
                    Subpart B_Use of Locomotive Horns


<R05>
Sec. 222.21  When must a locomotive horn be used?

    (a) Except as provided in this part, the locomotive horn on the lead 
locomotive of a train, lite locomotive consist, individual locomotive or 
lead cab car shall be sounded when such locomotive or lead cab car is 
approaching a public highway-rail grade crossing. Sounding of the 
locomotive horn with two long blasts, one short blast and one long blast 
shall be initiated at a location so as to be in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section and shall

[[Page 299]]

be repeated or prolonged until the locomotive occupies the crossing. 
This pattern may be varied as necessary where crossings are spaced 
closely together.
    (b)(1) Railroads to which this part applies shall comply with all 
the requirements contained in this paragraph (b) beginning on December 
15, 2006. On and after June 24, 2005, but prior to December 15, 2006, a 
railroad shall, at its option, comply with this section or shall sound 
the locomotive horn in the manner required by State law, or in the 
absence of State law, in the manner required by railroad operating rules 
in effect immediately prior to June 24, 2005.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (d) of this section, 
or when the locomotive horn is defective and the locomotive is being 
moved for repair consistent with section 229.9 of this chapter, the 
locomotive horn shall begin to be sounded at least 15 seconds, but no 
more than 20 seconds, before the locomotive enters the crossing. It 
shall not constitute a violation of this section if, acting in good 
faith, a locomotive engineer begins sounding the locomotive horn not 
more than 25 seconds before the locomotive enters the crossing, if the 
locomotive engineer is unable to precisely estimate the time of arrival 
of the train at the crossing for whatever reason.
    (3) Trains, locomotive consists and individual locomotives traveling 
at speeds in excess of 60 mph shall not begin sounding the horn more 
than one-quarter mile (1,320 feet) in advance of the nearest public 
highway-rail grade crossing, even if the advance warning provided by the 
locomotive horn will be less than 15 seconds in duration.
    (c) As stated in Sec. 222.3(c) of this part, this section does not 
apply to any Chicago Region highway-rail grade crossing at which 
railroads were excused from sounding the locomotive horn by the Illinois 
Commerce Commission, and where railroads did not sound the horn, as of 
December 18, 2003.
    (d) Trains, locomotive consists and individual locomotives that have 
stopped in close proximity to a public highway-rail grade crossing may 
approach the crossing and sound the locomotive horn for less than 15 
seconds before the locomotive enters the highway-rail grade crossing, if 
the locomotive engineer is able to determine that the public highway-
rail grade crossing is not obstructed and either:
    (1) The public highway-rail grade crossing is equipped with 
automatic flashing lights and gates and the gates are fully lowered; or
    (2) There are no conflicting highway movements approaching the 
public highway-rail grade crossing.
    (e) Where State law requires the sounding of a locomotive audible 
warning device other than the locomotive horn at public highway-rail 
grade crossings, that locomotive audible warning device shall be sounded 
in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 222.23  How does this regulation affect sounding of a horn during an 

emergency or other situations?

    (a)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, a 
locomotive engineer may sound the locomotive horn to provide a warning 
to animals, vehicle operators, pedestrians, trespassers or crews on 
other trains in an emergency situation if, in the locomotive engineer's 
sole judgment, such action is appropriate in order to prevent imminent 
injury, death, or property damage.
    (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, including 
provisions addressing the establishment of a quiet zone, limits on the 
length of time in which a horn may be sounded, or installation of 
wayside horns within quiet zones, this part does not preclude the 
sounding of locomotive horns in emergency situations, nor does it impose 
a legal duty to sound the locomotive horn in such situations.
    (b) Nothing in this part restricts the use of the locomotive horn in 
the following situations:
    (1) When a wayside horn is malfunctioning;
    (2) When active grade crossing warning devices have malfunctioned 
and use of the horn is required by one of the following sections of this 
chapter: Sec. Sec. 234.105, 234.106, or 234.107;
    (3) When grade crossing warning systems are temporarily out of 
service during inspection, maintenance, or testing of the system; or

[[Page 300]]

    (4) When SSMs, modified SSMs or engineering SSMs no longer comply 
with the requirements set forth in appendix A of this part or the 
conditions contained within the Associate Administrator's decision to 
approve the quiet zone in accordance with section 222.39(b) of this 
part.
    (c) Nothing in this part restricts the use of the locomotive horn 
for purposes other than highway-rail crossing safety (e.g., to announce 
the approach of a train to roadway workers in accordance with a program 
adopted under part 214 of this chapter, or where required for other 
purposes under railroad operating rules).


<R05>
Sec. 222.25  How does this rule affect private highway-rail grade crossings?

    This rule does not require the routine sounding of locomotive horns 
at private highway-rail grade crossings. However, where State law 
requires the sounding of a locomotive horn at private highway-rail grade 
crossings, the locomotive horn shall be sounded in accordance with Sec. 
222.21 of this part. Where State law requires the sounding of a 
locomotive audible warning device other than the locomotive horn at 
private highway-rail grade crossings, that locomotive audible warning 
device shall be sounded in accordance with Sec. Sec. 222.21(b) and (d) 
of this part.
    (a) Private highway-rail grade crossings located within the 
boundaries of a quiet zone must be included in the quiet zone.
    (b)(1) Private highway-rail grade crossings that are located in New 
Quiet Zones or New Partial Quiet Zones and allow access to the public, 
or which provide access to active industrial or commercial sites, must 
be evaluated by a diagnostic team and equipped or treated in accordance 
with the recommendations of such diagnostic team.
    (2) The public authority shall provide the State agency responsible 
for grade crossing safety and all affected railroads an opportunity to 
participate in the diagnostic team review of private highway-rail grade 
crossings.
    (c)(1) At a minimum, each approach to every private highway-rail 
grade crossing within a New Quiet Zone or New Partial Quiet Zone shall 
be marked by a crossbuck and a ``STOP'' sign, which are compliant with 
MUTCD standards unless otherwise prescribed by State law, and shall be 
equipped with advance warning signs in compliance with Sec. 222.35(c) 
of this part.
    (2) At a minimum, each approach to every private highway-rail grade 
crossing within a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone 
shall, by June 24, 2008, be marked by a crossbuck and a ``STOP'' sign, 
which are compliant with MUTCD standards unless otherwise prescribed by 
State law, and shall be equipped with advance warning signs in 
compliance with Sec. 222.35(c) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 222.27  How does this rule affect pedestrian grade crossings?

    This rule does not require the routine sounding of locomotive horns 
at pedestrian grade crossings. However, where State law requires the 
sounding of a locomotive horn at pedestrian grade crossings, the 
locomotive horn shall be sounded in accordance with Sec. 222.21 of this 
part. Where State law requires the sounding of a locomotive audible 
warning device other than the locomotive horn at pedestrian grade 
crossings, that locomotive audible warning device shall be sounded in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 222.21(b) and (d) of this part.
    (a) Pedestrian grade crossings located within the boundaries of a 
quiet zone must be included in the quiet zone.
    (b) Pedestrian grade crossings that are located in New Quiet Zones 
or New Partial Quiet Zones must be evaluated by a diagnostic team and 
equipped or treated in accordance with the recommendations of such 
diagnostic team.
    (c) The public authority shall provide the State agency responsible 
for grade crossing safety and all affected railroads an opportunity to 
participate in diagnostic team reviews of pedestrian grade crossings.
    (d) Advance warning signs. (1) Each approach to every pedestrian 
grade crossing within a New Quiet Zone shall be equipped with a sign 
that advises the pedestrian that train horns are not sounded at the 
crossing. Such sign shall conform to the standards contained in the 
MUTCD.
    (2) Each approach to every pedestrian grade crossing within a New 
Partial

[[Page 301]]

Quiet Zone shall be equipped with a sign that advises the pedestrian 
that train horns are not sounded at the crossing or that train horns are 
not sounded at the crossing between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., 
whichever is applicable. Such sign shall conform to the standards 
contained in the MUTCD.
    (3) Each approach to every pedestrian grade crossing within a Pre-
Rule Quiet Zone shall be equipped by June 24, 2008 with a sign that 
advises the pedestrian that train horns are not sounded at the crossing. 
Such sign shall conform to the standards contained in the MUTCD.
    (4) Each approach to every pedestrian grade crossing within a Pre-
Rule Partial Quiet Zone shall be equipped by June 24, 2008 with a sign 
that advises the pedestrian that train horns are not sounded at the 
crossing or that train horns are not sounded at the crossing for a 
specified period of time, whichever is applicable. Such sign shall 
conform to the standards contained in the MUTCD.


<R04>
         Subpart C_Exceptions to the Use of the Locomotive Horn


<R05>
Sec. 222.31  [Reserved]

                 Silenced Horns at Individual Crossings


<R05>
Sec. 222.33  Can locomotive horns be silenced at an individual public highway-rail grade crossing which is not within a quiet zone?

    (a) A railroad operating over an individual public highway-rail 
crossing may, at its discretion, cease the sounding of the locomotive 
horn if the locomotive speed is 15 miles per hour or less and train crew 
members, or appropriately equipped flaggers, as defined in 49 CFR 234.5, 
flag the crossing to provide warning of approaching trains to motorists.
    (b) This section does not apply where active grade crossing warning 
devices have malfunctioned and use of the horn is required by 49 CFR 
234.105, 234.106, or 234.107.

           Silenced Horns at Groups of Crossings--Quiet Zones


<R05>
Sec. 222.35  What are the minimum requirements for quiet zones?

    The following requirements apply to quiet zones established in 
conformity with this part.
    (a) Minimum length. (1)(i) Except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of this section, the minimum length of a New Quiet Zone or 
New Partial Quiet Zone established under this part shall be one-half 
mile along the length of railroad right-of-way.
    (ii) The one-half mile minimum length requirement shall be waived 
for any New Quiet Zone or New Partial Quiet Zone that is added onto an 
existing quiet zone, provided there is no public highway-rail grade 
crossing at which locomotive horns are routinely sounded within one-half 
mile of the New Quiet Zone or New Partial Quiet Zone.
    (iii) New Quiet Zones and New Partial Quiet Zones established along 
the same rail line within a single political jurisdiction shall be 
separated by at least one public highway-rail grade crossing, unless a 
New Quiet Zone or New Partial Quiet Zone is being added onto an existing 
quiet zone.
    (2)(i) The length of a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet 
Zone may continue unchanged from that which existed as of October 9, 
1996.
    (ii) With the exception of combining adjacent Pre-Rule Quiet Zones 
or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones, the addition of any public highway-rail 
grade crossing to a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone 
shall end the grandfathered status of that quiet zone and transform it 
into a New Quiet Zone or New Partial Quiet Zone that must comply with 
all requirements applicable to New Quiet Zones and New Partial Quiet 
Zones.
    (iii) The deletion of any public highway-rail grade crossing from a 
Pre-Rule Quiet Zone or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone, with the exception 
of a grade separation or crossing closure, must result in a quiet zone 
of at least one-half mile in length in order to retain Pre-Rule Quiet 
Zone or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone status.

[[Page 302]]

    (3) A quiet zone may include grade crossings on a segment of rail 
line crossing more than one political jurisdiction.
    (b) Active grade crossing warning devices. (1) Each public highway-
rail grade crossing in a New Quiet Zone established under this part must 
be equipped, no later than the quiet zone implementation date, with 
active grade crossing warning devices comprising both flashing lights 
and gates which control traffic over the crossing and that conform to 
the standards contained in the MUTCD. Such warning devices shall be 
equipped with constant warning time devices, if reasonably practical, 
and power-out indicators.
    (2) With the exception of public highway-rail grade crossings that 
will be temporarily closed in accordance with appendix A of this part, 
each public highway-rail grade crossing in a New Partial Quiet Zone 
established under this part must be equipped, no later than the quiet 
zone implementation date, with active grade crossing warning devices 
comprising both flashing lights and gates which control traffic over the 
crossing and that conform to the standards contained in the MUTCD. Such 
warning devices shall be equipped with constant warning time devices, if 
reasonably practical, and power-out indicators.
    (3) Pre-Rule Quiet Zones and Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones must 
retain, and may upgrade, the grade crossing safety warning system which 
existed as of December 18, 2003. Any upgrade involving the installation 
or renewal of an automatic warning device system shall include constant 
warning time devices, where reasonably practical, and power-out 
indicators. In no event may the grade crossing safety warning system, 
which existed as of December 18, 2003, be downgraded. Risk reduction 
resulting from upgrading to flashing lights or gates may be credited in 
calculating the Quiet Zone Risk Index.
    (c) Advance warning signs. (1) Each highway approach to every public 
and private highway-rail grade crossing within a New Quiet Zone shall be 
equipped with an advance warning sign that advises the motorist that 
train horns are not sounded at the crossing. Such sign shall conform to 
the standards contained in the MUTCD.
    (2) Each highway approach to every public and private highway-rail 
grade crossing within a New Partial Quiet Zone shall be equipped with an 
advance warning sign that advises the motorist that train horns are not 
sounded at the crossing or that train horns are not sounded at the 
crossing between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., whichever is 
applicable. Such sign shall conform to the standards contained in the 
MUTCD.
    (3) Each highway approach to every public and private highway-rail 
grade crossing within a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone shall be equipped by June 
24, 2008 with an advance warning sign that advises the motorist that 
train horns are not sounded at the crossing. Such sign shall conform to 
the standards contained in the MUTCD.
    (4) Each highway approach to every public and private highway-rail 
grade crossing within a Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone shall be equipped by 
June 24, 2008 with an advance warning sign that advises the motorist 
that train horns are not sounded at the crossing or that train horns are 
not sounded at the crossing for a specified period of time, whichever is 
applicable. Such sign shall conform to the standards contained in the 
MUTCD.
    (5) This paragraph (c) does not apply to public and private highway-
rail grade crossings equipped with wayside horns that conform to the 
requirements set forth in Sec. 222.59 and Appendix E of this part.
    (d) Bells. (1) Each public highway-rail grade crossing in a New 
Quiet Zone or New Partial Quiet Zone that is subjected to pedestrian 
traffic and equipped with one or more automatic bells shall retain those 
bells in working condition.
    (2) Each public highway-rail grade crossing in a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone 
or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone that is subjected to pedestrian traffic 
and equipped with one or more automatic bells shall retain those bells 
in working condition.
    (e) All private highway-rail grade crossings within the quiet zone 
must be treated in accordance with this section and Sec. 222.25 of this 
part.

[[Page 303]]

    (f) All pedestrian grade crossings within a quiet zone must be 
treated in accordance with Sec. 222.27 of this part.
    (g) All public highway-rail grade crossings within the quiet zone 
must be in compliance with the requirements of the MUTCD.


<R05>
Sec. 222.37  Who may establish a quiet zone?

    (a) A public authority may establish quiet zones that are consistent 
with the provisions of this part. If a proposed quiet zone includes 
public highway-rail grade crossings under the authority and control of 
more than one public authority (such as a county road and a State 
highway crossing the railroad tracks at different crossings), both 
public authorities must agree to establishment of the quiet zone, and 
must jointly, or by delegation provided to one of the authorities, take 
such actions as are required by this part.
    (b) A public authority may establish quiet zones irrespective of 
State laws covering the subject matter of sounding or silencing 
locomotive horns at public highway-rail grade crossings. Nothing in this 
part, however, is meant to affect any other applicable role of State 
agencies or the Federal Highway Administration in decisions regarding 
funding or construction priorities for grade crossing safety projects, 
selection of traffic control devices, or engineering standards for 
roadways or traffic control devices.
    (c) A State agency may provide administrative and technical services 
to public authorities by advising them, acting on their behalf, or 
acting as a central contact point in dealing with FRA; however, any 
public authority eligible to establish a quiet zone under this part may 
do so.


<R05>
Sec. 222.38  Can a quiet zone be created in the Chicago Region?

    Public authorities that are eligible to establish quiet zones under 
this part may create New Quiet Zones or New Partial Quiet Zones in the 
Chicago Region, provided the New Quiet Zone or New Partial Quiet Zone 
does not include any highway-rail grade crossing described in Sec. 
222.3(c) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 222.39  How is a quiet zone established?

    (a) Public authority designation. This paragraph (a) describes how a 
quiet zone may be designated by a public authority without the need for 
formal application to, and approval by, FRA. If a public authority 
complies with either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this 
section, and complies with the information and notification provisions 
of Sec. 222.43 of this part, a public authority may designate a quiet 
zone without the necessity for FRA review and approval.
    (1) A quiet zone may be established by implementing, at every public 
highway-rail grade crossing within the quiet zone, one or more SSMs 
identified in appendix A of this part.
    (2) A quiet zone may be established if the Quiet Zone Risk Index is 
at, or below, the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, as follows:
    (i) If the Quiet Zone Risk Index is already at, or below, the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold without being reduced by 
implementation of SSMs; or
    (ii) If SSMs are implemented which are sufficient to reduce the 
Quiet Zone Risk Index to a level at, or below, the Nationwide 
Significant Risk Threshold.
    (3) A quiet zone may be established if SSMs are implemented which 
are sufficient to reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index to a level at or 
below the Risk Index With Horns.
    (b) Public authority application to FRA. (1) A public authority may 
apply to the Associate Administrator for approval of a quiet zone that 
does not meet the standards for public authority designation under 
paragraph (a) of this section, but in which it is proposed that one or 
more safety measures be implemented. Such proposed quiet zone may 
include only ASMs, or a combination of ASMs and SSMs at various 
crossings within the quiet zone. Note that an engineering improvement 
which does not fully comply with the requirements for an SSM under 
appendix A of this part, is considered to be an ASM. The public 
authority's application must:
    (i) Contain an accurate, complete and current Grade Crossing 
Inventory

[[Page 304]]

Form for each public, private and pedestrian grade crossing within the 
proposed quiet zone;
    (ii) Contain sufficient detail concerning the present safety 
measures at each public, private and pedestrian grade crossing proposed 
to be included in the quiet zone to enable the Associate Administrator 
to evaluate their effectiveness;
    (iii) Contain detailed information about diagnostic team reviews of 
any crossing within the proposed quiet zone, including a membership list 
and a list of recommendations made by the diagnostic team;
    (iv) Contain a statement describing efforts taken by the public 
authority to address comments submitted by each railroad operating the 
public highway-rail grade crossings within the quiet zone, the State 
agency responsible for highway and road safety, and the State agency 
responsible for grade crossing safety in response to the Notice of 
Intent. This statement shall also list any objections to the proposed 
quiet zone that were raised by the railroad(s) and State agencies;
    (v) Contain detailed information as to which safety improvements are 
proposed to be implemented at each public, private, or pedestrian grade 
crossing within the proposed quiet zone;
    (vi) Contain a commitment to implement the proposed safety 
improvements within the proposed quiet zone; and
    (vii) Demonstrate through data and analysis that the proposed 
implementation of these measures will reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index 
to a level at, or below, either the Risk Index With Horns or the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold.
    (2) If the proposed quiet zone contains newly established public or 
private highway-rail grade crossings, the public authority's application 
for approval must also include five-year projected vehicle and rail 
traffic counts for each newly established grade crossing;
    (3) 60-day comment period. (i) The public authority application for 
FRA approval of the proposed quiet zone shall be provided, by certified 
mail, return receipt requested, to: all railroads operating over the 
public highway-rail grade crossings within the quiet zone; the highway

<R05>
Sec. 222.51  Under what conditions will quiet zone status be terminated?

    (a) New Quiet Zones--Annual risk review. (1) FRA will annually 
calculate the Quiet Zone Risk Index for each quiet zone established 
pursuant to Sec. Sec. 222.39(a)(2) and 222.39(b) of this part, and in 
comparison to the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold. FRA will notify 
each public authority of the Quiet Zone Risk Index for the preceding 
calendar year. FRA will not conduct annual risk reviews for quiet zones 
established by having an SSM at every public crossing within the quiet 
zone or for quiet zones established by reducing the Quiet Zone Risk 
Index to the Risk Index With Horns.
    (2) Actions to be taken by public authority to retain quiet zone. If 
the Quiet Zone Risk Index is above the Nationwide Significant Risk 
Threshold, the quiet zone will terminate six months from the date of 
receipt of notification from FRA that the Quiet Zone Risk Index exceeds 
the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, unless the public authority 
takes the following actions:
    (i) Within six months after the date of receipt of notification from 
FRA that the Quiet Zone Risk Index exceeds the Nationwide Significant 
Risk Threshold, provide to the Associate Administrator a written 
commitment to lower the potential risk to the traveling public at the 
crossings within the quiet zone to a level at, or below, the Nationwide 
Significant Risk Threshold or the Risk Index With Horns. Included in the 
commitment statement shall be a discussion of the specific steps to be 
taken by the public authority to increase safety at the crossings within 
the quiet zone; and

[[Page 311]]

    (ii) Within three years after the date of receipt of notification 
from FRA that the Quiet Zone Risk Index exceeds the Nationwide 
Significant Risk Threshold, complete implementation of SSMs or ASMs 
sufficient to reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index to a level at, or below, 
the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, or the Risk Index With Horns, 
and receive approval from the Associate Administrator, under the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 222.39(b) of this part, for continuation 
of the quiet zone. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index is reduced to the Risk 
Index With Horns, the quiet zone will be considered to have been 
established pursuant to Sec. 222.39(a)(3) of this part and subsequent 
annual risk reviews will not be conducted for that quiet zone.
    (iii) Failure to comply with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section 
shall result in the termination of the quiet zone six months after the 
date of receipt of notification from FRA that the Quiet Zone Risk Index 
exceeds the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold. Failure to comply 
with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall result in the 
termination of the quiet zone three years after the date of receipt of 
notification from FRA that the Quiet Zone Risk Index exceeds the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold.
    (b) Pre-Rule Quiet Zones--Annual risk review. (1) FRA will annually 
calculate the Quiet Zone Risk Index for each Pre-Rule Quiet Zone and 
Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone that qualified for automatic approval 
pursuant to Sec. Sec. 222.41(a)(1)(ii), 222.41(a)(1)(iii), 
222.41(b)(1)(ii), and 222.41(b)(1)(iii) of this part. FRA will notify 
each public authority of the Quiet Zone Risk Index for the preceding 
calendar year. FRA will also notify each public authority if a relevant 
collision occurred at a grade crossing within the quiet zone during the 
preceding calendar year.
    (2) Pre-Rule Quiet Zones and Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones authorized 
under Sec. Sec. 222.41(a)(1)(ii) and 222.41(b)(1)(ii). (i) If a Pre-
Rule Quiet Zone or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone originally qualified for 
automatic approval because the Quiet Zone Risk Index was at, or below, 
the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, the quiet zone may continue 
unchanged if the Quiet Zone Risk Index as last calculated by the FRA 
remains at, or below, the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold.
    (ii) If the Quiet Zone Risk Index as last calculated by FRA is above 
the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, but is lower than twice the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold and no relevant collisions have 
occurred at crossings within the quiet zone within the five years 
preceding the annual risk review, then the quiet zone may continue as 
though it originally received automatic approval pursuant to Sec. 
222.41(a)(1)(iii) or 222.41(b)(1)(iii) of this part.
    (iii) If the Quiet Zone Risk Index as last calculated by FRA is at, 
or above, twice the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, or if the 
Quiet Zone Risk Index is above the Nationwide Significant Risk 
Threshold, but is lower than twice the Nationwide Significant Risk 
Threshold and a relevant collision occurred at a crossing within the 
quiet zone within the preceding five calendar years, the quiet zone will 
terminate six months after the date of receipt of notification from FRA 
of the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold level, unless the public 
authority takes the actions specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section.
    (3) Pre-Rule Quiet Zones and Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones authorized 
under Sec. Sec. 222.41(a)(1)(iii) and 222.41(b)(1)(iii). (i) If a Pre-
Rule Quiet Zone or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone originally qualified for 
automatic approval because the Quiet Zone Risk Index was above the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, but below twice the Nationwide 
Significant Risk Threshold, and no relevant collisions had occurred 
within the five-year qualifying period, the quiet zone may continue 
unchanged if the Quiet Zone Risk Index as last calculated by FRA remains 
below twice the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold and no relevant 
collisions occurred at a public grade crossing within the quiet zone 
during the preceding calendar year.
    (ii) If the Quiet Zone Risk Index as last calculated by FRA is at, 
or above, twice the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, or if a 
relevant collision occurred at a public grade crossing within the quiet 
zone during the preceding

[[Page 312]]

calendar year, the quiet zone will terminate six months after the date 
of receipt of notification from FRA that the Quiet Zone Risk Index is 
at, or exceeds twice the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or that a 
relevant collision occurred at a crossing within the quiet zone, unless 
the public authority takes the actions specified in paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section.
    (4) Actions to be taken by the public authority to retain a quiet 
zone.
    (i) Within six months after the date of FRA notification, the public 
authority shall provide to the Associate Administrator a written 
commitment to lower the potential risk to the traveling public at the 
crossings within the quiet zone by reducing the Quiet Zone Risk Index to 
a level at, or below, the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or the 
Risk Index With Horns. Included in the commitment statement shall be a 
discussion of the specific steps to be taken by the public authority to 
increase safety at the public crossings within the quiet zone; and
    (ii) Within three years of the date of FRA notification, the public 
authority shall complete implementation of SSMs or ASMs sufficient to 
reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index to a level at, or below, the Nationwide 
Significant Risk Threshold, or the Risk Index With Horns, and receive 
approval from the Associate Administrator, under the procedures set 
forth in Sec. 222.39(b) of this part, for continuation of the quiet 
zone. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index is reduced to a level that fully 
compensates for the absence of the train horn, the quiet zone will be 
considered to have been established pursuant to Sec. 222.39(a)(3) of 
this part and subsequent annual risk reviews will not be conducted for 
that quiet zone.
    (iii) Failure to comply with paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section 
shall result in the termination of the quiet zone six months after the 
date of receipt of notification from FRA. Failure to comply with 
paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section shall result in the termination of 
the quiet zone three years after the date of receipt of notification 
from FRA.
    (c) Review at FRA's initiative. (1) The Associate Administrator may, 
at any time, review the status of any quiet zone.
    (2) If the Associate Administrator makes any of the following 
preliminary determinations, the Associate Administrator will provide 
written notice to the public authority, all railroads operating over 
public highway-rail grade crossings within the quiet zone, the highway 
or traffic control authority or law enforcement authority having control 
over vehicular traffic at the crossings within the quiet zone, the 
landowner having control over any private crossings within the quiet 
zone, the State agency responsible for grade crossing safety, and the 
State agency responsible for highway and road safety and will publish a 
notice of the determination in the Federal Register:
    (i) Safety systems and measures implemented within the quiet zone do 
not fully compensate for the absence of the locomotive horn due to a 
substantial increase in risk;
    (ii) Documentation relied upon to establish the quiet zone contains 
substantial errors that may have an adverse impact on public safety; or
    (iii) Significant risk with respect to loss of life or serious 
personal injury exists within the quiet zone.
    (3) After providing an opportunity for comment, the Associate 
Administrator may require that additional safety measures be taken or 
that the quiet zone be terminated. The Associate Administrator will 
provide a copy of his/her decision to the public authority and all 
parties listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The public authority 
may appeal the Associate Administrator's decision in accordance with 
Sec. 222.57(c) of this part. Nothing in this section is intended to 
limit the Administrator's emergency authority under 49 U.S.C. 20104 and 
49 CFR part 211.
    (d) Termination by the public authority. (1) Any public authority 
that participated in the establishment of a quiet zone under the 
provisions of this part may, at any time, withdraw its quiet zone 
status.
    (2) A public authority may withdraw its quiet zone status by 
providing written notice of termination, by certified mail, return 
receipt requested, to all railroads operating the public highway-rail 
grade crossings within the quiet

[[Page 313]]

zone, the highway or traffic control authority or law enforcement 
authority having control over vehicular traffic at the crossings within 
the quiet zone, the landowner having control over any private crossings 
within the quiet zone, the State agency responsible for grade crossing 
safety, the State agency responsible for highway and road safety, and 
the Associate Administrator.
    (3)(i) If the quiet zone that is being withdrawn was part of a 
multi-jurisdictional quiet zone, the remaining quiet zones may remain in 
effect, provided the public authorities responsible for the remaining 
quiet zones provide statements to the Associate Administrator certifying 
that the Quiet Zone Risk Index for each remaining quiet zone is at, or 
below, the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or the Risk Index With 
Horns. These statements shall be provided, no later than six months 
after the date on which the notice of quiet zone termination was mailed, 
to all parties listed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (ii) If any remaining quiet zone has a Quiet Zone Risk Index in 
excess of the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold and the Risk Index 
With Horns, the public authority responsible for the quiet zone shall 
submit a written commitment, to all parties listed in paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section, to reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index to a level at or 
below the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or the Risk Index With 
Horns within three years. Included in the commitment statement shall be 
a discussion of the specific steps to be taken by the public authority 
to reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index. This commitment statement shall be 
provided to all parties listed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section no 
later than six months after the date on which the notice of quiet zone 
termination was mailed.
    (iii) Failure to comply with paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (d)(3)(ii) of 
this section shall result in the termination of the remaining quiet 
zone(s) six months after the date on which the notice of quiet zone 
termination was mailed by the withdrawing public authority in accordance 
with paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (iv) Failure to complete implementation of SSMs and/or ASMs to 
reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index to a level at, or below, the Nationwide 
Significant Risk Index or the Risk Index With Horns, in accordance with 
the written commitment provided under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this 
section, shall result in the termination of quiet zone status three 
years after the date on which the written commitment was received by 
FRA.
    (e) Notification of termination. (1) In the event that a quiet zone 
is terminated under the provisions of this section, it shall be the 
responsibility of the public authority to immediately provide written 
notification of the termination by certified mail, return receipt 
requested, to all railroads operating over public highway-rail grade 
crossings within the quiet zone, the highway or traffic control 
authority or law enforcement authority having control over vehicular 
traffic at the crossings within the quiet zone, the landowner having 
control over any private crossings within the quiet zone, the State 
agency responsible for grade crossing safety, the State agency 
responsible for highway and road safety, and the Associate 
Administrator.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if a quiet 
zone is terminated under the provisions of this section, FRA shall also 
provide written notification to all parties listed in paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section.
    (f) Requirement to sound the locomotive horn. Upon receipt of 
notification of quiet zone termination pursuant to paragraph (e) of this 
section, railroads shall, within seven days, and in accordance with the 
provisions of this part, sound the locomotive horn when approaching and 
passing through every public highway-rail grade crossing within the 
former quiet zone.


<R05>
Sec. 222.53  What are the requirements for supplementary and alternative 

safety measures?

    (a) Approved SSMs are listed in appendix A of this part. Approved 
SSMs can qualify for quiet zone risk reduction credit in the manner 
specified in appendix A of this part.
    (b) Additional ASMs that may be included in a request for FRA 
approval of

[[Page 314]]

a quiet zone under Sec. 222.39(b) of this part are listed in appendix B 
of this part. Modified SSMs can qualify for quiet zone risk reduction 
credit in the manner specified in appendix B of this part.
    (c) The following do not, individually or in combination, constitute 
SSMs or ASMs: Standard traffic control device arrangements such as 
reflectorized crossbucks, STOP signs, flashing lights, or flashing 
lights with gates that do not completely block travel over the line of 
railroad, or traffic signals.


<R05>
Sec. 222.55  How are new supplementary or alternative safety measures 

approved?

    (a) The Associate Administrator may add new SSMs and standards to 
appendix A of this part and new ASMs and standards to appendix B of this 
part when the Associate Administrator determines that such measures or 
standards are an effective substitute for the locomotive horn in the 
prevention of collisions and casualties at public highway-rail grade 
crossings.
    (b) Interested parties may apply for approval from the Associate 
Administrator to demonstrate proposed new SSMs or ASMs to determine 
whether they are effective substitutes for the locomotive horn in the 
prevention of collisions and casualties at public highway-rail grade 
crossings.
    (c) The Associate Administrator may, after notice and opportunity 
for comment, order railroad carriers operating over a public highway-
rail grade crossing or crossings to temporarily cease the sounding of 
locomotive horns at such crossings to demonstrate proposed new SSMs or 
ASMs, provided that such proposed new SSMs or ASMs have been subject to 
prior testing and evaluation. In issuing such order, the Associate 
Administrator may impose any conditions or limitations on such use of 
the proposed new SSMs or ASMs which the Associate Administrator deems 
necessary in order to provide the level of safety at least equivalent to 
that provided by the locomotive horn.
    (d) Upon completion of a demonstration of proposed new SSMs or ASMs, 
interested parties may apply to the Associate Administrator for their 
approval. Applications for approval shall be in writing and shall 
include the following:
    (1) The name and address of the applicant;
    (2) A description and design of the proposed new SSM or ASM;
    (3) A description and results of the demonstration project in which 
the proposed SSMs or ASMs were tested;
    (4) Estimated costs of the proposed new SSM or ASM; and
    (5) Any other information deemed necessary.
    (e) If the Associate Administrator is satisfied that the proposed 
safety measure fully compensates for the absence of the warning provided 
by the locomotive horn, the Associate Administrator will approve its use 
as an SSM to be used in the same manner as the measures listed in 
appendix A of this part, or the Associate Administrator may approve its 
use as an ASM to be used in the same manner as the measures listed in 
appendix B of this part. The Associate Administrator may impose any 
conditions or limitations on use of the SSMs or ASMs which the Associate 
Administrator deems necessary in order to provide the level of safety at 
least equivalent to that provided by the locomotive horn.
    (f) If the Associate Administrator approves a new SSM or ASM, the 
Associate Administrator will: Notify the applicant, if any; publish 
notice of such action in the Federal Register; and add the measure to 
the list of approved SSMs or ASMs.
    (g) A public authority or other interested party may appeal to the 
Administrator from a decision by the Associate Administrator granting or 
denying an application for approval of a proposed SSM or ASM, or the 
conditions or limitations imposed on its use, in accordance with Sec. 
222.57 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 222.57  Can parties seek review of the Associate Administrator's actions?

    (a) A public authority or other interested party may petition the 
Administrator for review of any decision by the Associate Administrator 
granting or denying an application for approval of a new SSM or ASM 
under Sec. 222.55 of this part. The petition must be filed within 60 
days of the decision to be reviewed,

[[Page 315]]

specify the grounds for the requested relief, and be served upon the 
following parties: All railroads ordered to temporarily cease sounding 
of the locomotive horn over public highway-rail grade crossings for the 
demonstration of the proposed new SSM or ASM , the highway or traffic 
control authority or law enforcement authority having control over 
vehicular traffic at the crossings affected by the new SSM/ASM 
demonstration, the State agency responsible for grade crossing safety, 
the State agency responsible for highway and road safety, and the 
Associate Administrator. Unless the Administrator specifically provides 
otherwise, and gives notice to the petitioner or publishes a notice in 
the Federal Register, the filing of a petition under this paragraph does 
not stay the effectiveness of the action sought to be reviewed. The 
Administrator may reaffirm, modify, or revoke the decision of the 
Associate Administrator without further proceedings and shall notify the 
petitioner and other interested parties in writing or by publishing a 
notice in the Federal Register.
    (b) A public authority may request reconsideration of a decision by 
the Associate Administrator to deny an application by that authority for 
approval of a quiet zone, or to require additional safety measures, by 
filing a petition for reconsideration with the Associate Administrator. 
The petition must specify the grounds for asserting that the Associate 
Administrator improperly exercised his/her judgment in finding that the 
proposed SSMs and ASMs would not result in a Quiet Zone Risk Index that 
would be at or below the Risk Index With Horns or the Nationwide 
Significant Risk Threshold. The petition shall be filed within 60 days 
of the date of the decision to be reconsidered and be served upon all 
parties listed in Sec. 222.39(b)(3) of this part. Upon receipt of a 
timely and proper petition, the Associate Administrator will provide the 
petitioner an opportunity to submit additional materials and to request 
an informal hearing. Upon review of the additional materials and 
completion of any hearing requested, the Associate Administrator shall 
issue a decision on the petition that will be administratively final.
    (c) A public authority may request reconsideration of a decision by 
the Associate Administrator to terminate quiet zone status by filing a 
petition for reconsideration with the Associate Administrator. The 
petition must be filed within 60 days of the date of the decision, 
specify the grounds for the requested relief, and be served upon all 
parties listed in Sec. 222.51(c)(2) of this part. Unless the Associate 
Administrator publishes a notice in the Federal Register that 
specifically stays the effectiveness of his/her decision, the filing of 
a petition under this paragraph will not stay the termination of quiet 
zone status. Upon receipt of a timely and proper petition, the Associate 
Administrator will provide the petitioner an opportunity to submit 
additional materials and to request an informal hearing. Upon review of 
the additional materials and completion of any hearing requested, the 
Associate Administrator shall issue a decision on the petition that will 
be administratively final. A copy of this decision shall be served upon 
all parties listed in Sec. 222.51(c)(2) of this part.
    (d) A railroad may request reconsideration of a decision by the 
Associate Administrator to approve an application for approval of a 
proposed quiet zone under Sec. 222.39(b) of this part by filing a 
petition for reconsideration with the Associate Administrator. The 
petition must specify the grounds for asserting that the Associate 
Administrator improperly exercised his/her judgment in finding that the 
proposed SSMs and ASMs would result in a Quiet Zone Risk Index that 
would be at or below the Risk Index With Horns or the Nationwide 
Significant Risk Threshold. The petition shall be filed within 60 days 
of the date of the decision to be reconsidered, and be served upon all 
parties listed in Sec. 222.39(b)(3) of this part. Upon receipt of a 
timely and proper petition, the Associate Administrator will provide the 
petitioner an opportunity to submit additional materials and to request 
an informal hearing. Upon review of the additional materials and 
completion of any hearing requested, the Associate Administrator shall 
issue a decision that will be administratively final.

Sec. 222.59  When may a wayside horn be used?

    (a)(1) A wayside horn conforming to the requirements of appendix E 
of this part may be used in lieu of a locomotive horn at any highway-
rail grade crossing equipped with an active warning system consisting 
of, at a minimum, flashing lights and gates.
    (2) A wayside horn conforming to the requirements of appendix E of 
this part may be installed within a quiet zone. For purposes of 
calculating the length of a quiet zone, the presence of a wayside horn 
at a highway-grade crossing within a quiet zone shall be considered in 
the same manner as a grade crossing treated with an SSM. A grade 
crossing equipped with a wayside horn shall not be considered in 
calculating the Quiet Zone Risk Index or Crossing Corridor Risk Index.
    (b) A public authority installing a wayside horn at a grade crossing 
within a quiet zone shall provide written notice that a wayside horn is 
being installed to all railroads operating over the public highway-rail 
grade crossings within the quiet zone, the highway or traffic control 
authority or law enforcement authority having control over vehicular 
traffic at the crossings within the quiet zone, the landowner having 
control over any private crossings within the quiet zone, the State 
agency responsible for grade crossing safety, the State agency 
responsible for highway and road safety, and the Associate 
Administrator. This notice shall provide the date on which the wayside 
horn will be operational and identify the grade crossing at which the 
wayside horn shall be installed by both the U.S. DOT National Highway-
Rail Grade Crossing Inventory Number and street or highway name. The 
railroad or public authority shall provide notification of the 
operational date at least 21 days in advance.
    (c) A railroad or public authority installing a wayside horn at a 
grade crossing located outside a quiet zone shall provide written notice 
that a wayside horn is being installed to all railroads operating over 
the public highway-rail grade crossing, the highway or traffic control 
authority or law enforcement authority having control over vehicular 
traffic at the crossing, the State agency responsible for grade crossing 
safety, the State agency responsible for highway and road safety, and 
the Associate Administrator. This notice shall provide the date on which 
the wayside horn will be operational and identify the grade crossing at 
which the wayside horn shall be installed by both the U.S. DOT National 
Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Inventory Number and street or highway name. 
The railroad or public authority shall provide notification of the 
operational date at least 21 days in advance.
    (d) A railroad operating over a grade crossing equipped with an 
operational wayside horn installed within a quiet zone pursuant to this 
section shall cease routine locomotive horn use at the grade crossing. A 
railroad operating over a grade crossing that is equipped with a wayside 
horn and located outside of a quiet zone shall cease routine locomotive 
horn use at the grade crossing on the operational date specified in the 
notice required by paragraph (c) of this section.

   Sec. Appendix A to Part 222--Approved Supplementary Safety Measures

    A. Requirements and Effectiveness Rates for Supplementary Safety 
                                Measures

    This section provides a list of approved supplementary safety 
measures (SSMs) that may be installed at highway-rail grade crossings 
within quiet zones for risk reduction credit. Each SSM has been assigned 
an effectiveness rate, which may be subject to adjustment as research 
and demonstration projects are completed and data is gathered and 
refined. Sections B and C govern the process through which risk 
reduction credit for pre-existing SSMs can be determined.
    1. Temporary Closure of a Public Highway-Rail Grade Crossing: Close 
the crossing to highway traffic during designated quiet periods. (This 
SSM can only be implemented within Partial Quiet Zones.)
    Effectiveness: 1.0.
    Because an effective closure system prevents vehicle entrance onto 
the crossing, the probability of a collision with a train at the 
crossing is zero during the period the crossing is closed. Effectiveness 
would therefore equal 1. However, analysis should take into 
consideration that traffic would need to be redistributed among adjacent 
crossings or grade separations for the purpose of estimating risk 
following the silencing of train horns, unless the particular 
``closure'' was accomplished by a grade separation.

[[Page 317]]

    Required:
    a. The closure system must completely block highway traffic on all 
approach lanes to the crossing.
    b. The closure system must completely block adjacent pedestrian 
crossings.
    c. Public highway-rail grade crossings located within New Partial 
Quiet Zones shall be closed from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m. every day. Public 
highway-rail grade crossings located within Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones 
may only be closed during one period each 24 hours.
    d. Barricdes and signs used for closure of the roadway shall conform 
to the standards contained in the MUTCD.
    e. Daily activation and deactivation of the system is the 
responsibility of the public authority responsible for maintenance of 
the street or highway crossing the railroad tracks. The public authority 
may provide for third party activation and deactivation; however, the 
public authority shall remain fully responsible for compliance with the 
requirements of this part.
    f. The system must be tamper and vandal resistant to the same extent 
as other traffic control devices.
    g. The closure system shall be equipped with a monitoring device 
that contains an indicator which is visible to the train crew prior to 
entering the crossing. The indicator shall illuminate whenever the 
closure device is deployed.
    Recommended:
    Signs for alternate highway traffic routes should be erected in 
accordance with MUTCD and State and local standards and should inform 
pedestrians and motorists that the streets are closed, the period for 
which they are closed, and that alternate routes must be used.
    2. Four-Quadrant Gate System: Install gates at a crossing sufficient 
to fully block highway traffic from entering the crossing when the gates 
are lowered, including at least one gate for each direction of traffic 
on each approach.
    Effectiveness:
    Four-quadrant gates only, no presence detection: .82.
    Four-quadrant gates only, with presence detection: .77.
    Four-quadrant gates with traffic of at least 60 feet (with or 
without presence detection): .92.
    Note: The higher effectiveness rate for four-quadrant gates without 
presence detection does not mean that they are inherently safer than 
four-quadrant gates with presence detection. Four-quadrant gates with 
presence detection have been assigned a lower effectiveness rate because 
motorists may learn to delay the lowering of the exit gates by driving 
onto the opposing lane of traffic immediately after an opposing car has 
driven over the grade crossing. Since the presence detection will keep 
the exit gate raised, other motorists at the crossing who observe this 
scenario may also be tempted to take advantage of the raised exit gate 
by driving around the lowered entrance gates, thus increasing the 
potential for a crossing collision.
    It should, however, be noted that there are site-specific 
circumstances (such as nearby highway intersections that could cause 
traffic to back up and stop on the grade crossing), under which the use 
of presence detection would be advisable. For this reason, the various 
effectiveness rates assigned to four-quadrant gate systems should not be 
the sole determining factor as to whether presence detection would be 
advisable. A site-specific study should be performed to determine the 
best application for each proposed installation. Please refer to 
paragraphs (f) and (g) for more information.
    Required:
    Four-quadrant gate systems shall conform to the standards for four-
quadrant gates contained in the MUTCD and shall, in addition, comply 
with the following:
    a. When a train is approaching, all highway approach and exit lanes 
on both sides of the highway-rail crossing must be spanned by gates, 
thus denying to the highway user the option of circumventing the 
conventional approach lane gates by switching into the opposing 
(oncoming) traffic lane in order to enter the crossing and cross the 
tracks.
    b. Crossing warning systems must be activated by use of constant 
warning time devices unless existing conditions at the crossing would 
prevent the proper operation of the constant warning time devices.
    c. Crossing warning systems must be equipped with power-out 
indicators.
    Note: Requirements b and c apply only to New Quiet Zones or New 
Partial Quiet Zones. Constant warning time devices and power-out 
indicators are not required to be added to existing warning systems in 
Pre-Rule Quiet Zones and Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones. However, if 
existing automatic warning device systems in Pre-Rule Quiet Zones and 
Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones are renewed, or new automatic warning 
device systems are installed, power-out indicators and constant warning 
time devices are required, unless existing conditions at the crossing 
would prevent the proper operation of the constant warning devices.
    d. The gap between the ends of the entrance and exit gates (on the 
same side of the railroad tracks) when both are in the fully lowered, or 
down, position must be less than two feet if no median is present. If 
the highway approach is equipped with a median or a channelization 
device between the approach and exit lanes, the lowered gates must reach 
to within one foot of the median or channelization device, measured 
horizontally across the road from the end of the

[[Page 318]]

lowered gate to the median or channelization device or to a point over 
the edge of the median or channelization device. The gate and the median 
top or channelization device do not have to be at the same elevation.
    e. ``Break-away'' channelization devices must be frequently 
monitored to replace broken elements.
    Recommendations for new installations only:
    f. Gate timing should be established by a qualified traffic engineer 
based on site specific determinations. Such determination should 
consider the need for and timing of a delay in the descent of the exit 
gates (following descent of the conventional entrance gates). Factors to 
be considered may include available storage space between the gates that 
is outside the fouling limits of the track(s) and the possibility that 
traffic flows may be interrupted as a result of nearby intersections.
    g. A determination should be made as to whether it is necessary to 
provide vehicle presence detectors (VPDs) to open or keep open the exit 
gates until all vehicles are clear of the crossing. VPD should be 
installed on one or both sides of the crossing and/or in the surface 
between the rails closest to the field. Among the factors that should be 
considered are the presence of intersecting roadways near the crossing, 
the priority that the traffic crossing the railroad is given at such 
intersections, the types of traffic control devices at those 
intersections, and the presence and timing of traffic signal preemption.
    h. Highway approaches on one or both sides of the highway-rail 
crossing may be provided with medians or channelization devices between 
the opposing lanes. Medians should be defined by a non-traversable curb 
or traversable curb, or by reflectorized channelization devices, or by 
both.
    i. Remote monitoring (in addition to power-out indicators, which are 
required) of the status of these crossing systems is preferable. This is 
especially important in those areas in which qualified railroad signal 
department personnel are not readily available.
    3. Gates With Medians or Channelization Devices: Install medians or 
channelization devices on both highway approaches to a public highway-
rail grade crossing denying to the highway user the option of 
circumventing the approach lane gates by switching into the opposing 
(oncoming) traffic lane and driving around the lowered gates to cross 
the tracks.
    Effectiveness:
    Channelization devices--.75.
    Non-traversable curbs with or without channelization devices-- .80.
    Required:
    a. Opposing traffic lanes on both highway approaches to the crossing 
must be separated by either: (1) medians bounded by non-traversable 
curbs or (2) channelization devices.
    b. Medians or channelization devices must extend at least 100 feet 
from the gate arm, or if there is an intersection within 100 feet of the 
gate, the median or channelization device must extend at least 60 feet 
from the gate arm.
    c. Intersections of two or more streets, or a street and an alley, 
that are within 60 feet of the gate arm must be closed or relocated. 
Driveways for private, residential properties (up to four units) within 
60 feet of the gate arm are not considered to be intersections under 
this part and need not be closed. However, consideration should be given 
to taking steps to ensure that motorists exiting the driveways are not 
able to move against the flow of traffic to circumvent the purpose of 
the median and drive around lowered gates. This may be accomplished by 
the posting of ``no left turn'' signs or other means of notification. 
For the purpose of this part, driveways accessing commercial properties 
are considered to be intersections and are not allowed. It should be 
noted that if a public authority can not comply with the 60 feet or 100 
feet requirement, it may apply to FRA for a quiet zone under Sec. 
222.39(b), ``Public authority application to FRA.'' Such arrangement may 
qualify for a risk reduction credit in calculation of the Quiet Zone 
Risk Index. Similarly, if a public authority finds that it is feasible 
to only provide channelization on one approach to the crossing, it may 
also apply to FRA for approval under Sec. 222.39(b). Such an 
arrangement may also qualify for a risk reduction credit in calculation 
of the Quiet Zone Risk Index.
    d. Crossing warning systems must be activated by use of constant 
warning time devices unless existing conditions at the crossing would 
prevent the proper operation of the constant warning time devices.
    e. Crossing warning systems must be equipped with power-out 
indicators. Note: Requirements d and e apply only to New Quiet Zones and 
New Partial Quiet Zones. Constant warning time devices and power-out 
indicators are not required to be added to existing warning systems in 
Pre-Rule Quiet Zones or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones. However, if 
existing automatic warning device systems in Pre-Rule Quiet Zones and 
Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones are renewed, or new automatic warning 
device systems are installed, power-out indicators and constant warning 
time devices are required, unless existing conditions at the crossing 
would prevent the proper operation of the constant warning devices.
    f. The gap between the lowered gate and the curb or channelization 
device must be one foot or less, measured horizontally across the road 
from the end of the lowered gate to the curb or channelization device or

[[Page 319]]

to a point over the curb edge or channelization device. The gate and the 
curb top or channelization device do not have to be at the same 
elevation.
    g. ``Break-away'' channelization devices must be frequently 
monitored to replace broken elements.
    4. One Way Street with Gate(s): Gate(s) must be installed such that 
all approaching highway lanes to the public highway-rail grade crossing 
are completely blocked.
    Effectiveness: .82.
    Required:
    a. Gate arms on the approach side of the crossing should extend 
across the road to within one foot of the far edge of the pavement. If a 
gate is used on each side of the road, the gap between the ends of the 
gates when both are in the lowered, or down, position must be no more 
than two feet.
    b. If only one gate is used, the edge of the road opposite the gate 
mechanism must be configured with a non-traversable curb extending at 
least 100 feet.
    c. Crossing warning systems must be activated by use of constant 
warning time devices unless existing conditions at the crossing would 
prevent the proper operation of the constant warning time devices.
    d. Crossing warning systems must be equipped with power-out 
indicators.
    Note: Requirements c and d apply only to New Quiet Zones and New 
Partial Quiet Zones. Constant warning time devices and power-out 
indicators are not required to be added to existing warning systems in 
Pre-Rule Quiet Zones or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones. If automatic 
warning systems are, however, installed or renewed in a Pre-Rule Quiet 
or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone, power-out indicators and constant 
warning time devices shall be installed, unless existing conditions at 
the crossing would prevent the proper operation of the constant warning 
time devices.
    5. Permanent Closure of a Public Highway-Rail Grade Crossing: 
Permanently close the crossing to highway traffic.
    Effectiveness: 1.0.
    Required:
    a. The closure system must completely block highway traffic from 
entering the grade crossing.
    b. Barricades and signs used for closure of the roadway shall 
conform to the standards contained in the MUTCD.
    c. The closure system must be tamper and vandal resistant to the 
same extent as other traffic control devices.
    d. Since traffic will be redistributed among adjacent crossings, the 
traffic counts for adjacent crossings shall be increased to reflect the 
diversion of traffic from the closed crossing.

B. Credit for Pre-Existing SSMs in New Quiet Zones and New Partial Quiet 
                                  Zones

    A community that has implemented a pre-existing SSM at a public 
grade crossing can receive risk reduction credit by inflating the Risk 
Index With Horns as follows:
    1. Calculate the current risk index for the grade crossing that is 
equipped with a qualifying, pre-existing SSM. (See appendix D. FRA's 
web-based Quiet Zone Calculator may be used to complete this 
calculation.)
    2. Adjust the risk index by accounting for the increased risk that 
was avoided by implementing the pre-existing SSM at the public grade 
crossing. This adjustment can be made by dividing the risk index by one 
minus the SSM effectiveness rate. (For example, the risk index for a 
crossing equipped with pre-existing channelization devices would be 
divided by .25.)
    3. Add the current risk indices for the other public grade crossings 
located within the proposed quiet zone and divide by the number of 
crossings. The resulting risk index will be the new Risk Index With 
Horns for the proposed quiet zone.

  C. Credit for Pre-Existing SSMs in Pre-Rule Quiet Zones and Pre-Rule 
                           Partial Quiet Zones

    A community that has implemented a pre-existing SSM at a public 
grade crossing can receive risk reduction credit by inflating the Risk 
Index With Horns as follows:
    1. Calculate the current risk index for the grade crossing that is 
equipped with a qualifying, pre-existing SSM. (See appendix D. FRA's 
web-based Quiet Zone Calculator may be used to complete this 
calculation.)
    2. Reduce the current risk index for the grade crossing to reflect 
the risk reduction that would have been achieved if the locomotive horn 
was routinely sounded at the crossing. The following list sets forth the 
estimated risk reduction for certain types of crossings:
    a. Risk indices for passive crossings shall be reduced by 43%;
    b. Risk indices for grade crossings equipped with automatic flashing 
lights shall be reduced by 27%; and
    c. Risk indices for gated crossings shall be reduced by 40%.
    3. Adjust the risk index by accounting for the increased risk that 
was avoided by implementing the pre-existing SSM at the public grade 
crossing. This adjustment can be made by dividing the risk index by one 
minus the SSM effectiveness rate. (For example, the risk index for a 
crossing equipped with pre-existing channelization devices would be 
divided by .25.)
    4. Adjust the risk indices for the other crossings that are included 
in the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone by reducing 
the current risk index to reflect the risk reduction that would have 
been

[[Page 320]]

achieved if the locomotive horn was routinely sounded at each crossing. 
Please refer to step two for the list of approved risk reduction 
percentages by crossing type.
    5. Add the new risk indices for each crossing located within the 
proposed quiet zone and divide by the number of crossings. The resulting 
risk index will be the new Risk Index With Horns for the quiet zone.

        Sec. Appendix B to Part 222--Alternative Safety Measures

                              Introduction

    A public authority seeking approval of a quiet zone under public 
authority application to FRA (Sec. 222.39(b)) may include ASMs listed 
in this appendix in its proposal. This appendix addresses three types of 
ASMs: Modified SSMs, Non-Engineering ASMs, and Engineering ASMs. 
Modified SSMs are SSMs that do not fully comply with the provisions 
listed in appendix A. As provided in section I.B. of this appendix, 
public authorities can obtain risk reduction credit for pre-existing 
modified SSMs under the final rule. Non-engineering ASMs consist of 
programmed enforcement, public education and awareness, and photo 
enforcement programs that may be used to reduce risk within a quiet 
zone. Engineering ASMs consist of engineering improvements that address 
underlying geometric conditions, including sight distance, that are the 
source of increased risk at crossings.

                            I. Modified SSMs

        A. Requirements and Effectiveness Rates for Modified SSMs

    1. If there are unique circumstances pertaining to a specific 
crossing or number of crossings which prevent SSMs from being fully 
compliant with all of the SSM requirements listed in appendix A, those 
SSM requirements may be adjusted or revised. In that case, the SSM, as 
modified by the public authority, will be treated as an ASM under this 
appendix B, and not as a SSM under appendix A. After reviewing the 
estimated safety effect of the modified SSM and the proposed quiet zone, 
FRA will approve the proposed quiet zone if FRA finds that the Quiet 
Zone Risk Index will be reduced to a level at or below either the Risk 
Index With Horns or the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold.
    2. The public authority must provide estimates of effectiveness. 
These estimates may be based upon adjustments from the effectiveness 
levels provided in appendix A or from actual field data derived from the 
crossing sites. The specific crossing and applied mitigation measure 
will be assessed to determine the effectiveness of the modified SSM. FRA 
will continue to develop and make available effectiveness estimates and 
data from experience under the final rule.
    3. If one or more of the requirements associated with an SSM as 
listed in appendix A is revised or deleted, data or analysis supporting 
the revision or deletion must be provided to FRA for review. The 
following engineering types of ASMs may be included in a proposal for 
approval by FRA for creation of a quiet zone: (1) Temporary Closure of a 
Public Highway-Rail Grade Crossing, (2) Four-Quadrant Gate System, (3) 
Gates With Medians or Channelization Devices, and (4) One-Way Street 
With Gate(s).

  B. Credit for Pre-Existing Modified SSMs in New Quiet Zones and New 
                           Partial Quiet Zones

    A community that has implemented a pre-existing modified SSM at a 
public grade crossing can receive risk reduction credit by inflating the 
Risk Index With Horns as follows:
    1. Calculate the current risk index for the grade crossing that is 
equipped with a pre-existing modified SSM. (See appendix D. FRA's web-
based Quiet Zone Calculator may be used to complete this calculation.)
    2. Obtain FRA approval of the estimated effectiveness rate for the 
pre-existing modified SSM. Estimated effectiveness rates may be based 
upon adjustments from the SSM effectiveness rates provided in appendix A 
or actual field data derived from crossing sites.
    3. Adjust the risk index by accounting for the increased risk that 
was avoided by implementing the pre-existing modified SSM at the public 
grade crossing. This adjustment can be made by dividing the risk index 
by one minus the FRA-approved modified SSM effectiveness rate.
    4. Add the current risk indices for the other public grade crossings 
located within the proposed quiet zone and divide by the number of 
crossings. The resulting risk index will be the new Risk Index With 
Horns for the proposed quiet zone.

  C. Credit for Pre-Existing Modified SSMs in Pre-Rule Quiet Zones and 
                      Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones

    A community that has implemented a pre-existing modified SSM at a 
public grade crossing can receive risk reduction credit by inflating the 
Risk Index With Horns as follows:
    1. Calculate the current risk index for the grade crossing that is 
equipped with a pre-existing modified SSM. (See appendix D. FRA's web-
based Quiet Zone Calculator may be used to complete this calculation.)
    2. Reduce the current risk index for the grade crossing to reflect 
the risk reduction that would have been achieved if the locomotive horn 
was routinely sounded at the

[[Page 321]]

crossing. The following list sets forth the estimated risk reduction for 
certain types of crossings:
    a. Risk indices for passive crossings shall be reduced by 43%;
    b. Risk indices for grade crossings equipped with automatic flashing 
lights shall be reduced by 27%; and
    c. Risk indices for gated crossings shall be reduced by 40%.
    3. Obtain FRA approval of the estimated effectiveness rate for the 
pre-existing modified SSM. Estimated effectiveness rates may be based 
upon adjustments from the SSM effectiveness rates provided in appendix A 
or actual field data derived from crossing sites.
    4. Adjust the risk index by accounting for the increased risk that 
was avoided by implementing the pre-existing modified SSM at the public 
grade crossing. This adjustment can be made by dividing the risk index 
by one minus the FRA-approved modified SSM effectiveness rate.
    5. Adjust the risk indices for the other crossings that are included 
in the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone by reducing 
the current risk index to reflect the risk reduction that would have 
been achieved if the locomotive horn was routinely sounded at each 
crossing. Please refer to step two for the list of approved risk 
reduction percentages by crossing type.
    6. Add the new risk indices for each crossing located within the 
proposed quiet zone and divide by the number of crossings. The resulting 
risk index will be the new Risk Index With Horns for the quiet zone.

                        II. Non-Engineering ASMs

    A. The following non-engineering ASMs may be used in the creation of 
a Quiet Zone: (The method for determining the effectiveness of the non-
engineering ASMs, the implementation of the quiet zone, subsequent 
monitoring requirements, and dealing with an unacceptable effectiveness 
rate is provided in paragraph B.)
    1. Programmed Enforcement: Community and law enforcement officials 
commit to a systematic and measurable crossing monitoring and traffic 
law enforcement program at the public highway-rail grade crossing, alone 
or in combination with the Public Education and Awareness ASM.
    Required:
    a. Subject to audit, a statistically valid baseline violation rate 
must be established through automated or systematic manual monitoring or 
sampling at the subject crossing(s); and
    b. A law enforcement effort must be defined, established and 
continued along with continual or regular monitoring that provides a 
statistically valid violation rate that indicates the effectiveness of 
the law enforcement effort.
    c. The public authority shall retain records pertaining to 
monitoring and sampling efforts at the grade crossing for a period of 
not less than five years. These records shall be made available, upon 
request, to FRA as provided by 49 U.S.C. 20107.
    2. Public Education and Awareness: Conduct, alone or in combination 
with programmed law enforcement, a program of public education and 
awareness directed at motor vehicle drivers, pedestrians and residents 
near the railroad to emphasize the risks associated with public highway-
rail grade crossings and applicable requirements of state and local 
traffic laws at those crossings.
    Requirements:
    a. Subject to audit, a statistically valid baseline violation rate 
must be established through automated or systematic manual monitoring or 
sampling at the subject crossing(s); and
    b. A sustainable public education and awareness program must be 
defined, established and continued along with continual or regular 
monitoring that provides a statistically valid violation rate that 
indicates the effectiveness of the public education and awareness 
effort. This program shall be provided and supported primarily through 
local resources.
    c. The public authority shall retain records pertaining to 
monitoring and sampling efforts at the grade crossing for a period of 
not less than five years. These records shall be made available, upon 
request, to FRA as provided by 49 U.S.C. 20107.
    3. Photo Enforcement: This ASM entails automated means of gathering 
valid photographic or video evidence of traffic law violations at a 
public highway-rail grade crossing together with follow-through by law 
enforcement and the judiciary.
    Requirements:
    a. State law authorizing use of photographic or video evidence both 
to bring charges and sustain the burden of proof that a violation of 
traffic laws concerning public highway-rail grade crossings has 
occurred, accompanied by commitment of administrative, law enforcement 
and judicial officers to enforce the law;
    b. Sanction includes sufficient minimum fine (e.g., $100 for a first 
offense, ``points'' toward license suspension or revocation) to deter 
violations;
    c. Means to reliably detect violations (e.g., loop detectors, video 
imaging technology);
    d. Photographic or video equipment deployed to capture images 
sufficient to document the violation (including the face of the driver, 
if required to charge or convict under state law).
    Note: This does not require that each crossing be continually 
monitored. The objective of this option is deterrence, which may be 
accomplished by moving photo/video equipment among several crossing 
locations,

[[Page 322]]

as long as the motorist perceives the strong possibility that a 
violation will lead to sanctions. Each location must appear identical to 
the motorist, whether or not surveillance equipment is actually placed 
there at the particular time. Surveillance equipment should be in place 
and operating at each crossing at least 25 percent of each calendar 
quarter.
    e. Appropriate integration, testing and maintenance of the system to 
provide evidence supporting enforcement;
    f. Public awareness efforts designed to reinforce photo enforcement 
and alert motorists to the absence of train horns;
    g. Subject to audit, a statistically valid baseline violation rate 
must be established through automated or systematic manual monitoring or 
sampling at the subject crossing(s); and
    h. A law enforcement effort must be defined, established and 
continued along with continual or regular monitoring.
    i. The public authority shall retain records pertaining to 
monitoring and sampling efforts at the grade crossing for a period of 
not less than five years. These records shall be made available, upon 
request, to FRA as provided by 49 U.S.C. 20107.
    B. The effectiveness of an ASM will be determined as follows:
    1. Establish the quarterly (three months) baseline violation rates 
for each crossing in the proposed quiet zone.
    a. A violation in this context refers to a motorist not complying 
with the automatic warning devices at the crossing (not stopping for the 
flashing lights and driving over the crossing after the gate arms have 
started to descend, or driving around the lowered gate arms). A 
violation does not have to result in a traffic citation for the 
violation to be considered.
    b. Violation data may be obtained by any method that can be shown to 
provide a statistically valid sample. This may include the use of video 
cameras, other technologies (e.g., inductive loops), or manual 
observations that capture driver behavior when the automatic warning 
devices are operating.
    c. If data is not collected continuously during the quarter, 
sufficient detail must be provided in the application in order to 
validate that the methodology used results in a statistically valid 
sample. FRA recommends that at least a minimum of 600 samples (one 
sample equals one gate activation) be collected during the baseline and 
subsequent quarterly sample periods.
    d. The sampling methodology must take measures to avoid biases in 
their sampling technique. Potential sampling biases could include: 
Sampling on certain days of the week but not others; sampling during 
certain times of the day but not others; sampling immediately after 
implementation of an ASM while the public is still going through an 
adjustment period; or applying one sample method for the baseline rate 
and another for the new rate.
    e. The baseline violation rate should be expressed as the number of 
violations per gate activations in order to normalize for unequal gate 
activations during subsequent data collection periods.
    f. All subsequent quarterly violation rate calculations must use the 
same methodology as stated in this paragraph unless FRA authorizes 
another methodology.
    2. The ASM should then be initiated for each crossing. Train horns 
are still being sounded during this time period.
    3. In the calendar quarter following initiation of the ASM, 
determine a new quarterly violation rate using the same methodology as 
in paragraph (1) above.
    4. Determine the violation rate reduction for each crossing by the 
following formula:

Violation rate reduction = (new rate - baseline rate)/baseline rate

    5. Determine the effectiveness rate of the ASM for each crossing by 
multiplying the violation rate reduction by .78.
    6. Using the effectiveness rates for each grade crossing treated by 
an ASM, determine the Quiet Zone Risk Index. If and when the Quiet Zone 
Risk Index for the proposed quiet zone has been reduced to a level at, 
or below, the Risk Index With Horns or the Nationwide Significant Risk 
Threshold, the public authority may apply to FRA for approval of the 
proposed quiet zone. Upon receiving written approval of the quiet zone 
application from FRA, the public authority may then proceed with 
notifications and implementation of the quiet zone.
    7. Violation rates must be monitored for the next two calendar 
quarters and every second quarter thereafter. If, after five years from 
the implementation of the quiet zone, the violation rate for any quarter 
has never exceeded the violation rate that was used to determine the 
effectiveness rate that was approved by FRA, violation rates may be 
monitored for one quarter per year.
    8. In the event that the violation rate is ever greater than the 
violation rate used to determine the effectiveness rate that was 
approved by FRA, the public authority may continue the quiet zone for 
another quarter. If, in the second quarter the violation rate is still 
greater than the rate used to determine the effectiveness rate that was 
approved by FRA, a new effectiveness rate must be calculated and the 
Quiet Zone Risk Index re-calculated using the new effectiveness rate. If 
the new Quiet Zone Risk Index indicates that the ASM no longer fully 
compensates for the lack of a train horn, or that the risk level is 
equal to, or exceeds the National Significant Risk Threshold, the 
procedures for dealing with unacceptable effectiveness after

[[Page 323]]

establishment of a quiet zone should be followed.

                          III. Engineering ASMs

    A. Engineering improvements, other than modified SSMs, may be used 
in the creation of a Quiet Zone. These engineering improvements, which 
will be treated as ASMs under this appendix, may include improvements 
that address underlying geometric conditions, including sight distance, 
that are the source of increased risk at the crossing.
    B. The effectiveness of an Engineering ASM will be determined as 
follows:
    1. Establish the quarterly (three months) baseline violation rate 
for the crossing at which the Engineering ASM will be applied.
    a. A violation in this context refers to a motorist not complying 
with the automatic warning devices at the crossing (not stopping for the 
flashing lights and driving over the crossing after the gate arms have 
started to descend, or driving around the lowered gate arms). A 
violation does not have to result in a traffic citation for the 
violation to be considered.
    b. Violation data may be obtained by any method that can be shown to 
provide a statistically valid sample. This may include the use of video 
cameras, other technologies (e.g. inductive loops), or manual 
observations that capture driver behavior when the automatic warning 
devices are operating.
    c. If data is not collected continuously during the quarter, 
sufficient detail must be provided in the application in order to 
validate that the methodology used results in a statistically valid 
sample. FRA recommends that at least a minimum of 600 samples (one 
sample equals one gate activation) be collected during the baseline and 
subsequent quarterly sample periods.
    d. The sampling methodology must take measures to avoid biases in 
their sampling technique. Potential sampling biases could include: 
Sampling on certain days of the week but not others; sampling during 
certain times of the day but not others; sampling immediately after 
implementation of an ASM while the public is still going through an 
adjustment period; or applying one sample method for the baseline rate 
and another for the new rate.
    e. The baseline violation rate should be expressed as the number of 
violations per gate activations in order to normalize for unequal gate 
activations during subsequent data collection periods.
    f. All subsequent quarterly violation rate calculations must use the 
same methodology as stated in this paragraph unless FRA authorizes 
another methodology.
    2. The Engineering ASM should be initiated at the crossing. Train 
horns are still being sounded during this time period.
    3. In the calendar quarter following initiation of the Engineering 
ASM, determine a new quarterly violation rate using the same methodology 
as in paragraph (1) above.
    4. Determine the violation rate reduction for the crossing by the 
following formula:

Violation rate reduction = (new rate - baseline rate)/baseline rate

    5. Using the Engineering ASM effectiveness rate, determine the Quiet 
Zone Risk Index. If and when the Quiet Zone Risk Index for the proposed 
quiet zone has been reduced to a risk level at or below the Risk Index 
With Horns or the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, the public 
authority may apply to FRA for approval of the quiet zone. Upon 
receiving written approval of the quiet zone application from FRA, the 
public authority may then proceed with notifications and implementation 
of the quiet zone.
    6. Violation rates must be monitored for the next two calendar 
quarters. Unless otherwise provided in FRA's notification of quiet zone 
approval, if the violation rate for these two calendar quarters does not 
exceed the violation rate that was used to determine the effectiveness 
rate that was approved by FRA, the public authority can cease violation 
rate monitoring.
    7. In the event that the violation rate over either of the next two 
calendar quarters are greater than the violation rate used to determine 
the effectiveness rate that was approved by FRA, the public authority 
may continue the quiet zone for a third calendar quarter. However, if 
the third calendar quarter violation rate is also greater than the rate 
used to determine the effectiveness rate that was approved by FRA, a new 
effectiveness rate must be calculated and the Quiet Zone Risk Index re-
calculated using the new effectiveness rate. If the new Quiet Zone Risk 
Index exceeds the Risk Index With Horns and the Nationwide Significant 
Risk Threshold, the procedures for dealing with unacceptable 
effectiveness after establishment of a quiet zone should be followed.

     Sec. Appendix C to Part 222--Guide to Establishing Quiet Zones

                              Introduction

    This Guide to Establishing Quiet Zones (Guide) is divided into five 
sections in order to address the variety of methods and conditions that 
affect the establishment of quiet zones under this rule.
    Section I of the Guide provides an overview of the different ways in 
which a quiet zone may be established under this rule. This includes a 
brief discussion on the safety thresholds that must be attained in order 
for train horns to be silenced and the relative merits of each. It also 
includes the two general methods that may be used to reduce risk in the 
proposed quiet zone, and the different impacts that the methods have on 
the quiet zone implementation process. This section

[[Page 324]]

also discusses Partial (e.g. night time only quiet zones) and 
Intermediate Quiet Zones. An Intermediate Quiet Zone is one where horn 
restrictions were in place after October 9, 1996, but as of December 18, 
2003.
    Section II of the Guide provides information on establishing New 
Quiet Zones. A New Quiet Zone is one at which train horns are currently 
being sounded at crossings. The Public Authority Designation and Public 
Authority Application to FRA methods will be discussed in depth.
    Section III of the Guide provides information on establishing Pre-
Rule Quiet Zones. A Pre-Rule Quiet Zone is one where train horns were 
not routinely sounded as of October 9, 1996 and December 18, 2003. The 
differences between New and Pre-Rule Quiet Zones will be explained. 
Public Authority Designation and Public Authority Application to FRA 
methods also apply to Pre-Rule Quiet Zones.
    Section IV of the Guide deals with the required notifications that 
must be provided by public authorities when establishing both New and 
continuing Pre-Rule or Intermediate Quiet Zones.
    Section V of the Guide provides examples of quiet zone 
implementation.

                           Section I--Overview

    In order for a quiet zone to be qualified under this rule, it must 
be shown that the lack of the train horn does not present a significant 
risk with respect to loss of life or serious personal injury, or that 
the significant risk has been compensated for by other means. The rule 
provides four basic ways in which a quiet zone may be established. 
Creation of both New Quiet Zones and Pre-Rule Quiet Zones are based on 
the same general guidelines; however, there are a number of differences 
that will be noted in the discussion on Pre-Rule Quiet Zones.

                        A. Qualifying Conditions

    (1) One of the following four conditions or scenarios must be met in 
order to show that the lack of the train horn does not present a 
significant risk, or that the significant risk has been compensated for 
by other means:
    a. One or more SSMs as identified in appendix A are installed at 
each public crossing in the quiet zone; or
    b. The Quiet Zone Risk Index is equal to, or less than, the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold without implementation of 
additional safety measures at any crossings in the quiet zone; or
    c. Additional safety measures are implemented at selected crossings 
resulting in the Quiet Zone Risk Index being reduced to a level equal 
to, or less than, the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold; or
    d. Additional safety measures are taken at selected crossings 
resulting in the Quiet Zone Risk Index being reduced to at least the 
level of the Risk Index With Horns (that is, the risk that would exist 
if train horns were sounded at every public crossing in the quiet zone).
    (2) It is important to consider the implications of each approach 
before deciding which one to use. If a quiet zone is qualified based on 
reference to the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold (i.e. the Quiet 
Zone Risk Index is equal to, or less than, the Nationwide Significant 
Risk Threshold--see the second and third scenarios above), then an 
annual review will be done by FRA to determine if the Quiet Zone Risk 
Index remains equal to, or less than, the Nationwide Significant Risk 
Threshold. Since the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold and the Quiet 
Zone Risk Index may change from year to year, there is no guarantee that 
the quiet zone will remain qualified. The circumstances that cause the 
disqualification may not be subject to the control of the public 
authority. For example, an overall national improvement in safety at 
gated crossings may cause the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold to 
fall. This may cause the Quiet Zone Risk Index to become greater than 
the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold. If the quiet zone is no 
longer qualified, then the public authority will have to take additional 
measures, and may incur additional costs that might not have been 
budgeted, to once again lower the Quiet Zone Risk Index to at least the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold in order to retain the quiet zone. 
Therefore, while the initial cost to implement a quiet zone under the 
second or third scenario may be lower than the other options, these 
scenarios also carry a degree of uncertainty about the quiet zone's 
continued existence.
    (3) The use of the first or fourth scenarios reduces the risk level 
to at least the level that would exist if train horns were sounding in 
the quiet zone. These methods may have higher initial costs because more 
safety measures may be necessary in order to achieve the needed risk 
reduction. Despite the possibility of greater initial costs, there are 
several benefits to these methods. The installation of SSMs at every 
crossing will provide the greatest safety benefit of any of the methods 
that may be used to initiate a quiet zone. With both of these methods 
(first and fourth scenarios), the public authority will never need to be 
concerned about the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, annual 
reviews of the Quiet Zone Risk Index, or failing to be qualified because 
the Quiet Zone Risk Index is higher than the Nationwide Significant Risk 
Threshold. Public authorities are strongly encouraged to carefully 
consider both the pros and cons of all of the methods and to choose the 
method that will best meet the needs of its citizens by providing a 
safer and quieter community.

[[Page 325]]

    (4) For the purposes of this Guide, the term ``Risk Index with 
Horns'' is used to represent the level of risk that would exist if train 
horns were sounded at every public crossing in the proposed quiet zone. 
If a public authority decides that it would like to fully compensate for 
the lack of a train horn and not install SSMs at each public crossing in 
the quiet zone, it must reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index to a level that 
is equal to, or less than, the Risk Index with Horns. The Risk Index 
with Horns is similar to the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold in 
that both are targets that must be reached in order to establish a quiet 
zone under the rule. Quiet zones that are established by reducing the 
Quiet Zone Risk Index to at least the level of the Nationwide 
Significant Risk Threshold will be reviewed annually by FRA to determine 
if they still qualify under the rule to retain the quiet zone. Quiet 
zones that are established by reducing the Quiet Zone Risk Index to at 
least the level of the Risk Index with Horns will not be subject to 
annual reviews.
    (5) The use of FRA's web-based Quiet Zone Calculator is recommended 
to aid in the decision making process (http://www.fra.dot.gov/us/
content/1337). The Quiet Zone Calculator will allow the public authority 
to consider a variety of options in determining which SSMs make the most 
sense. It will also perform the necessary calculations used to determine 
the existing risk level and whether enough risk has been mitigated in 
order to create a quiet zone under this rule.

                        B. Risk Reduction Methods

    FRA has established two general methods to reduce risk in order to 
have a quiet zone qualify under this rule. The method chosen impacts the 
manner in which the quiet zone is implemented.
    1. Public Authority Designation (SSMs)--The Public Authority 
Designation method (Sec. 222.39(a)) involves the use of SSMs (see 
appendix A) at some or all crossings within the quiet zone. The use of 
only SSMs to reduce risk will allow a public authority to designate a 
quiet zone without approval from FRA. If the public authority installs 
SSMs at every crossing within the quiet zone, it need not demonstrate 
that they will reduce the risk sufficiently in order to qualify under 
the rule since FRA has already assessed the ability of the SSMs to 
reduce risk. In other words, the Quiet Zone Calculator does not need to 
be used. However, if only SSMs are installed within the quiet zone, but 
not at every crossing, the public authority must calculate that 
sufficient risk reduction will be accomplished by the SSMs. Once the 
improvements are made, the public authority must make the required 
notifications (which includes a copy of the report generated by the 
Quiet Zone Calculator showing that the risk in the quiet zone has been 
sufficiently reduced), and the quiet zone may be implemented. FRA does 
not need to approve the plan as it has already assessed the ability of 
the SSMs to reduce risk.
    2. Public Authority Application to FRA (ASMs)--The Public Authority 
Application to FRA method (Sec. 222.39(b)) involves the use ASMs (see 
appendix B). ASMs include modified SSMs that do not fully comply with 
the provisions found in appendix A (e.g., shorter than required traffic 
channelization devices), non-engineering ASMs (e.g., programmed law 
enforcement), and engineering ASMs (i.e., engineering improvements other 
than modified SSMs). If the use of ASMs (or a combination of ASMs and 
SSMs) is elected to reduce risk, then the public authority must provide 
a Notice of Intent and then apply to FRA for approval of the quiet zone. 
The application must contain sufficient data and analysis to confirm 
that the proposed ASMs do indeed provide the necessary risk reduction. 
FRA will review the application and will issue a formal approval if it 
determines that risk is reduced to a level that is necessary in order to 
comply with the rule. Once FRA approval has been received and the safety 
measures fully implemented, the public authority would then provide a 
Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment and the quiet zone may be 
implemented. The use of non-engineering ASMs will require continued 
monitoring and analysis throughout the existence of the quiet zone to 
ensure that risk continues to be reduced.
    3. Calculating Risk Reduction--The following should be noted when 
calculating risk reductions in association with the establishment of a 
quiet zone. This information pertains to both New Quiet Zones and Pre-
Rule Quiet Zones and to the Public Authority Designation and Public 
Authority Application to FRA methods.
    Crossing closures: If any public crossing within the quiet zone is 
proposed to be closed, include that crossing when calculating the Risk 
Index with Horns. The effectiveness of a closure is 1.0. However, be 
sure to increase the traffic counts at other crossings within the quiet 
zone and recalculate the risk indices for those crossings that will 
handle the traffic diverted from the closed crossing. It should be noted 
that crossing closures that are already in existence are not considered 
in the risk calculations.

    Example: A proposed New Quiet Zone contains four crossings: A, B, C 
and D streets. A, B and D streets are equipped with flashing lights and 
gates. C Street is a passive crossbuck crossing with a traffic count of 
400 vehicles per day. It is decided that C Street will be closed as part 
of the project. Compute the risk indices for all four streets. The 
calculation for C Street will utilize flashing lights and gates as the 
warning device. Calculate the Crossing Corridor Risk Index by

[[Page 326]]

averaging the risk indices for all four of the crossings. This value 
will also be the Risk Index with Horns since train horns are currently 
being sounded. To calculate the Quiet Zone Risk Index, first re-
calculate the risk indices for B and D streets by increasing the traffic 
count for each crossing by 200. (Assume for this example that the public 
authority decided that the traffic from C Street would be equally 
divided between B and D streets.) Increase the risk indices for A, B and 
D streets by 66.8% and divide the sum of the three remaining crossings 
by four. This is the initial Quiet Zone Risk Index and accounts for the 
risk reduction caused by closing C Street.

    Grade Separation: Grade separated crossings that were in existence 
before the creation of a quiet zone are not included in any of the 
calculations. However, any public crossings within the quiet zone that 
are proposed to be treated by grade separation should be treated in the 
same manner as crossing closures. Highway traffic that may be diverted 
from other crossings within the quiet zone to the new grade separated 
crossing should be considered when computing the Quiet Zone Risk Index.

    Example: A proposed New Quiet Zone contains four crossings: A, B, C 
and D streets. All streets are equipped with flashing lights and gates. 
C Street is a busy crossing with a traffic count of 25,000 vehicles per 
day. It is decided that C Street will be grade separated as part of the 
project and the existing at-grade crossing closed. Compute the risk 
indices for all four streets. Calculate the Crossing Corridor Risk 
Index, which will also be the Risk Index with Horns, by averaging the 
risk indices for all four of the crossings. To calculate the Quiet Zone 
Risk Index, first re-calculate the risk indices for B and D streets by 
decreasing the traffic count for each crossing by 1,200. (The public 
authority decided that 2,400 motorists will decide to use the grade 
separation at C Street in order to avoid possible delays caused by 
passing trains.) Increase the risk indices for A, B and D streets by 
66.8% and divide the sum of the three remaining crossings by four. This 
is the initial Quiet Zone Risk Index and accounts for the risk reduction 
caused by the grade separation at C Street.

    Pre-Existing SSMs: Risk reduction credit may be taken by a public 
authority for a SSM that was previously implemented and is currently in 
place in the quiet zone. If an existing improvement meets the criteria 
for a SSM as provided in appendix A, the improvement is deemed a Pre-
Existing SSM. Risk reduction credit is obtained by inflating the Risk 
Index With Horns to show what the risk would have been at the crossing 
if the pre-existing SSM had not been implemented. Crossing closures and 
grade separations that occurred prior to the implementation of the quiet 
zone are not Pre-Existing SSMs and do not receive any risk reduction 
credit.

    Example 1. A proposed New Quiet Zone has one crossing that is 
equipped with flashing lights and gates and has medians 100 feet in 
length on both sides of the crossing. The medians conform to the 
requirements in appendix A and qualify as a Pre-Existing SSM. The risk 
index as calculated for the crossing is 10,000. To calculate the Risk 
Index With Horns for this crossing, you divide the risk index by 
difference between one and the effectiveness rate of the pre-existing 
SSM (10,000 / (1-0.75) = 40,000). This value (40,000) would then be 
averaged in with the risk indices of the other crossings to determine 
the proposed quiet zone's Risk Index With Horns. To calculate the Quiet 
Zone Risk Index, the original risk index is increased by 66.8% to 
account for the additional risk attributed to the absence of the train 
horn (10,000 x 1.668 = 16,680). This value (16,680) is then averaged 
into the risk indices of the other crossings that have also been 
increased by 66.8%. The resulting average is the Quiet Zone Risk Index.
    Example 2. A Pre-Rule Quiet Zone consisting of four crossings has 
one crossing that is equipped with flashing lights and gates and has 
medians 100 feet in length on both sides of the crossing. The medians 
conform to the requirements in appendix A and qualify as a Pre-Existing 
SSM. The risk index as calculated for the crossing is 20,000. To 
calculate the Risk Index With Horns for this crossing, first reduce the 
risk index by 40 percent to reflect the risk reduction that would be 
achieved if train horns were routinely sounded (20,000 x 0.6 = 12,000). 
Next, divide the resulting risk index by difference between one and the 
effectiveness rate of the pre-existing SSM (12,000 / (1 - 0.75) = 
48,000). This value (48,000) would then be averaged with the adjusted 
risk indices of the other crossings to determine the pre-rule quiet 
zone's Risk Index With Horns. To calculate the Quiet Zone Risk Index, 
the original risk index (20,000) is then averaged into the risk original 
indices of the other crossings. The resulting average is the Quiet Zone 
Risk Index.

    Pre-Existing Modified SSMs: Risk reduction credit may be taken by a 
public authority for a modified SSM that was previously implemented and 
is currently in place in the quiet zone. Modified SSMs are Alternative 
Safety Measures which must be approved by FRA. If an existing 
improvement is approved by FRA as a modified SSM as provided in appendix 
B, the improvement is deemed a Pre-Existing Modified SSM. Risk reduction 
credit is obtained by inflating the Risk Index With Horns to show what 
the risk would have been at the crossing if the pre-existing

[[Page 327]]

SSM had not been implemented. The effectiveness rate of the modified SSM 
will be determined by FRA. The public authority may provide information 
to FRA to be used in determining the effectiveness rate of the modified 
SSM. Once an effectiveness rate has been determined, follow the 
procedure previously discussed for Pre-Existing SSMs to determine the 
risk values that will be used in the quiet zone calculations.
    Wayside Horns: Crossings with wayside horn installations will be 
treated as a one for one substitute for the train horn and are not to be 
included when calculating the Crossing Corridor Risk Index, the Risk 
Index with Horns or the Quiet Zone Risk Index.

    Example: A proposed New Quiet Zone contains four crossings: A, B, C 
and D streets. All streets are equipped with flashing lights and gates. 
It is decided that C Street will have a wayside horn installed. Compute 
the risk indices for A, B and D streets. Since C Street is being treated 
with a wayside horn, it is not included in the calculation of risk. 
Calculate the Crossing Corridor Risk Index by averaging the risk indices 
for A, B and D streets. This value is also the Risk Index with Horns. 
Increase the risk indices for A, B and D streets by 66.8% and average 
the results. This is the initial Quiet Zone Risk Index for the proposed 
quiet zone.

                         C. Partial Quiet Zones

    A Partial Quiet Zone is a quiet zone in which locomotive horns are 
not routinely sounded at public crossings for a specified period of time 
each day. For example, a quiet zone during only the nighttime hours 
would be a partial quiet zone. Partial quiet zones may be either New or 
Pre-Rule and follow the same rules as 24 hour quiet zones. New Partial 
Quiet Zones must be in effect during the hours of 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. All 
New Partial Quiet Zones must comply with all of the requirements for New 
Quiet Zones. For example, all public grade crossings that are open 
during the time that horns are silenced must be equipped with flashing 
lights and gates that are equipped with constant warning time (where 
practical) and power out indicators. Risk is calculated in exactly the 
same manner as for New Quiet Zones. The Quiet Zone Risk Index is 
calculated for the entire 24-hour period, even though the train horn 
will only be silenced during the hours of 10 p.m. to 7 a.m.
    A Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone is a partial quiet zone at which train 
horns were not sounding as of October 9, 1996 and on December 18, 2003. 
All of the regulations that pertain to Pre-Rule Quiet Zones also pertain 
to Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones. The Quiet Zone Risk Index is calculated 
for the entire 24-hour period for Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones, even 
though train horns are only silenced during the nighttime hours. Pre-
Rule Partial Quiet Zones may qualify for automatic approval in the same 
manner as Pre-Rule Quiet Zones with one exception. If the Quiet Zone 
Risk Index is less than twice the National Significant Risk Threshold, 
and there have been no relevant collisions during the time period when 
train horns are silenced, then the Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone is 
automatically qualified. In other words, a relevant collision that 
occurred during the period of time that train horns were sounded will 
not disqualify a Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone that has a Quiet Zone Risk 
Index that is less than twice the National Significant Risk Index. Pre-
Rule Partial Quiet Zones must provide the notification as required in 
Sec. 222.43 in order to keep train horns silenced. A Pre-Rule Partial 
Quiet Zone may be converted to a 24 hour New Quiet Zone by complying 
with all of the New Quiet Zone regulations.

                       D. Intermediate Quiet Zones

    An Intermediate Quiet Zone is one where horn restrictions were in 
place after October 9, 1996, but as of December 18, 2003 (the 
publication date of the Interim Final Rule). Intermediate Quiet Zones 
and Intermediate Partial Quiet Zones will be able to keep train horns 
silenced until June 24, 2006, provided notification is made per Sec. 
222.43. This will enable public authority to have additional time to 
make the improvement necessary to come into compliance with the rule. 
Intermediate Quiet Zones must conform to all the requirements for New 
Quiet Zones by June 24, 2006. Other than having the horn silenced for an 
additional year, Intermediate Quiet Zones are treated exactly like New 
Quiet Zones.

                       Section II--New Quiet Zones

    FRA has established several approaches that may be taken in order to 
establish a New Quiet Zone under this rule. Please see the preceding 
discussions on ``Qualifying Conditions'' and ``Risk Reduction Methods'' 
to assist in the decision-making process on which approach to take. This 
following discussion provides the steps necessary to establish New Quiet 
Zones and includes both the Public Authority Designation and Public 
Authority Application to FRA methods. It must be remembered that in a 
New Quiet Zone all public crossings must be equipped with flashing 
lights and gates. The requirements are the same regardless of whether a 
24-hour or partial quiet zone is being created.

    A. Requirements for Both Public Authority Designation and Public 
                          Authority Application

    The following steps are necessary when establishing a New Quiet 
Zone. This information pertains to both the Public Authority Designation 
and Public Authority Application to FRA methods.

[[Page 328]]

    1. The public authority must provide a written Notice of Intent 
(Sec. 222.43(a)(1) and Sec. 222.43(b)) to the railroads that operate 
over the proposed quiet zone, the State agency responsible for highway 
and road safety and the State agency responsible for grade crossing 
safety. The purpose of this Notice of Intent is to provide an 
opportunity for the railroads and the State agencies to provide comments 
and recommendations to the public authority as it is planning the quiet 
zone. They will have 60 days to provide these comments to the public 
authority. The quiet zone cannot be created unless the Notice of Intent 
has been provided. FRA encourages public authorities to provide the 
required Notice of Intent early in the quiet zone development process. 
The railroads and State agencies can provide an expertise that very well 
may not be present within the public authority. FRA believes that it 
will be very useful to include these organizations in the planning 
process. For example, including railroads and State agencies in the 
inspections of the crossing will help ensure accurate Inventory 
information for the crossings. The railroad can provide information on 
whether the flashing lights and gates are equipped with constant warning 
time and power out indicators. Pedestrian crossings and private 
crossings with public access, industrial or commercial use that are 
within the quiet zone must have a diagnostic team review and be treated 
according to the team's recommendations. Railroads and the State agency 
responsible for grade crossing safety must be invited to the diagnostic 
team review. Note: Please see Section IV for details on the requirements 
of a Notice of Intent.
    2. Determine all public, private and pedestrian at-grade crossings 
that will be included within the quiet zone. Also, determine any 
existing grade-separated crossings that fall within the quiet zone. Each 
crossing must be identified by the U.S. DOT Crossing Inventory number 
and street or highway name. If a crossing does not have a U.S. DOT 
Crossing Inventory number, then contact FRA's Office of Safety (202-493-
6299) for assistance.
    3. Ensure that the quiet zone will be at least one-half mile in 
length. (Sec. 222.35(a)(1)) If more than one New Quiet Zone or New 
Partial Quiet Zone will be created within a single political 
jurisdiction, ensure that each New Quiet Zone or New Partial Quiet Zone 
will be separated by at least one public highway-rail grade crossing. 
(Sec. 222.35(a)(1)(iii))
    4. A complete and accurate Grade Crossing Inventory Form must be on 
file with FRA for all crossings (public, private and pedestrian) within 
the quiet zone. An inspection of each crossing in the proposed quiet 
zone should be performed and the Grade Crossing Inventory Forms updated, 
as necessary, to reflect the current conditions at each crossing.
    5. Every public crossing within the quiet zone must be equipped with 
active warning devices comprising both flashing lights and gates. The 
warning devices must be equipped with power out indicators. Constant 
warning time circuitry is also required unless existing conditions would 
prevent the proper operation of the constant warning time circuitry. FRA 
recommends that these automatic warning devices also be equipped with at 
least one bell to provide an audible warning to pedestrians. If the 
warning devices are already equipped with a bell (or bells), the bells 
may not be removed or deactivated. The plans for the quiet zone may be 
made assuming that flashing lights and gates are at all public 
crossings; however the quiet zone may not be implemented until all 
public crossings are actually equipped with the flashing lights and 
gates. (Sec. Sec. 222.35(b)(1) and 222.35(b)(2))
    6. Private crossings must have cross-bucks and ``STOP'' signs on 
both approaches to the crossing. Private crossings with public access, 
industrial or commercial use must have a diagnostic team review and be 
treated according to the team's recommendations. The public authority 
must invite the State agency responsible for grade crossing safety and 
all affected railroads to participate in the diagnostic review. 
(Sec. Sec. 222.25(b) and (c))
    7. Each highway approach to every public and private crossing must 
have an advance warning sign (in accordance with the MUTCD) that advises 
motorists that train horns are not sounded at the crossing, unless the 
public or private crossing is equipped with a wayside horn. (Sec. 
222.35(c))
    8. Each pedestrian crossing must be reviewed by a diagnostic team 
and equipped or treated in accordance with the recommendation of the 
diagnostic team. The public authority must invite the State agency 
responsible for grade crossing safety and all affected railroads to 
participate in the diagnostic review. At a minimum, each approach to 
every pedestrian crossing must be equipped with a sign that conforms to 
the MUTCD and advises pedestrians that train horns are not sounded at 
the crossing. (Sec. 222.27)

            B. New Quiet Zones--Public Authority Designation

    Once again it should be remembered that all public crossings must be 
equipped with automatic warning devices consisting of flashing lights 
and gates in accordance with Sec. 222.35(b). In addition, one of the 
following conditions must be met in order for a public authority to 
designate a new quiet zone without FRA approval:
    a. One or more SSMs as identified in appendix A are installed at 
each public crossing in the quiet zone (Sec. 222.39(a)(1)); or
    b. The Quiet Zone Risk Index is equal to, or less than, the 
Nationwide Significant Risk

[[Page 329]]

Threshold without SSMs installed at any crossings in the quiet zone 
(Sec. 222.39(a)(2)(i)); or
    c. SSMs are installed at selected crossings, resulting in the Quiet 
Zone Risk Index being reduced to a level equal to, or less than, the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold (Sec. 222.39(a)(2)(ii)); or
    d. SSMs are installed at selected crossings, resulting in the Quiet 
Zone Risk Index being reduced to a level of risk that would exist if the 
horn were sounded at every crossing in the quiet zone (i.e., the Risk 
Index with Horns) (Sec. 222.39(a)(3)).
    Steps necessary to establish a New Quiet Zone using the Public 
Authority Application to FRA method:
    1. If one or more SSMs as identified in appendix A are installed at 
each public crossing in the quiet zone, the requirements for a public 
authority designation quiet zone will have been met. It is not necessary 
for the same SSM to be used at each crossing. However, before any 
improvements are implemented, the public authority must provide a Notice 
of Intent, which will trigger a 60-day comment period. During the 60-day 
comment period, railroads operating within the proposed quiet zone and 
State agencies responsible for grade crossing, highway and road safety 
may submit comments on the proposed quiet zone improvements to the 
public authority. Once the necessary improvements have been installed, 
Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment shall be provided and the quiet zone 
implemented in accordance with the rule. If SSMs are not installed at 
each public crossing, proceed on to Step 2 and use the risk reduction 
method.
    2. To begin, calculate the risk index for each public crossing 
within the quiet zone (See appendix D. FRA's web-based Quiet Zone 
Calculator may be used to do this calculation). If flashing lights and 
gates have to be installed at any public crossings, calculate the risk 
indices for such crossings as if lights and gates were installed. (Note: 
Flashing lights and gates must be installed prior to initiation of the 
quiet zone.) If the Inventory record does not reflect the actual 
conditions at the crossing, be sure to use the conditions that currently 
exist when calculating the risk index. Note: Private crossings and 
pedestrian crossings are not included when computing the risk for the 
proposed quiet zone.
    3. The Crossing Corridor Risk Index is then calculated by averaging 
the risk index for each public crossing within the proposed quiet zone. 
Since train horns are routinely being sounded for crossings in the 
proposed quiet zone, this value is also the Risk Index with Horns.
    4. In order to calculate the initial Quiet Zone Risk Index, first 
adjust the risk index at each public crossing to account for the 
increased risk due to the absence of the train horn. The absence of the 
horn is reflected by an increased risk index of 66.8% at gated 
crossings. The initial Quiet Zone Risk Index is then calculated by 
averaging the increased risk index for each public crossing within the 
proposed quiet zone. At this point the Quiet Zone Risk Index will equal 
the Risk Index with Horns multiplied by 1.668.
    5. Compare the Quiet Zone Risk Index to the Nationwide Significant 
Risk Threshold. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index is equal to, or less than, 
the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, then the public authority may 
decide to designate a quiet zone and provide the Notice of Intent, 
followed by the Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment. With this approach, 
FRA will annually recalculate the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold 
and the Quiet Zone Risk Index. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index for the 
quiet zone rises above the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, FRA 
will notify the Public Authority so that appropriate measures can be 
taken. (See Sec. 222.51(a)).
    6. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index is greater than the Nationwide 
Significant Risk Threshold, then select an appropriate SSM for a 
crossing. Reduce the inflated risk index calculated in Step 4 for that 
crossing by the effectiveness rate of the chosen SSM. (See appendix A 
for the effectiveness rates for the various SSMs). Recalculate the Quiet 
Zone Risk Index by averaging the revised inflated risk index with the 
inflated risk indices for the other public crossings. If this new Quiet 
Zone Risk Index is equal to, or less than, the Nationwide Significant 
Risk Threshold, the quiet zone would qualify for public authority 
designation. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index is still higher than the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, treat another public crossing 
with an appropriate SSM and repeat the process until the Quiet Zone Risk 
Index is equal to, or less than, the Nationwide Significant Risk 
Threshold. Once this result is obtained, the quiet zone will qualify for 
establishment by public authority designation. Early in the quiet zone 
development process, a Notice of Intent should be provided by the public 
authority, which will trigger a 60-day comment period. During this 60-
day comment period, railroads operating within the proposed quiet zone 
and State agencies responsible for grade crossing, highway and road 
safety may provide comments on the proposed quiet zone improvements 
described in the Notice of Intent. Once all the necessary safety 
improvements have been implemented, Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment 
must be provided. With this approach, FRA will annually recalculate the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold and the Quiet Zone Risk Index. If 
the Quiet Zone Risk Index for the quiet zone rises above the Nationwide 
Significant Risk Threshold, FRA

[[Page 330]]

will notify the public authority so that appropriate measures can be 
taken. (See Sec. 222.51(a)).
    7. If the public authority wishes to reduce the risk of the quiet 
zone to the level of risk that would exist if the horn were sounded at 
every crossing within the quiet zone, the public authority should 
calculate the initial Quiet Zone Risk Index as in Step 4. The objective 
is to now reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index to the level of the Risk 
Index with Horns by adding SSMs at the crossings. The difference between 
the Quiet Zone Risk Index and the Risk Index with Horns is the amount of 
risk that will have to be reduced in order to fully compensate for lack 
of the train horn. The use of the Quiet Zone Calculator will aid in 
determining which SSMs may be used to reduce the risk sufficiently. 
Follow the procedure stated in Step 6, except that the Quiet Zone Risk 
Index must be equal to, or less than, the Risk Index with Horns instead 
of the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold. Once this risk level is 
attained, the quiet zone will qualify for establishment by public 
authority designation. Early in the quiet zone development process, a 
Notice of Intent should be provided by the public authority, which will 
trigger a 60-day comment period. During this 60-day comment period, 
railroads operating within the proposed quiet zone and State agencies 
responsible for grade crossing, highway and road safety may provide 
comments on the proposed quiet zone improvements described in the Notice 
of Intent. Once all the necessary safety improvements have been 
implemented, Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment must be provided. One 
important distinction with this option is that the public authority will 
never need to be concerned with the Nationwide Significant Risk 
Threshold or the Quiet Zone Risk Index. The rule's intent is to make the 
quiet zone as safe as if the train horns were sounding. If this is 
accomplished, the public authority may designate the crossings as a 
quiet zone and need not be concerned with possible fluctuations in the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or annual risk reviews.

         C. New Quiet Zones--Public Authority Application to FRA

    A public authority must apply to FRA for approval of a quiet zone 
under three conditions. First, if any of the SSMs selected for the quiet 
zone do not fully conform to the design standards set forth in appendix 
A. These are referred to as modified SSMs in appendix B. Second, when 
programmed law enforcement, public education and awareness programs, or 
photo enforcement is used to reduce risk in the quiet zone, these are 
referred to as non-engineering ASMs in appendix B. It should be 
remembered that non-engineering ASMs will require periodic monitoring as 
long as the quiet zone is in existence. Third, when engineering ASMs are 
used to reduce risk. Please see appendix B for detailed explanations of 
ASMs and the periodic monitoring of non-engineering ASMs.
    The public authority is strongly encouraged to submit the 
application to FRA for review and comment before the appendix B 
treatments are initiated. This will enable FRA to provide comments on 
the proposed ASMs to help guide the application process. If non-
engineering ASMs or engineering ASMs are proposed, the public authority 
also may wish to confirm with FRA that the methodology it plans to use 
to determine the effectiveness rates of the proposed ASMs is 
appropriate. A quiet zone that utilizes a combination of SSMs from 
appendix A and ASMs from appendix B must make a Public Authority 
Application to FRA. A complete and thoroughly documented application 
will help to expedite the approval process.
    The following discussion is meant to provide guidance on the steps 
necessary to establish a new quiet zone using the Public Authority 
Application to FRA method. Once again it should be remembered that all 
public crossings must be equipped with automatic warning devices 
consisting of flashing lights and gates in accordance with Sec. 
222.35(b).
    1. Gather the information previously mentioned in the section on 
``Requirements for both Public Authority Designation and Public 
Authority Application.''
    2. Calculate the risk index for each public crossing as directed in 
Step 2--Public Authority Designation.
    3. Calculate the Crossing Corridor Risk Index, which is also the 
Risk Index with Horns, as directed in Step 3--Public Authority 
Designation.
    4. Calculate the initial Quiet Zone Risk Index as directed in Step 
4--Public Authority Designation.
    5. Begin to reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index through the use of ASMs 
and SSMs. Follow the procedure provided in Step 6--Public Authority 
Designation until the Quiet Zone Risk Index has been reduced to equal 
to, or less than, either the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or 
the Risk Index with Horns. (Remember that the public authority may 
choose which level of risk reduction is the most appropriate for its 
community.) Effectiveness rates for ASMs should be provided as follows:
    a. Modified SSMs--Estimates of effectiveness for modified SSMs may 
be based upon adjustments from the effectiveness rates provided in 
appendix A or from actual field data derived from the crossing sites. 
The application must provide an estimated effectiveness rate and the 
rationale for the estimate.

[[Page 331]]

    b. Non-engineering ASMs--Effectiveness rates are to be calculated in 
accordance with the provisions of appendix B, paragraph II B.
    c. Engineering ASMs--Effectiveness rates are to be calculated in 
accordance with the provisions of appendix B, paragraph III B.
    6. Once it has been determined through analysis that the Quiet Zone 
Risk Index will be reduced to a level equal to, or less than, either the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or the Risk Index with Horns, the 
public authority must provide a Notice of Intent. The mailing of the 
Notice of Intent will trigger a 60-day comment period, during which 
railroads operating within the proposed quiet zone and State agencies 
responsible for grade crossing, highway and road safety may provide 
comments on the proposed quiet zone improvements. After reviewing any 
comments received, the public authority may make application to FRA for 
a quiet zone under Sec. 222.39(b). FRA will review the application to 
determine the appropriateness of the proposed effectiveness rates, and 
whether or not the proposed application demonstrates that the quiet zone 
meets the requirements of the rule. When submitting the application to 
FRA for approval, the application must contain the following (Sec. 
222.39(b)(1)):
    a. Sufficient detail concerning the present safety measures at all 
crossings within the proposed quiet zone. This includes current and 
accurate crossing inventory forms for each public, private, and 
pedestrian grade crossing.
    b. Detailed information on the safety improvements that are proposed 
to be implemented at public, private and pedestrian grade crossings 
within the proposed quiet zone.
    c. Membership and recommendations of the diagnostic team (if any) 
that reviewed the proposed quiet zone.
    d. Statement of efforts taken to address comments submitted by 
affected railroads, the State agency responsible for grade crossing 
safety, and the State agency responsible for highway and road safety, 
including a list of any objections raised by the railroads or State 
agencies.
    e. A commitment to implement the proposed safety measures.
    f. Demonstrate through data and analysis that the proposed measures 
will reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index to a level equal to, or less than, 
either the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or the Risk Index with 
Horns.
    g. A copy of the application must be provided to: All railroads 
operating over the public highway-rail grade crossings within the quiet 
zone; the highway or traffic control or law enforcement authority having 
jurisdiction over vehicular traffic at grade crossings within the quiet 
zone; the landowner having control over any private crossings within the 
quiet zone; the State agency responsible for highway and road safety; 
the State agency responsible for grade crossing safety; and the 
Associate Administrator. (Sec. 222.39(b)(3))
    7. Upon receiving written approval from FRA of the quiet zone 
application, the public authority may then provide the Notice of Quiet 
Zone Establishment and implement the quiet zone. If the quiet zone is 
qualified by reducing the Quiet Zone Risk Index to a level at, or below, 
the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, FRA will annually recalculate 
the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold and the Quiet Zone Risk Index. 
If the Quiet Zone Risk Index for the quiet zone rises above the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, FRA will notify the public 
authority so that appropriate measures can be taken. (See Sec. 
222.51(a))
    Note: The provisions stated above for crossing closures, grade 
separations, wayside horns, pre-existing SSMs and pre-existing modified 
SSMs apply for Public Authority Application to FRA as well.

                    Section III--Pre-Rule Quiet Zones

    Pre-Rule Quiet Zones are treated slightly differently from New Quiet 
Zones in the rule. This is a reflection of the statutory requirement to 
``take into account the interest of communities that have in effect 
restrictions on the sounding of a locomotive horn at highway-rail grade 
crossings. * * *'' (49 U.S.C. 20153(i)) It also recognizes the 
historical experience of train horns not being sounded at Pre-Rule Quiet 
Zones.

                                Overview

    Pre-Rule Quiet Zones that are not established by automatic approval 
(see discussion that follows) must meet the same requirements as New 
Quiet Zones as provided in Sec. 222.39. In other words, risk must be 
reduced through the use of SSMs or ASMs so that the Quiet Zone Risk 
Index for the quiet zone has been reduced to either the risk level which 
would exist if locomotive horns sounded at all crossings in the quiet 
zone (i.e. the Risk Index with Horns) or to a risk level equal to, or 
less than, the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold. There are four 
differences in the requirements between Pre-Rule Quiet Zones and New 
Quiet Zones that must be noted.
    (1) First, since train horns have not been routinely sounded in the 
Pre-Rule Quiet Zone, it is not necessary to increase the risk indices of 
the public crossings to reflect the additional risk caused by the lack 
of a train horn. Since the train horn has already been silenced, the 
added risk caused by the lack of a horn is reflected in the actual 
collision history at the crossings. Collision history is an important 
part in the calculation of the severity risk indices. In other words, 
the Quiet Zone Risk Index is calculated by averaging

[[Page 332]]

the existing risk index for each public crossing without the need to 
increase the risk index by 66.8%. For Pre-Rule Quiet Zones, the Crossing 
Corridor Risk Index and the initial Quiet Zone Risk Index have the same 
value.
    (2) Second, since train horns have been silenced at the crossings, 
it will be necessary to mathematically determine what the risk level 
would have been at the crossings if train horns had been routinely 
sounded. These revised risk levels then will be used to calculate the 
Risk Index with Horns. This calculation is necessary to determine how 
much risk must be eliminated in order to compensate for the lack of the 
train horn. This will allow the public authority to have the choice to 
reduce the risk to at least the level of the Nationwide Significant Risk 
Threshold or to fully compensate for the lack of the train horn.
    To calculate the Risk Index with Horns, the first step is to divide 
the existing severity risk index for each crossing by the appropriate 
value as shown in Table 1. This process eliminates the risk that was 
caused by the absence of train horns. The table takes into account that 
the train horn has been found to produce different levels of 
effectiveness in preventing collisions depending on the type of warning 
device at the crossing. (Note: FRA's web-based Quiet Zone Calculator 
will perform this computation automatically for Pre-Rule Quiet Zones.) 
The Risk Index with Horns is the average of the revised risk indices. 
The difference between the calculated Risk Index with Horns and the 
Quiet Zone Risk Index is the amount of risk that would have to be 
reduced in order to fully compensate for the lack of train horns.

                   Table 1--Risk Index Divisor Values
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                   Flashing    Lights  &
                                        Passive     lights       gates
------------------------------------------------------------------------
U.S.................................      1.749       1.309       1.668
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) The third difference is that credit is given for the risk 
reduction that is brought about through the upgrading of the warning 
devices at public crossings (Sec. 222.35(b)(3)). For New Quiet Zones, 
all crossings must be equipped with automatic warning devices consisting 
of flashing lights and gates. Crossings without gates must have gates 
installed. The severity risk index for that crossing is then calculated 
to establish the risk index that is used in the Risk Index with Horns. 
The Risk Index with Horns is then increased by 66.8% to adjust for the 
lack of the train horn. The adjusted figure is the initial Quiet Zone 
Risk Index. There is no credit received for the risk reduction that is 
attributable to warning device upgrades in New Quiet Zones.
    For Pre-Rule Quiet Zones, the Risk Index with Horns is calculated 
from the initial risk indices which use the warning devices that are 
currently installed. If a public authority elects to upgrade an existing 
warning device as part of its quiet zone plan, the accident prediction 
value for that crossing will be re-calculated based on the upgraded 
warning device. (Once again, FRA's web-based Quiet Zone Calculator can 
do the actual computation.) The new accident prediction value is then 
used in the severity risk index formula to determine the risk index for 
the crossing. This adjusted risk index is then used to compute the new 
Quiet Zone Risk Index. This computation allows the risk reduction 
attributed to the warning device upgrades to be used in establishing a 
quiet zone.
    (4) The fourth difference is that Pre-Rule Quiet Zones have 
different minimum requirements under Sec. 222.35. A Pre-Rule Quiet Zone 
may be less than one-half mile in length if that was its length as of 
October 9, 1996 (Sec. 222.35(a)(2)). A Pre-Rule Quiet Zone does not 
have to have automatic warning devices consisting of flashing lights and 
gates at every public crossing (Sec. 222.35(b)(3)). The existing 
crossing safety warning systems in place as of December 18, 2003 may be 
retained but cannot be downgraded. It also is not necessary for the 
automatic warning devices to be equipped with constant warning time 
devices or power out indicators; however, when the warning devices are 
upgraded, constant warning time and power out indicators will be 
required if reasonably practical (Sec. 222.35(b)(3)). Advance warning 
signs that notify the motorist that train horns are not sounded do not 
have to be installed on each approach to public, private, and pedestrian 
grade crossings within the quiet zone until June 24, 2008. (Sec. Sec. 
222.27(d) and 222.35(c)) Similarly, STOP signs and crossbucks do not 
have to be installed on each approach to private crossings within the 
quiet zone until June 24, 2008. (Sec. 222.25(c)).

    A. Requirements for Both Public Authority Designation and Public 
               Authority Application--Pre-Rule Quiet Zones

    The following is necessary when establishing a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone. 
This information pertains to Automatic Approval, the Public Authority 
Designation and Public Authority Application to FRA methods.
    1. Determine all public, private and pedestrian at-grade crossings 
that will be included within the quiet zone. Also determine any existing 
grade separated crossings that fall within the quiet zone. Each crossing 
must be identified by the U.S. DOT Crossing Inventory number and street 
name. If a crossing does not have a U.S. DOT crossing number, then 
contact FRA for assistance.
    2. Document the length of the quiet zone. It is not necessary that 
the quiet zone be at least one-half mile in length. Pre-Rule Quiet

[[Page 333]]

Zones may be shorter than one-half mile. However, the addition of a new 
crossing that is not a part of an existing Pre-Rule Quiet Zone to a 
quiet zone nullifies its pre-rule status, and the resulting New Quiet 
Zone must be at least one-half mile. The deletion of a crossing from a 
Pre-Rule Quiet Zone (except through closure or grade separation) must 
result in a quiet zone that is at least one-half mile in length. It is 
the intent of the rule to allow adjacent Pre-Rule Quiet Zones to be 
combined into one large pre-rule quiet zone if the respective public 
authorities desire to do so. (Sec. 222.35(a)(2))
    3. A complete and accurate Grade Crossing Inventory Form must be on 
file with FRA for all crossings (public, private and pedestrian) within 
the quiet zone. An inspection of each crossing in the proposed quiet 
zone should be performed and the Grade Crossing Inventory Forms updated, 
as necessary, to reflect the current conditions at each crossing.
    4. Pre-Rule Quiet Zones must retain, and may upgrade, the existing 
grade crossing safety warning systems. Unlike New Quiet Zones, it is not 
necessary that every public crossing within a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone be 
equipped with active warning devices comprising both flashing lights and 
gates. Existing warning devices need not be equipped with power out 
indicators and constant warning time circuitry. If warning devices are 
upgraded to flashing lights, or flashing lights and gates, the upgraded 
equipment must include, as is required for New Quiet Zones, power out 
indicators and constant warning time devices (if reasonably practical). 
(Sec. 222.35(b)(3))
    5. By June 24, 2008, private crossings must have cross-bucks and 
``STOP'' signs on both approaches to the crossing. (Sec. 222.25(c))
    6. By June 24, 2008, each approach to a public, private, and 
pedestrian crossing must be equipped with an advance warning sign that 
conforms to the MUTCD and advises pedestrians and motorists that train 
horns are not sounded at the crossing. (Sec. Sec. 222.27(d), 222.35(c))
    7. It will be necessary for the public authority to provide a Notice 
of Quiet Zone Continuation in order to prevent the resumption of 
locomotive horn sounding when the rule becomes effective. A detailed 
discussion of the requirements of Sec. 222.43(c) is provided in Section 
IV of this appendix. The Notice of Quiet Zone Continuation must be 
provided to the appropriate parties by all Pre-Rule Quiet Zones that 
have not established quiet zones by automatic approval. This should be 
done no later than June 3, 2005 to ensure that train horns will not 
start being sounded on June 24, 2005. A Pre-Rule Quiet Zone may provide 
a Notice of Quiet Zone Continuation before it has determined whether or 
not it qualifies for automatic approval. Once it has been determined 
that the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone will be established by automatic approval, 
the Public Authority must provide the Notice of Quiet Zone 
Establishment. This must be accomplished no later than December 24, 
2005. If the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone will not be established by automatic 
approval, the Notice of Quiet Zone Continuation will enable the train 
horns to be silenced until June 24, 2008. (Please refer to Sec. 
222.41(c) for more information.)

               B. Pre-Rule Quiet Zones--Automatic Approval

    In order for a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone to be established under this rule 
(Sec. 222.41(a)), one of the following conditions must be met:
    a. One or more SSMs as identified in appendix A are installed at 
each public crossing in the quiet zone;
    b. The Quiet Zone Risk Index is equal to, or less than, the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold;
    c. The Quiet Zone Risk Index is above the Nationwide Significant 
Risk Threshold but less than twice the Nationwide Significant Risk 
Threshold and there have been no relevant collisions at any public grade 
crossing within the quiet zone for the preceding five years; or
    d. The Quiet Zone Risk Index is equal to, or less than, the Risk 
Index With Horns.
    Additionally, the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone must be in compliance with the 
minimum requirements for quiet zones (Sec. 222.35) and the notification 
requirements in Sec. 222.43.
    The following discussion is meant to provide guidance on the steps 
necessary to determine if a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone qualifies for automatic 
approval.
    1. All of the items listed in Requirements for Both Public Authority 
Designation and Public Authority Application--Pre-Rule Quiet Zones 
previously mentioned are to be accomplished. Remember that a Pre-Rule 
Quiet Zone may be less than one-half mile in length if that was its 
length as of October 9, 1996. Also, a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone does not have 
to have automatic warning devices consisting of flashing lights and 
gates at every public crossing.
    2. If one or more SSMs as identified in appendix A are installed at 
each public crossing in the quiet zone, the quiet zone qualifies and the 
public authority may provide the Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment. If 
the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone does not qualify by this step, proceed on to the 
next step.
    3. Calculate the risk index for each public crossing within the 
quiet zone (See appendix D.) Be sure that the risk index is calculated 
using the formula appropriate for the type of warning device that is 
actually installed at the crossing. Unlike New Quiet Zones, it is not 
necessary to calculate the risk index using flashing lights and gates as 
the warning device at every public crossing. (FRA's web-based Quiet Zone 
Calculator may be used to simplify the calculation process). If

[[Page 334]]

the Inventory record does not reflect the actual conditions at the 
crossing, be sure to use the conditions that currently exist when 
calculating the risk index.
    4. The Quiet Zone Risk Index is then calculated by averaging the 
risk index for each public crossing within the proposed quiet zone. 
(Note: The initial Quiet Zone Risk Index and the Crossing Corridor Risk 
Index are the same for Pre-Rule Quiet Zones.)
    5. Compare the Quiet Zone Risk Index to the Nationwide Significant 
Risk Threshold. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index is equal to, or less than, 
the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, then the quiet zone 
qualifies, and the public authority may provide the Notice of Quiet Zone 
Establishment. With this approach, FRA will annually recalculate the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold and the Quiet Zone Risk. If the 
Quiet Zone Risk Index for the quiet zone is found to be above the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, FRA will notify the public 
authority so that appropriate measures can be taken (See Sec. 
222.51(b)). If the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone is not established by this step, 
proceed on to the next step.
    6. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index is above the Nationwide Significant 
Risk Threshold but less than twice the Nationwide Significant Risk 
Threshold and there have been no relevant collisions at any public grade 
crossing within the quiet zone for the preceding five years, then the 
quiet zone qualifies for automatic approval. However, in order to 
qualify on this basis, the public authority must provide a Notice of 
Quiet Zone Establishment by December 24, 2005. (Note: A relevant 
collision means a collision at a highway-rail grade crossing between a 
train and a motor vehicle, excluding the following: a collision 
resulting from an activation failure of an active grade crossing warning 
system; a collision in which there is no driver in the motor vehicle; or 
a collision where the highway vehicle struck the side of the train 
beyond the fourth locomotive unit or rail car.) With this approach, FRA 
will annually recalculate the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold and 
the Quiet Zone Risk. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index for the quiet zone is 
above two times the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, or a relevant 
collision has occurred during the preceding year, FRA will notify the 
public authority so that appropriate measures can be taken (See Sec. 
222.51(b)).
    If the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone is not established by automatic approval, 
continuation of the quiet zone may require implementation of SSMs or 
ASMs to reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index for the quiet zone to a risk 
level equal to, or below, either the risk level which would exist if 
locomotive horns sounded at all crossings in the quiet zone (i.e. the 
Risk Index with Horns) or the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold. 
This is the same methodology used to create New Quiet Zones with the 
exception of the four differences previously noted. A review of the 
previous discussion on the two methods used to establish quiet zones may 
prove helpful in determining which would be the most beneficial to use 
for a particular Pre-Rule Quiet Zone.

          C. Pre-Rule Quiet Zones--Public Authority Designation

    The following discussion is meant to provide guidance on the steps 
necessary to establish a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone using the Public Authority 
Designation method.
    1. The public authority must provide a Notice of Intent (Sec. Sec. 
222.43(a)(1) and 222.43(b)) to the railroads that operate within the 
proposed quiet zone, the State agency responsible for highway and road 
safety and the State agency responsible for grade crossing safety. This 
notice must be mailed by February 24, 2008, in order to continue 
existing locomotive horn restrictions beyond June 24, 2008 without 
interruption. The purpose of this Notice of Intent is to provide an 
opportunity for the railroads and the State agencies to provide comments 
and recommendations to the public authority as it is planning the quiet 
zone. They will have 60 days to provide these comments to the public 
authority. The Notice of Intent must be provided, if new SSMs or ASMs 
will be implemented within the quiet zone. FRA encourages public 
authorities to provide the required Notice of Intent early in the quiet 
zone development process. The railroads and State agencies can provide 
an expertise that very well may not be present within the public 
authority. FRA believes that it will be very useful to include these 
organizations in the planning process. For example, including them in 
the inspections of the crossing will help ensure accurate Inventory 
information for the crossings. Note: Please see Section IV for details 
on the requirements of a Notice of Intent.
    2. All of the items listed in ``Requirements for Both Public 
Authority Designation and Public Authority Application--Pre-Rule Quiet 
Zones'' previously mentioned are to be accomplished. Remember that a 
Pre-Rule Quiet Zone may be less than one-half mile in length if that was 
its length as of October 9, 1996. Also, a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone does not 
have to have automatic warning devices consisting of flashing lights and 
gates at every public crossing.
    3. Calculate the risk index for each public crossing within the 
quiet zone as in Step 3--Pre-Rule Quiet Zones--Automatic Approval.
    4. The Crossing Corridor Risk Index is then calculated by averaging 
the risk index for each public crossing within the proposed quiet zone. 
Since train horns are not being sounded for crossings, this value is 
actually the initial Quiet Zone Risk Index.
    5. Calculate Risk Index with Horns by the following:

[[Page 335]]

    a. For each public crossing, divide the risk index that was 
calculated in Step 2 by the appropriate value in Table 1. This produces 
the risk index that would have existed had the train horn been sounded.
    b. Average these reduced risk indices together. The resulting 
average is the Risk Index with Horns.
    6. Begin to reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index through the use of SSMs 
or by upgrading existing warning devices. Follow the procedure provided 
in Step 6--Public Authority Designation until the Quiet Zone Risk Index 
has been reduced to a level equal to, or less than, either the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or the Risk Index with Horns. A 
public authority may elect to upgrade an existing warning device as part 
of its Pre-Rule Quiet Zone plan. When upgrading a warning device, the 
accident prediction value for that crossing must be re-calculated for 
the new warning device. Determine the new risk index for the upgraded 
crossing by using the new accident prediction value in the severity risk 
index formula. This new risk index is then used to compute the new Quiet 
Zone Risk Index. (Remember that FRA's web-based Quiet Zone Calculator 
will be able to do the actual computations.) Once the Quiet Zone Risk 
Index has been reduced to a level equal to, or less than, either the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or the Risk Index with Horns, the 
quiet zone may be established by the Public Authority Designation 
method, and the public authority may provide the Notice of Quiet Zone 
Establishment once all the necessary improvements have been installed. 
If the quiet zone is established by reducing the Quiet Zone Risk Index 
to a risk level equal to, or less than, the Nationwide Significant Risk 
Threshold, FRA will annually recalculate the Nationwide Significant Risk 
Threshold and the Quiet Zone Risk Index. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index 
for the quiet zone rises above the Nationwide Significant Risk 
Threshold, FRA will notify the public authority so that appropriate 
measures can be taken (See Sec. 222.51(b)).
    7. If the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone will not be established before June 
24, 2008, the public authority must file a detailed plan for quiet zone 
improvements with the Associate Administrator by June 24, 2008. By 
providing a Notice of Intent (see Step 1 above) and a detailed plan for 
quiet zone improvements, existing locomotive horn restrictions may 
continue until June 24, 2010. (If a comprehensive State-wide 
implementation plan and funding commitment are also provided and safety 
improvements are initiated within at least one Pre-Rule Quiet Zone or 
Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone, existing locomotive horn restrictions may 
continue until June 24, 2013.) (See Sec. 222.41(c) for more 
information.)

    Note: The provisions stated above for crossing closures, grade 
separations, wayside horns, pre-existing SSMs and pre-existing modified 
SSMs apply for Public Authority Application to FRA as well.

      D. Pre-Rule Quiet Zones--Public Authority Application to FRA

    The following discussion is meant to provide guidance on the steps 
necessary to establish a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone using the Public Authority 
Application to FRA method.
    1. The public authority must provide a Notice of Intent (Sec. Sec. 
222.43(a)(1) and 222.43(b)) to the railroads that operate within the 
proposed quiet zone, the State agency responsible for highway and road 
safety and the State agency responsible for grade crossing safety. This 
notice must be mailed by February 24, 2008, in order to continue 
existing locomotive horn restrictions beyond June 24, 2008 without 
interruption. The purpose of this Notice of Intent is to provide an 
opportunity for the railroads and the State agencies to provide comments 
and recommendations to the public authority as it is planning the quiet 
zone. They will have 60 days to provide these comments to the public 
authority. The Notice of Intent must be provided, if new SSMs or ASMs 
will be implemented within the quiet zone. FRA encourages public 
authorities to provide the required Notice of Intent early in the quiet 
zone development process. The railroads and State agencies can provide 
an expertise that very well may not be present within the public 
authority. FRA believes that it will be very useful to include these 
organizations in the planning process. For example, including them in 
the inspections of the crossing will help ensure accurate Inventory 
information for the crossings. Note: Please see Section IV for details 
on the requirements of a Notice of Detailed Plan.
    2. All of the items listed in ``Requirements for both Public 
Authority Designation and Public Authority Application--Pre-Rule Quiet 
Zones'' previously mentioned are to be accomplished. Remember that a 
Pre-Rule Quiet Zone may be less than one-half mile in length if that was 
its length as of October 9, 1996. Also, a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone does not 
have to have automatic warning devices consisting of flashing lights and 
gates at every public crossing.
    3. Calculate the risk index for each public crossing within the 
quiet zone (See appendix D. FRA's web-based Quiet Zone Calculator may be 
used to simplify the calculation process). If the Inventory record does 
not reflect the actual conditions at the crossing, be sure to use the 
conditions that currently exist when calculating the risk index.
    4. The Crossing Corridor Risk Index is then calculated by averaging 
the risk index for each public crossing within the proposed quiet zone. 
Since train horns are not being sounded for crossings, this value is 
actually the initial Quiet Zone Risk Index.

[[Page 336]]

    5. Calculate Risk Index with Horns by the following:
    a. For each public crossing, divide its risk index that was 
calculated in Step 2 by the appropriate value in Table 1. This produces 
the risk index that would have existed had the train horn been sounded.
    b. Average these reduced risk indices together. The resulting 
average is the Risk Index with Horns.
    6. Begin to reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index through the use of ASMs 
and/or SSMs. Follow the procedure provided in Step 6--New Quiet Zones 
Public Authority Designation--until the Quiet Zone Risk Index has been 
reduced to a level equal to, or less than, either the Nationwide 
Significant Risk Threshold or the Risk Index with Horns. A public 
authority may elect to upgrade an existing warning device as part of its 
Pre-Rule Quiet Zone plan. When upgrading a warning device, the accident 
prediction value for that crossing must be re-calculated for the new 
warning device. Determine the new risk index for the upgraded crossing 
by using the new accident prediction value in the severity risk index 
formula. (Remember that FRA's web-based quiet zone risk calculator will 
be able to do the actual computations.) This new risk index is then used 
to compute the new Quiet Zone Risk Index. Effectiveness rates for ASMs 
should be provided as follows:
    a. Modified SSMs--Estimates of effectiveness for modified SSMs may 
be based upon adjustments from the benchmark levels provided in appendix 
A or from actual field data derived from the crossing sites. The 
application must provide an estimated effectiveness rate and the 
rationale for the estimate.
    b. Non-engineering ASMs--Effectiveness rates are to be calculated in 
accordance with the provisions of appendix B, section II B.
    c. Engineering ASMs--Effectiveness rates are to be calculated in 
accordance with the provisions of appendix B, section III B.
    7. Once it has been determined through analysis that the Quiet Zone 
Risk Index will be reduced to a level equal to, or less than, either the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or the Risk Index with Horns, the 
public authority may make application to FRA for a quiet zone under 
Sec. 222.39(b). FRA will review the application to determine the 
appropriateness of the proposed effectiveness rates, and whether or not 
the proposed application demonstrates that the quiet zone meets the 
requirements of the rule. When submitting the application to FRA for 
approval, it should be remembered that the application must contain the 
following (Sec. 222.39(b)(1)):
    a. Sufficient detail concerning the present safety measures at all 
crossings within the proposed quiet zone to enable the Associate 
Administrator to evaluate their effectiveness. This includes current and 
accurate crossing Inventory forms for each public, private and 
pedestrian grade crossing.
    b. Detailed information on the safety improvements, including 
upgraded warning devices that are proposed to be implemented at public, 
private, and pedestrian grade crossings within the proposed quiet zone.
    c. Membership and recommendations of the diagnostic team (if any) 
that reviewed the proposed quiet zone.
    d. Statement of efforts taken to address comments submitted by 
affected railroads, the State agency responsible for grade crossing 
safety, and the State agency responsible for highway and road safety, 
including a list of any objections raised by the railroads or State 
agencies.
    e. A commitment to implement the proposed safety measures.
    f. Demonstrate through data and analysis that the proposed measures 
will reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index to a level at, or below, either 
the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or the Risk Index with Horns.
    g. A copy of the application must be provided to all railroads 
operating over the public highway-rail grade crossings within the quiet 
zone; the highway or traffic control or law enforcement authority having 
jurisdiction over vehicular traffic at grade crossings within the quiet 
zone; the landowner having control over any private crossings within the 
quiet zone; the State agency responsible for highway and road safety; 
the State agency responsible for grade crossing safety; and the 
Associate Administrator. (Sec. 222.39(b)(3))
    8. Upon receiving written approval from FRA of the quiet zone 
application, the public authority may then provide the Notice of Quiet 
Zone Establishment and implement the quiet zone. If the quiet zone is 
established by reducing the Quiet Zone Risk Index to a level equal to, 
or less than, the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, FRA will 
annually recalculate the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold and the 
Quiet Zone Risk. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index for the quiet zone is 
above the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, FRA will notify the 
public authority so that appropriate measures can be taken (See Sec. 
222.51(b)).

    Note: The provisions stated above for crossing closures, grade 
separations, wayside horns, pre-existing SSMs and pre-existing modified 
SSMs apply for Public Authority Application to FRA as well.

                   Section IV--Required Notifications

                             A. Introduction

    The public authority is responsible for providing notification to 
parties that will be affected by the quiet zone. There are several 
different types of notifications and a public authority may have to make 
more than one notification during the entire process of

[[Page 337]]

complying with the regulation. The notification process is to ensure 
that interested parties are made aware in a timely manner of the 
establishment or continuation of quiet zones. It will also provide an 
opportunity for State agencies and affected railroads to provide input 
to the public authority during the development of quiet zones. Specific 
information is to be provided so that the crossings in the quiet zone 
can be identified. Providing the appropriate notification is important 
because once the rule becomes effective, railroads will be obligated to 
sound train horns when approaching all public crossings unless notified 
in accordance with the rule that a New Quiet Zone has been established 
or that a Pre-Rule or Intermediate Quiet Zone is being continued.

                  B. Notice of Intent--Sec. 222.43(b)

    The purpose of the Notice of Intent is to provide notice to the 
railroads and State agencies that the public authority is planning on 
creating a New Quiet Zone or implementing new SSMs or ASMs within a Pre-
Rule Quiet Zone. The Notice of Intent provides an opportunity for the 
railroad and the State agencies to give input to the public authority 
during the quiet zone development process. The State agencies and 
railroads will be given sixty days to provide information and comments 
to the public agency.
    The Notice of Intent must be provided under the following 
circumstances:
    1. A New Quiet Zone or New Partial Quiet Zone is under 
consideration.
    2. An Intermediate Quiet Zone or Intermediate Partial Quiet Zone 
that will be converted into a New Quiet Zone or New Partial Quiet Zone. 
Please note that Notice of Intent must be mailed by April 3, 2006, in 
order prevent the resumption of locomotive horn sounding on June 24, 
2006.
    3. The implementation of SSMs or ASMs within a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone 
or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone is under consideration. Please note that 
Notice of Intent must be mailed by February 24, 2008, in order to 
continue existing restrictions on locomotive horn sounding beyond June 
24, 2008 without interruption. Each public authority that is creating a 
New Quiet Zone must provide written notice, by certified mail, return 
receipt requested, to the following:
    1. All railroads operating within the proposed quiet zone
    2. State agency responsible for highway and road safety
    3. State agency responsible for grade crossing safety
    The Notice of Intent must contain the following information:
    1. A list of each public highway-rail grade crossing, private 
highway-rail grade crossing, and pedestrian crossings within the 
proposed quiet zone. The crossings are to be identified by both the U.S. 
DOT Crossing Inventory Number and the street or highway name.
    2. A statement of the time period within which the restrictions 
would be in effect on the routine sounding of train horns (i.e., 24 
hours or from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m.).
    3. A brief explanation of the public authority's tentative plans for 
implementing improvements within the proposed quiet zone.
    4. The name and title of the person who will act as the point of 
contact during the quiet zone development process and how that person 
can be contacted.
    5. A list of the names and addresses of each party that will receive 
a copy of the Notice of Intent.
    The parties that receive the Notice of Intent will be able to submit 
information or comments to the public authority for 60 days. The public 
authority will not be able to establish the quiet zone during the 60 day 
comment period unless each railroad and State agency that receives the 
Notice of Intent provides either written comments to the public 
authority or a written statement waiving its right to provide comments 
on the Notice of Intent. The public authority must provide an 
affirmation in the Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment that each of the 
required parties was provided the Notice of Intent and the date it was 
mailed. If the quiet zone is being established within 60 days of the 
mailing of the Notice of Intent, the public authority also must affirm 
each of the parties have provided written comments or waived its right 
to provide comments on the Notice of Intent.

          C. Notice of Quiet Zone Continuation--Sec. 222.43(c)

    The purpose of the Notice of Quiet Zone Continuation is to provide a 
means for the public authority to formally advise affected parties that 
an existing quiet zone is being continued after the effective date of 
the rule. All Pre-Rule, Pre-Rule Partial, Intermediate and Intermediate 
Partial Quiet Zones must provide this Notice of Quiet Zone Continuation 
no later than June 3, 2005 to ensure that train horns are not sounded at 
public crossings when the rule becomes effective on June 24, 2005. This 
will enable railroads to properly comply with the requirements of the 
Final Rule.
    Each public authority that is continuing an existing Pre-Rule, Pre-
Rule Partial, Intermediate and Intermediate Partial Quiet Zone must 
provide written notice, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to 
the following:
    1. All railroads operating over the public highway-rail grade 
crossings within the quiet zone;
    2. The highway or traffic control or law enforcement authority 
having jurisdiction over

[[Page 338]]

vehicular traffic at grade crossings within the quiet zone;
    3. The landowner having control over any private crossings within 
the quiet zone;
    4. The State agency responsible for highway and road safety;
    5. The State agency responsible for grade crossing safety; and
    6. The Associate Administrator.
    The Notice of Quiet Zone Continuation must contain the following 
information:
    1. A list of each public highway-rail grade crossing, private 
highway-rail grade crossing, and pedestrian crossing within the quiet 
zone, identified by both U.S. DOT National Highway-Rail Grade Crossing 
Inventory Number and street or highway name.
    2. A specific reference to the regulatory provision that provides 
the basis for quiet zone continuation, citing as appropriate, Sec. 
222.41 or 222.42.
    3. A statement of the time period within which restrictions on the 
routine sounding of the locomotive horn will be imposed (i.e., 24 hours 
or nighttime hours only.)
    4. An accurate and complete Grade Crossing Inventory Form for each 
public highway-rail grade crossing, private highway-rail grade crossing, 
and pedestrian crossing within the quiet zone that reflects conditions 
currently existing at the crossing.
    5. The name and title of the person responsible for monitoring 
compliance with the requirements of this part and the manner in which 
that person can be contacted.
    6. A list of the names and addresses of each party that will receive 
the Notice of Quiet Zone Continuation.
    7. A statement signed by the chief executive officer of each public 
authority participating in the continuation of the quiet zone, in which 
the chief executive officer certifies that the information submitted by 
the public authority is accurate and complete to the best of his/her 
knowledge and belief.
    Public authorities should remember that this notice is required to 
ensure that train horns will remain silent. Even if a public authority 
has not been able to determine whether its Pre-Rule or Pre-Rule Partial 
Quiet Zone qualifies for automatic approval under the rule, it should 
issue a Notice of Quiet Zone Continuation to keep the train horns silent 
after the effective date of the rule.

         E. Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment--Sec. 222.43(d)

    The purpose of the Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment is to provide 
a means for the public authority to formally advise affected parties 
that a quiet zone is being established. Notice of Quiet Zone 
Establishment must be provided under the following circumstances:
    1. A New Quiet Zone or New Partial Quiet Zone is being created.
    2. A Pre-Rule Quiet Zone or a Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone that 
qualifies for automatic approval under the rule is being established.
    3. An Intermediate Quiet Zone or Intermediate Partial Quiet Zone 
that is creating a New Quiet Zone under the rule. Please note that 
Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment must be provided by June 3, 2006, in 
order to prevent the resumption of locomotive horn sounding on June 24, 
2006.
    4. A Pre-Rule Quiet Zone or a Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone that was 
not established by automatic approval and has since implemented 
improvements to establish a quiet zone in accordance to the rule.

    Each public authority that is establishing a quiet zone under the 
above circumstances must provide written notice, by certified mail, 
return receipt requested, to the following:
    1. All railroads operating over the public highway-rail grade 
crossings within the quiet zone;
    2. The highway or traffic control or law enforcement authority 
having jurisdiction over vehicular traffic at grade crossings within the 
quiet zone;
    3. The landowner having control over any private crossings within 
the quiet zone;
    4. The State agency responsible for highway and road safety;
    5. The State agency responsible for grade crossing safety; and
    6. The Associate Administrator.

    The Notice of Quiet Establishment must contain the following 
information:

            Section V--Examples of Quiet Zone Implementations

                        Example 1--New Quiet Zone

    (a) A public authority wishes to create a New Quiet Zone over four 
public crossings. All of the crossings are equipped with flashing lights 
and gates, and the length of the quiet zone is 0.75 mile. There are no 
private crossings within the proposed zone.
    (b) The tables that follow show the street name in the first column, 
and the existing risk index for each crossing with the horn sounding 
(``Crossing Risk Index w/ Horns'') in the second. The third column, 
``Crossing Risk Index w/o Horns'', is the risk index for each crossing 
after it has been inflated by 66.8% to account for the lack of train 
horns. The fourth column, ``SSM Eff'', is the effectiveness of the SSM 
at the crossing. A zero indicates that no SSM has been applied. The last 
column, ``Crossing Risk Index w/o Horns Plus SSM'', is the inflated risk 
index for the crossing after being reduced by the implementation of the 
SSM. At the bottom of the table are two values. The first is the Risk 
Index with Horns (``RIWH'') which represents the average initial amount 
of risk in the proposed quiet zone with the train horn sounding. The 
second is the Quiet Zone Risk Index (``QZRI''), which is the average 
risk in the proposed quiet zone taking into consideration the increased 
risk caused by the lack of train horns and the reductions in risk 
attributable to the installation of SSMs. For this example it is assumed 
that the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold is 17,030. In order for 
the proposed quiet zone to qualify under the rule, the Quiet Zone Risk 
Index must be reduced to a level at, or below, the Nationwide 
Significant Risk Threshold (17,030) or the Risk Index with Horns.
    (c) Table 2 shows the existing conditions in the proposed quiet 
zone. SSMs have not yet been installed. The Risk Index with Horns for 
the proposed quiet zone is 11,250. The Quiet Zone Risk Index without any 
SSMs is 18,765.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) The public authority decides to install traffic channelization 
devices at D Street. Reducing the risk at the crossing that has the 
highest severity risk index will provide the greatest reduction in risk. 
The effectiveness of traffic channelization devices is 0.75. Table 3 
shows the changes in the proposed quiet zone corridor that would occur 
when traffic channelization devices are installed at D Street. The Quiet 
Zone Risk Index has been reduced to 14,073.75. This reduction in risk 
would qualify the quiet zone as the risk has been reduced lower than the 
Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold which is 17,030.

    (e) The public authority realizes that reducing the Quiet Zone Risk 
Index to a level below the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold will 
result in an annual re-calculation of the Quiet Zone Risk Index and 
comparison to the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold. As the Quiet 
Zone Risk Index is close to the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold 
(14,074 to 17,030), there is a reasonable chance that the Quiet Zone 
Risk Index may some day exceed the Nationwide Significant Risk 
Threshold. This would result in the quiet zone no longer being qualified 
and additional steps would have to be taken to keep the quiet zone. 
Therefore, the public authority decides to reduce the risk further by 
the use of traffic channelization devices at A Street. Table 4 shows the 
results of this change. The Quiet Zone Risk Index is now 10,320.75 which 
is less than the Risk Index with Horns of 11,250. The quiet zone now 
qualifies by fully compensating for the loss of train horns and will not 
have to undergo annual reviews of the Quiet Zone Risk Index.

                     Example 2--Pre-Rule Quiet Zone

    (a) A public authority wishes to qualify a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone which 
did not meet the requirements for Automatic Approval because the Quiet 
Zone Risk Index is greater than twice the Nationwide Significant Risk 
Threshold. There are four public crossings in the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone. 
Three of the crossings are equipped with flashing lights and gates, and 
the fourth (Z Street) is passively signed with a STOP sign. The length 
of the

[[Page 341]]

quiet zone is 0.6 mile, and there are no private crossings within the 
proposed zone.
    (b) The tables that follow are very similar to the tables in Example 
1. The street name is shown in the first column, and the existing risk 
index for each crossing (``Crossing Risk Index w/o Horns'') in the 
second. This is a change from the first example because the risk is 
calculated without train horns sounding because of the existing ban on 
whistles. The third column, ``Crossing Risk Index w/ Horns'', is the 
risk index for each crossing after it has been adjusted to reflect what 
the risk would have been had train horns been sounding. This is 
mathematically done by dividing the existing risk index for the three 
gated crossing by 1.668. The risk at the passive crossing at Z Street is 
divided by 1.749. (See the above discussion in ``Pre-Rule Quiet Zones--
Establishment Overview'' for more information.) The fourth column, ``SSM 
Eff'', is the effectiveness of the SSM at the crossing. A zero indicates 
that no SSM has been applied. The last column, ``Crossing Risk Index w/o 
Horns Plus SSM'', is the risk index without horns for the crossing after 
being reduced for the implementation of the SSM. At the bottom of the 
table are two values. The first is the Risk Index with Horns (RIWH), 
which represents the average initial amount of risk in the proposed 
quiet zone with the train horn sounding. The second is the Quiet Zone 
Risk Index (``QZRI''), which is the average risk in the proposed quiet 
zone taking into consideration the increased risk caused by the lack of 
train horns and reductions in risk attributable to the installation of 
SSMs. Once again it is assumed that the Nationwide Significant Risk 
Threshold is 17,030. The Quiet Zone Risk Index must be reduced to either 
the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold (17,030) or to the Risk Index 
with Horns in order to qualify under the rule.
    (c) Table 5 shows the existing conditions in the proposed quiet 
zone. SSMs have not yet been installed. The Risk Index with Horns for 
the proposed quiet zone is 18,705.83. The Quiet Zone Risk Index without 
any SSMs is 31,375. Since the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold is 
less than the calculated Risk Index with Horns, the public authority's 
goal will be to reduce the risk to at least value of the Risk Index with 
Horns. This will qualify the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone under the rule.

    (d) The Z Street crossing is scheduled to have flashing lights and 
gates installed as part of the state's highway-rail grade crossing 
safety improvement plan (Section 130). While this upgrade is not 
directly a part of the plan to authorize a quiet zone, the public 
authority may take credit for the risk reduction achieved by the 
improvement from a passive STOP sign crossing to a crossing equipped 
with flashing lights and gates. Unlike New Quiet Zones, upgrades to 
warning devices in Pre-Rule Quiet Zones do contribute to the risk 
reduction necessary to qualify under the rule. Table 6 shows the quiet 
zone corridor after including the warning device upgrade at Z Street. 
The Quiet Zone Risk Index has been reduced to 29,500.

    (e) The public authority elects to install four-quadrant gates 
without vehicle presence detection at X Street. As shown in Table 7, 
this reduces the Quiet Zone Risk Index to 20,890. This risk reduction is 
not sufficient to quality as quiet zone under the rule.

    (f) The public authority next decides to use traffic channelization 
devices at W Street. Table 8 shows that the Quiet Zone Risk Index is now 
reduced to 14,327.5. This risk reduction fully compensates for the loss 
of the train horn as it is less than the Risk Index with Horns. The 
quiet zone is qualified under the rule.

<R05>
          Sec. Appendix D to Part 222--Determining Risk Levels

                              Introduction

    The Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, the Crossing Corridor 
Risk Index, and the Quiet Zone Risk Index are all measures of collision 
risk at public highway-rail grade crossings that are weighted by the 
severity of the associated casualties. Each crossing can be assigned a 
risk index.
    (a) The Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold represents the average 
severity weighted collision risk for all public highway-rail grade 
crossings equipped with lights and gates nationwide where train horns 
are routinely sounded. FRA developed this index to serve as a threshold 
of permissible risk for quiet zones established under this rule.
    (b) The Crossing Corridor Risk Index represents the average severity 
weighted collision risk for all public highway-rail grade crossings 
along a defined rail corridor.
    (c) The Quiet Zone Risk Index represents the average severity 
weighted collision risk for all public highway-rail grade crossings that 
are part of a quiet zone.

                         The Prediction Formulas

    (a) The Prediction Formulas were developed by DOT as a guide for 
allocating scarce traffic safety budgets at the State level. They allow 
users to rank candidate crossings for safety improvements by collision 
probability. There are three formulas, one for each warning device 
category:
    1. automatic gates with flashing lights;
    2. flashing lights with no gates; and
    3. passive warning devices.
    (b) The prediction formulas can be used to derive the following for 
each crossing:
    1. the predicted collisions (PC)
    2. the probability of a fatal collision given that a collision 
occurs (P(FC[verbar]C))
    3. the probability of a casualty collision given that a collision 
occurs (P(CC[verbar]C))
    (c) The following factors are the determinants of the number of 
predicted collisions per year:
    1. average annual daily traffic
    2. total number of trains per day
    3. number of highway lanes
    4. number of main tracks
    5. maximum timetable train speed
    6. whether the highway is paved or not
    7. number of through trains per day during daylight hours

[[Page 343]]

    (d) The resulting basic prediction is improved in two ways. It is 
enriched by the particular crossing's collision history for the previous 
five years and it is calibrated by resetting normalizing constants. The 
normalizing constants are reset so that the sum of the predicted 
accidents in each warning device group (passive, flashing lights, gates) 
for the top twenty percent most hazardous crossings exactly equals the 
number of accidents which occurred in a recent period for the top twenty 
percent of that group. This adjustment factor allows the formulas to 
stay current with collision trends. The calibration also corrects for 
errors such as data entry errors. The final output is the predicted 
number of collisions (PC).
    (e) The severity formulas answer the question, ``What is the chance 
that a fatality (or casualty) will happen, given that a collision has 
occurred?'' The fatality formula calculates the probability of a fatal 
collision given that a collision occurs (i.e., the probability of a 
collision in which a fatality occurs) P(FC[verbar]C). Similarly, the 
casualty formula calculates the probability of a casualty collision 
given that a collision occurs P(CC[verbar]C). As casualties consist of 
both fatalities and injuries, the probability of a non-fatal injury 
collision is found by subtracting the probability of a fatal collision 
from the probability of a casualty collision. To convert the probability 
of a fatal or casualty collision to the number of expected fatal or 
casualty collisions, that probability is multiplied by the number of 
predicted collisions (PC).
    (f) For the prediction and severity index formulas, please see the 
following DOT publications: Summary of the DOT Rail-Highway Crossings 
Resource Allocation Procedure--Revised, June 1987, and the Rail-Highway 
Crossing Resource Allocation Procedure: User's Guide, Third Edition, 
August 1987. Both documents are in the docket for this rulemaking and 
also available through the National Technical Information Service 
located in Springfield, Virginia 22161.

                               Risk Index

    (a) The risk index is basically the predicted cost to society of the 
casualties that are expected to result from the predicted collisions at 
a crossing. It incorporates three outputs of the DOT prediction 
formulas. The two components of a risk index are:

1. Predicted Cost of Fatalities = PC x P(FC[verbar]C) x (Average Number 
          of Fatalities Observed In Fatal Collisions) x $3 million
2. Predicted Cost of Injuries = PC x (P(CC[verbar]C)--P(FC[verbar]C)) x 
          (Average Number of Injuries in Collisions Involving Injuries) 
          x $1,167,000

PC, P(CC[verbar]C), and P(FC[verbar]C) are direct outputs of the DOT 
          prediction formulas.
    (b) The average number of fatalities observed in fatal collisions 
and the average number of injuries in collisions involving injuries are 
calculated by FRA as described in paragraphs (c) through (e).
    (c) FRA will match the highway-rail incident files for the past five 
years against a data file containing the list of grade crossings where 
the train horn was not routinely sounded over that five-year period to 
identify two types of collisions involving trains and motor vehicles: 
(1) Those that occurred at crossings where the train horn was not 
routinely sounded during the period, and (2) those that occurred at 
crossings equipped with automatic gates where the train horn was 
routinely sounded. Certain records will be excluded, including records 
pertaining to incidents where the driver was not in the motor vehicle or 
where the motor vehicle struck the train beyond the fourth locomotive or 
rail car that entered the crossing. FRA believes that sounding the train 
horn would not be very effective at preventing such incidents.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The data used to make these exclusions is contained in blocks 
18--Position of Car Unit in Train; 19--Circumstance: Rail Equipment 
Struck/Struck by Highway User; 28--Number of Locomotive Units; and 29--
Number of Cars on the current FRA Form 6180-57 Highway-Rail Grade 
Crossing Accident/Incident Report.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Collisions in the group containing the gated crossings 
nationwide where horns were routinely sounded will then be identified as 
fatal, injury only or no casualty. Collisions will be identified as 
fatal if one or more deaths occurred, regardless of whether injuries 
were also sustained. Collisions will be identified as injury only when 
injuries, but no fatalities, resulted.
    (e) The collisions (incidents) will be summarized by year for the 
five-year period preceding the year in which the risk index is being 
updated. The fatality rate for each year will be calculated by dividing 
the number of fatalities by the number of fatal incidents. The injury 
rate will be calculated by dividing the number of injuries in injury 
only incidents by the number of injury only incidents. FRA will publish 
updated fatality and injury rates on an annual basis in the Federal 
Register.
    (f) Per guidance from DOT, $3 million is the value placed on 
preventing a fatality. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) developed by 
the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine categorizes 
injuries into six levels of severity. Each AIS level is assigned a value 
of injury avoidance as a fraction of the value of avoiding a fatality . 
FRA rates collisions that occur at train speeds in excess of 25 mph as 
an AIS level 5

[[Page 344]]

($2,287,500) and injuries that result from collisions involving trains 
traveling under 25 mph as an AIS level 2 ($46,500). About half of grade 
crossing collisions occur at speeds greater than 25 mph. Therefore, FRA 
estimates that the value of preventing the average injury resulting from 
a grade crossing collision is $1,167,000 (the average of an AIS-5 injury 
and an AIS-2 injury).
    (g) Notice that the quantity [PC*P(FC[verbar]C)] represents the 
expected number of fatal collisions. Similarly, {PC*[P(CC[verbar]C)-
P(FC[verbar]C)]{time}  represents the expected number of injury 
collisions. These are then multiplied by their respective average number 
of fatalities and injuries (from the table above) to develop the number 
of expected casualties. The final parts of the expressions attach the 
dollar values for these casualties.
    (h) The Risk Index for a Crossing is the integer sum of the 
Predicted Cost of Fatalities and the Predicted Cost of Injuries.

                  Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold

    The Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold is simply an average of 
the risk indexes for all of the gated public crossings nationwide where 
train horns are routinely sounded. This value will be recalculated 
annually and published in a notice in the Federal Register. For the most 
recent value of the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, please visit 
FRA's public Web site at http://www.fra.dot.gov.

                      Crossing Corridor Risk Index

    The Crossing Corridor Risk Index is the average of the risk indexes 
of all the public crossings in a defined rail corridor.

                          Quiet Zone Risk Index

    The Quiet Zone Risk Index is the average of the risk indexes of all 
the public crossings in a Quiet Zone. It takes into consideration the

       Sec. Appendix E to Part 222--Requirements for Wayside Horns

    This appendix sets forth the following minimum requirements for 
wayside horn use at highway-rail grade crossings:
    1. Highway-rail crossing must be equipped with constant warning time 
device, if reasonably practical, and power-out indicator;
    2. Horn system must be equipped with an indicator or other system to 
notify the locomotive engineer as to whether the wayside horn is 
operating as intended in sufficient time to enable the locomotive 
engineer to sound the locomotive horn for at least 15 seconds prior to 
arrival at the crossing in the event the wayside horn is not operating 
as intended;
    3. The railroad must adopt an operating rule, bulletin or special 
instruction requiring that the train horn be sounded if the wayside horn 
indicator is not visible approaching the crossing or if the wayside horn 
indicator, or an equivalent system, indicates that the system is not 
operating as intended;
    4. Horn system must provide a minimum sound level of 92 dB(A) and a 
maximum of 110 dB(A) when measured 100 feet from the centerline of the 
nearest track;
    5. Horn system must sound at a minimum of 15 seconds prior to the 
train's arrival at the crossing and while the lead locomotive is 
traveling across the crossing. It is permissible for the horn system to 
begin to sound simultaneously with activation of the flashing lights or 
descent of the crossing arm; arm
    6. Horn shall be directed toward approaching traffic.


<R05>
       Sec. Appendix F to Part 222--Diagnostic Team Considerations

    For purposes of this part, a diagnostic team is a group of 
knowledgeable representatives of parties of interest in a highway-rail 
grade crossing, organized by the public authority responsible for that 
crossing who, using crossing safety management principles, evaluate 
conditions at a grade crossing to make determinations or recommendations 
for the public authority concerning the safety needs at that crossing. 
Crossings proposed for inclusion in a quiet zone should be reviewed in 
the field by a diagnostic team composed of railroad personnel, public 
safety or law enforcement, engineering personnel from the State agency 
responsible for grade crossing safety, and other concerned parties.
    This diagnostic team, using crossing safety management principles, 
should evaluate conditions at a grade crossing to make determinations 
and recommendations concerning safety needs at that crossing. The 
diagnostic team can evaluate a crossing from many perspectives and can 
make recommendations as to what safety measures authorized by this part 
might be utilized to compensate for the silencing of the train horns 
within the proposed quiet zone.

               All Crossings Within a Proposed Quiet Zone

    The diagnostic team should obtain and review the following 
information about each crossing within the proposed quiet zone:
    1. Current highway traffic volumes and percent of trucks;
    2. Posted speed limits on all highway approaches;
    3. Maximum allowable train speeds, both passenger and freight;

[[Page 345]]

    4. Accident history for each crossing under consideration;
    5. School bus or transit bus use at the crossing; and
    6. Presence of U.S. DOT grade crossing inventory numbers clearly 
posted at each of the crossings in question.
    The diagnostic team should obtain all inventory information for each 
crossing and should check, while in the field, to see that inventory 
information is up-to-date and accurate. Outdated inventory information 
should be updated as part of the quiet zone development process.
    When in the field, the diagnostic team should take note of the 
physical characteristics of each crossing, including the following 
items:
    1. Can any of the crossings within the proposed quiet zone be closed 
or consolidated with another adjacent crossing? Crossing elimination 
should always be the preferred alternative and it should be explored for 
crossings within the proposed quiet zone.
    2. What is the number of lanes on each highway approach? Note the 
pavement condition on each approach, as well as the condition of the 
crossing itself.
    3. Is the grade crossing surface smooth, well graded and free 
draining?
    4. Does the alignment of the railroad tracks at the crossing create 
any problems for road users on the crossing? Are the tracks in 
superelevation (are they banked on a curve?) and does this create a 
conflict with the vertical alignment of the crossing roadway?
    5. Note the distance to the nearest intersection or traffic signal 
on each approach (if within 500 feet or so of the crossing or if the 
signal or intersection is determined to have a potential impact on 
highway traffic at the crossing because of queuing or other special 
problems).
    6. If a roadway that runs parallel to the railroad tracks is within 
100 feet of the railroad tracks when it crosses an intersecting road 
that also crosses the tracks, the appropriate advance warning signs 
should be posted as shown in the MUTCD.
    7. Is the posted highway speed (on each approach to the crossing) 
appropriate for the alignment of the roadway and the configuration of 
the crossing?
    8. Does the vertical alignment of the crossing create the potential 
for a ``hump crossing'' where long, low-clearance vehicles might get 
stuck on the crossing?
    9. What are the grade crossing warning devices in place at each 
crossing? Flashing lights and gates are required for each public 
crossing in a New Quiet Zone. Are all required warning devices, signals, 
pavement markings and advance signing in place, visible and in good 
condition for both day and night time visibility?
    10. What kind of train detection is in place at each crossing? Are 
these systems old or outmoded; are they in need of replacement, 
upgrading, or refurbishment?
    11. Are there sidings or other tracks adjacent to the crossing that 
are often used to store railroad cars, locomotives, or other equipment 
that could obscure the vision of road users as they approach the 
crossings in the quiet zone? Clear visibility may help to reduce 
automatic warning device violations.
    12. Are motorists currently violating the warning devices at any of 
the crossings at an excessive rate?
    13. Do collision statistics for the corridor indicate any potential 
problems at any of the crossings?
    14. If school buses or transit buses use crossings within the 
proposed quiet zone corridor, can they be rerouted to use a single 
crossing within or outside of the quiet zone?

             Private Crossings Within a Proposed Quiet Zone

    In addition to the items discussed above, a diagnostic team should 
note the following issues when examining any private crossings within a 
proposed quiet zone:
    1. How often is the private crossing used?
    2. What kind of signing or pavement markings are in place at the 
private crossing?
    3. What types of vehicles use the private crossing?
    School buses
    Large trucks
    Hazmat carriers
    Farm equipment
    4. What is the volume, speed and type of train traffic over the 
crossing?
    5. Do passenger trains use the crossing?
    6. Do approaching trains sound the horn at the private crossing?
    State or local law requires it?
    Railroad safety rule requires it?
    7. Are there any nearby crossings where train horns sound that might 
also provide some warning if train horns were not sounded at the private 
crossing?
    8. What are the approach (corner) sight distances?
    9. What is the clearing sight distance for all approaches?
    10. What are the private roadway approach grades?
    11. What are the private roadway pavement surfaces?

            Pedestrian Crossings Within a Proposed Quiet Zone

    In addition to the items discussed in the section titled, ``All 
crossings within a proposed quiet zone'', a diagnostic team should note 
the following issues when examining any pedestrian crossings within a 
proposed quiet zone:
    1. How often is the pedestrian crossing used?

[[Page 346]]

    2. What kind of signing or pavement markings are in place at the 
pedestrian crossing?
    3. What is the volume, speed, and type of train traffic over the 
crossing?
    4. Do approaching trains sound the horn at the pedestrian crossing?
    State or local law requires it?
    Railroad safety rule requires it?
    5. Are there any crossings where train horns sound that might also 
provide some warning if train horns were not sounded at the pedestrian 
crossing?
    6. What are the approach sight distances?
    7. What is the clearing sight distance for all approaches?

     Sec. Appendix A to Part 223--Certification of Glazing Materials

    As provided in this part, certified glazing materials installed in 
locomotives, passenger cars, or cabooses must be certified by the 
glazing manufacturer in accordance with the following procedures:
    a. General Requirements
    (1) Each manufacturer that provides glazing materials, intended by 
the manufacturer for use in achieving compliance with the requirements 
of this part, shall certify that each type of glazing material being 
supplied for this purpose has been succcessfully tested in accordance 
with this appendix and that test verification data is available to a 
railroad or to FRA upon request.
    (2) The test verification data shall contain all pertinent original 
data logs and documentation that the selection of material samples, test 
set-ups, test measuring devices, and test procedures were performed by 
qualified personnel using recognized and acceptable practices and in 
accordance with this appendix.
    b. Testing Requirements
    (1) The material to be tested (Target Material) shall be a full 
scale sample of the largest dimension intended to be produced and 
installed.
    (2) The Target Material shall be representative of production 
material and shall be selected on a documented random choice basis.
    (3) The Target Material shall be securely and rigidly attached in a 
fixture so that the fixture's own characteristics will not induce test 
errors.
    (4) The Target Material so selected and attached shall constitute a 
Test Specimen.
    (5) The Test Specimen will then be equipped with a Witness Plate 
that shall be mounted parallel to and at a distance of six inches in 
back of the Target Material. The Witness Plate shall have at least an 
area which will cover the full map of the Target Material.
    (6) The Witness Plate shall be an unbacked sheet of maximum 0.006 
inch, alloy 1100 temper O, aluminum stretched within the perimeter of a 
suitable frame to provide a taut surface.
    (7) The Test Specimen will be positioned so that the defined 
projectile impacts it at an angle of 90 degrees to the Test Specimen 
surface.
    (8) The point of impact of the defined projectile will be within a 
radius of 3<gr-thn-eq> of the centroid of the Target Material.

[[Page 351]]

    (9) Velocity screens or other suitable velocity measuring devices 
will be positioned so as to measure the impact velocity of the defined 
projectile within a 10% accuracy tolerance, with test modifications made 
to guarantee that the stipulated minimum velocity requirements are met.
    (10) The Test Specimen for glazing material that is intended for use 
in end facing glazing locations shall be subjected to a Type I test 
regimen consisting of the following tests:
    (i) Ballistic Impact in which a standard 22 caliber long rifle lead 
bullet of 40 grains in weight impacts at a minimum of 960 feet per 
second velocity.
    (ii) Large Object Impact in which a cinder block of 24 lbs minimum 
weight with dimensions of 8 inches by 8 inches by 16 inches nominally 
impacts at the corner of the block at a minimum of 44 feet per second 
velocity. The cinder block must be of composition referenced in American 
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Specification C33L or ASTM C90.
    (11) The Test Specimen for glazing material that is intended for use 
only in side facing glazing locations shall be subjected to a Type II 
test regimen consisting of the following tests:
    (i) Ballistic Impact in which a standard 22 caliber long rifle lead 
bullet of 40 grains in weight impacts at a minimum of 960 feet per 
second velocity.
    (ii) Large Object Impact in which a cinder block of 24 lbs minimum 
weight with dimensions of 8 inches by 8 inches by 16 inches nominally 
impacts at the corner of the block at a minimum of 12 feet per second 
velocity. The cinder block must be of the composition referenced in ASTM 
C33L or ASTM C90.
    (12) Three different test specimens must be subjected to the 
ballistic impact portion of these tests.
    (13) Two different test specimens must be subjected to the large 
object impact portion of these tests.
    (14) A material so tested must perform so that:
    (i) there shall be no penetration of the back surfaces (side closest 
to Witness Plate) of the Target Material by the projectile. Partial 
penetration of the impact (front) surface of the Target Material does 
not constitute a failure; and
    (ii) there shall be no penetration of particles from the back side 
of the Target Material through the back side of the prescribed Witness 
Plate.
    (15) Test specimens must consecutively pass the required number of 
tests at the required minimum velocities. Individual tests resulting in 
failures at greater than the required minimum velocities may be repeated 
but a failure of an individual test at less than the minimum velocity 
shall result in termination of the total test and failure of the 
material.
    (16) After successful completion of the prescribed set of required 
consecutive tests, a manufacturer may certify in writing that a 
particular glazing material meets the requirements of these standards.
    c. Material Identification
    (1) Each individual unit of glazing material shall be permanently 
marked, prior to installation, to indicate that this type of material 
has been successfully tested as set forth in this appendix and that 
marking shall be done in such a manner that it is clearly visible after 
the material has been installed.
    (2) Each individual unit of a glazing material that has successfully 
passed the Type I testing regimen shall be marked to indicate:
    (i) ``FRA Type I'' material;
    (ii) the manufacturer of the material;
    (iii) the type or brand identification of the material.
    (3) Each individual unit of a glazing material that has successfully 
passed the Type II testing regimen shall be marked to indicate:
    (i) ``FRA Type II'' material;
    (ii) the manufacturer of the material;
    (iii) the type or brand identification of the material.

      Sec. Appendix B to Part 223--Schedule of Civil Penalties \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ A penalty may be assessed against an individual only for a 
willful violation. The Administrator reserves the right to assess a 
penalty of up to $27,000 for any violation where circumstances warrant. 
See 49 U.S.C. 21301, 21304, and 49 CFR part 209, appendix A. If more 
than one item is listed as a type of violation of a given section, each 
item is also designated by a ``penalty code,'' which is used to 
facilitate assessment of civil penalties, and which may or may not 
correspond to any subsection designation(s). For convenience, penalty 
citations will cite the CFR section and the penalty code, if any. FRA 
reserves the right, should litigation become necessary, to substitute in 
its complaint the CFR citation in place of the combined CFR and penalty 
code citation, should they differ.

<R05>
Sec. 224.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of this part is to reduce highway-rail grade 
crossing accidents and deaths, injuries, and property damage resulting 
from those accidents, by enhancing the conspicuity of rail freight 
rolling stock so as to increase its detectability by motor vehicle 
operators at night and under conditions of poor visibility.
    (b) In order to achieve cost-effective mitigation of collision risk 
at highway-rail grade crossings, this part establishes the duties of 
freight rolling stock owners (including those who manage maintenance of 
freight rolling stock, supply freight rolling stock for transportation, 
or offer freight rolling stock in transportation) and railroads to 
progressively apply retroreflective material to freight rolling stock, 
and to periodically inspect and maintain that material. Freight rolling 
stock owners, however, are under no duty to install, clean or otherwise 
maintain, or repair reflective material except as specified in this 
part.
    (c) This part establishes a schedule for the application of 
retroreflective material to rail freight rolling stock and prescribes 
standards for the application, inspection, and maintenance of 
retroreflective material to rail freight rolling stock for the purpose 
of enhancing its detectability at highway-rail grade crossings. This 
part does not restrict a freight rolling stock owner or railroad from 
applying retroreflective material to freight rolling stock for other 
purposes if not inconsistent with the recognizable pattern required by 
this part.

each car or locomotive subject to this part is dependent on the length 
of the car or locomotive and the color of the sheeting. For purposes of 
this part, the length of a railroad freight car or locomotive is 
measured from endsill to endsill, exclusive of the coupler and draft 
gear. Each side of a railroad freight car subject to this part, 
including each unit of multi-unit cars, and each side of a locomotive 
subject to this part must be equipped with at least the minimum amount 
of retroreflective sheeting specified in Table 2 of this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 224.106  Location of retroreflective sheeting.

    (a) Railroad freight cars. The retroreflective sheeting shall be 
applied along the length of each railroad freight car side in the manner 
provided by a uniform industry standard accepted by the Associate 
Administrator that provides for distribution of material along the 
length of each car and as close as practicable to 42 inches above the 
top of rail. In the event such a standard is not proffered by industry 
or

[[Page 357]]

accepted by the Associate Administrator, the criteria set forth in this 
subpart shall apply. Retroreflective sheeting applied under this part 
must be located clear of appurtenances and devices such as ladders and 
other safety appliances, pipes, or other attachments that may obscure 
its visibility. Retroreflective sheeting need not be applied to 
discontinuous surfaces such as bolts, rivets, door hinges, or other 
irregularly shaped areas that may prevent the sheeting from adhering to 
the car sides. In addition, retroreflective sheeting need not be applied 
over existing or required car stencils and markings. If necessary to 
avoid appurtenances, discontinuous surfaces, or existing or required car 
markings or stencils, 4x18 and 4x36 inch strips of retroreflective 
material may be divided into 4x9 inch strips and applied on either side 
of the appurtenance, discontinuous surface, or car markings or stencils, 
as practicable. Unless otherwise specified, retroreflective sheeting 
shall be applied along the sides of freight rolling stock at intervals 
not to exceed every 12 feet, as practicable. If it is not practicable to 
apply retroreflective sheeting every 12 feet because of existing 
stencils, appurtenances, or discontinuous surfaces, the sheeting shall 
be applied at the next smallest interval practicable.
    (1) General rule. On railroad freight cars other than flat cars and 
tank cars, retroreflective sheeting shall be applied in either a 
vertical or horizontal pattern along the length of the car sides, with 
the bottom edge of the sheeting as close as practicable to 42 inches 
above the top of rail. Retroreflective sheeting shall not be applied 
below the side sill.
    (i) Vertical application. If retroreflective sheeting is applied in 
a vertical pattern, at least one 4x36 inch strip or two 4x18 inch 
strips, one above the other, shall be applied as close to each end of 
the car as practicable. Between these two vertical end strips, a minimum 
of one 4x18 inch strip shall be applied at least every 12 feet, as 
practicable. See Figures 1, 2 and 3.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28OC05.002

    (ii) Horizontal application. If retroreflective sheeting is applied 
in a horizontal pattern, at least one 4x36 inch strip, or two 4x18 inch 
strips, one above or next to the other, shall be applied as close to 
each end of the car as practicable. Between these end strips, a minimum 
of one 4x18 inch strip shall be

[[Page 361]]

applied at least every 12 feet, as practicable. See Figures 4, 5, and 6.

    (2) Tank cars. On tank cars, retroreflective sheeting shall be 
applied vertically to each car side and centered on the horizontal 
centerline of the tank, or as near as practicable. If it is not 
practicable to safely apply the sheeting centered vertically about the 
horizontal centerline of the tank,

[[Page 364]]

the sheeting may be applied vertically with its top edge no lower than 
the horizontal centerline of the tank. A minimum of either one 4x36 inch 
strip or two 4x18 inch strips, one above the other, shall be applied as 
close to each end of the car as practicable. Between these two end 
strips, a minimum of one 4x18 inch strip shall be applied at least every 
12 feet, as practicable. Retroreflective sheeting applied under this 
part shall not be located in the spillage area directly beneath the 
manway used to load and unload the tank. See Figures 7 and 8.

[[Page 365]]

[[Page 366]]


[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28OC05.007

    (3) Flat cars. On flat cars, retroreflective sheeting shall be 
applied in a horizontal pattern along the length of the side sill with 
the bottom edge of the sheeting no lower than the bottom of the side 
sill and the top edge of the sheeting no higher than the top of the car 
deck or floor. At least two

[[Page 367]]

4x18 inch strips, one above the other, shall be applied as close to each 
end of the car as practicable. If the side sill is less than 8 inches 
wide, one 4x36 inch strip, or two 4x18 inch strips may be applied one 
next to the other, dividing the strips into nine inch segments as 
necessary in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. Between the 
two end strips, a minimum of one 4x18 inch strip shall be applied at 
least every 12 feet, as practicable. See Figure 9. If a car has a 
separate rack structure, retroreflective sheeting may be applied to the 
flat car portion only in accordance with the requirements of this 
section. For cars without continuous side sills, retroreflective 
sheeting may be applied to other surfaces inboard of the sides, such as 
the center sill, provided that the sheeting is not obscured by other 
components.

[[Page 368]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28OC05.008

    (4) Cars of special construction. This paragraph applies to any car 
the design of which is not compatible with the patterns of application 
otherwise provided in this section. Retroreflective sheeting shall 
conform as closely as practicable to the requirements of paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (a)(3) of this

[[Page 369]]

section and shall have the minimum amount of sheeting described in Sec. 
224.105 distributed along the length of each car side.
    (b) Locomotives. Locomotives subject to this part shall be equipped 
with at least the minimum amounts of retroreflective sheeting required 
by Sec. 224.105 either in strips four inches wide and 18 or 36 inches 
long and spaced as uniformly as practicable along the length of the 
locomotive sides, or in one continuous strip, at least four inches wide, 
along the length of the locomotive. Retroreflective sheeting applied to 
locomotive sides shall be applied as close as practicable to 42 inches 
from the top of the rail.

Sec. 224.109  Inspection, repair, and replacement.

    (a) Railroad freight cars. Retroreflective sheeting on railroad 
freight cars subject to this part must be visually inspected for 
presence and condition whenever a car undergoes a single car air brake 
test required under 49 CFR 232.305. If at the time of inspection less 
than 80 percent of the amount of sheeting required under Sec. 224.105 
(Sec. 224.107 in the case of freight cars subject to Sec. 
224.107(a)(3)) on either side of a car is present, not damaged, and not 
obscured, the inspecting railroad or contractor shall promptly notify 
the person responsible for the reporting mark, as indicated in the 
Universal Machine Language Equipment Register, of the damaged, obscured, 
or missing sheeting (unless the inspecting railroad or contractor is the 
person responsible for the reporting mark). The inspecting railroad or 
contractor shall retain a written or electronic copy of each such 
notification made for at least two years from the date of the notice and 
shall make these records available for inspection and copying by the FRA 
upon request. Any person notified of a defect under this section shall 
have nine months (270 calendar days) from the date of notification to 
repair or replace the damaged, obscured, or missing sheeting. Where the 
inspecting railroad or contractor is the person responsible for the 
reporting mark, the person shall have nine months (270 calendar days) 
from the date of the inspection to repair or replace the damaged, 
obscured, or missing sheeting.
    (b) Locomotives. Retroreflective sheeting must be visually inspected 
for presence and condition when the locomotive receives the annual 
inspection required under 49 CFR 229.27. If at the time of inspection 
less than 80 percent of the amount of sheeting required under Sec. 
224.105 (Sec. 224.107 in the case of locomotives subject to Sec. 
224.107(b)(3)) on either side of a locomotive is present, not damaged, 
and not obscured, the damaged, obscured, or missing sheeting must be 
repaired or replaced within nine months (270 calendar days) from the 
date of inspection, provided a record of the defect is maintained in the 
locomotive cab or in a secure and accessible electronic database to 
which FRA is provided access on request.


<R05>
Sec. 224.111  Renewal.

    Regardless of condition, retroreflective sheeting required under 
this part must be replaced with new sheeting no later than ten years 
after the date of initial installation. At the time of replacement, it 
is not necessary to remove the old sheeting unless it interferes with 
the placement of the new sheeting, but the old sheeting shall not be 
considered in calculating the amount of retroreflective material 
required under this part. For purposes of this section, November 28, 
2005, shall be considered the initial date of installation for freight 
cars and locomotives covered by Sec. 224.107(a)(3) or 224.107(b)(3).\1\

Sec. 225.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to provide the Federal Railroad 
Administration with accurate information concerning the hazards and 
risks that exist on the Nation's railroads. FRA needs this information 
to effectively carry out its regulatory responsibilities under 49 U.S.C. 
chapters 201-213. FRA also uses this information for determining 
comparative trends of railroad safety and to develop hazard elimination 
and risk reduction programs that focus on preventing railroad injuries 
and accidents. Issuance of these regulations under the federal railroad 
safety laws and regulations preempts States from prescribing accident/
incident reporting requirements. Any State may, however, require 
railroads to submit to it copies of accident/incident and injury/illness 
reports filed with FRA under this part, for accidents/incidents and 
injuries/illnesses which occur in that State.

<R05>
Sec. 225.3  Applicability.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d), this part 
applies to all railroads except--
    (1) A railroad that operates freight trains only on track inside an 
installation which is not part of the general railroad system of 
transportation or that owns no track except for track that is inside an 
installation that is not part of the general railroad system of 
transportation and used for freight operations.
    (2) Rail mass transit operations in an urban area that are not 
connected with the general railroad system of transportation.
    (3) A railroad that exclusively hauls passengers inside an 
installation that is insular or that owns no track except for track used 
exclusively for the hauling of passengers inside an installation that is 
insular. An operation is not considered insular if one or more of the 
following exists on its line:
    (i) A public highway-rail grade crossing that is in use;
    (ii) An at-grade rail crossing that is in use;
    (iii) A bridge over a public road or waters used for commercial 
navigation; or
    (iv) A common corridor with a railroad, i.e., its operations are 
within 30 feet of those of any railroad.
    (b) The Internal Control Plan requirements in Sec. 225.33(a)(3) 
through (10) do not apply to--
    (1) Railroads that operate or own track on the general railroad 
system of transportation that have 15 or fewer employees covered by the 
hours of service law (49 U.S.C. 21101-21107) and
    (2) Railroads that operate or own track exclusively off the general 
system.
    (c) The recordkeeping requirements regarding accountable injuries 
and illnesses and accountable rail equipment

[[Page 378]]

accidents/incidents found in Sec. 225.25(a) through (g) do not apply 
to--
    (1) Railroads that operate or own track on the general railroad 
system of transportation that have 15 or fewer employees covered by the 
hours of service law (49 U.S.C. 21101-21107) and
    (2) Railroads that operate or own track exclusively off the general 
system.
    (d) All requirements in this part to record or report an injury or 
illness incurred by any classification of person that results from a 
non-train incident do not apply to railroads that operate or own track 
exclusively off the general railroad system of transportation, unless 
the non-train incident involves in- service on-track equipment.

[61 FR 30967, June 18, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 67490, Dec. 23, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 225.5  Definitions.

    As used in this part--
    Accident/incident means:
    (1) Any impact between railroad on-track equipment and an 
automobile, bus, truck, motorcycle, bicycle, farm vehicle or pedestrian 
at a highway-rail grade crossing;
    (2) Any collision, derailment, fire, explosion, act of God, or other 
event involving operation of railroad on-track equipment (standing or 
moving) that results in reportable damages greater than the current 
reporting threshold to railroad on-track equipment, signals, track, 
track structures, and roadbed;
    (3) Any event or exposure arising from the operation of a railroad, 
if the event or exposure is a discernable cause of one or more of the 
following outcomes, and this outcome is a new case or a significant 
aggravation of a pre-existing injury or illness:
    (i) Death to any person;
    (ii) Injury to any person that results in medical treatment;
    (iii) Injury to a railroad employee that results in:
    (A) A day away from work;
    (B) Restricted work activity or job transfer; or
    (C) Loss of consciousness;
    (iv) Occupational illness of a railroad employee that results in any 
of the following:
    (A) A day away from work;
    (B) Restricted work activity or job transfer;
    (C) Loss of consciousness; or
    (D) Medical treatment;
    (v) Significant injury to or significant illness of a railroad 
employee diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care 
professional even if it does not result in death, a day away from work, 
restricted work activity or job transfer, medical treatment, or loss of 
consciousness;
    (vi) Illness or injury that meets the application of any of the 
following specific case criteria:
    (A) Needlestick or sharps injury to a railroad employee;
    (B) Medical removal of a railroad employee;
    (C) Occupational hearing loss of a railroad employee;
    (D) Occupational tuberculosis of a railroad employee; or
    (E) Musculoskeletal disorder of a railroad employee if this disorder 
is independently reportable under one or more of the general reporting 
criteria.
    (4) Occupational illness.
    Accountable injury or illness means any condition, not otherwise 
reportable, of a railroad employee that is discernably caused by an 
event, exposure, or activity in the work environment which condition 
causes or requires the railroad employee to be examined or treated by a 
qualified health care professional.
    Accountable rail equipment accident/incident means any event not 
otherwise reportable, involving the operation of on-track equipment that 
causes physical damage to either the on-track equipment or the track 
upon which such equipment was operated and that requires the removal or 
repair of rail equipment from the track before any rail operations over 
the track can continue. An accountable rail equipment accident/incident, 
if not tended to, thus would disrupt railroad service. Examples of 
``disruption of service'' would include: loss of main track; one or more 
derailed wheels; any train failing to arrive or depart at its scheduled 
time; one or more cars or locomotives taken out of service; or rerouting 
trains due to a damaged car or locomotive.

[[Page 379]]

    Covered data means information that must be reported to FRA under 
this part concerning a railroad employee injury or illness case that is 
reportable exclusively because a physician or other licensed health care 
professional--
    (1) Recommended in writing that--
    (i) The employee take one or more days away from work when the 
employee instead reports to work (or would have reported had he or she 
been scheduled) and takes no days away from work in connection with the 
injury or illness,
    (ii) The employee work restricted duty for one or more days when the 
employee instead works unrestricted (or would have worked unrestricted 
had he or she been scheduled) and takes no days of restricted work 
activity in connection with the injury or illness, or
    (iii) The employee take over-the-counter medication at a dosage 
equal to or greater than the minimum prescription strength, whether or 
not the employee actually takes the medication; or
    (2) Made a one-time topical application of a prescription-strength 
medication to the employee's injury.
    Day away from work means a day away from work as described in 
paragraph (1) of this definition or, if paragraph (1) does not apply, a 
day away from work solely for reporting purposes as described in 
paragraph (2) of this definition. For purposes of this definition, the 
count of days includes all calendar days, regardless of whether the 
employee would normally be scheduled to work on those days (e.g., 
weekend days, holidays, rest days, and vacation days), and begins on the 
first calendar day after the railroad employee has been examined by a 
physician or other licensed health care professional (PLHCP) and 
diagnosed with a work-related injury or illness. In particular, the term 
means--
    (1) Each calendar day that the employee, for reasons associated with 
his or her condition, does not report to work (or would have been unable 
to report had he or she been scheduled) if not reporting results from:
    (i) A PLHCP's written recommendation not to work, or
    (ii) A railroad's instructions not to work, if the injury or illness 
is otherwise reportable; or
    (2) A minimum of one calendar day if a PLHCP, for reasons associated 
with the employee's condition, recommends in writing that the employee 
take one or more days away from work, but the employee instead reports 
to work (or would have reported had he or she been scheduled). This 
paragraph is intended to take into account ``covered data'' cases and 
also those non-covered data cases that are independently reportable for 
some other reason (e.g., ``medical treatment'' or ``day of restricted 
work activity''). The requirement to report ``a minimum of one calendar 
day'' is intended to give a railroad the discretion to report up to the 
total number of days recommended by the PLHCP.
    Day of restricted work activity means a day of restricted work 
activity as described in paragraph (1) of this definition or, if 
paragraph (1) does not apply, a day of restricted work activity solely 
for reporting purposes as described in paragraph (2) of this definition; 
in both cases, the work restriction must affect one or more of the 
employee's routine job functions (i.e., those work activities regularly 
performed at least once per week) or prevent the employee from working 
the full workday that he or she would otherwise have worked. For 
purposes of this definition, the count of days includes all calendar 
days, regardless of whether the employee would normally be scheduled to 
work on those days (e.g., weekend days, holidays, rest days, and 
vacation days), and begins on the first calendar day after the railroad 
employee has been examined by a physician or other licensed health care 
professional (PLHCP) and diagnosed with a work-related injury or 
illness. In particular, the term means--
    (1) Each calendar day that the employee, for reasons associated with 
his or her condition, works restricted duty (or would have worked 
restricted duty had he or she been scheduled) if the restriction results 
from:
    (i) A PLHCP's written recommendation to work restricted duty, or
    (ii) A railroad's instructions to work restricted duty, if the 
injury or illness is otherwise reportable; or

[[Page 380]]

    (2) A minimum of one calendar day if a PLHCP, for reasons associated 
with the employee's condition, recommends in writing that the employee 
work restricted duty for one or more days, but the employee instead 
works unrestricted (or would have worked unrestricted had he or she been 
scheduled). This paragraph is intended to take into account ``covered 
data'' cases and also those non-covered data cases that are 
independently reportable for some other reason (e.g., ``medical 
treatment'' or ``day of restricted work activity''). The requirement to 
report ``a minimum of one calendar day'' is intended to give a railroad 
the discretion to report up to the total number of days recommended by 
the PLHCP.
    Employee human factor includes any of the accident causes signified 
by the train accident cause codes listed under ``Train Operation--Human 
Factors'' in the current ``FRA Guide for Preparing Accidents/Incidents 
Reports,'' except for those train accident cause codes pertaining to 
non-railroad workers. For purposes of this definition ``employee'' 
includes the classifications of Worker on Duty--Employee, Employee not 
on Duty, Worker on Duty--Contractor, and Worker on Duty--Volunteer.
    Establishment means a single physical location where workers report 
to work, where railroad business is conducted, or where services or 
operations are performed. Examples are: a division office, general 
office, repair or maintenance facility, major switching yard or 
terminal. For employees who are engaged in dispersed operations, such as 
signal or track maintenance workers, an ``establishment'' is typically a 
location where work assignments are initially made and oversight 
responsibility exists, e.g., the establishment where the signal 
supervisor or roadmaster is located.
    Event or exposure arising from the operation of a railroad 
includes--
    (1) With respect to a person who is on property owned, leased, or 
maintained by the railroad, an activity of the railroad that is related 
to the performance of its rail transportation business or an exposure 
related to the activity;
    (2) With respect to an employee of the railroad (whether on or off 
property owned, leased, or maintained by the railroad), an activity of 
the railroad that is related to the performance of its rail 
transportation business or an exposure related to the activity; and
    (3) With respect to a person who is not an employee of the railroad 
and not on property owned, leased, or maintained by the railroad--an 
event or exposure directly resulting from one or more of the following 
railroad operations:
    (i) A train accident, a train incident, or a highway-rail crossing 
accident or incident involving the railroad; or
    (ii) A release of a hazardous material from a railcar in the 
possession of the railroad or of another dangerous commodity that is 
related to the performance of the railroad's rail transportation 
business.
    FRA representative means the Associate Administrator for Safety, 
FRA; the Associate Administrator's delegate (including a qualified State 
inspector acting under part 212 of this chapter); the Chief Counsel, 
FRA; or the Chief Counsel's delegate.
    General reporting criteria means the criteria listed in Sec. 
225.19(d)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5).
    Highway-rail grade crossing means a location where a public highway, 
road, street, or private roadway, including associated sidewalks and 
pathways, crosses one or more railroad tracks at grade.
    Joint operations means rail operations conducted on a track used 
jointly or in common by two or more railroads subject to this part or 
operation of a train, locomotive, car, or other on-track equipment by 
one railroad over the track of another railroad.
    Medical removal means medical removal under the medical surveillance 
requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
standard in 29 CFR part 1910 in effect during calendar year 2002, even 
if the case does not meet one of the general reporting criteria.
    Medical treatment means any medical care or treatment beyond ``first 
aid'' regardless of who provides such treatment. Medical treatment does 
not include diagnostic procedures, such as X-

[[Page 381]]

rays and drawing blood samples. Medical treatment also does not include 
counseling.
    Musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) means a disorder of the muscles, 
nerves, tendons, ligaments, joints, cartilage, and spinal discs. The 
term does not include disorders caused by slips, trips, falls, motor 
vehicle accidents, or other similar accidents. Examples of MSDs include: 
Carpal tunnel syndrome, Rotator cuff syndrome, De Quervain's disease, 
Trigger finger, Tarsal tunnel syndrome, Sciatica, Epicondylitis, 
Tendinitis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Carpet layers knee, Herniated spinal 
disc, and Low back pain.
    Needlestick or sharps injury means a cut, laceration, puncture, or 
scratch from a needle or other sharp object that involves contamination 
with another person's blood or other potentially infectious material, 
even if the case does not meet one of the general reporting criteria.
    New case means a case in which either the employee has not 
previously experienced a reported injury or illness of the same type 
that affects the same part of the body, or the employee previously 
experienced a reported injury or illness of the same type that affected 
the same part of the body but had recovered completely (all signs had 
disappeared) from the previous injury or illness and an event or 
exposure in the work environment caused the signs or symptoms to 
reappear.
    Non-train incident means an event that results in a reportable 
casualty, but does not involve the movement of on-track equipment nor 
cause reportable damage above the threshold established for train 
accidents.
    Occupational hearing loss means a diagnosis of occupational hearing 
loss by a physician or other licensed health care professional, where 
the employee's audiogram reveals a work-related Standard Threshold Shift 
(STS) (i.e., at least a 10-decibel change in hearing threshold, relative 
to the baseline audiogram for that employee) in hearing in one or both 
ears, and the employee's total hearing level is 25 decibels or more 
above audiometric zero (averaged at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz) in the same 
ear(s) as the STS.
    Occupational illness means any abnormal condition or disorder, as 
diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care professional, of 
any person who falls under the definition for the classification of 
Worker on Duty--Employee, other than one resulting from injury, 
discernably caused by an environmental factor associated with the 
person's railroad employment, including, but not limited to, acute or 
chronic illnesses or diseases that may be caused by inhalation, 
absorption, ingestion, or direct contact.
    Occupational tuberculosis means the occupational exposure of an 
employee to anyone with a known case of active tuberculosis if the 
employee subsequently develops a tuberculosis infection, as evidenced by 
a positive skin test or diagnosis by a physician or other licensed 
health care professional, even if the case does not meet one of the 
general reporting criteria.
    Privacy concern case is any occupational injury or illness in the 
following list:
    (1) Any injury or illness to an intimate body part or the 
reproductive system;
    (2) An injury or illness resulting from a sexual assault;
    (3) Mental illnesses;
    (4) HIV infection, hepatitis, or tuberculosis;
    (5) Needlestick and sharps injuries; and
    (6) Other injuries or illnesses, if the employee independently and 
voluntarily requests in writing to the railroad reporting officer that 
his or her injury or illness not be posted.
    Person includes all categories of entities covered under 1 U.S.C. 1, 
including, but not limited to, a railroad; any manager, supervisor, 
official, or other employee or agent of a railroad; any owner, 
manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, or 
facilities; any passenger; any trespasser or nontrespasser; any 
independent contractor providing goods or services to a railroad; any 
volunteer providing goods or services to a railroad; and any employee of 
such owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor.
    Qualified health care professional is a health care professional 
operating

[[Page 382]]

within the scope of his or her license, registration, or certification. 
For example, an otolaryngologist is qualified to diagnose a case of 
noise-induced hearing loss and identify potential causal factors, but 
may not be qualified to diagnose a case of repetitive motion injuries. 
In addition to licensed physicians, the term qualified health care 
professional includes members of other occupations associated with 
patient care and treatment such as chiropractors, podiatrists, 
physician's assistants, psychologists, and dentists.
    Railroad means a person providing railroad transportation.
    Railroad transportation means any form of non-highway ground 
transportation that run on rails or electro-magnetic guideways, 
including commuter or other short-haul railroad passenger service in a 
metropolitan or suburban area, as well as any commuter railroad service 
that was operated by the Consolidated Rail Corporation as of January 1, 
1979, and high speed ground transportation systems that connect 
metropolitan areas, without regard to whether they use new technologies 
not associated with traditional railroads. Such term does not include 
rapid transit operations within an urban area that are not connected to 
the general railroad system of transportation.
    Significant change in the damage costs for reportable rail equipment 
accidents/incidents means at least a ten-percent variance between the 
damage amount reported to FRA and current cost figures.
    Significant change in the number of reportable days away from work 
or days restricted means at least a ten-percent variance in the number 
of actual reportable days away from work or days restricted compared to 
the number of days already reported.
    Significant illness means an illness involving cancer or a chronic

    (b) Method of reporting. (1) Telephonic reports required by this 
section shall be made by toll-free telephone to the National Response 
Center, Area Code 800-424-8802 or 800-424-0201.
    (2) Through one of the same telephone numbers (800-424-0201), the 
National Response Center (NRC) also receives notifications of rail 
accidents for the National Transportation Safety Board (49 CFR part 840) 
and the Research and Special Programs Administration of the U.S. 
Department of Transportation (Hazardous Materials Regulations, 49 CFR 
171.15). FRA Locomotive Safety Standards require certain locomotive 
accidents to be reported by telephone to the NRC at the same toll-free 
number (800-424-0201). 49 CFR 229.17.
    (c) Contents of report. Each report must state the:
    (1) Name of the railroad;
    (2) Name, title, and telephone number of the individual making the 
report;
    (3) Time, date, and location of the accident/incident;
    (4) Circumstances of the accident/incident;
    (5) Number of persons killed or injured; and
    (6) Available estimates of railroad and non-railroad property 
damage.
    (d) Timing of report. (1) To the extent that the necessity to report 
an accident/incident depends upon a determination of fact or an estimate 
of property damage, a report will be considered immediate if made as 
soon as possible following the time that the determination or estimate 
is made, or could reasonably have been made,

[[Page 384]]

whichever comes first, taking into consideration the health and safety 
of those affected by the accident/incident, including actions to protect 
the environment.
    (2) NTSB has other specific requirements regarding the timeliness of 
reporting. See 49 CFR part 840.

<R05>
Sec. 225.12  Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Reports alleging employee human 

factor as cause; Employee Human Factor Attachment; notice to employee; 

employee supplement.

    (a) Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report alleging employee human 
factor as cause; completion of Employee Human Factor Attachment. If, in 
reporting a rail equipment accident/incident to FRA, a railroad cites an 
employee human factor as the primary cause or a contributing cause of 
the accident; then the railroad that cited such employee human factor 
must complete, in accordance with instructions on the form and in the 
current ``FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports,'' an 
Employee Human Factor Attachment form on the accident. For purposes of 
this section, ``employee'' is defined as a Worker on Duty--Employee, 
Employee not on Duty, Worker on Duty--Contractor, or Worker on Duty--
Volunteer.
    (b) Notice to identified implicated employees. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, for each employee whose act, 
omission, or physical condition was alleged by the railroad as the 
employee human factor that was the primary cause or a contributing cause 
of a rail equipment accident/incident and whose name was listed in the 
Employee Human Factor Attachment for the accident and for each such 
railroad employee of whose identity the railroad has actual knowledge, 
the alleging railroad shall--
    (1) Complete part I, ``Notice to Railroad Employee Involved in Rail 
Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Employee Human Factor,'' of 
Form FRA F 6180.78 with information regarding the accident, in 
accordance with instructions on the form and in the current ``FRA Guide 
for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports''; and
    (2) Hand deliver or send by first class mail (postage prepaid) to 
that employee, within 45 days after the end of the month in which the 
rail equipment accident/incident occurred--
    (i) A copy of Form FRA F 6180.78, ``Notice to Railroad Employee 
Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Employee 
Human Factor; Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident 
Report,'' with part I completed as to the applicable employee and 
accident;
    (ii) A copy of the railroad's Rail Equipment Accident/Incident 
Report and Employee Human Factor Attachment on the rail equipment 
accident/incident involved; and
    (iii) If the accident was also reportable as a highway-rail grade 
crossing accident/incident, a copy of the railroad's Highway-Rail Grade 
Crossing Accident/Incident Report on that accident.
    (c) Joint operations. If a reporting railroad makes allegations 
under paragraph (a) of this section concerning the employee of another 
railroad, the employing railroad must promptly provide the name, job 
title, address, and medical status of any employee reasonably identified 
by the alleging railroad, if requested by the alleging railroad.
    (d) Late identification. Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and 
(f) of this section, if a railroad is initially unable

[[Page 385]]

to identify a particular railroad employee whose act, omission, or 
physical condition was cited by the railroad as a primary or 
contributing cause of the accident, but subsequently makes such 
identification, the railroad shall submit a revised Employee Human 
Factor Attachment to FRA immediately, and shall submit the Notice 
described in paragraph (b) of this section to that employee within 15 
days of when the revised report is to be submitted.
    (e) Deferred notification on medical grounds. The reporting railroad 
has reasonable discretion to defer notification of implicated employees 
on medical grounds.
    (f) Implicated employees who have died by the time that the Notice 
is ready to be sent. (1) If an implicated employee has died as a result 
of the accident, a Notice under paragraph (b) addressed to that employee 
must not be sent to any person.
    (2) If an implicated employee has died of whatever causes by the 
time that the Notice is ready to be sent, no Notice addressed to that 
employee is required.
    (g) Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report 
(Supplements or Employee Supplements). (1) Employee Statements 
Supplementing Railroad Accident Reports are voluntary, not mandatory; 
nonsubmission of a Supplement does not imply that the employee admits or 
endorses the railroad's conclusions as to cause or any other 
allegations.
    (2) Although a Supplement is completely optional and not required, 
if an employee wishes to submit a Supplement and assure that, after 
receipt, it will be properly placed by FRA in a file with the railroad's 
Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report and that it will be required to 
be reviewed by the railroad that issued the Notice, the Supplement must 
be made on part II of Form FRA F 6180.78 (entitled ``Notice to Railroad 
Employee Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to 
Employee Human Factor; Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad 
Accident Report''), following the instructions printed on the form. 
These instructions require that, within 35 days of the date that the 
Notice was hand delivered or sent by first class mail (postage prepaid) 
to the employee (except for good cause shown), the original of the 
Supplement be filed with FRA and a copy be hand delivered or sent by 
first class mail (postage prepaid) to the railroad that issued the 
Notice so that the railroad will have an opportunity to reassess its 
reports to FRA concerning the accident.
    (3) Information that the employee wishes to withhold from the 
railroad must not be included in this Supplement. If an employee wishes 
to provide confidential information to FRA, the employee should not use 
the Supplement form (part II of Form FRA F 6180.78), but rather provide 
such confidential information by other means, such as a letter to the 
employee's collective bargaining representative, or to the Federal 
Railroad Administration, Office of Safety Assurance and Compliance, RRS-
11, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. The letter should 
include the name of the railroad making the allegations, the date and 
place of the accident, and the rail equipment accident/incident number.
    (h) Willful false statements; penalties. If an employee chooses to 
submit a Supplement to FRA, all of the employee's assertions in the 
Supplement must be true and correct to the best of the employee's 
knowledge and belief.
    (1) Under 49 U.S.C. 21301, 21302, and 21304, any person who 
willfully files a false Supplement with FRA is subject to a civil 
penalty. See appendix A to this part.
    (2) Any person who knowingly and willfully files a false Supplement 
is subject to a $5,000 fine, or up to two years'' imprisonment, or both, 
under 49 U.S.C. 21311.

<R05>
Sec. 225.13  Late reports.

    Whenever a railroad discovers that a report of an accident/incident, 
through mistake or otherwise, has been improperly omitted from or 
improperly reported on its regular monthly accident/incident report, a 
report covering this accident/incident together with a letter of 
explanation must be submitted immediately. Whenever a railroad receives 
a partially or fully completed

[[Page 386]]

Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report (part II of 
Form FRA F 6180.78), in response to a Notice to Railroad Employee (part 
I of Form FRA F 6180.78) issued by the railroad and mailed or hand 
delivered to the employee, the railroad must promptly review that 
Supplement; based on that review, reassess the accuracy and validity of 
the railroad's Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report and of any other 
reports and records required by this part concerning the same accident, 
including the Employee Human Factor Attachment; make all justified 
revisions to each of those reports and records; submit any amended 
reports to FRA; and submit a copy of any amended Rail Equipment 
Accident/Incident Report, Employee Human Factor Attachment, and Highway-
Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report on the accident to the 
employee. A second notice under Sec. 225.12 is not required for the 
employee. If an employee who was never sent a notice under Sec. 225.12 
for that accident is implicated in the revised Employee Human Factor 
Attachment, the railroad must follow the procedures of Sec. 225.12(d).

[39 FR 43224, Dec. 11, 1974, as amended at 55 FR 37828, Sept. 13, 1990;

<R05>
Sec. 225.15  Accidents/incidents not to be reported.

    A railroad need not report:
    (a) Casualties which occur at highway-rail grade crossings that do 
not involve the presence or operation of on-track equipment, or the 
presence of railroad employees then engaged in the operation of a 
railroad;
    (b) Casualties in or about living quarters not arising from the 
operation of a railroad;
    (c) Suicides as determined by a coroner or other public authority; 
or
    (d) Attempted suicides.

<R05>
Sec. 225.17  Doubtful cases; alcohol or drug involvement.

    (a) The reporting officer of a railroad will ordinarily determine 
the reportability or nonreportability of an accident/incident after 
examining all evidence available. The FRA, however, cannot delegate 
authority to decide matters of judgment when facts are in dispute. In 
all such cases the decision shall be that of the FRA.
    (b) Even though there may be no witness to an accident/incident, if 
there is evidence indicating that a reportable accident/incident may 
have occurred, a report of that accident/incident must be made.
    (c) All accidents/incidents reported as ``claimed but not admitted 
by the railroad'' are given special examination by the FRA, and further 
inquiry may be ordered. Accidents/incidents accepted as reportable are 
tabulated and included in the various statistical statements issued by 
the FRA. The denial of any knowledge or refusal to admit responsibility 
by the railroad does not exclude those accidents/incidents from monthly 
and annual figures. Facts stated by a railroad that tend to refute the 
claim of an injured person are given consideration, and when the facts 
seem sufficient to support the railroad's position, the case is not 
allocated to the reporting railroad.
    (d)(1) In preparing a Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report under 
this part, the railroad shall make such specific inquiry as may be 
reasonable under the circumstances into the possible involvement of 
alcohol or drug use or impairment in such accident or incident. If the 
railroad comes into possession of any information whatsoever, whether or 
not confirmed, concerning alleged alcohol or drug use or impairment by 
an employee who was involved in, or arguably could be said to have been 
involved in, the accident/incident, the railroad shall report such 
alleged use or impairment as provided in the current FRA Guide for 
Preparing Accident/Incident Reports. If the railroad is in possession of 
such information but does not believe that alcohol or drug impairment 
was the primary or contributing cause of the accident/incident, then the 
railroad shall include in the narrative statement of such report a brief 
explanation of the basis of such determination.
    (2) For any train accident within the requirement for post-accident 
testing under Sec. 219.201 of this title, the railroad

[[Page 387]]

shall append to the Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report any report 
required by Sec. 219.209(b) (pertaining to failure to obtain samples 
for post-accident toxicological testing).
    (3) For any train or non-train incident, the railroad shall provide 
any available information concerning the possible involvement of alcohol 
or drug use or impairment in such accident or incident.
    (4) In providing information required by this paragraph, a railroad 
shall not disclose any information concerning use of controlled 
substances determined by the railroad's Medical Review Officer to have 
been consistent with 49 CFR 219.103.

FR 53279, Dec. 27, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 225.19  Primary groups of accidents/incidents.

    (a) For reporting purposes reportable railroad accidents/incidents 
are divided into three groups:

Group I--Highway-Rail Grade Crossing;
Group II--Rail Equipment;
Group III--Death, Injury and Occupational Illness.

    (b) Group I--Highway-rail grade crossing. Each highway-rail grade 
crossing accident/incident must be reported to the FRA on Form FRA F 
6180.57, regardless of the extent of damages or whether a casualty 
occurred. In addition, whenever a highway-rail grade crossing accident/
incident results in damages greater than the current reporting threshold 
to railroad on-track equipment, signals, track, track structures, or 
roadbed, that accident/incident shall be reported to the FRA on Form FRA 
F 6180.54. For reporting purposes, damages include labor costs and all 
other costs to repair or replace in kind damaged on-track equipment, 
signals, track, track structures, or roadbed, but do not include the 
cost of clearing a wreck.
    (c) Group II--Rail equipment. Rail equipment accidents/incidents are 
collisions, derailments, fires, explosions, acts of God, and other 
events involving the operation of on-track equipment (standing or 
moving) that result in damages higher than the current reporting 
threshold (i.e., $6,700 for calendar years 2002 through 2005, $7,700 for 
calendar year 2006, $8,200 for calendar year 2007, and $8,500 for 
calendar year 2008) to railroad on-track equipment, signals, tracks, 
track structures, or roadbed, including labor costs and the costs for 
acquiring new equipment and material. Each rail equipment accident/
incident must be reported to the FRA on Form FRA F 6180.54. If the 
property of more than one railroad is involved in an accident/incident, 
the reporting threshold is calculated by including the damages suffered 
by all of the railroads involved. See Sec. 225.23, Joint Operations. 
The reporting threshold will be reviewed periodically, and, if 
necessary, will be adjusted every year.
    (d) Group III--Death, injury, or occupational illness. Each event or 
exposure arising from the operation of a railroad shall be reported on 
Form FRA F 6180.55a if the event or exposure is a discernable cause of 
one or more of the following outcomes, and this outcome is a new case or 
a significant aggravation of a pre-existing injury or illness:
    (1) Death to any person;
    (2) Injury to any person that results in medical treatment;
    (3) Injury to a railroad employee that results in:
    (i) A day away from work;
    (ii) Restricted work activity or job transfer; or
    (iii) Loss of consciousness;
    (4) Occupational illness of a railroad employee that results in any 
of the following:
    (i) A day away from work;
    (ii) Restricted work activity or job transfer;
    (iii) Loss of consciousness; or
    (iv) Medical treatment;
    (5) Significant injury to or significant illness of a railroad 
employee diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care 
professional even if it does not result in death, a day away from work, 
restricted work activity or job transfer, medical treatment, or loss of 
consciousness;
    (6) Illness or injury that meets the application of any of the 
following specific case criteria:
    (i) Needlestick or sharps injury to a railroad employee;

[[Page 388]]

    (ii) Medical removal of a railroad employee;
    (iii) Occupational hearing loss of a railroad employee;
    (iv) Occupational tuberculosis of a railroad employee; or
    (v) Musculoskeletal disorder of a railroad employee if this disorder 
is independently reportable under one or more of the general reporting 
criteria.
    (e) The reporting threshold is $6,700 for calendar years 2002 
through 2005, $7,700 for calendar year 2006, $8,200 for calendar year 
2007 and $8,500 for calendar year 2008. The procedure for determining 
the reporting threshold for calendar years 2006 and beyond appears as 
paragraphs 1-8 of appendix B to part 225.

Sec. 225.21  Forms.

    The following forms and copies of the FRA Guide for Preparing 
Accident/Incident Reports may be obtained from the Office of Safety, 
FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.
    (a) Form FRA F 6180.54--Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report. 
Form FRA F 6180.54 shall be used to report each reportable rail 
equipment accident/incident which occurred during the preceding month.
    (b) Form FRA F 6180.55--Railroad Injury and Illness Summary. Form 
FRA F 6180.55 must be filed each month, even though no reportable 
accident/incident occurred during the month covered. Each report must 
include an oath or verification, made by the proper officer of the 
reporting railroad, as provided for attestation on the form. If no 
reportable accident/incident occurred during the month, that fact must 
be stated on this form. All railroads subject to this part, shall show 
on this form the total number of freight train miles, passenger train 
miles, yard switching train miles, and other train miles run during the 
month.
    (c) Form FRA 6180.55a--Railroad Injury and Illness (Continuation 
Sheet). Form FRA 6180.55a shall be used to report all reportable 
fatalities, injuries and occupational illnesses that occurred during the 
preceding month.
    (d) Form FRA 6180.56--Annual Railroad Report of Manhours by State. 
Form FRA 6180.56 shall be submitted as part of the monthly Railroad 
Injury and Illness Summary (Form FRA F 6180.55) for the month of 
December of each year.
    (e) Form FRA F 6180.57--Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/
Incident Report. Form FRA F 6180.57 shall be used to report each 
highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident which occurred during the 
preceding month.
    (f) Form FRA F 6180.81--Employee Human Factor Attachment. Form FRA F 
6180.81 shall be used by railroads, as a supplement to the Rail 
Equipment Accident/Incident Report (Form FRA F 6180.54), in reporting 
rail equipment accidents/incidents that they attribute to an employee 
human factor. This form shall be completed in accordance with 
instructions printed on the form and in the current ``FRA Guide for 
Preparing Accident/Incident Reports.'' The form shall be attached to the 
Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report and shall be submitted within 30 
days after expiration of the month in which the accident/incident 
occurred.
    (g) Form FRA F 6180.78--Notice to Railroad Employee Involved in Rail 
Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Employee Human Factor; 
Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report. When a 
railroad alleges, in the Employee Human Factor Attachment to a Rail 
Equipment Accident/Incident Report, that the act, omission, or physical 
condition of a specific employee was a primary or contributing cause of 
the rail equipment accident/incident, the railroad shall complete part I 
of Form FRA F 6180.78 to notify each such employee identified that the 
railroad

[[Page 389]]

has made such allegation and that the employee has the right to submit a 
statement to FRA. The railroad shall then submit the entire form, parts 
I and II, to the employee. The Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad 
Accident Report (Employee Supplement) is completely at the option of the 
employee; however, if the employee desires to make a statement about the 
accident that will become part of the railroad's Rail Equipment 
Accident/Incident Report, the employee shall complete the Employee 
Supplement form (part II of Form FRA F 6180.78) and shall then submit 
the original of the entire form, parts I and II, and any attachments, to 
FRA and submit a copy of the same to the railroad that issued the Notice 
in part I.
    (h) Form FRA F 6180.98--Railroad Employee Injury and/or Illness 
Record. Form FRA F 6180.98 or an alternative railroad-designed record 
shall be used by the railroads to record all reportable and accountable 
injuries and illnesses to railroad employees for each establishment. 
This record shall be completed and maintained in accordance with the 
requirements set forth in Sec. 225.25.
    (i) Form FRA F 6180.97--Initial Rail Equipment Accident/Incident 
Record. Form FRA F 6180.97 or an alternative railroad-designed record 
shall be used by the railroads to record all reportable and accountable 
rail equipment accidents/incidents for each establishment. This record 
shall be completed and maintained in accordance with the requirements 
set forth in Sec. 225.25.
    (j) Form FRA 6180.107--Alternative Record for Illnesses Claimed To 
Be Work-Related. (1) Form FRA F 6180.107 shall be used by a railroad to 
record each illness claimed to be work-related that is reported to the 
railroad--
    (i) For which there is insufficient information to determine whether 
the illness is work-related;
    (ii) For which the railroad has made a preliminary determination 
that the illness is not work-related; or
    (iii) For which the railroad has made a final determination that the 
illness is not work-related.
    (2) For any case determined to be reportable, the designation 
``illness claimed to be work-related'' shall be removed, and the record 
shall be transferred to the reporting officer for retention and 
reporting in the normal manner.
    (3) In the event the narrative block (similar to Form FRA F 6180.98, 
block 39) indicates that the case is not reportable, the explanation 
contained on that block shall record the reasons the railroad determined 
that the case is not reportable, making reference to the most 
authoritative information relied upon.
    (4) Although the Form FRA F 6180.107 may not include all supporting 
documentation, such as medical records, the Form FRA F 6180.107 shall 
note the name, title, and address of the custodian of those documents 
and where the supporting documents are located so that they are readily 
accessible to FRA upon request.

Sec. 225.23  Joint operations.

    (a) Any reportable death, injury, or illness of an employee arising 
from an accident/incident involving joint operations must be reported on 
Form FRA F 6180.55a by the employing railroad.
    (b) In all cases involving joint operations, each railroad must 
report on Form FRA F 6180.55a the casualties to all persons on its train 
or other on-track equipment. Casualties to railroad employees must be 
reported by the employing railroad regardless of whether the employees 
were on or off duty. Casualties to all other persons not on trains or 
on-track equipment must be reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a by the 
railroad whose train or equipment is involved. Any person found 
unconscious or dead, if such condition arose from the operation of a 
railroad, on or adjacent to the premises or right-of-way of the railroad 
having track maintenance responsibility must be reported by that 
railroad on Form FRA F 6180.55a.
    (c) In rail equipment accident/incident cases involving joint 
operations, the railroad responsible for carrying out repairs to, and 
maintenance of, the track on which the accident/incident

[[Page 390]]

incident on the appropriate record, as required by paragraphs (a) 
through (e) of this section, as early as practicable but no later than 
seven working days after receiving information or acquiring knowledge 
that an injury or illness or rail equipment accident/incident has 
occurred.
    (g) The records required under paragraphs (a) through (e) of this 
section may be maintained at the local establishment or, alternatively, 
at a centralized location. If the records are maintained at a 
centralized location, but not through electronic means, then a paper 
copy of the records that is current within 35 days of the month to which 
it applies shall be available for that establishment. If the records are 
maintained at a centralized location through electronic means, then the 
records for that establishment shall be available for review in a hard 
copy format within four business hours of FRA's request. FRA recognizes 
that circumstances outside the railroad's control may preclude it from 
fulfilling the four-business-hour time limit. In these circumstances, 
FRA will not assess a monetary penalty against the railroad for its 
failure to provide the requested documentation provided the railroad 
made a reasonable effort to correct the problem.
    (h) Except as provided in paragraph(h)(15) of this section, a 
listing of all injuries and occupational illnesses reported to FRA as

the month during which the injuries and illnesses occurred, if the 
establishment has been in continual operation for a minimum of 90 
calendar days. If the establishment has not been in continual operation 
for a minimum of 90 calendar days, the listing of all injuries and 
occupational illnesses reported to FRA as having occurred at the 
establishment shall be posted, within 30 days after the expiration of 
the month during which the injuries and illnesses occurred, in a 
conspicuous location at the next higher organizational level 
establishment, such as one of the following: an operating division 
headquarters; a major classification yard or terminal headquarters; a 
major equipment maintenance or repair installation, e.g., a locomotive 
or rail car repair or construction facility; a railroad signal and 
maintenance-of-way division headquarters; or a central location where 
track or signal maintenance

[[Page 393]]

employees are assigned as a headquarters or receive work assignments. 
These examples include facilities that are generally major facilities of 
a permanent nature where the railroad generally posts or disseminates 
company informational notices and policies, e.g., the policy statement 
in the internal control plan required by Sec. 225.33 concerning 
harassment and intimidation. At a minimum, ``establishment'' posting is 
required and shall include locations where a railroad reasonably expects 
its employees to report during a 12-month period and to have the 
opportunity to observe the posted list containing any reportable 
injuries or illnesses they have suffered during the applicable period. 
This listing shall be posted and shall remain continuously displayed for 
the next twelve consecutive months. Incidents reported for employees at 
that establishment shall be displayed in date sequence. The listing 
shall contain, at a minimum, the information specified in paragraphs 
(h)(1) through (14) of this section.
    (1) Name and address of the establishment;

establishment;
    (12) Preparer's name, title, telephone number with area code, and 
signature (or, in lieu of signing each establishment's list of 
reportable injuries and illnesses, the railroad's preparer of this 
monthly list may sign a cover sheet or memorandum which contains a list 
of each railroad establishment for which a monthly list of reportable 
injuries and illnesses has been prepared. This cover memorandum shall be 
signed by the preparer and shall have attached to it a duplicate copy of 
each establishment's list of monthly reportable injuries and illnesses. 
The preparer of the monthly lists of reportable injuries and illnesses 
shall mail or send by facsimile each establishment's list to the 
establishment in the time frame prescribed in paragraph (h) of this 
section.); and
    (13) Date the record was completed.
    (14) When there are no reportable injuries or occupational illnesses 
associated with an establishment for that month, the listing shall make 
reference to this fact.
    (15) The railroad is permitted not to post information on an 
occupational injury or illness that is a privacy concern case.
    (i) Claimed Occupational Illnesses. (1) Each railroad shall maintain 
either the Form FRA F 6180.107, to the extent that the information is 
reasonably available, or an alternate railroad-designed record 
containing the same information as called for on the Form FRA F 
6180.107, to the extent that the information is reasonably available, 
for each illness claimed to be work-related--
    (i) For which there is insufficient information to determine whether 
the illness is work-related;
    (ii) For which the railroad has made a preliminary determination 
that the illness is not work-related; or
    (iii) For which the railroad has made a final determination that the 
illness is not work-related.
    (2) For any case determined to be reportable, the designation 
``illness claimed to be work-related'' shall be removed, and the record 
shall be transferred to the reporting officer for retention and 
reporting in the normal manner.
    (3) In the event the narrative block (similar to Form FRA F 6180.98, 
block 39) indicates that the case is not reportable, the explanation 
contained on that block shall record the reasons the railroad determined 
that the case is not reportable, making reference to the most 
authoritative information relied upon.
    (4) In the event the railroad must amend the record with new or 
additional information, the railroad shall have up until December 1 of 
the next

[[Page 394]]

calendar year for reporting accidents/incidents to make the update.
    (5) Although the Alternative Record for Illnesses Claimed to be 
Work-Related (or the alternate railroad-designed form) may not include 
all supporting documentation, such as medical records, the alternative 
record shall note the custodian of those documents and where the 
supporting documents are located so that they are readily accessible to 
FRA upon request.

Sec. 225.35  Access to records and reports.

    (a) Each railroad subject to this part shall have at least one 
location, and shall identify each location, where any representative of 
the Federal Railroad Administration or of a State agency participating 
in investigative and surveillance activities under part 212 of this 
chapter or any other authorized representative, has centralized access 
to a copy of any record and report required under this part, for 
examination and photocopying in a reasonable manner during normal 
business hours.
    (b) Each railroad subject to this part shall also provide to any 
representative of the Federal Railroad Administration or of a State 
agency participating in investigative or and surveillance activities 
under part 212 of this chapter or any other authorized representative 
access to relevant medical and claims records for examination and 
photocopying in a reasonable manner during normal business hours. Such 
representatives shall display proper credentials when requested. Each 
railroad shall identify the locations where a copy of any record and 
report required under this part is accessible for inspection and 
photocopying by maintaining a list of such establishment locations at 
the office where the railroad's reporting officer conducts his or her 
official business. A copy of any record and report required under this 
part shall be accessible within four business hours after the request. 
The Form FRA F 6180.107 or the alternate railroad-designed form need not 
be provided at any railroad establishment within 4 hours of a request. 
Rather, the Form FRA F 6180.107 or the alternate railroad-designed form 
must be provided upon request, within five business days, and may be 
kept at a central location, in either paper or electronic format. FRA 
will not assess a monetary penalty against the railroad for its failure 
to provide the requested documentation when circumstances outside the 
railroad's control preclude it from fulfilling the four-business-hour 
time limit and the railroad has made a reasonable effort to correct the 
problem. Should a railroad assert a legal privilege with respect to 
certain claims and medical records, failure to provide FRA access to 
such records would not constitute a violation of this section. FRA 
retains the right to issue a subpoena to obtain such records under 49 
U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 20107 and 20902 and Sec. Sec. 209.7(a) and 225.31(b) 
of this title, and the railroad may contest that subpoena.

<R05>
    Sec. Appendix B to Part 225--Procedure for Determining Reporting 
                                Threshold

    1. Wage data used in the calculation are collected from railroads by 
the Surface Transportation Board (STB) on Form A--STB Wage Statistics. 
Rail equipment data from the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (BLS), LABSTAT Series reports are used in the calculation. 
The equation used to adjust the reporting threshold has two components: 
(a) The average hourly earnings of certain railroad maintenance 
employees as reported to the STB by the Class I railroads and Amtrak; 
and (b) an overall rail equipment cost index determined by the BLS. The 
wage component is weighted by 40% and the equipment component by 60%.
    2. For the wage component, the average of the data from Form A--STB 
Wage Statistics for Group No. 300 (Maintenance of Way and Structures) 
and Group No. 400 (Maintenance of Equipment and Stores) employees is 
used.
    3. For the equipment component, LABSTAT Series Report, Producer 
Price Index (PPI) Series WPU 144 for Railroad Equipment is used.
    4. In the month of October, second-quarter wage data are obtained 
from the STB. For equipment costs, the corresponding BLS railroad 
equipment indices for the second quarter are obtained. As the equipment 
index is reported monthly rather than quarterly, the average for the 
months of April, May and June is used for the threshold calculation.
    5. The wage data are reported in terms of dollars earned per hour, 
while the equipment cost data are indexed to a base year of 1982.
    6. The procedure for adjusting the reporting threshold is shown in 
the formula below. The wage component appears as a fractional change 
relative to the prior year, while the equipment component is a 
difference of two percentages which must be divided by 100 to present it 
in a consistent fractional form. After performing the calculation, the 
result is rounded to the nearest $100.
    7. The weightings result from using STB wage data and BLS equipment 
cost data to produce a reasonable estimation of the reporting threshold 
that was calculated using the threshold formula in effect immediately 
before calendar year 2006, a formula that assumed damage repair costs, 
at levels at or near the threshold, were split approximately evenly 
between labor and materials.
    8. Formula:

New Threshold = Prior Threshold x [1 + 0.4(Wnew--Wprior)/Wprior + 
          0.6(Enew - Eprior)/100]

Where:

Wnew = New average hourly wage rate ($).
Wprior = Prior average hourly wage rate ($).
Enew = New equipment average PPI value.
Eprior = Prior equipment average PPI value.

locomotive repair or servicing areas, as provided in Sec. Sec. 218.5 
and 218.29(a) of this chapter, or
    (ii) Employees who move a locomotive or group of locomotives for 
distances of less than 100 feet and this incidental movement of a 
locomotive or locomotives is for inspection or maintenance purposes, or
    (iii) Contractors who operate historic equipment in occasional 
service, provided that the contractors have been provided with hearing 
protectors and, where necessary, are required to use the hearing 
protectors while operating the historic equipment;
    (2) Any direct supervisor of the persons described in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section whose duties require frequent work in the 
locomotive cab; and
    (3) At the election of the railroad, any other person (including a 
person excluded by paragraph (a)(1) of this section) whose duties 
require frequent work in the locomotive cab and whose primary noise 
exposure is reasonably expected to be experienced in the cab, if the 
position occupied by such person is designated in writing by the 
railroad, as required by Sec. 227.121(d).
    (b) Occupational noise exposure and hearing conservation for 
employees not covered by this subpart is governed by the appropriate 
occupational noise exposure regulation of the U.S. Department of Labor, 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration located at 29 CFR 1910.95.


<R05>
Sec. 227.103  Noise monitoring program.

    (a) Schedule. A railroad shall develop and implement a noise 
monitoring program to determine whether any employee covered by the 
scope of this subpart may be exposed to noise that may equal or exceed 
an 8-hour TWA of 85 dB(A), in accordance with the following schedule:
    (1) Class 1, passenger, and commuter railroads no later than 
February 26, 2008.
    (2) Railroads with 400,000 or more annual employee hours that are 
not Class 1, passenger, or commuter railroads no later than August 26, 
2008.

    (3) Railroads with fewer than 400,000 annual employee hours no later 
than August 26, 2009.
    (b) Sampling strategy. (1) In its monitoring program, the railroad 
shall use a sampling strategy that is designed to identify employees for 
inclusion in the hearing conservation program and to enable the proper 
selection of hearing protection.
    (2) Where circumstances such as high worker mobility, significant 
variations in sound level, or a significant component of impulse noise 
make area monitoring generally inappropriate, the railroad shall use 
representative personal sampling to comply with the monitoring 
requirements of this section, unless the railroad can show that area 
sampling produces equivalent results.
    (c) Noise measurements. (1) All continuous, intermittent, and 
impulse sound levels from 80 decibels to 140 decibels shall be 
integrated into the noise measurements.
    (2) Noise measurements shall be made under typical operating

Sec. 227.109  Audiometric testing program.

    (a) Each railroad shall establish and maintain an audiometric 
testing program as set forth in this section and include employees who 
are required to be included in a hearing conservation program pursuant 
to Sec. 227.107.
    (b) Cost. The audiometric tests shall be provided at no cost to 
employees.
    (c) Tests. Audiometric tests shall be performed by:
    (1) An audiologist, otolaryngologist, or other physician who has 
experience and expertise in hearing and hearing loss; or
    (2) A qualified technician.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Baseline audiogram. This paragraph (e) applies to employees who 
are required by Sec. 227.107 to be included in a hearing conservation 
program.
    (1) New employees. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii), 
for employees hired after February 26, 2007, the railroad shall 
establish a valid baseline audiogram within 6 months of the new 
employee's first tour of duty.
    (ii) Where mobile test vans are used to meet the requirement in 
paragraph (e)(1)(i), the railroad shall establish a valid baseline 
audiogram within one year of the new employee's first tour of duty.
    (2) Existing employees. (i) For all employees without a baseline 
audiogram as of February 26, 2007, Class 1, passenger, and commuter 
railroads, and railroads with 400,000 or more annual employee hours 
shall establish a valid baseline audiogram by February 26, 2009; and 
railroads with less than 400,000 annual employee hours shall establish a 
valid baseline audiogram by February 26, 2010.
    (ii) If an employee has had a baseline audiogram as of February 26, 
2007, and it was obtained under conditions that satisfy the requirements 
found in 29 CFR 1910.95(h), the railroad must use that baseline 
audiogram.
    (iii) If the employee has had a baseline audiogram as of February 
26, 2007, and it was obtained under conditions that satisfy the 
requirements in 29 CFR 1910.95(h)(1), but not the requirements found in 
29 CFR 1910.95(h)(2) through (5), the railroad may elect to use that 
baseline audiogram provided that the Professional Supervisor of the 
Audiometric Monitoring Program makes a reasonable determination that the 
baseline audiogram is valid and is clinically consistent with other 
materials in the employee's medical file.
    (3) Testing to establish a baseline audiogram shall be preceded by 
at least 14 hours without exposure to occupational noise in excess of 
the action level. Hearing protectors may be used as a substitute for the 
requirement that baseline audiograms be preceded

[[Page 405]]

by 14 hours without exposure to occupational noise.
    (4) The railroad shall notify its employees of the need to avoid 
high levels of non-occupational noise exposure during the 14-hour period 
immediately preceding the audiometric examination.
    (f) Periodic audiogram. (1) The railroad shall offer an audiometric 
test to each employee included in the hearing conservation program at 
least once each calendar year. The interval between the date offered to 
any employee for a test in a calendar year and the date offered in the 
subsequent calendar year shall be no more than 450 days and no less than 
280 days.
    (2) The railroad shall require each employee included in the hearing 
conservation program to take an audiometric test at least once every 
1095 days.
    (g) Evaluation of audiogram. (1) Each employee's periodic audiogram 
shall be compared to that employee's baseline audiogram to determine if 
the audiogram is valid and to determine if a standard threshold shift 
has occurred. This comparison may be done by a qualified technician.
    (2) If the periodic audiogram demonstrates a standard threshold 
shift, a railroad may obtain a retest within 90 days. The railroad may 
consider the results of the retest as the periodic audiogram.
    (3) The audiologist, otolaryngologist, or physician shall review 
problem audiograms and shall determine whether there is a need for 
further evaluation. A railroad shall provide all of the following 
information to the person performing this review:
    (i) The baseline audiogram of the employee to be evaluated;
    (ii) The most recent audiogram of the employee to be evaluated;
    (iii) Measurements of background sound pressure levels in the 
audiometric test room as required in appendix D of this part: 
Audiometric Test Rooms; and
    (iv) Records of audiometer calibrations required by Sec. 227.111.
    (h) Follow-up procedures. (1) If a comparison of the periodic 
audiogram to the baseline audiogram indicates that a standard threshold 
shift has occurred, the railroad shall inform the employee in writing 
within 30 days of the determination.
    (2) Unless a physician or audiologist determines that the standard 
threshold shift is not work-related or aggravated by occupational noise 
exposure, the railroad shall ensure that the following steps are taken:
    (i) Employees not using hearing protectors shall be fitted with 
hearing protectors, shall be trained in their use and care, and shall be 
required to use them.
    (ii) Employees already provided with hearing protectors shall be 
refitted, shall be retrained in the use of hearing protectors offering 
greater attenuation, if necessary, and shall be required to use them.
    (iii) If subsequent audiometric testing is necessary or if the 
railroad suspects that a medical pathology of the ear is caused or 
aggravated by the wearing of hearing protectors, the railroad shall 
refer the employee for a clinical audiological evaluation or an 
otological examination.
    (iv) If the railroad suspects that a medical pathology of the ear 
unrelated to the use of hearing protectors is present, the railroad 
shall inform the employee of the need for an otological examination.
    (3) If subsequent audiometric testing of an employee, whose exposure 
to noise is less than an 8-hour TWA of 90 dB, indicates that a standard 
threshold shift is not persistent, the railroad shall inform the 
employee of the new audiometric interpretation and may discontinue the 
required use of hearing protectors for that employee.
    (i) Revised baseline. A railroad shall use the following methods for 
revising baseline audiograms:
    (1) Periodic audiograms from audiometric tests conducted through 
February 26, 2009, may be substituted for the baseline measurement by 
the Professional Supervisor of the Audiometric Monitoring Program who is 
evaluating the audiogram if:
    (i) The standard threshold shift revealed by the audiogram is 
persistent; or

[[Page 406]]

    (ii) The hearing threshold shown in the periodic audiogram indicates 
significant improvement over the baseline audiogram.
    (2) Baseline audiograms from audiometric tests conducted after 
February 26, 2009, shall be revised in accordance with the method 
specified in appendix C of this part: Audiometric Baseline Revision.
    (j) Standard threshold shift. In determining whether a standard 
threshold shift has occurred, allowance may be made for the contribution 
of aging (presbycusis) to the change in hearing level by correcting the 
annual audiogram according to the procedure described in appendix F of 
this part: Calculation and Application of Age Correction to Audiograms.

         Sec. Appendix A to Part 227--Noise Exposure Computation

    This appendix is mandatory.

                I. Computation of Employee Noise Exposure

    A. Noise dose is computed using Table A-1 as follows:
    1. When the sound level, L, is constant over the entire work day, 
the noise dose, D, in percent, is given by: D = 100 C/T, where C is the 
total length of the work day, in hours, and T is the duration permitted 
corresponding to the measured sound level, L, as given in Table A-1.
    2. When the work day noise exposure is composed of two or more 
periods of noise at different levels, the total noise dose over the work 
day is given by:

D = 100 (C1/T1 + C2/T2 + . . . + Cn/Tn), where Cn indicates the total 
time of exposure at a specific noise level, and Tn indicates the 
duration permitted for that level as given by Table A-1.

    B. The eight-hour TWA in dB may be computed from the dose, in 
percent, by means of the formula: TWA = 16.61 log10 (D/100) + 90. For an 
eight-hour work day with the noise level constant over the entire day, 
the TWA is equal to the measured sound level.
    C. Exposure to impulsive or impact noise should not exceed 140 dB 
peak sound pressure level.
    D. Any time that an employee spends deadheading shall be included in 
the calculation of the noise dose.
    E. A table relating dose and TWA is given in Section II of this 
Appendix.

\1\ Numbers above 115 dB(A) are italicized to indicate that they are
  noise levels that are not permitted. The italicized numbers are
  included only because they are sometimes necessary for the computation
  of noise dose.

    In the above table the duration permitted, T, is computed by
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC06.004
    
where L is the measured A-weighted sound level.

  II. Conversion Between ``Dose'' and ``8-Hour Time-Weighted Average'' 
                               Sound Level

    A. Compliance with subpart B of part 227 is determined by the amount 
of exposure to noise in the workplace. The amount of such exposure is 
usually measured with a dosimeter which gives a readout in terms of 
``dose.'' In order to better understand the requirements of the 
regulation, dosimeter readings can be converted to an ``8-hour TWA.''
    B. In order to convert the reading of a dosimeter into TWA, see 
Table A-2, below. This table applies to dosimeters that are set by the 
manufacturer to calculate dose or percent exposure according to the 
relationships in Table A-1. So, for example, a dose of 91 percent over 
an eight-hour day results in a TWA of 89.3 dB, and a dose of 50 percent 
corresponds to a TWA of 85 dB.
    C. If the dose as read on the dosimeter is less than or greater than 
the values found in Table A-2, the TWA may be calculated by using the 
formula: TWA = 16.61 log10 (D/100) + 90 where TWA = 8-hour time-weighted 
average sound level and D = accumulated dose in percent exposure.

  Sec. Appendix B to Part 227--Methods for Estimating the Adequacy of 

                      Hearing Protector Attenuation

    This appendix is mandatory.
    Employers must select one of the following three methods by which to 
estimate the adequacy of hearing protector attenuation.

                            I. Derate by Type

    Derate the hearing protector attenuation by type using the following 
requirements:
    A. Subtract 7 dB from the published Noise Reduction Rating (NRR).
    B. Reduce the resulting amount by:
    1. 20% for earmuffs,
    2. 40% for form-able earplugs, or
    3. 60% for all other earplugs.
    C. Subtract the remaining amount from the A-weighted TWA. You will 
have the estimated A-weighted TWA for that hearing protector.

[[Page 412]]

           II. Method B From ANSI S12.6-1997 (Reaffirmed 2002)

    Use Method B, which is found in ANSI S12.6-1997 (Reaffirmed 2002) 
``Methods for Measuring the Real-Ear Attenuation of Hearing 
Protectors.'' The Director of the Federal Register approves the 
incorporation by reference of this standard in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 
552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. You may obtain a copy of the incorporated 
standard from the American National Standards Institute at 1819 L 
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20036, or http://www.ansi.org. You may 
inspect a copy of the incorporated standard at the Federal Railroad 
Administration, Docket Room, 1120 Vermont Ave., Suite 700, Washington, 
DC 20005, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). 
For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-
741-6030, or go to http://www.archives.gov/federal--register/code--of--
federal--regulations/ibr--locations.html.

                       III. Objective Measurement

    Use actual measurements of the level of noise exposure (as an A-
weighted SLOW response dose) inside the hearing protector when the 
employee wears the hearing protector in the actual work environment.


<R05>
       Sec. Appendix C to Part 227--Audiometric Baseline Revision

    This appendix is mandatory beginning on February 26, 2009.

                               I. General

    A. A professional reviewer (audiologist, otolaryngologist, or 
physician) shall use these procedures when revising baseline audiograms.
    B. Although these procedures can be programmed by a computer to 
identify records for potential revision, the final decision for revision 
rests with a human being. Because the goal of the guidelines is to 
foster consistency among different professional reviewers, human 
override of the guidelines must be justified by specific concrete 
reasons.
    C. These procedures do not apply to: The identification of standard 
threshold shifts (STS) other than an FRA STS \1\ or to the calculation 
of the 25-dB average shifts that are reportable on the Form FRA F 
6180.55a.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ OSHA and FRA use the same definition for Standard Threshold 
Shift (STS). FRA's definition is located in Sec. 227.5. OSHA's 
definition is located in 29 CFR 1910.95(g)(10)(i).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    D. Initially, the baseline is the latest audiogram obtained before 
entry into the hearing conservation program. If no appropriate pre-entry 
audiogram exists, the baseline is the first audiogram obtained after 
entry into the hearing conservation program. Each subsequent audiogram 
is reviewed to detect improvement in the average (average of thresholds 
at 2, 3, and 4 kHz) and to detect an FRA STS. The two ears are examined 
separately and independently for improvement and for worsening. If one 
ear meets the criteria for revision of baseline, then the baseline is 
revised for that ear only. Therefore, if the two ears show different 
hearing trends, the baseline for the left ear may be from one test date, 
while the baseline for the right ear may be from a different test date.
    E. Age corrections do not apply in considering revisions for 
improvement (Rule 1). The FRA-allowed age corrections from appendix F of 
Part 227 \2\ may be used, if desired, before considering revision for 
persistent STS. Rule 2 operates in the same way, whether age corrections 
are used or not.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ FRA and OSHA use the same age-correction provisions. FRA's is 
found in appendix F of part 227 and OSHA's in appendix F of 29 CFR 
1910.95.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

             II. Rule 1: Revision for Persistent Improvement

    If the average of the thresholds for 2, 3, and 4 kHz for either ear 
shows an improvement of 5 dB or more from the baseline value, and the 
improvement is present on one test and persistent on the next test, then 
the record should be identified for review by the audiologist, 
otolaryngologist, or physician for potential revision of the baseline 
for persistent improvement. The baseline for that ear should be revised 
to the test which shows the lower (more sensitive) value for the average 
of thresholds at 2, 3, and 4 kHz unless the audiologist, 
otolaryngologist, or physician determines and documents specific reasons 
for not revising. If the values of the three-frequency average are 
identical for the two tests, then the earlier test becomes the revised 
baseline.

      III. Rule 2: Revision for Persistent Standard Threshold Shift

    A. If the average of thresholds for 2, 3, and 4 kHz for either ear 
shows a worsening of 10 dB or more from the baseline value, and the STS 
persists on the next periodic test (or the next test given at least 6 
months later), then the record should be identified for review by the 
audiologist, otolaryngologist, or physician for potential revision of 
the baseline for persistent worsening. Unless the audiologist, 
otolaryngologist, or physician determines and documents specific reasons 
for not revising, the baseline for that ear should be revised to the 
test which shows the lower (more sensitive) value for the average of 
thresholds at 2, 3, and 4 kHz. If both tests show the same numerical 
value for the average of 2, 3, and 4 kHz, then the audiologist,

[[Page 413]]

otolaryngologist, or physician should revise the baseline to the earlier 
of the two tests, unless the later test shows better (more sensitive) 
thresholds for other test frequencies.
    B. Following an STS, a retest within 90 days of the periodic test 
may be substituted for the periodic test if the retest shows better 
(more sensitive) results for the average threshold at 2, 3, and 4 kHz.
    C. If the retest is used in place of the periodic test, then the 
periodic test is retained in the record, but it is marked in such a way 
that it is no longer considered in baseline revision evaluations. If a 
retest within 90 days of periodic test confirms an FRA STS shown on the 
periodic test, the baseline will not be revised at that point because 
the required six-month interval between tests showing STS persistence 
has not been met. The purpose of the six-month requirement is to prevent 
premature baseline revision when STS is the result of temporary medical 
conditions affecting hearing.
    D. Although a special retest after six months could be given, if 
desired, to assess whether the STS is persistent, in most cases, the 
next annual audiogram would be used to evaluate persistence of the STS.

           Sec. Appendix D to Part 227--Audiometric Test Rooms

    This appendix is mandatory.
    A. Rooms used for audiometric testing shall not have background 
sound pressure levels exceeding those in Table D-1 when measured by 
equipment conforming at least to the Type 2 requirements of ANSI S1.4-
1983 (Reaffirmed 2001) and to the Class 2 requirements of ANSI S1.11-
2004, ``Specification for Octave-Band and Fractional-Octave-Band Analog 
and Digital Filters.''
    B. The Director of the Federal Register approves the incorporation 
by reference of ANSI S1.4-1983 (Reaffirmed 2001) and S.1.11-2004 in this 
section in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. You may

  Sec. Appendix E to Part 227--Use of Insert Earphones for Audiometric 
                                 Testing

    This appendix is mandatory.
    Section 227.111(d) allows railroads to use insert earphones for 
audiometric testing. Railroads are not required to use insert earphones, 
however, where they elect to use insert earphones, they must comply with 
the requirements of this appendix.

                            I. Acceptable Fit

    A. The audiologist, otolaryngologist, or other physician responsible 
for conducting the audiometric testing, shall identify ear canals that 
prevent achievement of an acceptable fit with insert earphones, or shall 
assure that any technician under his/her authority who conducts 
audiometric testing with insert earphones has the ability to identify 
such ear canals.
    B. Technicians who conduct audiometric tests must be trained to 
insert the earphones correctly into the ear canals of test subjects and 
to recognize conditions where ear canal size prevents achievement of an 
acceptable insertion depth (fit).
    C. Insert earphones shall not be used for audiometric testing of 
employees with ear canal sizes that prevent achievement of an acceptable 
insertion depth (fit).

                             II. Proper Use

    The manufacturer's guidelines for proper use of insert earphones 
must be followed.

                       III. Audiometer Calibration

    A. Audiometers used with insert earphones must be calibrated in 
accordance with ANSI S3.6-2004, ``Specification for Audiometers.'' The 
Director of the Federal Register approves the incorporation by reference 
of this standard in this section in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 
1 CFR part 51. You may obtain a copy of the incorporated standard from

one of the couplers listed in Table 7 of ANSI S3.6-2004.
    C. The acoustical calibration shall be conducted annually.
    D. The functional calibration must be conducted before each day's 
use of the audiometer.

                       IV. Background Noise Levels

    Testing shall be conducted in a room where the background ambient 
noise octave-band sound pressures levels meet appendix D to this part.

                V. Conversion From Supra Aural Earphones

    At the time of conversion from supra-aural to insert earphones, 
testing must be performed with both types of earphones.
    A. The test subject must have a quiet period of at least 14 hours 
before testing. Hearing protectors may be used as a substitute for the 
quiet period.
    B. The supra-aural earphone audiogram shall be compared to the 
baseline audiogram, or the revised baseline audiogram if appropriate, to 
check for a Standard Threshold Shift (STS). In accordance with Sec. 
227.109(f)(2), if the audiogram shows an STS, retesting with supra-aural 
earphones must be performed within 90 days. If the resulting audiogram 
confirms the STS, then it is adopted as the current test instead of the 
prior one.
    C. If retesting with supra-aural earphones is performed, then 
retesting with insert earphones must be performed at that time to 
establish the baseline for future audiometric tests using the insert 
earphones.

                     VI. Revised Baseline Audiograms

    A. If an STS is confirmed by the re-test with supra-aural earphones, 
the audiogram may become the revised baseline audiogram per the 
requirements of Sec. 227.109(i) for all future hearing tests with 
supra-aural earphones. The insert-earphone audiogram will become the new 
reference baseline audiogram for all future hearing tests performed with 
insert earphones.
    B. If an STS is not indicated by the test with supra-aural 
earphones, the baseline audiogram remains the reference baseline 
audiogram for all future supra-aural earphone tests, until such time as 
an STS is observed. In this case, the insert-earphone audiogram taken at 
the same time will become the new reference baseline audiogram for all 
future hearing tests performed with insert earphones.
    C. Transitioning Employees with Partial Shifts. Employers must 
account for the workers who are in the process of developing an STS 
(e.g., demonstrate a 7 dB average shift), but who at the time of the 
conversion to insert earphones do not have a 10 dB average shift. 
Employers who want to use insert earphones must enter the 7 dB shift 
information in the employee's audiometric test records although it is 
not an ``STS''. When the next annual audiogram using insert earphones 
shows an average threshold shift at 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz of 3 dB, 
completing the full shift (7 dB + 3 dB), employers must then label that 
average shift as an STS. This triggers the follow-up procedures at Sec. 
227.109(h).

                              VII. Records

    All audiograms (including both those produced through the use of 
insert earphones and supra-aural headsets), calculations, pure-tone 
individual and average threshold shifts, full STS migrations, and 
audiometric acoustical calibration records, are to be preserved as 
records and maintained according to Sec. 227.121(c).

    Sec. Appendix F to Part 227--Calculations and Application of Age 

                        Corrections to Audiograms

    This appendix is non-mandatory.
    In determining whether a standard threshold shift (STS) has 
occurred, allowance may be made for the contribution of aging to the 
change in hearing level by adjusting the most recent audiogram. If the 
employer chooses to adjust the audiogram, the employer shall follow the 
procedure described below. This procedure and the age correction tables 
were developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health in a criteria document. See ``Criteria for a Recommended 
Standard: Occupational Exposure to Noise,'' Department of Health and 
Human Services (NIOSH) Publication No. 98-126. For each audiometric test 
frequency:
    I. Determine from Tables F-1 or F-2 the age correction values for 
the employee by:
    A. Finding the age at which the most recent audiogram was taken and 
recording the corresponding values of age corrections at 1000 Hz through 
6000 Hz;
    B. Finding the age at which the baseline audiogram was taken and 
recording the corresponding values of age corrections at 1000 Hz through 
6000 Hz.
    II. Subtract the values found in step (I)(B) from the value found in 
step (I)(A).
    III. The differences calculated in step (II) represented that 
portion of the change in hearing that may be due to aging.

    a. The audiogram at age 27 is considered the baseline since it shows 
the best hearing threshold levels. Asterisks have been used to identify 
the baseline and most recent audiogram. A threshold shift of 20 dB 
exists at 4000 Hz between the audiograms taken at ages 27 and 32.
    b. (The threshold shift is computed by subtracting the hearing 
threshold at age 27, which was 5, from the hearing threshold at age 32, 
which is 25). A retest audiogram has confirmed this shift. The 
contribution of aging to this change in hearing may be estimated in the 
following manner:
    c. Go to Table F-1 and find the age correction values (in dB) for 
4000 Hz at age 27 and age 32.

    d. The difference represents the amount of hearing loss that may be 
attributed to aging in the time period between the baseline audiogram 
and the most recent audiogram. In this example, the difference at 4000 
Hz is 3 dB. This value is subtracted from the hearing level at 4000 Hz, 
which in the most recent audiogram is 25, yielding 22 after adjustment. 
Then the hearing threshold in the baseline audiogram at 4000 Hz (5) is 
subtracted from the adjusted annual audiogram hearing threshold at 4000 
Hz (22). Thus the age-corrected threshold shift would be 17 dB (as 
opposed to a threshold shift of 20 dB without age correction).

          Subpart C_Construction of Employee Sleeping Quarters

    Source: 43 FR 31012, July 19, 1978, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 228.101  Distance requirement; definitions.

    (a) The Hours of Service Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 61-64b), makes 
it unlawful for any common carrier engaged in interstate or foreign 
commerce by railroad to begin, on or after July 8, 1976, the 
construction or reconstruction of sleeping quarters for employees who 
perform duties covered by the act ``within or in the immediate vicinity 
(as determined in accordance with rules prescribed by the Secretary of 
Transportation) of any area where railroad switching or humping 
operations are performed.'' 45 U.S.C. 62(a)(4). This subpart sets forth 
(1) a general definition of ``immediate vicinity'' (Sec. 228.101(b)), 
(2) procedures under which a carrier may request a determination by the 
Federal Railroad Administration that a particular proposed site is not 
within the ``immediate vicinity'' of railroad switching or humping 
operations (Sec. Sec. 228.103 and 228.105), and (3) the basic criteria 
utilized in evaluating proposed sites (Sec. 228.107).
    (b) Except as determined in accordance with the provisions of this 
subpart. ``The immediate vicinity'' shall mean the area within one-half 
mile (2,640 feet) (804 meters) of switching or humping operations as 
measured from the nearest rail of the nearest trackage where switching 
or humping operations are performed to the point on the site where the 
carrier proposes to construct or reconstruct the exterior wall of the 
structure, or portion of such wall, which is closest to such operations.
    (c) As used in this subpart--
    (1) Construction shall refer to the--
    (i) Creation of a new facility;
    (ii) Expansion of an existing facility;
    (iii) Placement of a mobile or modular facility; or
    (iv) Acquisition and use of an existing building.
    (2) Reconstruction shall refer to the--
    (i) Replacement of an existing facility with a new facility on the 
same site; or
    (ii) Rehabilitation or improvement of an existing facility (normal 
periodic maintenance excepted) involving the expenditure of an amount 
representing more than 50 percent of the cost of replacing such facility 
on the same site at the time the work of rehabilitation or improvement 
began, the replacement cost to be estimated on the basis of contemporary 
construction methods and materials.
    (3) Switching or humping operations includes the classification of 
placarded railroad cars according to commodity or destination, 
assembling of placarded cars for train movements, changing the position 
of placarded cars for purposes of loading, unloading, or weighing, and 
the placing of placarded cars for repair. However, the term does not 
include the moving of rail equipment in connection with work service, 
the moving of a train or part of a train within yard

[[Page 422]]

limits by a road locomotive or placing locomotives or cars in a train or 
removing them from a train by a road locomotive while en route to the 
train's destination. The term does include operations within this 
definition which are conducted by any railroad; it is not limited to the 
operations of the carrier contemplating construction or reconstruction 
of railroad employee sleeping quarters.
    (4) Placarded car shall mean a railroad car required to be placarded 
by the Department of Transportation hazardous materials regulations (49 
CFR 172.504).
    (5) The term L<INF>eq</INF> (8) shall mean the equivalent steady 
state sound level which in 8 hours would contain the same acoustic 
energy as the time-varying sound level during the same time period.


<R05>
Sec. 228.103  Approval procedure: construction within one-half mile (2,640 

feet) (804 meters).

    (a) A common carrier that has developed plans for the construction 
or reconstruction of sleeping quarters subject to this subpart and which 
is considering a site less than one-half mile (2,640 feet) (804 meters) 
from any area where switching or humping operations are performed, 
measured from the nearest rail of the nearest trackage utilized on a 
regular or intermittent basis for switching or humping operations to the 
point on the site where the carrier proposes to construct or reconstruct 
the exterior wall of the structure, or portion of such wall, which is 
closest to such operations, must obtain the approval of the Federal 
Railroad Administration before commencing construction or reconstruction 
on that site. Approval may be requested by filing a petition conforming 
to the requirements of this subpart.
    (b) A carrier is deemed to have conducted switching or humping 
operations on particular trackage within the meaning of this subpart if 
placarded cars are subjected to the operations described in Sec. 
228.101(c)(3) within the 365-day period immediately preceding the date 
construction or reconstruction is commenced or if such operations are to 
be permitted on such trackage after such date. If the carrier does not 
have reliable records concerning the traffic handled on the trackage 
within the specified period, it shall be presumed that switching of 
placarded cars is conducted at the location and construction or 
reconstruction of sleeping quarters within one-half mile shall be 
subject to the approval procedures of this subpart.
    (c) A petition shall be filed in triplicate with the Secretary, 
Railroad Safety Board, Federal Railroad Administration, Washington, DC 
20590 and shall contain the following:
    (1) A brief description of the type of construction planned, 
including materials to be employed, means of egress from the quarters, 
and actual and projected exterior noise levels and projected interior 
noise levels;
    (2) The number of employees expected to utilize the quarters at full 
capacity;
    (3) A brief description of the site, including:
    (i) Distance from trackage where switching or humping operations are 
performed, specifying distances from particular functions such as 
classification, repair, assembling of trains from large groups of cars, 
etc. cetera;
    (ii) Topography within a general area consisting of the site and all 
of the rail facilities close to the site;
    (iii) Location of other physical improvements situated between the 
site and areas where railroad operations are conducted;
    (4) A blueprint or other drawing showing the relationship of the 
site to trackage and other planned and existing facilities;
    (5) The proposed or estimated date for commencement of construction;
    (6) A description of the average number and variety of rail 
operations in the areas within one-half mile (2,640 feet) (804 meters) 
of the site (e.g., number of cars classified in 24-hour period; number 
of train movements);
    (7) An estimate of the average daily number of placarded rail cars 
transporting hazardous materials through the railroad facility (where 
practicable, based on a 365-day period sample, that period not having 
ended more than 120 days prior to the date of filing the petition), 
specifying the--

[[Page 423]]

    (i) Number of such cars transporting class A explosives and poison 
gases; and
    (ii) Number of DOT Specification 112A and 114A tank cars 
transporting flammable gas subject to FRA emergency order No. 5;
    (8) A statement certified by a corporate officer of the carrier 
possessing authority over the subject matter explaining any plans of 
that carrier for utilization of existing trackage, or for the 
construction of new trackage, which may impact on the location of 
switching or humping operations within one-half mile of the proposed 
site (if there are no plans, the carrier official must so certify); and
    (9) Any further information which is necessary for evaluation of the 
site.
    (d) A petition filed under this section must contain a statement 
that the petition has been served on the recognized representatives of 
the railroad employees who will be utilizing the proposed sleeping 
quarters, together with a list of the employee representatives served.


<R05>
Sec. 228.105  Additional requirements; construction within one-third mile 

(1,760 feet) (536 meters) of certain switching.

    (a) In addition to providing the information specified by Sec. 
228.103, a carrier seeking approval of a site located within one-third 
mile (1,760 feet) (536 meters) of any area where railroad switching or 
humping operations are performed involving any cars required to be 
placarded ``EXPLOSIVES A'' or ``POISON GAS'' or any DOT Specification 
112A or 114A tank cars transporting flammable gas subject to FRA 
emergency order No. 5 shall establish by a supplementary statement 
certified by a corporate officer possessing authority over the subject 
matter that--
    (1) No feasible alternate site located at or beyond one-third mile 
from switching or humping operations is either presently available to 
the railroad or is obtainable within 3 miles (15,840 feet) (4,827 
meters) of the reporting point for the employees who are to be housed in 
the sleeping quarters;
    (2) Natural or other barriers exist or will be created prior to 
occupancy of the proposed facility between the proposed site and any 
areas in which switching or humping operations are performed which will 
be adequate to shield the facility from the direct and severe effects of 
a hazardous materials accident/incident arising in an area of switching 
or humping operations;
    (3) The topography of the property is such as most likely to cause 
any hazardous materials unintentionally released during switching or 
humping to flow away from the proposed site; and
    (4) Precautions for ensuring employee safety from toxic gases or 
explosions such as employee training and evacuation plans, availability 
of appropriate respiratory protection, and measures for fire protection, 
have been considered.
    (b) In the absence of reliable records concerning traffic handled on 
trackage within the one-third mile area, it shall be presumed that the 
types of cars enumerated in paragraph (a) of this section are switched 
on that trackage; and the additional requirements of this section shall 
be met by the petitioning carrier, unless the carrier establishes that 
the switching of the enumerated cars will be effectively barred from the 
trackage if the petition is approved.


<R05>
Sec. 228.107  Action on petition.

    (a) Each petition for approval filed under Sec. 228.103 is referred 
to the Railroad Safety Board for action in accordance with the 
provisions of part 211, title 49, CFR, concerning the processing of 
requests for special approvals.
    (b) In considering a petition for approval filed under this subpart, 
the Railroad Safety Board evaluates the material factors bearing on--
    (1) The safety of employees utilizing the proposed facility in the 
event of a hazardous materials accident/incident and in light of other 
relevant safety factors; and
    (2) Interior noise levels in the facility.
    (c) The Railroad Safety Board will not approve an application 
submitted under this subpart if it appears from the available 
information that the proposed sleeping quarters will be so situated and 
constructed as to permit interior noise levels due to noise under the 
control of the railroad to exceed an L<INF>eq</INF>(8) value of 55dB(A). 
If individual air

[[Page 424]]

conditioning and heating systems are to be utilized, projections may 
relate to noise levels with such units turned off.
    (d) Approval of a petition filed under this subpart may be withdrawn 
or modified at any time if it is ascertained, after opportunity for a 
hearing, that any representation of fact or intent made by a carrier in 
materials submitted in support of a petition was not accurate or 
truthful at the time such representation was made.


<R05>
 Sec. Appendix A to Part 228--Requirements of the Hours of Service Act: 

              Statement of Agency Policy and Interpretation

    First enacted in 1907, the Hours of Service Act was substantially 
revised in 1969 by Public Law 91-169. Further amendments were enacted as 
part of the Federal Railroad Safety Authorization Act of 1976, Public 
Law 94-348 and by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988, Public Law 
100-342. The purpose of the law is ``to promote the safety of employees 
and travelers upon railroads by limiting the hours of service of 
employees * * *.'' This appendix is designed to explain the effect of 
the law in commonly-encountered situations.
    The Act governs the maximum work hours of employees engaged in one 
or more of the basic categories of covered service treated below. If an 
individual performs more than one kind of covered service during a tour 
of duty, then the most restrictive of the applicable limitations 
control.
    The act applies to any railroad, as that term is defined in 45 
U.S.C. 431(e). It governs the carrier's operations over its own railroad 
and all lines of road which it uses.

                        train and engine service

    Covered Service. Train or engine service refers to the actual 
assembling or operation of trains. Employees who perform this type of 
service commonly include locomotive engineers, firemen, conductors, 
trainmen, switchmen, switchtenders (unless their duties come under the 
provisions of section 3) and hostlers. With the passage of the 1976 
amendments, both inside and outside hostlers are considered to be 
connected with the movement of trains. Previously, only outside hostlers 
were covered. Any other employee who is actually engaged in or connected 
with the movement of any train is also covered, regardless of his job 
title.
    Limitations on Hours. The Act establishes two limitations on hours 
of service. First, no employee engaged in train or engine service may be 
required or permitted to work in excess of twelve consecutive hours. 
After working a full twelve consecutive hours, an employee must be given 
at least ten consecutive hours off duty before being permitted to return 
to work.
    Second, no employee engaged in train or engine service may be 
required or permitted to continue on duty or go on duty unless he has 
had at least eight consecutive hours off duty within the preceding 
twenty-four hours. This latter limitation, when read in conjunction with 
the requirements with respect to computation of duty time (discussed 
below) results in several conclusions:
    (1) When an employee's work tour is broken or interrupted by a valid 
period of interim release (4 hours or more at a designated terminal), he 
may return to duty for the balance of the total 12-hour work tour during 
a 24-hour period.
    (2) After completing the 12 hours of broken duty, or at the end of 
the 24-hour period, whichever occurs first, the employee may not be 
required or permitted to continue on duty or to go on duty until he has 
had at least 8 consecutive hours off duty.
    (3) The 24-hour period referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 above shall 
begin upon the commencement of a work tour by the employee immediately 
after his having received a statutory off-duty period of 8 or 10 hours 
as appropriate.
    Duty time and effective periods of release. On-duty time commences 
when an employee reports at the time and place specified by the railroad 
and terminates when the employee is finally released of all 
responsibilities. (Time spent in deadhead transportation to a duty 
assignment is also counted as time on duty. See discussion below.) Any 
period available for rest that is of four or more hours and is at a 
designated terminal is off-duty time. All other periods available for 
rest must be counted as time on duty under the law, regardless of their 
duration.
    The term ``designated terminal'' means a terminal (1) which is 
designated in or under a collective bargaining agreement as the ``home'' 
or ``away-from-home'' terminal for a particular crew assignment and (2) 
which has suitable facilities for food and lodging. Carrier and union 
representatives may agree to establish additional designated terminals 
having such facilities as points of effective release under the Act. 
Agreements to designate additional terminals for purposes of release 
under the Act should be reduced to writing and should make reference to 
the particular assignments affected and to the Hours of Service Act. The 
following are common situations illustrating the designated terminal 
concept:
    (1) A freight or passenger road crew operates a train from home 
terminal ``A'' to away-from-home terminal ``B'' (or the reverse). 
Terminals ``A'' and ``B'' would normally be the designated terminals for 
this specific crew assignment. However, carrier

[[Page 425]]

and employee representatives may agree to designate additional terminals 
having suitable facilities for food and lodging as appropriate points of 
release under the Hours of Service Act.
    (2) A road crew operates a train in turn-around service from home 
terminal ``A'' to turn-around point ``B'' and back to ``A''. Terminal 
``A'' is the only designated terminal for this specific crew assignment, 
unless carrier and employee representatives have agreed to designate 
additional terminals having suitable facilities for food and lodging.
    (3) A crew is assigned to operate a maintenance-of-way work train 
from home terminal ``A'', work on line of road and tie up for rest along 
the line of road at point ``B''. Home terminal ``A'' and tie-up point 
``B'' both qualify as designated terminals for this specific work train 
crew assignment. Of course, suitable facilities for food and lodging 
must be available at tie-up point ``B''.
    Deadheading. Under the Act time spent in deadhead transportation 
receives special treatment. Time spent in deadhead transportation to a 
duty assignment by a train or engine service employee is considered on-
duty time. Time spent in deadhead transportation from the final duty 
assignment of the work tour to the point of final release is not 
computed as either time on duty or time off duty. Thus, the period of 
deadhead transportation to point of final release may not be included in 
the required 8- or 10-hour off-duty period. Time spent in deadhead 
transportation to a duty assignment is calculated from the time the 
employee reports for deadhead until he reaches his duty assignment.
    All time spent awaiting the arrival of a deadhead vehicle for 
transportation from the final duty assignment of the work tour to the 
point of final release is considered limbo time, i.e., neither time on 
duty nor time off duty, provided that the employee is given no specific 
responsibilities to perform during this time. However, if an employee is 
required to perform service of any kind during that period (e.g., 
protecting the train against vandalism, observing passing trains for any 
defects or unsafe conditions, flagging, shutting down locomotives, 
checking fluid levels, or communicating train consist information via 
radio), he or she will be considered as on duty until all such service 
is completed. Of course, where a railroad carrier's operating rules 
clearly relieve the employee of all duties during the waiting period and 
no duties are specifically assigned, the waiting time is not computed as 
either time on duty or time off duty.
    Transit time from the employee's residence to his regular reporting 
point is not considered deadhead time.
    If an employee utilizes personal automobile transportation to a 
point of duty assignment other than the regular reporting point in lieu 
of deadhead transportation provided by the carrier, such actual travel 
time is considered as deadheading time. However, if the actual travel 
time from his home to the point of duty assignment exceeds a reasonable 
travel time from the regular reporting point to the point of duty 
assignment, then only the latter period is counted. Of course, actual 
travel time must be reasonable and must not include diversions for 
personal reasons.

    Example: Employee A receives an assignment from an ``extra board'' 
located at his home terminal to protect a job one hour's drive from the 
home terminal. In lieu of transporting the employee by carrier 
conveyance, the railroad pays the employee a fixed amount to provide his 
own transportation to and from the outlying point. The employee is 
permitted to go directly from his home to the outlying point, a drive 
which takes 40 minutes. The normal driving time between his regular 
reporting point at his home terminal and the outlying point is 60 
minutes. The actual driving time, 40 minutes is considered deadhead time 
and is counted as time on duty under the Act.
    Employee A performs local switching service at the outlying point. 
When the employee returns from the outlying point that evening, and 
receives an ``arbitrary'' payment for his making the return trip by 
private automobile, 40 minutes of his time in transportation home is 
considered deadheading to point of final release and is not counted as 
either time on duty or time off duty.

    Wreck and relief trains. Prior to the 1976 amendments, crews of 
wreck and relief trains were exempted entirely from the limitations on 
hours of service. Under present law that is no longer the case. The crew 
of a wreck or relief train may be permitted to be on duty for not to 
exceed 4 additional hours in any period of 24 consecutive hours whenever 
an actual emergency exists and the work of the crew is related to that 
emergency. Thus, a crew could work up to 16 hours, rather than 12. The 
Act specifies that an emergency ceases to exist for purposes of this 
provision when the track is cleared and the line is open for traffic. An 
``emergency'' for purposes of wreck or relief service may be a less 
extraordinary or catastrophic event than an ``unavoidable accident or 
Act of God'' under section 5(d) of the Act.

    Example: The crew of a wreck train is dispatched to clear the site 
of a derailment which has just occurred on a main line. The wreck crew 
re-rails or clears the last car and the maintenance of way department 
releases the track to the operating department 14 hours and 30 minutes 
into the duty tour. Since the line is not clear until the wreck train is 
itself out of the way, the crew may

[[Page 426]]

operate the wreck train to its terminal, provided this can be 
accomplished within the total of 16 hours on duty.

    Emergencies. The Act contains no general exception using the term 
``emergency'' with respect to train or engine service or related work. 
See ``casualties,'' etc., under ``General Provisions''.

                      communication of train orders

    Covered Service. The handling of orders governing the movement of 
trains is the second type of covered service. This provision of the Act 
applies to any operator, train dispatcher or other employee who by the 
use of the telegraph, telephone, radio, or any other electical or 
mechanical device dispatches, reports, transmits, receives, or delivers 
orders pertaining to or affecting train movements.
    The approach of the law is functional. Thus, though a yardmaster 
normally is not covered by this provision, a yardmaster or other 
employee who performs any of the specified service during a duty tour is 
subject to the limitations on service for that entire tour.
    Limitations on hours. No employee who performs covered service 
involving communication of train orders may be required or permitted to 
remain on duty for more than nine hours, whether consecutive or in the 
aggregate, in any 24-hour period in any office, tower, station or place 
where two or more shifts are employed. Where only one shift is employed, 
the employee is restricted to 12 hours consecutively or in the aggregate 
during any 24-hour period.
    The provision on emergencies, discussed below, may extend the 
permissible hours of employees performing this type of service.
    Shifts. The term ``shift'' is not defined by the Act, but the 
legislative history of the 1969 amendments indicates that it means a 
tour of duty constituting a day's work for one or more employee 
performing the same class of work at the same station who are scheduled 
to begin and end work at the same time. The following are examples of 
this principle:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Scheduled Hours                      Classification
------------------------------------------------------------------------
7 a.m. to 3 p.m...........................  1 shift.
7 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. 1:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.     Do.
 (Schedule for one employee including one
 hour lunch period).
7 a.m. to 3 p.m. 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. (Two       Do.
 employees scheduled).
7 a.m. to 3 p.m. 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Two      2 shifts.
 employees scheduled).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Duty time and effective periods of release. If, after reporting to 
his place of duty, an employee is required to perform duties at other 
places during this same tour of duty, the time spent traveling between 
such places is considered as time on duty. Under the traditional 
administrative interpretation of section 3, other periods of 
transportation are viewed as personal commuting and, thus, off-duty 
time.
    A release period is considered off-duty time if it provides a 
meaningful period of relaxation and if the employee is free of all 
responsibilities to the carrier. One hour is the minimum acceptable 
release period for this type of covered service.
    Emergencies. The section of the Act dealing with dispatchers, 
operators, and others who transmit or receive train orders contains its 
own emergency provision. In case of emergency, an employee subject to 
the 9 or 12-hour limitation is permitted to work an additional four 
hours in any 24-hour period, but only for a maximum of three days in any 
period of seven consecutive days. However, even in an emergency 
situation the carrier must make reasonable efforts to relieve the 
employee.

                           General Provisions

                   (applicable to all covered service)

    Commingled Service. All duty time for a railroad even though not 
otherwise subject to the Act must be included when computing total on-
duty time of an individual who performs one or more of the type of 
service covered by the Act. This is known as the principle of 
``commingled service''.
    For example, if an employee performs duty for 8 hours as a trainman 
and then is used as a trackman (not covered by the law) in the same 24-
hour period, total on-duty time is determined by adding the duty time as 
trackman to that as trainman. The law does not distinguish treatment of 
situations in which non-covered service follows, rather than precedes, 
covered service. The limitations on total hours apply on both cases. It 
should be remembered that attendance at required rules classes is duty 
time subject to the provisions on ``commingling''. Similarly, where a 
carrier compels attendance at a disciplinary proceeding, time spent in 
attendance is subject to the provisions on commingling.
    When an employee performs service covered by more than one 
restrictive provision, the most restrictive provision determines the 
total lawful on-duty time. Thus, when an employee performs duty in train 
or engine service and also as an operator, the provisions of the law 
applicable to operators apply to all on-duty and off-duty periods during 
such aggregate time. However, an employee subject to the 12 hour 
provision of section 2 of the law does not become subject to the 9 or 
12-hour provisions of section 3 merely because he receives, transmits or 
delivers orders pertaining to or affecting the movement of his train in 
the course of his duties as a trainman.

[[Page 427]]

    Casualties, Unavoidable Accidents, Acts of God. Section 5(d) of the 
Act states the following: ``The provisions of this Act shall not apply 
in any case of casualty or unavoidable accident or the Act of God; nor 
where the delay was the result of a cause not known to the carrier or 
its officer or agent in charge of the employee at the time said employee 
left a terminal, and which could not have been foreseen.'' This passage 
is commonly referred to as the ``emergency provision''. Judicial 
construction of this sentence has limited the relief which it grants to 
situations which are truly unusual and exceptional. The courts have 
recognized that delays and operational difficulties are common in the 
industry and must be regarded as entirely foreseeable; otherwise, the 
Act will provide no protection whatsoever. Common operational 
difficulties which do not provide relief from the Act include, but are 
not limited to, broken draw bars, locomotive malfunctions, equipment 
failures, brake system failures, hot boxes, unexpected switching, 
doubling hills and meeting trains. Nor does the need to clear a main 
line or cut a crossing justify disregard of the limitations of the Act. 
Such contingencies must normally be anticipated and met within the 12 
hours. Even where an extraordinary event or combination of events occurs 
which, by itself, would be sufficient to permit excess service, the 
carrier must still employ due diligence to avoid or limit such excess 
service. The burden of proof rests with the carrier to establish that 
excess service could not have been avoided.
    Sleeping Quarters. Under the 1976 amendments to the Act it is 
unlawful for any common carrier to provide sleeping quarters for persons 
covered by the Hours of Service Act which do not afford such persons an 
opportunity for rest, free from interruptions caused by noise under the 
control of the railroad, in clean, safe, and sanitary quarters. Such 
sleeping quarters include crew quarters, camp or bunk cars, and 
trailers.
    Sleeping quarters are not considered to be ``free from interruptions 
caused by noise under the control of the railroad'' if noise levels 
attributable to noise sources under the control of the railroad exceed 
an L<INF>eq</INF>(8) value of 55dB(A).
    FRA recognizes that camp cars, either because of express limitations 
of local codes or by virtue of their physical mobility, cannot, for 
practical purposes, be subject to state or local housing, sanitation, 
health, electrical, or fire codes. Therefore, FRA is unable to rely upon 
state or local authorities to ensure that persons covered by the Act who 
reside in railroad-provided camp cars are afforded an opportunity for 
rest in ``clean, safe, and sanitary'' conditions. Accordingly, the 
guidelines in appendix C to this part 228 will be considered by FRA as 
factors to be used in applying the concepts of ``clean,'' ``safe,'' and 
``sanitary'' to camp cars provided by railroads for the use of employees 
covered by section 2(a)(3) of the Act. Failure to adhere to these 
guidelines might interfere with the ordinary person's ability to rest.
    Collective Bargaining. The Hours of Service Act prescribes the 
maximum permissible hours of service consistent with safety. However, 
the Act does not prohibit collective bargaining for shorter hours of 
service and time on duty.
    Penalty. As amended by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988 and 
the Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act of 1992, the penalty 
provisions of the law apply to any person (an entity of any type covered 
under 1 U.S.C. 1, including but not limited to the following: a 
railroad; a manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of 
a railroad; any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad 
equipment, track, or facilities; any independent contractor providing 
goods or services to a railroad; and any employee of such owner, 
manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor), except that a 
penalty may be assessed against an individual only for a willful 
violation. See appendix A to 49 CFR part 209. For violations that 
occurred on September 3, 1992, a person who violates the Act is liable 
for a civil penalty, as the Secretary of Transportation deems 
reasonable, in an amount not less than $500 nor more than $11,000, 
except that where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated 
violations has created an imminent hazard of death or injury to persons, 
or has caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $22,000 may be 
assessed. The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 
as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 required 
agencies to increase the maximum civil monetary penalty for inflation. 
The amounts increased from $10,000 to $11,000 and from $20,000 to 
$22,000 respectively. According to the same law, in 2004, the minimum 
penalty of $500 was raised to $550, and the maximum penalty for a 
grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violations that has 
caused an imminent hazard of death or injury to individuals or has 
caused death or injury, was increased from $22,000 to $27,000. The 
$11,000 maximum penalty was not adjusted. Effective October 9, 2007, the 
ordinary maximum penalty of $11,000 was raised to $16,000 as required 
under the law; however, the minimum penalty and the maximum penalty for 
a grossly negligent violation did not need to be adjusted.
    Each employee who is required or permitted to be on duty for a 
longer period than prescribed by law or who does not receive a required 
period of rest represents a separate and distinct violation and subjects 
the railroad to a separate civil penalty. In the case of a violation of 
section 2(a)(3) or (a)(4) of the Act, each day a facility is in 
noncompliance

[[Page 428]]

constitutes a separate offense and subjects the railroad to a separate 
civil penalty.
    In compromising a civil penalty assessed under the Act, FRA takes 
into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the 
violation committed, and, with respect to the person found to have 
committed such violation, the degree of culpability, any history of 
prior or subsequent offenses, ability to pay, effect on ability to 
continue to do business and such other matters as justice may require.
    Statute of limitations. No suit may be brought after the expiration 
of two years from the date of violation unless administrative 
notification of the violation has been provided to the person to be 
charged within that two year period. In no event may a suit be brought 
after expiration of the period specified in 28 U.S.C. 2462.
    Exemptions. A railroad which employs not more than 15 persons 
covered by the Hours of Service Act (including signalmen and hostlers) 
may be exempted from the law's requirements by the FRA after hearing and 
for good cause shown. The exemption must be supported by a finding that 
it is in the public interest and will not adversely affect safety. The 
exemption need not relate to all carrier employees. In no event may any 
employee of an exempt railroad be required or permitted to work beyond 
16 hours continuously or in the aggregate within any 24-hour period. Any 
exemption is subject to review at least annually.

of the work allows.
    (b) To facilitate cleaning, every floor, working place, and 
passageway should be kept free from protruding nails, splinters, loose 
boards, and unnecessary holes and openings.
    3. Waste Disposal.

[[Page 429]]

    (a) Any exterior receptacle used for putrescible solid or liquid 
waste or refuse should be so constructed that it does not leak and may 
be thoroughly cleaned and maintained in a sanitary condition. Such a 
receptacle should be equipped with a solid tight-fitting cover, unless 
it can be maintained in a sanitary condition without a cover. This 
requirement does not prohibit the use of receptacles designed to permit 
the maintenance of a sanitary condition without regard to the 
aforementioned requirements.
    (b) All sweepings, solid or liquid wastes, refuse, and garbage 
should be removed in such a manner as to avoid creating a menace to 
health and as often as necessary or appropriate to maintain a sanitary 
condition.
    4. Vermin Control.
    (a) Camp cars should be so constructed, equipped, and maintained, so 
far as reasonably practicable, as to prevent the entrance or harborage 
of rodents, insects, or other vermin. A continuing and effective 
extermination program should be instituted where their presence is 
detected.
    5. Water Supply.
    (a) Potable water. (1) Potable water should be adequately and 
conveniently provided to all employees in camp cars for drinking, 
washing of the person, cooking, washing of foods, washing of cooking or 
eating utensils, washing of food preparation or processing premises, and 
personal service rooms where such facilities are provided.
    (2) Potable drinking water dispensers should be designed, 
constructed, and serviced so that sanitary conditions are maintained, 
should be capable of being closed, and should be equipped with a tap.
    (3) Open containers such as barrels, pails, or tanks for drinking 
water from which the water must be dipped or poured, whether or not they 
are fitted with a cover, should not be used.
    (4) A common drinking cup and other common utensils should not be 
used.
    (b) The distribution lines should be capable of supplying water at 
sufficient operating pressures to all taps for normal simultaneous 
operation.
    6. Toilet facilities.
    (a) Toilet facilities. (1) Toilet facilities adequate for the number 
of employees housed in the camp car should be provided in convenient and 
safe location(s), and separate toilet rooms for each sex should be 
provided in accordance with table l of this paragraph. The number of 
facilities to be provided for each sex should be based on the number of 
employees of that sex for whom the facilities are furnished. Where 
toilet rooms will be occupied by no more than one person at a time, can 
be locked from the inside, and contain at least one water closet or 
nonwater carriage toilet facility, separate toilet rooms for each sex 
need not be provided. Where such single-occupancy rooms have more than 
one toilet facility, only one such facility in each toilet room should 
be counted for the purpose of table 1.

                                 Table 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Minimum

feet, but as far as practical on the same side of the track on which 
camp cars are sited.
    (3) Each toilet facility should be lighted naturally, or 
artificially by a safe type of lighting available at all hours of the 
day and night. Flashlights can be substituted by the railroad when 
nonwater carriage toilet facilities are used.
    (4) An adequate supply of toilet paper should be provided in each 
water closet, or nonwater carriage toilet facility, unless provided to 
the employees individually.
    (5) Toilet facilities should be kept in a clean and sanitary 
condition. They should be cleaned regularly when occupied. In the case 
of nonwater carriage toilet facilities, they should be cleaned and 
changed regularly.
    7. Lavatories.
    (a) Lavatories should be made available to all rail employees housed 
in camp cars.
    (b) Each lavatory should be provided with either hot and cold 
running water or tepid running water.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided by agreement, hand soap or similar 
cleansing agents should be provided.

[[Page 430]]

    (d) Showers. 1. Unless otherwise provided by agreement, body soap or 
other appropriate cleansing agent convenient to the showers should be 
provided.
    2. Showers should be provided with hot and cold water feeding a 
common discharge line.
    3. Unless otherwise provided by agreement, employees who use showers 
should be provided with individual clean towels.
    9. Kitchens, dining hall and feeding facilities.
    (a) In all camp cars where central dining operations are provided, 
the food handling facilities should be clean and sanitary.
    (b) When separate kitchen and dining hall cars are provided, there 
should be a closable door between the living or sleeping quarters into a 
kitchen or dining hall car.
    10. Consumption of food and beverages on the premises.
    (a) Application. This paragraph should apply only where employees 
are permitted to consume food or beverages, or both, on the premises.
    (b) Eating and drinking areas. No employee should be allowed to 
consume food or beverages in a toilet room or in any area exposed to a

    (d) Waste disposal containers provided for the interior of camp 
cars. An adequate number of receptacles constructed of smooth, corrosion 
resistant, easily cleanable, or disposable materials, should be provided 
and used for the disposal of waste food. Receptacles should be provided 
with a solid tightfitting cover unless sanitary conditions can be 
maintained without use of a cover. The number, size and location of such 
receptacles should encourage their use and not result in overfilling. 
They should be emptied regularly and maintained in a clean and sanitary 
condition.
    (e) Sanitary storage. No food or beverages should be stored in 
toilet rooms or in an area exposed to a toxic material.
    (f) Food handling. (1) All employee food service facilities and 
operations should be carried out in accordance with sound hygienic 
principles. In all places of employment where all or part of the food 
service is provided, the food dispensed should be wholesome, free from 
spoilage, and should be processed, prepared, handled, and stored in such 
a manner as to be protected against contamination.
    (2) No person with any disease communicable through contact with 
food or food preparation items should be employed or permitted to work 
in the preparation, cooking, serving, or other handling of food, 
foodstuffs, or materials used therein, in a kitchen or dining facility 
operated in or in connection with camp cars.
    11. Lighting. Each habitable room in a camp car should be provided 
with adequate lighting.
    12. First Aid. Adequate first aid kits should be maintained and made 
available for railway employees housed in camp cars for the emergency 
treatment of injured persons.
    13. Shelter.
    (a) Every camp car should be constructed in a manner that will 
provide protection against the elements.
    (b) All steps, entry ways, passageways and corridors providing 
normal entry to or between camp cars should be constructed of durable 
weather resistant material and properly maintained. Any broken or unsafe 
fixtures or components in need of repair should be repaired or replaced 
promptly.
    (c) Each camp car used for sleeping purposes should contain at least 
48 square feet of floor space for each occupant. At least a 7-foot 
ceiling measured at the entrance to the car should be provided.
    (d) Beds, cots, or bunks and suitable storage facilities such as 
wall lockers or space for foot lockers for clothing and personal 
articles should be provided in every room used for sleeping purposes. 
Except where partitions are provided, such beds or similar facilities 
should be spaced not closer than 36 inches laterally (except in modular 
units which cannot be spaced closer than 30 inches) and 30 inches end to 
end, and should be elevated at least 12 inches from the floor. If 
double-deck bunks are used, they should be spaced not less than 48 
inches both laterally and end to end. The minimum clear space between 
the lower and upper bunk should be not less than 27 inches. Triple-deck 
bunks should not be used.

[[Page 431]]

    (e) Floors should be of smooth and tight construction and should be 
kept in good repair.
    (f) All living quarters should be provided with windows the total of 
which should be not less than 10 percent of the floor area. At least 
one-half of each window designed to be opened should be so constructed 
that it can be opened for purposes of ventilation. Durable opaque window 
coverings should be provided to reduce the entrance of light during 
sleeping hours.
    (g) All exterior openings should be effectively screened with 16-
mesh material. All screen doors should be equipped with self-closing 
devices.
    (h) In a facility where workers cook, live, and sleep, a minimum of 
90 square feet per person should be provided. Sanitary facilities should 
be provided for storing and preparing food.
    (i) In camp cars where meals are provided, adequate facilities to 
feed employees within a 60-minute period should be provided.
    (j) All heating, cooking, ventilation, air conditioning and water 
heating equipment should be installed in accordance with applicable 
local regulations governing such installations.
    (k) Every camp car should be provided with equipment capable of 
maintaining a temperature of at least 68 degrees F. during normal cold 
weather and no greater than 78 degrees F., or 20 degrees below ambient, 
whichever is warmer, during normal hot weather.
    (l) Existing camp cars may be grandfathered so as to only be subject 
to subparagraphs (c), (d), (f), (h), and (k), in accordance with the 
following as recommended maximums:

13 (c), (d), and (h)--by January 1, 1994.
13(f)--Indefinitely insofar as the ten percent (10%) requirement for 
window spacing is concerned.
13(k)--by January 1, 1992.

    14. Location. Camp cars occupied exclusively by individuals employed 
for the purpose of maintaining the right-of-way of a railroad should be 
located as far as practical from where ``switching or humping 
operations'' of ``placarded cars'' occur, as defined in 49 CFR 228.101 
(c)(3) and (c)(4), respectively. Every reasonable effort should be made 
to locate these camp cars at least one-half mile (2,640 feet) from where 
such switching or humping occurs. In the event employees housed in camp 
cars located closer than one-half mile (2,640 feet) from where such 
switching or humping of cars takes place are exposed to an unusual 
hazard at such location, the employees involved should be housed in 
other suitable accommodations. An unusual hazard means an unsafe 
condition created by an occurrence other than normal switching or 
humping.
    15. General provisions. (a) Sleeping quarters are not considered to 
be ``free of interruptions caused by noise under the control of the 
railroad'' if noise levels attributable to noise sources under the 
control of the railroad exceed an Leq (8) value of 55 dB(A), with 
windows closed and exclusive of cooling, heating, and ventilating 
equipment.
    (b) A railroad should, within 48 hours after notice of noncompliance 
with these recommendations, fix the deficient condition(s). Where 
holidays or weekends intervene, the railroad should fix the condition 
within 8 hours after the employees return to work. In the event such 
condition(s) affects the safety or health of the employees, such as 
water, cooling, heating or eating facilities, the railroad should 
provide alternative arrangements for housing and eating until the 
noncomplying condition is fixed.

Sec. 229.23  Periodic inspection: General.

    (a) Each locomotive and steam generator shall be inspected at each 
periodic inspection to determine whether it complies with this part. 
Except as provided in Sec. 229.9, all non-complying conditions shall be 
repaired before the locomotive or the steam generator is used. Except as 
provided in Sec. 229.33, the interval between any two periodic 
inspections may not exceed 92 days. Periodic inspections shall only be 
made where adequate facilities are available. At each periodic 
inspection, a locomotive shall be positioned so that a person may safely 
inspect the entire underneath portion of the locomotive.
    (b) The periodic inspection of the steam generator may be postponed 
indefinitely if the water suction pipe to the water pump and the leads 
to the main switch (steam generator switch) are disconnected, and the 
train line shut-off-valve is wired closed or a blind gasket applied. 
However, the steam generator shall be so inspected before it is returned 
to use.
    (c) After April 30, 1980, each new locomotive shall receive an 
initial periodic inspection before it is used. Except as provided in 
Sec. 229.33, each locomotive in use on or before April 30, 1980, shall 
receive an initial periodic inspection within 92 days of the last 30-day 
inspection performed under the prior rules (49 CFR 230.331 and 230.451). 
At the initial periodic inspection, the date and place of the last tests 
performed that are the equivalent of the tests required by Sec. Sec. 
229.27, 229.29, and 229.31 shall be entered on Form FRA F 6180-49A. 
These dates shall determine when the tests first become due under 
Sec. Sec. 229.27, 229.29, and 229.31. Out of use credit may be carried 
over from Form FRA F 6180-49 and entered on Form FRA F 6180-49A.
    (d) Each periodic inspection shall be recorded on Form FRA F 6180-
49A. The form shall be signed by the person conducting the inspection 
and certified by that person's supervisor that the work was done. The 
form shall be displayed under a transparent cover in a conspicuous place 
in the cab of each locomotive.
    (e) At the first periodic inspection in each calendar year the 
carrier shall remove from each locomotive Form FRA F 6180-49A covering 
the previous calendar year. If a locomotive does not receive its first 
periodic inspection in a calendar year before April 2 because it is out 
of use, the form shall be promptly replaced. The Form FRA F 6180-49A 
covering the preceding year for each locomotive, in or out of use, shall 
be signed by the railroad official responsible for the locomotive and 
filed as required in Sec. 229.23(f). The date and place of the last 
periodic inspection and the date and place of the last test performed 
under Sec. Sec. 229.27, 229.29, and 229.31 shall be transferred to the 
replacement Form FRA F 6180-49A.
    (f) The mechanical officer of each railroad who is in charge of a 
locomotive shall maintain in his office a secondary record of the 
information reported on Form FRA F 6180-49A under this part. The 
secondary record shall

[[Page 441]]

be retained until Form FRA F 6180-49A has been removed from the 
locomotive and filed in the railroad office of the mechanical officer in 
charge of the locomotive. If the Form FRA F 6180-49A removed from the 
locomotive is not clearly legible, the secondary record shall be 
retained until the Form FRA F 6180-49A for the succeeding year is filed. 
The Form F 6180-49A removed from a locomotive shall be retained until 
the Form FRA F 6180-49A for the succeeding year is filed.

    (3) Safety valves shall be set and tested under steam after the 
steam pressure gauge is tested.
    (e) Event recorder. A microprocessor-based self-monitoring event 
recorder, if installed, is exempt from periodic inspection under 
paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section and shall be inspected 
annually as required by Sec. 229.27(d). Other types of event recorders, 
if installed, shall be inspected, maintained, and tested in accordance 
with instructions of the manufacturer, supplier, or owner thereof and in 
accordance with the following criteria:
    (1) A written or electronic copy of the instructions in use shall be 
kept at the point where the work is performed and a hard-copy version, 
written in the English language, shall be made available upon request of 
a governmental agent empowered to request it.
    (2) The event recorder shall be tested before any maintenance work 
is performed on it. At a minimum, the event recorder test shall include 
cycling, as practicable, all required recording elements and determining 
the full range of each element by reading out recorded data.
    (3) If the pre-maintenance test does not reveal that the device is 
recording all the specified data and that all recordings are within the 
designed recording elements, this fact shall be noted, and maintenance 
and testing shall be performed as necessary until a subsequent test is 
successful.
    (4) When a successful test is accomplished, a copy of the data-
verification results shall be maintained in any medium with the 
maintenance records for the locomotive until the next one is filed.
    (5) A railroad's event recorder periodic maintenance shall be 
considered effective if 90 percent of the recorders on locomotives 
inbound for periodic inspection in any given calendar month are still 
fully functional; maintenance practices and test intervals shall be 
adjusted as necessary to yield effective periodic maintenance.

    (d) A microprocessor-based event recorder with a self-monitoring 
feature equipped to verify that all data elements required by this part 
are recorded, requires further maintenance only if either or both of the 
following conditions exist:
    (1) The self-monitoring feature displays an indication of a failure. 
If a failure is displayed, further maintenance and testing must be 
performed until a subsequent test is successful. When a successful test 
is accomplished, a record, in any medium, shall be made of that fact and 
of any maintenance work necessary to achieve the successful result. This 
record shall be available at the location where the locomotive is 
maintained until a record of a subsequent successful test is filed.
    (2) A download of the event recorder, taken within the preceding 30 
days and reviewed for the previous 48 hours of locomotive operation, 
reveals a failure to record a regularly recurring data element or 
reveals that any required data element is not representative of the 
actual operations of the locomotive during this time period. If the 
review is not successful, further maintenance and testing shall be 
performed until a subsequent test is successful. When a successful test 
is accomplished, a record, in any medium, shall be made of that fact and 
of any maintenance work necessary to achieve the successful result. This 
record shall be kept at the location where the locomotive is maintained 
until a record of a subsequent successful test is filed. The download 
shall be taken from information stored in the certified crashworthy 
crash hardened event recorder memory module if the locomotive is so 
equipped.

is met. The manufacturer may determine the average by testing a 
representative sample of locomotives or an initial series of 
locomotives, provided that there are suitable manufacturing quality 
controls and verification procedures in place to ensure product 
consistency.
    (2) In the maintenance of locomotives that are manufactured in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a railroad shall not 
make any alterations that cause the average sound level for that 
locomotive design or model to exceed:
    (i) 82 dB(A) if the average sound level for a locomotive design or 
model is less than 82 dB(A); or
    (ii) 85 dB(A) if the average sound level for a locomotive design or 
model is 82 dB(A) to 85 dB(A), inclusive,
    (3) The railroad or manufacturer shall follow the static test 
protocols set forth in appendix H of this part to determine compliance 
with paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and, to the extent reasonably 
necessary to evaluate the effect of alterations during maintenance, to 
determine compliance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (b) Maintenance of locomotives. (1) If a railroad receives an 
excessive noise report, and if the condition giving rise to the noise is 
not required to be immediately corrected under part 229, the railroad 
shall maintain a record of the report, and repair or replace the item 
identified as substantially contributing to the noise:
    (i) On or before the next periodic inspection required by Sec. 
229.23; or
    (ii) If the railroad determines that the repair or replacement of 
the item requires significant shop or material resources that are not 
readily available, at the time of the next major equipment repair 
commonly used for the particular type of maintenance needed.
    (2) Conditions that may lead a locomotive cab occupant to file an 
excessive noise report include, but are not limited to: defective cab 
window seals; defective cab door seals; broken or inoperative windows; 
deteriorated insulation or insulation that has been removed for other 
reasons; broken or inoperative doors; and air brakes that vent inside of 
the cab.
    (3) A railroad has an obligation to respond to an excessive noise 
report that a locomotive cab occupant files. The railroad meets its 
obligation to respond to an excessive noise report, as set forth in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if the railroad makes a good faith 
effort to identify the cause of the reported noise, and where the 
railroad is successful in determining the cause, if the railroad repairs 
or replaces the items cause the noise.
    (4) Recordkeeping. (i) A railroad shall maintain a written or 
electronic record of any excessive noise report, inspection, test, 
maintenance, replacement, or repair completed pursuant to Sec. 
229.121(b) and the date on which that inspection, test, maintenance, 
replacement, or repair occurred. If a railroad elects to maintain an 
electronic record, the railroad must satisfy the conditions listed in 
Sec. 227.121(a)(2)(i) through (v).

[[Page 452]]

complies with the requirements of IEC standard 60942 (1997-11) for a 
Class 2 instrument.
    (3) The manufacturer's instructions pertaining to mounting and 
orienting the microphone; positioning of the observer; and periodic 
factory recalibration shall be followed.
    (4) A microphone windscreen shall be used and tripods or similar 
microphone mountings shall be used that minimize interference with the 
sound being measured.
    (5) The test site shall be free of large reflective structures, such 
as barriers, hills, billboards, tractor trailers or other large 
vehicles, locomotives or rail cars on adjacent tracks, bridges or 
buildings, within 200 feet to the front and sides of the locomotive. The 
locomotive shall be positioned on straight, level track.
    (6) Measurements shall be taken only when ambient air temperature is 
between 32 degrees and 104 degrees Fahrenheit inclusively; relative 
humidity is between 20 percent and 95 percent inclusively; wind velocity 
is not more than 12 miles per hour and there is no precipitation.
    (7) With the exception of cab-mounted or low-mounted horns, the 
microphone shall be located 100 feet forward of the front knuckle of the 
locomotive, 15 feet above the top of the rail, at an angle no greater 
than 20 degrees from the center line of the track, and oriented with 
respect to the sound source according to the manufacturer's 
recommendations. For cab-mounted and low-mounted horns, the microphone 
shall be located 100 feet forward of the front knuckle of the 
locomotive, four feet above the top of the rail, at an angle no greater 
than 20 degrees from the center line of the track, and oriented with 
respect to the sound source according to the manufacturer's 
recommendations. The observer shall not stand between the microphone and 
the horn.
    (8) Background noise shall be minimal: the sound level at the test 
site immediately before and after each horn sounding event shall be at 
least 10 dB(A) below the level measured during the horn sounding.
    (9) Measurement procedures. The sound level meter shall be set for 
A-weighting with slow exponential response and

[[Page 455]]

shall be calibrated with the acoustic calibrator immediately before and 
after compliance tests. Any change in the before and after calibration 
levels shall be less than 0.5 dB. After the output from the locomotive 
horn system has reached a stable level, the A-weighted equivalent sound 
level (slow response) for a 10-second duration (LAeq, 10s) shall be 
obtained either directly using an integrating-averaging sound level 
meter, or recorded once per second and calculated indirectly. The 
arithmetic-average of a series of at least six such 10-second duration 
readings shall be used to determine compliance. The standard deviation 
of the readings shall be less than 1.5 dB.
    (10) Written reports of locomotive horn testing required by this 
part shall be made and shall reflect horn type; the date, place, and 
manner of testing; and sound level measurements. These reports, which 
shall be signed by the person who performs the test, shall be retained 
by the railroad, at a location of its choice, until a subsequent 
locomotive horn test is completed and shall be made available, upon 
request, to FRA as provided by 49 U.S.C. 20107.
    (d) This section does not apply to locomotives of rapid transit 
operations which are otherwise subject to this part.

next calendar-day inspection. A locomotive with an inoperative event 
recorder is not deemed to be in improper condition, unsafe to operate, 
or a non-complying locomotive under Sec. Sec. 229.7 and 229.9, and, 
other than the requirements of Appendix D of this part, the inspection, 
maintenance, and testing of event recorders are limited to the 
requirements set forth in Sec. Sec. 229.25(e) and 229.27(d).
    (e) Preserving accident data. If any locomotive equipped with an 
event recorder, or any other locomotive-mounted recording device or 
devices designed to record information concerning the functioning of a 
locomotive or train, is involved in an accident/incident that is 
required to be reported to FRA under part 225 of this chapter, the 
railroad that was using the locomotive at the time of the accident 
shall, to the extent possible, and to the extent consistent with the 
safety of life and property, preserve the data recorded by each such 
device for analysis by FRA. This preservation requirement permits the 
railroad to extract and analyze such data, provided the original 
downloaded data file, or an unanalyzed exact copy of it, shall be 
retained in secure custody and shall not be utilized for analysis or any 
other purpose except by direction of FRA or the National Transportation

[[Page 460]]

Safety Board. This preservation requirement shall expire one (1) year 
after the date of the accident unless FRA or the Board notifies the 
railroad in writing that the data are desired for analysis.
    (f) Relationship to other laws. Nothing in this section is intended 
to alter the legal authority of law enforcement officials investigating 
potential violation(s) of State criminal law(s), and nothing in this 
chapter is intended to alter in any way the priority of National 
Transportation Safety Board investigations under 49 U.S.C. 1131 and 
1134, nor the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to 
investigate railroad accidents under 49 U.S.C. 5121, 5122, 20107, 20111, 
20112, 20505, 20702, 20703, and 20902.

\1\ A penalty may be assessed against an individual only for a willful
  violation. Generally, when two or more violations of these regulations
  are discovered with respect to a single locomotive that is used by a
  railroad, the appropriate penalties set forth above are aggregated up
  to a maximum of $16,000 per day. However, a failure to perform, with
  respect to a particular locomotive, any of the inspections and tests
  required under subpart B of this part will be treated as a violation
  separate and distinct from, and in addition to, any substantive
  violative conditions found on that locomotive. Moreover, the

 Sec. Appendix D to Part 229--Criteria for Certification of Crashworthy 

                      Event Recorder Memory Module

    Section 229.135(b) requires that certain locomotives be equipped 
with an event recorder that includes a certified crashworthy event 
recorder memory module. This appendix prescribes the requirements for 
certifying an event recorder memory module (ERMM) as crashworthy, 
including the performance criteria and test sequence for establishing 
the crashworthiness of the ERMM as well as the marking of the event 
recorder containing the crashworthy ERMM.

                         A. General Requirements

    1. Each manufacturer that represents its ERMM as crashworthy shall, 
by marking it as specified in Section B of this appendix, certify that 
the ERMM meets the performance criteria contained in this appendix and 
that test verification data are available to a railroad or to FRA upon 
request.
    2. The test verification data shall contain, at a minimum, all 
pertinent original data logs and documentation that the test sample 
preparation, test set up, test measuring devices and test procedures 
were performed by designated, qualified personnel using recognized and 
acceptable practices. Test verification data shall be retained by the 
manufacturer or its successor as long as the specific model of ERMM 
remains in service on any locomotive.
    3. A crashworthy ERMM shall be marked by its manufacturer as 
specified in Section B of this appendix.

                         B. Marking Requirements

    1. The outer surface of the event recorder containing a certified 
crashworthy ERMM shall be colored international orange. In addition, the 
outer surface shall be inscribed, on the surface allowing the most 
visible area, in black letters on an international orange background, 
using the largest type size that can be accommodated, with the words 
CERTIFIED DOT CRASHWORTHY, followed by the ERMM model number (or other 
such designation), and the name of the manufacturer of the event 
recorder. This information may be displayed as follows:

CERTIFIED DOT CRASHWORTHY

Event Recorder Memory Module Model Number

Manufacturer's Name

Marking ``CERTIFIED DOT CRASHWORTHY'' on an event recorder designed for 
installation in a railroad locomotive is the certification that all 
performance criteria contained in this appendix have been met and all 
functions performed by, or on behalf of, the manufacturer whose name 
appears as part of the marking, conform to the requirements specified in 
this appendix.

    2. Retro-reflective material shall be applied to the edges of each 
visible external surface of an event recorder containing a certified 
crashworthy ERMM.

                  C. Performance Criteria for the ERMM

    An ERMM is crashworthy if it has been successfully tested for 
survival under conditions of fire, impact shock, static crush, fluid 
immersion, and hydro-static pressure contained in one of the two tables 
shown in this section of Appendix D. (See Tables 1 and 2.) Each ERMM 
must meet the individual performance criteria in the sequence 
established in Section D of this appendix. A performance criterion is 
deemed to be met if, after undergoing a test established in this 
Appendix D for that criterion, the ERMM has preserved all of the data 
stored in it. The data set stored in the ERMM to be tested shall include 
all the recording elements required by Sec. 229.135(b). The following 
tables describe alternative performance criteria that may be used when 
testing an ERMM's crashworthiness. A manufacturer may utilize either 
table during its testing but may not combine the criteria contained in 
the two tables.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                           D. Testing Sequence

    In order to reasonably duplicate the conditions an event recorder 
may encounter, the ERMM shall meet the various performance criteria, 
described in Section C of this appendix, in a set sequence. (See Figure 
1). If all tests are done in the set sequence (single branch testing), 
the same ERMM must be utilized throughout. If a manufacturer opts for 
split branch testing, each branch of the test must be conducted using an 
ERMM of the same design type as used for the other branch. Both 
alternatives are deemed equivalent, and the choice of single branch 
testing or split branch testing may be determined by the party 
representing that the ERMM meets the standard.

[[Page 474]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30JN05.002

                          E. Testing Exception

    If a new model ERMM represents an evolution or upgrade from an older 
model ERMM that was previously tested and certified as meeting the 
performance criteria contained in Section C of this appendix, the new 
model ERMM need only be tested for compliance with those performance 
criteria contained in Section C of this appendix that are potentially 
affected by the upgrade or modification. FRA will consider a performance 
criterion not to be potentially affected if a preliminary engineering 
analysis or other pertinent data establishes that the modification or 
upgrade will not change the performance of the older model ERMM against 
the performance criterion in question. The manufacturer shall retain and 
make available to FRA upon request any analysis or data relied upon to 
satisfy the requirements of this paragraph to sustain an exception from 
testing.

    Sec. Appendix E to Part 229--Performance Criteria for Locomotive 

                             Crashworthiness

    This appendix provides performance criteria for the crashworthiness 
evaluation of alternative locomotive designs, and design standards for 
wide-nosed locomotives and any for other locomotive, except monocoque/
semi-monocoque design locomotives and narrow-nose design locomotives. 
Each of the following criteria describes a collision scenario and a 
given performance measure for protection provided to cab occupants, 
normally through structural design. Demonstration that these performance 
criteria have been satisfied may be accomplished through any of the 
methods described in Sec. 229.205. This performance criteria is 
intended to prevent intrusion into the cab seating area occupied by 
crews. This excludes inner and outer vestibule areas.
    (a) Front end structure (collision posts).--(1) Objective. The front 
end structure of the locomotive must withstand a frontal impact with a 
proxy object which is intended to simulate lading carried by a heavy 
highway vehicle (see figure 1).
    (2) Proxy object characteristics and orientation. The proxy object 
must have the following characteristics: Cylindrical shape; 48-inch 
diameter; 126-inch length; 65,000 pound minimum weight; and uniform 
density. The longitudinal axis of the proxy object must be oriented 
horizontally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the locomotive.
    (3) Impact and result. The front end structure of the locomotive 
must withstand a 30-mph impact with the proxy object resulting in no 
more than 24 inches of crush along the longitudinal axis of the 
locomotive, measured from the foremost point on the collision post, and 
with no more than 12 inches of intrusion into the cab. The center of 
impact must be 30 inches above the top of the locomotive underframe 
along the longitudinal centerline of the locomotive.

[[Page 475]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28JN06.004

    (b) Front end structure (short hood)
    (1) Objective. The front end structure of the locomotive must 
withstand an oblique impact with a proxy object intended to simulate an 
intermodal container offset from a freight car on an adjacent parallel 
track (see figure 2).
    (2) Proxy object characteristics and orientation. The proxy object 
must have the following characteristics: Block shape; 36-inch width; 60-
inch height; 108-inch length; corners having 3-inch radii corners; 
65,000 pound minimum weight; and uniform density. The longitudinal axis 
of the proxy object must be oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis 
of the locomotive. At impact, the proxy object must be oriented such 
that there are 12 inches of lateral overlap and 30 inches from the 
bottom of the proxy object to the top of the locomotive underframe.
    (3) Impact and results. The front end structure of the locomotive 
must withstand a 30-mph impact with the proxy object resulting in no 
more than 60 inches of crush along the longitudinal axis of the 
locomotive, measured from the first point of contact on the short hood 
post, and with no more than 12 inches of intrusion into the cab.

                       II. Test Site Requirements

    The test site shall meet the following requirements:
    (1) The locomotive to be tested should not be positioned where large 
reflective surfaces are directly adjacent to or within 25 feet of the 
locomotive cab.
    (2) The locomotive to be tested should not be positioned where other 
locomotives or rail cars are present on directly adjacent tracks next to 
or within 25 feet of the locomotive cab.

[[Page 477]]

    (3) All windows, doors, cabinets seals, etc., must be installed in 
the locomotive cab and be closed.
    (4) The locomotive must be running for sufficient time before the 
test to be at normal operating temperature.
    (5) The heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system or a 
dedicated heating or air conditioner system must be operating on high, 
and the vents must be open and unobstructed.
    (6) The locomotive shall not be tested in any site specifically 
designed to artificially lower in-cab noise levels.

                     III. Procedures for Measurement

    (1) L<INF>Aeq, T</INF> is defined as the A-weighted, equivalent 
sound level for a duration of T seconds, and the sound level meter shall 
be set for A-weighting with slow response.
    (2) The sound level meter shall be calibrated with the acoustic 
calibrator immediately before and after the in-cab static tests. The 
calibration levels shall be recorded.
    (3) Any change in the before and after calibration level(s) shall be 
less than 0.5 dB.
    (4) The sound level meter shall be measured at each of the following 
locations:
    (A) 30 inches above the center of the left seat;
    (B) Centered in the middle of the cab between the right and left 
seats, and 56 inches above the floor;
    (C) 30 inches above the center of the right seat; and
    (D) One foot (0.3 meters) from the center of the back interior wall 
of the cab and 56 inches above the floor. See Figure 1.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC06.005

    (5) The observer shall stand as far from the microphone as possible. 
No more than two people (tester, observers or crew members) shall be 
inside the cab during measurements.
    (6) The locomotive shall be tested under self-loading conditions if 
so equipped. If the locomotive is not equipped with self load, the 
locomotive shall be tested with no-load (No-load defined as maximum 
RPM--no electric load) and an adjustment of 3 dB added to the measured 
level.
    (7) The sound level shall be recorded at the highest horsepower or 
throttle setting.
    (8) After the engine speed has become constant and the in-cab noise 
is continuous, L<INF>Aeq, T</INF> shall be measured, either directly or 
using a 1 second sampling interval, for a minimum duration of 30 seconds 
at each measurement position (L<INF>Aeq, 30s</INF>).
    (9) The highest L<INF>Aeq, 30s</INF> of the 4 measurement positions 
shall be used for determining compliance with Sec. 229.121(a).
    (10) A locomotive that has failed to meet the static test 
requirements of this regulation may be re-tested in accordance with the 
requirements in section II of this appendix.

                            IV. Recordkeeping

    To demonstrate compliance, the entity conducting the test shall 
maintain records of the following data. The records created under this 
procedure shall be retained and made readily accessible for review for a 
minimum of three years. All records may be

[[Page 478]]

maintained in either written or electronic form.
    (1) Name(s) of persons conducting the test, and the date of the 
test.
    (2) Description of locomotive being tested, including: make, model 
number, serial number, and date of manufacture.
    (3) Description of sound level meter and calibrator, including: 
make, model, type, serial number, and manufacturer's calibration date.
    (4) The recorded measurement during calibration and for each 
microphone location during operating conditions.
    (5) Other information as appropriate to describe the testing 
conditions and procedure, including whether or not the locomotive was 
tested under self-loading conditions, or not.
    (6) Where a locomotive fails a test and is re-tested under the 
provisions of Sec. III(9) of this appendix, the suspected reason(s) for 
the failure.

<R04>
                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 230.1  Purpose and scope.

    This part prescribes minimum Federal safety standards for all steam-
propelled locomotives operated on railroads to which this part applies. 
This part does not restrict a railroad from adopting and enforcing 
additional or more stringent requirements not inconsistent with this 
part.

[[Page 480]]


<R05>
Sec. 230.2  Applicability.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this part 
applies to all railroads that operate steam locomotives.
    (b) This part does not apply to:
    (1) A railroad with track gage of less than 24 inches;
    (2) A railroad that operates exclusively freight trains and does so 
only on track inside an installation that is not part of the general 
system of transportation;
    (3) Rapid transit operations in an urban area that are not connected 
to the general system of transportation; or
    (4) A railroad that operates passenger trains and does so only on 
track inside an installation that is insular, i.e., its operations are 
limited to a separate enclave in such a way that there is no reasonable 
expectation that the safety of the public--except a business guest, a 
licensee of the railroad or an affiliated entity, or a trespasser--would 
be affected by the operation. An operation will not be considered 
insular if one or more of the following exists on its line:
    (i) A public highway-rail crossing that is in use;
    (ii) An at-grade rail crossing that is in use;
    (iii) A bridge over a public road or waters used for commercial 
navigation; or
    (iv) A common corridor with another railroad, i.e., its operations 
are conducted within 30 feet of those of any other railroad.
    (c) See appendix A of part 209 for a current statement of the FRA's 
policy on its exercise of jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 230.3  Implementation.

    Except as provided in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, 
the locomotive owner and/or operator shall perform a 1472 service day 
inspection that meets the requirements of Sec. 230.17 when the 
locomotive's flues would be required to be removed pursuant to Sec. 
230.10, of the regulations in effect prior to January 18, 2000. (See 49 
CFR parts 200-999, revised October 1, 1978) At the time the locomotive 
owner and/or operator completes this inspection, it must begin to comply 
with the rest of the provisions of this part. Up until such time, and 
except as provided in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, 
compliance with the regulations in effect prior to January 18, 2000 (See 
49 CFR parts 200-999, revised October 1, 1978) will constitute full 
compliance with this part. Any interested person may obtain the October 
1, 1978 revision of 49 CFR part s 200-999 by contacting the Federal 
Railroad Administration, Office of Chief Counsel, 400 7th Street, SW, 
Washington, DC 20590.
    (a) One year after January 18, 2000. The following sections of this 
part must be complied with by January 18, 2001: Sec. Sec. 230.7, 
230.51, 230.57, 230.68, 230.70, 230.85, 230.87, 230.115, and 230.116.
    (b) Interim flue removal extensions. FRA will continue to consider 
requests for flue removal extensions under the provisions of Sec. 
230.10 of the regulations in effect prior to January 18, 2000 (See 49 
CFR parts 200-999, revised October 1, 1978) until January 18, 2002.
    (c) Petition for special consideration. The locomotive owner or 
operator may petition FRA for special consideration of this part's 
implementation with respect to any locomotive that has either fully or 
partially satisfied the requirements of Sec. 230.17 within the three 
(3) year period prior to September 25, 1998--provided the locomotive is 
in full compliance with Sec. 230.17 by the time the petition is 
actually filed.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Note: As an example, where a locomotive has received a proper 
boiler inspection after September 25, 1995 pursuant to Sec. Sec. 230.10 
and 230.11 of the regulations in effect prior to January 18, 2000 but 
has not had its FRA Form No. 4 updated, the locomotive owner or operator 
may update and verify the FRA Form No. 4 for that locomotive, and submit 
a timely petition that requests retroactive credit for the boiler 
inspection. (See 49 CFR parts 200-999, revised October 1, 1978.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Petition process. Petitions must be filed by January 18, 2001 
and must be accompanied by all relevant documentation to be considered, 
including a FRA Form No. 4 (see appendix C of this part) that has been 
calculated in accordance with Sec. 230.17, and all records that 
demonstrate the number of days the locomotive has been in service. Based 
upon the documentation provided, FRA will calculate the number of 
``service days'' the locomotive has accrued and will notify the 
petitioner

[[Page 481]]

of the number of service days that remain in the locomotive's 1472 
service day cycle. Petitions should be sent to FRA by some form of 
registered mail to ensure a record of delivery. FRA will investigate 
these petitions and will respond to these petitions within one year of 
their receipt. FRA will send its response by some form of registered 
mail to ensure that a record of delivery is created. In its response, 
FRA may grant the petition or deny it. If FRA grants the petition, the 
entirety of the revised requirements will become effective upon receipt 
of FRA's response, unless FRA's response indicates otherwise. If FRA 
denies the petition, the rule will become effective as provided in the 
first paragraph of this section.
    (2) FRA silence. Anyone who does not receive a response within one 
year of the date they filed their petition, whether through 
administrative or postal error, must notify FRA that the response has 
not been received. The notification should be provided to FRA by some 
form of registered mail to ensure a record of delivery. Upon receipt of 
this notification, FRA will ensure that a response is either issued, or 
re-issued, as soon as possible. In the interim, however, any operator 
who is at the end of their inspection cycle under the rules in effect 
prior to January 18, 2000 (See 49 CFR parts 200-999, revised October 1, 
1978) will be allowed to remain in service without conducting the 
required inspection under Sec. 230.17 for an additional six months, or 
until they receive FRA's decision, whichever occurs first.


<R05>
Sec. 230.4  Penalties.

    (a) Any person who violates any requirement of this part or causes 
the violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil penalty of 
at least $550 and not more than $16,000 per violation, except that: 
Penalties may be assessed against individuals only for willful 
violations, and, where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of 
repeated violations has created an imminent hazard of death or injury to 
persons, or has caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $27,000 
per violation may be assessed. Each day a violation continues shall 
constitute a separate offense. See appendix A of part 209 for a 
statement of agency civil penalty policy.
    (b) Any person who knowingly and willfully falsifies a record or 
report required by this part may be subject to criminal penalties under 
49 U.S.C. 21311.

[64 FR 62865, Nov. 17, 1999, as amended at 69 FR 30594, May 28, 2004; 72 
FR 51197, Sept. 6, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 230.5  Preemptive effect.

    The Locomotive Boiler Inspection Act (49 U.S.C. 20701-20703) 
preempts all State laws or regulations concerning locomotive safety. 
Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., 272 U.S. 605 (1926). However, FRA 
believes Congress did not intend to preempt State laws or regulations 
concerning rail operations over which FRA does not exercise 
jurisdiction. Therefore, in issuing this part, it is FRA's intent that 
State laws or regulations applicable to those rail operations to which 
this part does not apply (i.e., insular tourist operations) not be 
preempted.


<R05>
Sec. 230.6  Waivers.

    (a) A person subject to a requirement of this part may petition the 
Administrator of FRA for a waiver of compliance with such requirement. 
The filing of such a petition does not affect that person's 
responsibility for compliance with that requirement while the petition 
is being considered.
    (b) Each petition for waiver under this section must be filed in the 
manner and contain the information required by part 211 of this chapter.
    (c) If the Administrator finds that a waiver of compliance is in the 
public interest and is consistent with railroad safety, the 
Administrator may grant the waiver subject to any conditions the 
Administrator deems necessary. Where a waiver is granted, the 
Administrator publishes a notice containing the reasons for granting the 
waiver.
    (d) All waivers of every form and type from any requirement of any 
order or regulation implementing the Locomotive Boiler Inspection Act, 
36 Stat. 913, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 20702, applicable to one or more 
steam locomotives, shall lapse on January 18, 2000 unless a copy of the 
grant of waiver is filed for reassessment prior to that

[[Page 482]]

date with the Office of Safety, Federal Railroad Administration, 400 
Seventh Street, Washington, DC 20590. FRA will review the waiver and 
notify the applicant whether the waiver has been continued.


<R05>
Sec. 230.7  Responsibility for compliance.

    (a) The locomotive owner and/or operator is directly responsible for 
ensuring that all requirements of this part are satisfied, and is the 
entity primarily responsible for compliance with this part.
    (b) Although the duties imposed by this part are generally stated in 
terms of the duties of a railroad or a steam locomotive owner and/or 
operator, any person, including a contractor for a railroad, who 
performs any function covered by this part must perform that function in 
accordance with this part.
    (c) Chapter 207 of Title 49 of the United States Codes makes it 
unlawful for any railroad to use or permit to be used on its line any 
steam locomotive or tender unless the entire steam locomotive or tender 
and its parts and appurtenances are in proper condition and safe to 
operate in the service to which they are put, without unnecessary danger 
of personal injury and have been inspected and tested as required by 
this part.

                                Staybolts


<R05>
Sec. 230.38  Telltale holes.

    (a) Staybolts less than 8 inches long. All staybolts shorter than 8 
inches, except flexible bolts, shall have telltale holes 3/16 inch to 7/
32 inch diameter and at least 1\1/4\ inches deep in the outer end.
    (b) Reduced body staybolts. On reduced body staybolts, the telltale 
hole shall extend beyond the fillet and into the reduced section of the 
staybolt. Staybolts may have through telltale holes.
    (c) Telltale holes kept open. All telltale holes, except as provided 
for in Sec. 230.41, must be kept open at all times.


<R05>
Sec. 230.39  Broken staybolts.

    (a) Maximum allowable number of broken staybolts. No boiler shall be 
allowed to remain in service with two broken staybolts located within 24 
inches of each other, as measured inside the firebox or combustion 
chamber on a straight line. No boiler shall be allowed to remain in 
service with more than 4 broken staybolts inside the entire firebox and 
combustion chamber, combined.
    (b) Staybolt replacement. Broken staybolts must be replaced during 
the 31 service day inspection, if detected at that time. Broken 
staybolts detected in between 31 service day inspections must be 
replaced no later than 30 calendar days from the time of detection. When 
staybolts 8 inches or less in

[[Page 491]]

length are replaced, they shall be replaced with bolts that have 
telltale holes \3/16\ inch to \7/32\ inch in diameter and at least 1\1/
4\ inches deep at each end, or that have telltale holes \3/16\ inch to 
\7/32\ inch in diameter their entire length. At the time of replacement 
of broken staybolts, adjacent staybolts shall be inspected.
    (c) Assessment of broken staybolts. Telltale holes leaking, plugged, 
or missing shall be counted as broken staybolts.
    (d) Prohibited methods of closing telltale holes. Welding, forging, 
or riveting broken staybolt ends is prohibited as a method of closing 
telltale holes.


<R05>
Sec. 230.40  Time and method of staybolt testing.

    (a) Time of hammer testing--(1) General. All staybolts shall be 
hammer tested at every 31 service day inspection, except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section. All staybolts also shall be hammer 
tested under hydrostatic pressure any time hydrostatic pressure above 
the MAWP specified on the boiler specification form (FRA Form No. 4), is 
applied to the boiler. (See appendix B of this part.)
    (2) Exception for inaccessible staybolts. The removal of brickwork 
or grate bearers for the purpose of hammer testing staybolts during each 
31 service day inspection will not be required if the staybolts behind 
these structural impediments have a telltale hole 3/16 inch to 7/32 inch 
in diameter their entire length. Whenever the brickwork or grate bearers 
are removed for any other reason, however, the bolts shall be inspected 
at that time.
    (b) Method of hammer testing. If staybolts are tested while the 
boiler contains water, the hydrostatic pressure must be not less than 95 
percent of the MAWP. The steam locomotive owner and/or operator shall 
tap each bolt with a hammer and determine broken bolts from the sound or 
the vibration of the sheet. Whenever staybolts are tested while the 
boiler is not under pressure, such as during the 31 service day 
inspection, the staybolt test must be made with all the water drained 
from the boiler.


<R05>
Sec. 230.41  Flexible staybolts with caps.

    (a) General. Flexible staybolts with caps shall have their caps 
removed during every 5th annual inspection for the purpose of inspecting 
the bolts for breakage, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (b) Drilled flexible staybolts. For flexible staybolts that have 
telltale holes between \3/16\ inch and \7/32\ inch in diameter, and 
which extend the entire length of the bolt and into the head not less 
than one third of the diameter of the head, the steam locomotive owner 
and/or operator need not remove the staybolt caps if it can be 
established, by an electrical or other suitable method, that the 
telltale holes are open their entire length. Any leakage from these 
telltale holes during the hydrostatic test indicates that the bolt is 
broken and must be replaced. Before the steam locomotive is placed in 
service, the inner ends of all telltale holes shall be closed with a 
fireproof porous material that will keep the telltale holes free of 
foreign matter and permit steam or water to exit the telltale hole when 
the bolt is broken or fractured.
    (c) Recordkeeping. The removal of flexible staybolt caps and other 
tests shall be reported on FRA Form No. 3. (See appendix B of this 
part.)
    (d) Testing at request of FRA inspector. Staybolt caps also shall be 
removed, or any of the tests in this section made, whenever the FRA 
inspector or the steam locomotive owner and/or operator considers it 
necessary due to identifiable safety concerns about the condition of 
staybolts, staybolt caps or staybolt sleeves.

irregularity is reported.


<R05>
Sec. 230.45  Method of testing.

    Steam gauges shall be compared with an accurate test gauge or dead 
weight tester. While under test load at the MAWP of the boiler to which 
the gauge will be applied, the gauge shall be set to read that pressure 
as accurately as the physical limitations of the gauge will allow. Under 
test the gauge shall read within the manufacturer's tolerance at all 
points on the gauge up to 25 percent above the allowed pressure. If the 
manufacturer's tolerance is not known, the gauge must read within 2 
percent full scale accuracy at all points on the gauge up to 25 percent 
above allowed pressure.

full view of the persons engaged in setting such valves; and if the 
pressure indicated by the gauges varies more than 3 psi they shall be 
removed from the boiler, tested, and corrected before the safety relief 
valves are set. Gauges shall in all cases be tested immediately before 
the safety relief valves are set or any change made in the setting. When 
setting safety relief valves, the water level shall not be higher than 
\3/4\ of the length of the visible water glass, as measured from the 
bottom of the glass.
    (d) Labeling of lowest set pressure. The set pressure of the lowest 
safety relief valve shall be indicated on a tag or label attached to the 
steam gauge so

<R05>
Sec. 230.72  Testing main reservoirs.

    (a) Hammer and hydrostatic testing. Except as described in 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, every main reservoir, except 
those cast integrally with the frame, shall be hammer and 
hydrostatically tested during each annual inspection. The reservoir 
shall be hammer tested while empty and with no pressure applied. If no 
defective areas are detected, a hydrostatic test of MAWP shall be 
applied.
    (b) Drilling of main reservoirs. (1) Only welded main reservoir 
originally constructed to withstand at least five times the MAWP may be 
drilled over its entire surface with telltale holes that are \3/16\ of 
an inch in diameter. The holes shall be spaced not more than 12 inches 
apart, measured both longitudinally and circumferentially, and drilled 
from the outer surface to an extreme depth determined by the following 
formula:

D=(.6PR/(S-.6P))

Where:

D = Extreme depth of telltale holes in inches but in no case less than 
one-sixteenth inch;
P = certified working pressure in psi;
S = \1/5\ of the minimum specified tensile strength of the material in 
psi; and
R = inside radius of the reservoir in inches.

    (2) One row of holes shall be drilled lengthwise of the reservoir on 
a line intersecting the drain opening. When main reservoirs are drilled 
as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the hydrostatic and 
hammer tests described in paragraph (a) of this section are not required 
during the annual inspection. Whenever any telltale hole shall have 
penetrated the interior of any reservoir, the reservoir shall be 
permanently withdrawn from service.
    (c) Welded main reservoirs without longitudinal lap seams. For 
welded main reservoirs that do not have longitudinal lap seams, an 
appropriate NDE method that can measure the wall thickness of the 
reservoir may be used instead of the hammer test and hydrostatic test 
required in paragraph (a) of this section. The spacing of the sampling 
points for wall thickness shall not be greater than 12 inches 
longitudinally and circumferentially. The reservoir shall permanently be 
withdrawn from service where the NDE testing reveals wall thickness less 
than the value determined by the following formula:

t=(PR/(S-.6P)

Where:

t = Minimum value for wall thickness;
P = Certified working pressure in psi;
S = \1/5\ of the minimum specified tensile strength of the material in 
psi, or 10,000 psi if the tensile strength is unknown; and
R = Inside radius of the reservoir in inches.

    (d) Welded or riveted longitudinal lap seam main reservoirs. (1) For 
welded or riveted longitudinal lap seam main reservoirs, an appropriate 
NDE method that can measure wall thickness of the reservoir shall be 
used instead of, or in addition to, the hammer test and hydrostatic 
test. The spacing of the sampling points for wall thickness shall not be 
greater than 12 inches longitudinally and circumferentially. Particular 
care shall be taken to measure along the longitudinal seam on both 
plates at an interval of no more than 6 inches longitudinally. The 
reservoir shall be withdrawn permanently from service where NDE testing 
reveals wall thickness less than the value determined by the following 
formula:

t=(PR/(0.5S-0.6P))

Where:

t = Minimum value for wall thickness;
P = Certified working pressure in psi;

commodity or destination; assembling of cars for train movements; 
changing the position of cars for purposes of loading, unloading, or 
weighing, placing of locomotives and cars for repair or storage; or 
moving of rail equipment in connection with work service that does not 
constitute a road movement. However, this term does not include movement 
of a train or part of a train within yard limits by the road locomotive 
and the placement of locomotives or cars in a train or their removal 
from a train by the road locomotive while en route to the train's 
destination.
    (3) Safety tread surface means that portion of anti-skid surface of 
a switching step that actually is contacted by a shoe or boot.

[[Page 580]]

    (4) Uncoupling mechanism means the arrangement for operating the

    \1\ A penalty may be assessed against an individual only for a 
willful violation. The Administrator reserves the right to assess a 
penalty of up to $27,000 for any violation where circumstances warrant. 
See 49 CFR part 209, appendix A.
    \2\ This schedule uses section numbers from FRA's Safety Appliance 
Defect Code, a restatement of the CFR text in a reorganized format. For 
convenience, and as an exception to FRA's general policy, penalty 
citations will cite the defect code rather than the CFR. FRA reserves 
the right, should litigation become necessary, to substitute in its 
complaint the CFR and/or statutory citation in place of the defect code 
section cited in the penalty demand letter.

[[Page 588]]


<R05>
Sec. 232.5  Definitions.

    The definitions in this section are intended to clarify the meaning 
of terms used in this part as it becomes applicable pursuant to Sec. 
232.1(b) and (c).
    AAR means the Association of American Railroads.
    Air brake means a combination of devices operated by compressed air, 
arranged in a system, and controlled manually, electrically, 
electronically, or pneumatically, by means of which the motion of a 
railroad car or locomotive is retarded or arrested.
    Air Flow Indicator, AFM means a specific air flow indicator required 
by the air flow method of qualifying train air brakes (AFM). The AFM Air 
Flow Indicator is a calibrated air flow measuring device which is 
clearly visible and legible in daylight and darkness from the engineer's 
normal operating position. The indicator face displays:
    (1) Markings from 10 cubic feet per minute (CFM) to 80 CFM, in 
increments of 10 CFM or less; and
    (2) Numerals indicating 20, 40, 60, and 80 CFM for continuous 
monitoring of air flow.
    Bind means restrict the intended movement of one or more brake 
system components by reduced clearance, by obstruction, or by increased 
friction.
    Brake, dynamic means a train braking system whereby the kinetic 
energy of a moving train is used to generate electric current at the 
locomotive traction motors, which is then dissipated through resistor 
grids or into the catenary or third rail system.
    Brake, effective means a brake that is capable of producing its 
nominally designed retarding force on the train. A car's air brake is 
not considered effective if it is not capable of producing its nominally 
designed retarding force or if its piston travel exceeds:
    (1) 10\1/2\ inches for cars equipped with nominal 12-inch stroke 
brake cylinders; or
    (2) The piston travel limit indicated on the stencil, sticker, or 
badge plate for that brake cylinder.
    Brake, hand means a brake that can be applied and released by hand 
to prevent or retard the movement of a locomotive.
    Brake indicator means a device which indicates the brake application 
range and indicates whether brakes are applied and released.
    Brake, inoperative means a primary brake that, for any reason, no 
longer applies or releases as intended.
    Brake, inoperative dynamic means a dynamic brake that, for any 
reason, no longer provides its designed retarding force on the train.
    Brake, parking means a brake that can be applied by means other than 
by hand, such as spring, hydraulic, or air pressure when the brake pipe 
air is depleted, or by an electrical motor.
    Brake pipe means the system of piping (including branch pipes, angle 
cocks, cutout cocks, dirt collectors, hoses, and hose couplings) used 
for connecting locomotives and all railroad cars for the passage of 
compressed air.
    Brake, primary means those components of the train brake system 
necessary to stop the train within the signal spacing distance without 
thermal damage to friction braking surfaces.
    Brake, secondary means those components of the train brake system 
which develop supplemental brake retarding force that is not needed to 
stop the train within signal spacing distances or to prevent thermal 
damage to wheels.
    Emergency application means an irretrievable brake application 
resulting in the maximum retarding force available from the train brake 
system.
    End-of-train device, one-way means two pieces of equipment linked by 
radio that meet the requirements of Sec. 232.403.
    End-of-train device, two-way means two pieces of equipment linked by 
radio that meet the requirements of Sec. Sec. 232.403 and 232.405.
    Foul means any condition which restricts the intended movement of 
one or more brake system components because the component is snagged, 
entangled, or twisted.
    Freight car means a vehicle designed to carry freight, or railroad 
personnel, by rail and a vehicle designed for use in a work or wreck 
train or other non-passenger train.
    Initial terminal means the location where a train is originally 
assembled.
    Locomotive means a piece of railroad on-track equipment, other than 
hi-rail, specialized maintenance, or other similar equipment, which may 
consist of

one or more units operated from a single control stand--
    (1) With one or more propelling motors designed for moving other 
railroad equipment;
    (2) With one or more propelling motors designed to transport freight 
or passenger traffic or both; or
    (3) Without propelling motors but with one or more control stands.
    Locomotive cab means that portion of the superstructure designed to 
be occupied by the crew operating the locomotive.
    Locomotive, controlling means the locomotive from which the engineer 
exercises control over the train.
    Off air means not connected to a continuous source of compressed air 
of at least 60 pounds per square inch (psi).
    Ordered date or date ordered means the date on which notice to 
proceed is given by a procuring railroad to a contractor or supplier for 
new equipment.
    Piston travel means the amount of linear movement of the air brake 
hollow rod (or equivalent) or piston rod when forced outward by movement 
of the piston in the brake cylinder or actuator and limited by the brake 
shoes being forced against the wheel or disc.
    Pre-revenue service acceptance testing plan means a document, as 
further specified in Sec. 232.505, prepared by a railroad that explains 
in detail how pre-revenue service tests of certain equipment demonstrate 
that the equipment meets Federal safety standards and the railroad's own 
safety design requirements.

    Qualified mechanical inspector means a qualified person who has 
received, as a part of the training, qualification, and designation 
program required under Sec. 232.203, instruction and training that 
includes ``hands-on'' experience (under appropriate supervision or 
apprenticeship) in one or more of the following functions: 
troubleshooting, inspection, testing, maintenance or repair of the 
specific train brake components and systems for which the person is 
assigned responsibility. This person shall also possess a current 
understanding of what is required to properly repair and maintain the 
safety-critical brake components for which the person is assigned 
responsibility. Further, the qualified mechanical inspector shall be a 
person whose primary responsibility includes work generally consistent 
with the functions listed in this definition.
    Qualified person means a person who has received, as a part of the 
training, qualification, and designation program required under Sec. 
232.203, instruction and training necessary to perform one or more 
functions required under this part. The railroad is responsible for 
determining that the person has the knowledge and skills necessary to 
perform the required function for which the person is assigned 
responsibility. The railroad determines the qualifications and 
competencies for employees designated to perform various functions in 
the manner set forth in this part. Although the rule uses the term 
``qualified person'' to describe a person responsible for performing 
various functions required under this part, a person may be deemed 
qualified to perform some functions but not qualified to perform other 
functions. For example, although a person may be deemed qualified to 
perform the Class II/intermediate brake test required by this part, that 
same person may or may not be deemed qualified to perform the Class I/
initial Terminal brake test or authorize the movement of defective 
equipment under this part. The railroad will determine the required 
functions for which an individual will be deemed a ``qualified person'' 
based upon the instruction and training the individual has received 
pursuant to Sec. 232.203 concerning a particular function.
    Railroad means any form of non-highway ground transportation that 
runs on rails or electromagnetic guideways, including:

[[Page 590]]

    (1) Commuter or short-haul railroad passenger service in a 
metropolitan or suburban area and commuter railroad service that was 
operated by the Consolidated Rail Corporation on January 1, 1979; and
    (2) High speed ground transportation systems that connect 
metropolitan areas, without regard to whether those systems use new 
technologies not associated with traditional railroads. The term 
``railroad'' is also intended to mean a person that provides 
transportation by railroad, whether directly or by contracting out 
operation of the railroad to another person. The term does not include 
rapid transit operations in an urban area that are not connected to the 
general railroad system of transportation.
    Rebuilt equipment means equipment that has undergone overhaul 
identified by the railroad as a capital expense under the Surface 
Transportation Board's accounting standards.
    Refresher training means periodic retraining required for employees 
or contractors to remain qualified to perform specific equipment 
troubleshooting, inspection, testing, maintenance, or repair functions.
    Respond as intended means to produce the result that a device or 
system is designed to produce.
    ``Roll-by'' inspection means an inspection performed while equipment 
is moving.
    Service application means a brake application that results from one 
or more service reductions or the equivalent.
    Service reduction means a decrease in brake pipe pressure, usually 
from 5 to 25 psi at a rate sufficiently rapid to move the operating 
valve to service position, but at a rate not rapid enough to move the 
operating valve to emergency position.
    Solid block of cars means two or more freight cars coupled together 
and added to or removed from a train as a single unit.
    State inspector means an inspector of a participating State rail 
safety program under part 212 of this chapter.
    Switching service means the classification of freight cars according 
to commodity or destination; assembling of cars for train movements; 
changing the position of cars for purposes of loading, unloading, or 
weighing; placing of locomotives and cars for repair or storage; or 
moving of rail equipment in connection with work service that does not 
constitute a train movement.
    Tourist, scenic, historic, or excursion operations are railroad 
operations that carry passengers, often using antiquated equipment, with 
the conveyance of the passengers to a particular destination not being 
the principal purpose.
    Train means one or more locomotives coupled with one or more freight 
cars, except during switching service.
    Train line means the brake pipe or any non-pneumatic system used to 
transmit the signal that controls the locomotive and freight car brakes.
    Train, unit or train, cycle means a train that, except for the 
changing of locomotive power and the removal or replacement of defective 
equipment, remains coupled as a consist and continuously operates from 
location A to location B and back to location A.
    Transfer train means a train that travels between a point of origin 
and a point of final destination not exceeding 20 miles. Such trains may 
pick up or deliver freight equipment while en route to destination.
    Yard air means a source of compressed air other than from a 
locomotive.

[[Page 591]]

publishes a notice in the Federal Register containing the reasons for 
granting the waiver.


<R05>
Sec. 232.9  Responsibility for compliance.

    (a) A railroad subject to this part shall not use, haul, permit to 
be used or hauled on its line, offer in interchange, or accept in 
interchange any train, railroad car, or locomotive with one or more 
conditions not in compliance with this part; however, a railroad shall 
not be liable for a civil penalty for such action if such action is in 
accordance with Sec. 232.15. For purposes of this part, a train, 
railroad car, or locomotive will be considered in use prior to departure 
but after it has received, or should have received, the inspection 
required for movement and is deemed ready for service.
    (b) Although many of the requirements of this part are stated in 
terms of the duties of a railroad, when any person performs any function 
required by this part, that person (whether or not a railroad) is 
required to perform that function in accordance with this part.
    (c) Any person performing any function or task required by this part 
shall be deemed to have consented to FRA inspection of the person's 
operation to the extent necessary to determine whether the function or 
task is being performed in accordance with the requirements of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 232.11  Penalties.

    (a) Any person (including but not limited to a railroad; any 
manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of a railroad; 
any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, 
or facilities; any employee of such owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee, 
or independent contractor) who violates any requirement of this part or 
causes the violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil 
penalty of at least $550, but not more than $16,000 per violation, 
except that: Penalties may be assessed against individuals only for 
willful violations, and, where a grossly negligent violation or a 
pattern of repeated violations has created an imminent hazard of death 
or injury to persons, or has caused death or injury, a penalty not to 
exceed $27,000 per violation may be assessed. Each day a violation 
continues shall constitute a separate offense. Appendix A to this part 
contains a schedule of civil penalty amounts used in connection with 
this rule.
    (b) Any person who knowingly and willfully falsifies a record or 
report required by this part is subject to criminal penalties under 49 
U.S.C. 21311.

FR 51197, Sept. 6, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 232.13  Preemptive effect.

    (a) Under 49 U.S.C. 20106, issuance of the regulations in this part 
preempts any State law, rule, regulation, order, or standard covering 
the same subject matter, except for a provision necessary to eliminate 
or reduce a local safety hazard if that provision is not incompatible 
with this part and does not impose an undue burden on interstate 
commerce.
    (b) Preemption should also be considered pursuant to the Locomotive 
Boiler Inspection Act (now codified at 49 U.S.C. 20701-20703), the 
Safety Appliance Acts (now codified at 49 U.S.C. 20301-20304), and the 
Commerce Clause based on the relevant case law pertaining to preemption 
under those provisions.
    (c) FRA does not intend by issuance of the regulations in this part 
to preempt provisions of State criminal law that impose sanctions for 
reckless conduct that leads to actual loss of life, injury, or damage to 
property, whether such provisions apply specifically to railroad 
employees or generally to the public at large.


<R05>
Sec. 232.15  Movement of defective equipment.

may prohibit or revoke a railroad's authority to utilize an approved 
automated tracking system in lieu of tagging if FRA finds that the 
automated tracking system is not properly secure, is inaccessible to FRA 
or a railroad's employees, or fails to adequately track and monitor the 
movement of defective equipment. FRA will record such a determination in 
writing, include a statement of the basis for such action, and provide a 
copy of the document to the railroad.
    (c) Movement for unloading or purging of defective cars. If a 
defective car is loaded with a hazardous material or contains residue of 
a hazardous material, the car may not be placed for unloading or purging 
unless unloading or purging is consistent with determinations made and 
restrictions imposed under paragraph (a)(11)(i) of this section and the 
unloading or purging is necessary for the safe repair of the car.
    (d) Computation of percent operative power brakes. (1) The 
percentage of operative power brakes in a train shall be based on the 
number of control valves in the train. The percentage shall be 
determined by dividing the number of control valves that are cut-in by 
the total number of control valves in the train. A control valve shall 
not be considered cut-in if the brakes controlled by that valve are 
inoperative. Both cars and locomotives shall be considered when making 
this calculation.

are not considered inoperative power brakes for purposes of this 
section:
    (i) Failure or cutting out of secondary brake systems;
    (ii) Inoperative or otherwise defective handbrakes or parking 
brakes;
    (iii) Piston travel that is in excess of the Class I brake test 
limits required in Sec. 232.205 but that does not exceed the outside 
limits contained on the stencil, sticker, or badge plate required by 
Sec. 232.103(g) for considering the power brakes to be effective; and
    (iv) Power brakes overdue for inspection, testing, maintenance, or 
stenciling under this part.
    (e) Placement of equipment with inoperative brakes. (1) A freight 
car or locomotive with inoperative brakes shall not be placed as the 
rear car of the train.
    (2) No more than two freight cars with either inoperative brakes or 
not equipped with power brakes shall be consecutively placed in the same 
train.
    (3) Multi-unit articulated equipment shall not be placed in a train 
if the equipment has more than two consecutive individual control valves 
cut-out or if the brakes controlled by the valves are inoperative.
    (f) Guidelines for determining locations where necessary repairs can 
be performed. The following guidelines will be considered by FRA when 
determining whether a location is a location where repairs to a car's 
brake system or components can be performed and whether a location is 
the nearest location where the needed repairs can be effectuated.
    (1) The following general factors and guidelines will be considered 
when making determinations as to whether a location is a location where 
brake repairs can be performed:
    (i) The accessibility of the location to persons responsible for 
making repairs;
    (ii) The presence of hazardous conditions that affect the ability to 
safely make repairs of the type needed at the location;

[[Page 594]]

    (iii) The nature of the repair necessary to bring the car into 
compliance;
    (iv) The need for railroads to have in place an effective means to 
ensure the safe and timely repair of equipment;
    (v) The relevant weather conditions at the location that affect 
accessibility or create hazardous conditions;
    (vi) A location need not have the ability to effectuate every type 
of brake system repair in order to be considered a location where some 
brake repairs can be performed;
    (vii) A location need not be staffed continuously in order to be 
considered a location where brake repairs can be performed;
    (viii) The ability of a railroad to perform repair track brake tests 
or single car tests at a location shall not be considered; and
    (ix) The congestion of work at a location shall not be considered
    (2) The general factors and guidelines outlined in paragraph (f)(1) 
of this section should be applied to the following locations:
    (i) A location where a mobile repair truck is used on a regular 
basis;
    (ii) A location where a mobile repair truck originates or is 
permanently stationed;
    (iii) A location at which a railroad performs mechanical repairs 
other than brake system repairs; and
    (iv) A location that has an operative repair track or repair shop;
    (3) In determining whether a location is the nearest location where 
the necessary brake repairs can be made, the distance to the location is 
a key factor but should not be considered the determining factor. The 
distance to a location must be considered in conjunction with the 
factors and guidance outlined in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this 
section. In addition, the following safety factors must be considered in 
order to optimize safety:
    (i) The safety of the employees responsible for getting the 
equipment to or from a particular location; and
    (ii) The potential safety hazards involved with moving the equipment 
in the direction of travel necessary to get the equipment to a 
particular location.
    (g) Designation of repair locations. Based on the guidance detailed 
in paragraph (f) of this section and consistent with other requirements 
contained in this part, a railroad may submit a detailed petition, 
pursuant to the special approval procedures contained in Sec. 232.17, 
containing a plan designating locations where brake system repairs will 
be performed. Approval of such plans shall be made accordance with the 
procedures contained in Sec. 232.17, and shall be subject to any 
modifications determined by FRA to be necessary to ensure consistency 
with the requirements and guidance contained in this part.

Sec. 232.205.
    (e) A train shall not move if less than 85 percent of the cars in 
that train have operative and effective brakes.
    (f) Each car in a train shall have its air brakes in effective 
operating condition unless the car is being moved for repairs in 
accordance with Sec. 232.15. The air brakes on a car are not in 
effective operating condition if its brakes are cut-out or otherwise 
inoperative or if the piston travel exceeds:
    (1) 10\1/2\ inches for cars equipped with nominal 12-inch stroke 
brake cylinders; or
    (2) The piston travel limits indicated on the stencil, sticker, or 
badge plate for the brake cylinder with which the car is equipped.
    (g) Except for cars equipped with nominal 12-inch stroke (8\1/2\ and 
10-inch diameters) brake cylinders, all cars shall have a legible decal, 
stencil, or sticker affixed to the car or shall be equipped with a badge 
plate displaying the permissible brake cylinder piston travel range for 
the car at Class I brake tests and the length at which the piston travel 
renders the brake ineffective, if different from Class I brake test 
limits. The decal, stencil, sticker, or badge plate shall be located so 
that it may be easily read and understood by a person positioned safely 
beside the car.
    (h) All equipment ordered on or after August 1, 2002, or placed in 
service for the first time on or after April 1, 2004, shall have train 
brake systems designed so that an inspector can observe from a safe 
position either the piston travel, an accurate indicator which shows 
piston travel, or any other means by which the brake system is actuated. 
The design shall not require the inspector to place himself or herself 
on, under, or between components of the equipment to observe brake 
actuation or release.
    (i) All trains shall be equipped with an emergency application 
feature that produces an irretrievable stop, using a brake rate 
consistent with prevailing adhesion, train safety, and brake system 
thermal capacity. An emergency application shall be available at all 
times, and shall be initiated by an unintentional parting of the train 
line or loss of train brake communication.
    (j) A railroad shall set the maximum main reservoir working 
pressure.
    (k) The maximum brake pipe pressure shall not be greater than 15 psi 
less than the air compressor governor starting or loading pressure.

securing any unattended locomotive required to have a hand brake applied 
pursuant to paragraph (n)(3)(i) through (n)(3)(iii) when the locomotive 
is not equipped with an operative hand brake.
    (4) A railroad shall adopt and comply with a process or procedures 
to verify that the applied hand brakes will sufficiently hold an 
unattended locomotive consist. A railroad shall also adopt and comply 
with instructions to address throttle position, status of the reverse 
lever, position of the generator field switch, status of the independent 
brakes, position of the isolation switch, and position of the automatic 
brake valve on all unattended locomotives. The procedures and 
instruction required in this paragraph shall take into account winter 
weather conditions as they relate to throttle position and reverser 
handle.

days. The date of the last inspection shall be either entered on Form 
FRA F 6180-49A or suitably stenciled or tagged on the locomotive.
    (d) The amount of leakage from the equalizing reservoir on 
locomotives and related piping shall be zero, unless the system is 
capable of maintaining the set pressure at any service application with 
the brakes control valve in the freight position. If such leakage is 
detected en route, the train may be moved only to the nearest forward 
location where the equalizing-reservoir leakage can be corrected. On 
locomotives equipped with electronic brakes, if the system logs or 
displays a fault related to equalizing reservoir leakage, the train may 
be moved only to the nearest forward location where the necessary 
repairs can be made.
    (e) Use of the feed or regulating valve to control braking is 
prohibited.
    (f) The passenger position on the locomotive brake control stand 
shall be used only if the trailing equipment is designed for graduated 
brake release or if equalizing reservoir leakage occurs en route and its 
use is necessary to safely control the movement of the train until it 
reaches the next forward location where the reservoir leakage can be 
corrected.
    (g) When taking charge of a locomotive or locomotive consist, an 
engineer must know that the brakes are in operative condition.

the equipment it services.
    (ii) Identify yard air sources found not to be operating as intended 
or found introducing contaminants into the brake system of the equipment 
it services.
    (iii) Repair or take other remedial action regarding any yard air 
source identified under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (3) A railroad shall maintain records of the information and actions 
required by paragraph (a)(2). These records shall be maintained for a 
period of at least one year from the date of creation and may be 
maintained either electronically or in writing.
    (b) Condensation and other contaminants shall be blown from the pipe 
or hose from which compressed air is

[[Page 599]]

taken prior to connecting the yard air line or motive power to the 
train.
    (c) No chemicals which are known to degrade or harm brake system 
components shall be placed in the train air brake system.
    (d) Yard air reservoirs shall either be equipped with an operable 
automatic drain system or be manually drained at least once each day 
that the devices are used or more often if moisture is detected in the 
system.
    (e) A railroad shall adopt and comply with detailed written 
operating procedures tailored to the equipment and territory of that 
railroad to cover safe train operations during cold weather. For 
purposes of this provision, ``cold weather'' means when the ambient 
temperature drops below 10 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (minus 12.2 degrees 
Celsius).

terminal for a train and at other locations where a locomotive engineer 
first begins operation of a train. The information required by this 
paragraph may be provided to the locomotive engineer by any means 
determined to be appropriate by the railroad; however, a written or 
electronic record of the information shall be maintained in the cab of 
the controlling locomotive.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, all 
inoperative dynamic brakes shall be repaired within 30 calendar days of 
becoming inoperative or at the locomotive's next periodic inspection 
pursuant to Sec. 229.23 of this chapter, whichever occurs first.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a 
locomotive discovered with inoperative dynamic brakes shall have a tag 
bearing the words ``inoperative dynamic brake'' securely attached and 
displayed in a conspicuous location in the cab of the locomotive. This 
tag shall contain the following information:
    (1) The locomotive number;
    (2) The name of the discovering carrier;
    (3) The location and date where condition was discovered; and
    (4) The signature of the person discovering the condition.
    (d) An electronic or written record of repairs made to a 
locomotive's dynamic brakes shall be retained for 92 days.
    (e) A railroad may elect to declare the dynamic brakes on a 
locomotive deactivated without removing the dynamic brake components 
from the locomotive, only if all of the following conditions are met:
    (1) The locomotive is clearly marked with the words ``dynamic brake 
deactivated'' in a conspicuous location in the cab of the locomotive; 
and
    (2) The railroad has taken appropriate action to ensure that the 
deactivated locomotive is incapable of utilizing dynamic brake effort to 
retard or control train speed.
    (f) If a locomotive consist is intended to have its dynamic brakes 
used while in transit, a locomotive with inoperative or deactivated 
dynamic brakes or a locomotive not equipped with dynamic brakes shall 
not be placed in the controlling (lead) position of a consist unless the 
locomotive has the capability of:
    (1) Controlling the dynamic braking effort in trailing locomotives 
in the consist that are so equipped; and
    (2) Displaying to the locomotive engineer the deceleration rate of 
the train or the total train dynamic brake retarding force.
    (g) All locomotives equipped with dynamic brakes and ordered on or 
after April 1, 2006, or placed in service for the first time on or after 
October 1, 2007, shall be designed to:
    (1) Conduct an electrical integrity test of the dynamic brake to 
determine if electrical current is being received at the grids on the 
system; and
    (2) Display in real-time in the cab of the controlling (lead) 
locomotive the total train dynamic brake retarding force available in 
the train.
    (h) All rebuilt locomotives equipped with dynamic brakes and placed 
in service on or after April 1, 2004, shall be designed to:

[[Page 600]]

    (1) Conduct an electrical integrity test of the dynamic brake to

dynamic brakes shall adopt and comply with written operating rules 
governing safe train handling procedures using these dynamic brakes 
under all operating conditions, which shall be tailored to the specific 
equipment and territory of the railroad. The railroad's operating rules 
shall:
    (1) Ensure that the friction brakes are sufficient by themselves, 
without the aid of dynamic brakes, to stop the train safely under all 
operating conditions.
    (2) Include a ``miles-per-hour-overspeed-stop'' rule. At a minimum, 
this rule shall require that any train when descending a section of 
track with an average grade of one percent or greater over a distance of 
three continuous miles shall be immediately brought to a stop, by an 
emergency brake application if necessary, when the train's speed exceeds 
the maximum authorized speed for that train by more than 5 miles per 
hour. A railroad shall reduce the 5-miles-per-hour-overspeed-stop 
restriction if validated research indicates the need for such a 
reduction. A railroad may increase the 5-miles-per-hour-overspeed 
restriction only with approval of FRA and based upon verifiable data and 
research.

with a means for maintaining brake pipe pressure at a constant level 
during a 20-psi brake pipe service reduction, this feature shall be cut 
out during the leakage test; and
    (D) With the brake valve lapped and the pressure maintaining feature 
cut out (if so equipped) and after waiting

[[Page 604]]

45-60 seconds, note the brake pipe leakage as indicated by the brake-
pipe gauge in the locomotive, which shall not exceed 5 psi per minute.
    (ii) Air Flow Method Test. When a locomotive is equipped with a 26-L 
brake valve or equivalent pressure maintaining locomotive brake valve, a 
railroad may use the Air Flow Method Test as an alternate to the brake 
pipe leakage test. The Air Flow Method (AFM) Test shall be performed as 
follows:
    (A) Charge the air brake system to the pressure at which the train 
will be operated, and the pressure at the rear of the train shall be 
within 15 psi of the pressure at which the train will be operated, but 
not less than 75 psi, as indicated by an accurate gauge or end-of-train 
device at the rear end of train; and
    (B) Measure air flow as indicated by a calibrated AFM indicator, 
which shall not exceed 60 cubic feet per minute (CFM).
    (iii) The AFM indicator shall be calibrated for accuracy at periodic 
intervals not to exceed 92 days. The AFM indicator calibration test 
orifices shall be calibrated at temperatures of not less than 20 degrees 
Fahrenheit. AFM indicators shall be accurate to within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>3 standard cubic feet per minute (CFM).
    (2) The inspector(s) shall take a position on each side of each car 
sometime during the inspection process so as to be able to examine and 
observe the functioning of all moving parts of the brake system on each 
car in order to make the determinations and inspections required by this 
section. A ``roll-by'' inspection of the brake release as provided for 
in paragraph (b)(8) of this section shall not constitute an inspection 
of that side of the train for purposes of this requirement;
    (3) The train brake system shall be charged to the pressure at which 
the train will be operated, and the pressure at the rear of the train 
shall be within 15 psi of the pressure at which the train will be 
operated, but not less than 75 psi, angle cocks and cutout cocks shall 
be properly positioned, air hoses shall be properly coupled and shall 
not kink, bind, or foul or be in any other condition that restricts air 
flow. An examination must be made for leaks and necessary repairs made 
to reduce leakage to the required minimum. Retaining valves and 
retaining valve pipes shall be inspected and known to be in proper 
condition for service;
    (4) The brakes on each car shall apply in response to a 20-psi brake 
pipe service reduction and shall remain applied until a release of the 
air brakes has been initiated by the controlling locomotive or yard test 
device. The brakes shall not be applied or released until the proper 
signal is given. A car found with brakes that fail to apply or remain 
applied may be retested and remain in the train if the retest is 
conducted at an air pressure that is within 15 psi of the air pressure 
at which the train will be operated. The retest may be conducted from 
either the controlling locomotive, the head-end of the consist, or with 
a suitable test device, as described in Sec. 232.217(a), positioned at 
one end of the car(s) being retested, and the brakes shall remain 
applied until a release is initiated after a period which is no less 
than three minutes. If the retest is performed at the car(s) being 
retested with a suitable device, the compressed air in the car(s) shall 
be depleted prior to disconnecting the hoses between the car(s) to 
perform the retest;
    (5) For cars equipped with 8\1/2\-inch or 10-inch diameter brake 
cylinders, piston travel shall be within 7 to 9 inches. If piston travel 
is found to be less than 7 inches or more than 9 inches, it must be 
adjusted to nominally 7\1/2\ inches. For cars not equipped with 8\1/2\-
inch or 10-inch diameter brake cylinders, piston travel shall be within 
the piston travel stenciled or marked on the car or badge plate. Minimum 
brake cylinder piston travel of truck-mounted brake cylinders must be 
sufficient to provide proper brake shoe clearance when the brakes are 
released. Piston travel must be inspected on each freight car while the 
brakes are applied;
    (6) Brake rigging shall be properly secured and shall not bind or 
foul or otherwise adversely affect the operation of the brake system;
    (7) All parts of the brake equipment shall be properly secured. On 
cars where the bottom rod passes through the truck bolster or is secured 
with

[[Page 605]]

cotter keys equipped with a locking device to prevent their accidental 
removal, bottom rod safety supports are not required; and
    (8) When the release is initiated by the controlling locomotive or 
yard test device, the brakes on each freight car shall be inspected to 
verify that it did release; this may be performed by a ``roll-by'' 
inspection. If a ``roll-by'' inspection of the brake release is 
performed, train speed shall not exceed 10 MPH and the qualified person 
performing the ``roll-by'' inspection shall communicate the results of 
the inspection to the operator of the train. The operator of the train 
shall note successful completion of the release portion of the 
inspection on the record required in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Where a railroad's collective bargaining agreement provides that 
a carman is to perform the inspections and tests required by this 
section, a carman alone will be considered a qualified person. In these 
circumstances, the railroad shall ensure that the carman is properly 
trained and designated as a qualified person or qualified mechanical 
inspector pursuant to the requirements of this part.
    (e) A railroad shall notify the locomotive engineer that the Class I 
brake test was satisfactorily performed and provide the information 
required in this paragraph to the locomotive engineer or place the 
information in the cab of the controlling locomotive following the test. 
The information required by this paragraph may be provided to the 
locomotive engineer by any means determined appropriate by the railroad; 
however, a written or electronic record of the information shall be 
retained in the cab of the controlling locomotive until the train 
reaches its destination. The written or electronic record shall contain 
the date, time, number of freight cars inspected, and identify the 
qualified person(s) performing the test and the location where the Class 
I brake test was performed.
    (f) Before adjusting piston travel or working on brake rigging, 
cutout cock in brake pipe branch must be closed and air reservoirs must 
be voided of all compressed air. When cutout cocks are provided in brake 
cylinder pipes, these cutout cocks only may be closed and air reservoirs 
need not be voided of all compressed air.

Sec. 232.207  Class IA brake tests--1,000-mile inspection.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 232.213, each train shall receive a 
Class IA brake test performed by a qualified person, as defined in Sec. 
232.5, at a location that is not more than 1,000 miles from the point 
where any car in the train last received a Class I or Class IA brake 
test. The most restrictive car or block of cars in the train shall 
determine the location of this test.
    (b) A Class IA brake test of a train shall consist of the following 
tasks and requirements:
    (1) Brake pipe leakage shall not exceed 5 psi per minute, or air 
flow shall not exceed 60 cubic feet per minute (CFM). The brake pipe 
leakage test or air flow method test shall be conducted pursuant to the 
requirements contained in Sec. 232.205(c)(1);
    (2) The inspector shall position himself/herself, taking positions 
on each side of each car sometime during the inspection process, so as 
to be able to examine and observe the functioning of all moving parts of 
the brake system on each car in order to make the determinations and 
inspections required by this section;
    (3) The air brake system shall be charged to the pressure at which 
the train will be operated, and the pressure at the rear of the train 
shall be within 15 psi of the pressure at which the train will be 
operated, but not less than 75 psi, as indicated by an accurate gauge or 
end-of-train device at rear end of train;
    (4) The brakes on each car shall apply in response to a 20-psi brake 
pipe service reduction and shall remain applied until the release is 
initiated by the controlling locomotive. A car found with brakes that 
fail to apply or remain applied may be retested and remain in the train 
if the retest is conducted as prescribed in Sec. 232.205(c)(4); 
otherwise, the defective equipment may only be moved pursuant to the 
provisions contained in Sec. 232.15, if applicable;

[[Page 606]]

foul or otherwise adversely affect the operation of the brake system; 
and
    (6) All parts of the brake equipment shall be properly secured.
    (c) A railroad shall designate the locations where Class IA brake 
tests will be performed, and the railroad shall furnish to the Federal 
Railroad Administration upon request a description of each location 
designated. A railroad shall notify FRA's Associate Administrator for 
Safety in writing 30 days prior to any change in the locations 
designated for such tests and inspections.
    (1) Failure to perform a Class IA brake test on a train at a 
location designated pursuant to this paragraph constitutes a failure to 
perform a proper Class IA brake test if the train is due for such a test 
at that location.
    (2) In the event of an emergency that alters normal train 
operations, such as a derailment or other unusual circumstance that 
adversely affects the safe operation of the train, the railroad is not 
required to provide prior written notification of a change in the 
location where a Class IA brake test is performed to a location not on 
the railroad's list of designated locations for performing Class IA 
brake tests, provided that the railroad notifies FRA's Associate 
Administrator for Safety and the pertinent FRA Regional Administrator 
within 24 hours after the designation has been changed and the reason 
for that change.

Sec. 232.209  Class II brake tests--intermediate inspection.

    (a) At a location other than the initial terminal of a train, a 
Class II brake test shall be performed by a qualified person, as defined 
in Sec. 232.5, on the following equipment when added to a train:
    (1) Each car or solid block of cars, as defined in Sec. 232.5, that 
has not previously received a Class I brake test or that has been off 
air for more than four hours;
    (2) Each solid block of cars, as defined in Sec. 232.5, that is 
comprised of cars from more than one previous train; and
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, each 
solid block of cars that is comprised of cars from only one previous 
train, the cars of which have not remained continuously and 
consecutively coupled together with the train line remaining connected 
since being removed from the previous train. A solid block of cars is 
considered to have remained continuously and consecutively coupled 
together with the train line remaining connected since being removed 
from the previous train if it has been changed only by removing 
defective equipment.
    (4) Each solid block of cars that is comprised of cars from a single 
previous train, the cars of which were required to be separated into 
multiple solid blocks of cars due to space or trackage constraints at a 
particular location when removed from the previous train, if they are 
not added in the same relative order as when removed from the previous 
train or if the cars in each of the multiple blocks of cars have not 
remained continuously and consecutively coupled together with the train 
line remaining connected, except for the removal of defective equipment.
    (b) A Class II brake test shall consist of the following tasks and 
requirements:
    (1) Brake pipe leakage shall not exceed 5 psi per minute, or air 
flow shall not exceed 60 cubic feet per minute (CFM). The brake pipe 
leakage test or air flow method test shall be conducted on the entire 
train pursuant to the requirements contained in Sec. 232.205(c)(1);
    (2) The air brake system shall be charged to the pressure at which 
the train will be operated, and the pressure at the rear of the train 
shall be within 15 psi of the pressure at which the train will be 
operated, but not less than 75 psi, as indicated by an accurate gauge or 
end-of-train device at the rear end of train;
    (3) The brakes on each car added to the train and on the rear car of 
the train shall be inspected to ensure that they apply in response to a 
20-psi brake pipe service reduction and remain applied until the release 
is initiated from the controlling locomotive. A car found

[[Page 607]]

with brakes that fail to apply or remain applied may be retested and 
remain in the train if the retest is conducted as prescribed in Sec. 
232.205(c)(4); otherwise, the defective equipment may only be moved 
pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 232.15, if applicable;
    (4) When the release is initiated, the brakes on each car added to 
the train and on the rear car of the train shall be inspected to verify 
that they did release; this may be performed by a ``roll-by'' 
inspection. If a ``roll-by'' inspection of the brake release is 
performed, train speed shall not exceed 10 MPH, and the qualified person 
performing the ``roll-by'' inspection shall communicate the results of 
the inspection to the operator of the train; and
    (5) Before the train proceeds the operator of the train shall know 
that the brake pipe pressure at the rear of the train is being restored.
    (c) As an alternative to the rear car brake application and release 
portion of the test, the operator of the train shall determine that 
brake pipe pressure of the train is being reduced, as indicated by a 
rear car gauge or end-of-train telemetry device, and then that the brake 
pipe pressure of the train is being restored, as indicated by a rear car 
gauge or end-of-train telemetry device. (When an end-of-train telemetry 
device is used to comply with any test requirement in this part, the 
phrase ``brake pipe pressure of the train is being reduced'' means a 
pressure reduction of at least 5 psi, and the phrase ``brake pipe 
pressure of the train is being restored'' means a pressure increase of 
at least 5 psi). If an electronic communication link between a 
controlling locomotive and a remotely controlled locomotive attached to 
the rear end of a train is utilized to determine that brake pipe 
pressure is being restored, the operator of the train shall know that 
the air brakes function as intended on the remotely controlled 
locomotive.
    (d) Each car or solid block of cars that receives a Class II brake 
test pursuant to this section when added to the train shall receive a 
Class I brake test at the next forward location where facilities are 
available for performing such a test.

Sec. 232.211  Class III brake tests-trainline continuity inspection.

    (a) A Class III brake test shall be performed on a train by a 
qualified person, as defined in Sec. 232.5, to test the train brake 
system when the configuration of the train has changed in certain ways. 
In particular, a Class III brake test shall be performed at the location 
where any of the following changes in the configuration of the train 
occur:
    (1) Where a locomotive or a caboose is changed;
    (2) Where a car or a block of cars is removed from the train with 
the consist otherwise remaining intact;
    (3) At a point other than the initial terminal for the train, where 
a car or a solid block of cars that is comprised of cars from only one 
previous train the cars of which have remained continuously and 
consecutively coupled together with the trainline remaining connected, 
other than for removing defective equipment, since being removed from 
its previous train that has previously received a Class I brake test and 
that has not been off air for more than four hours is added to a train;
    (4) At a point other than the initial terminal for the train, where 
a solid block of cars that is comprised of cars from a single previous 
train is added to a train, provided that the solid block of cars was 
required to be separated into multiple solid blocks of cars due to space 
or trackage constraints at a particular location when removed from the 
previous train, and the cars have previously received a Class I brake 
test, have not been off air more than four hours, and the cars in each 
of the multiple blocks of cars have remained continuously and 
consecutively coupled together with the train line remaining connected, 
except for the removal of defective equipment. Furthermore, these 
multiple solid blocks of cars must be added to the train in the same 
relative order (no reclassification) as when removed from the previous 
train, except for the removal of defective equipment; or

[[Page 608]]

    (5) At a point other than the initial terminal for the train, where 
a car or a solid block of cars that has received a Class I or Class II 
brake test at that location, prior to being added to the train, and that 
has not been off air for more than four hours is added to a train.
    (b) A Class III brake test shall consist of the following tasks and 
requirements:
    (1) The train brake system shall be charged to the pressure at which 
the train will be operated, and the pressure at the rear of the train 
shall not be less than 60 psi, as indicated at the rear of the train by 
an accurate gauge or end-of-train device;
    (2) The brakes on the rear car of the train shall apply in response 
to a 20-psi brake pipe service reduction and shall remain applied until 
the release is initiated by the controlling locomotive;
    (3) When the release is initiated, the brakes on the rear car of the 
train shall be inspected to verify that it did release; and
    (4) Before proceeding the operator of the train shall know that the 
brake pipe pressure at the rear of freight train is being restored.
    (c) As an alternative to the rear car brake application and release 
portion of the test, it shall be determined that the brake pipe pressure 
of the train is being reduced, as indicated by a rear car gauge or end-
of-train telemetry device, and then that the brake pipe pressure of the 
train is being restored, as indicated by a rear car gauge or end-of-
train telemetry device. If an electronic or radio communication link 
between a controlling locomotive and a remotely controlled locomotive 
attached to the rear end of a train is utilized to determine that brake 
pipe pressure is being restored, the operator of the train shall know 
that the air brakes function as intended on the remotely controlled 
locomotive.
    (d) Whenever the continuity of the brake pipe is broken or 
interrupted with the train consist otherwise remaining unchanged, it 
must be determined that the brake pipe pressure of the train is being 
restored as indicated by a rear car gauge or end-of-train device prior 
to proceeding. In the absence of an accurate rear car gauge or end-of-
train telemetry device, it must be determined that the brakes on the 
rear car of the train apply and release in response to air pressure 
changes made in the controlling locomotive.

Sec. 232.213  Extended haul trains.

    (a) A railroad may be permitted to move a train up to, but not 
exceeding, 1,500 miles between brake tests and inspections if the 
railroad designates a train as an extended haul train. In order for a 
railroad to designate a train as an extended haul train, all of the 
following requirements must be met:
    (1) The railroad must designate the train in writing to FRA's 
Associate Administrator for Safety. This designation must include the 
following:
    (i) The train identification symbol or identification of the 
location where extended haul trains will originate and a description of 
the trains that will be operated as extended haul trains from those 
locations;
    (ii) The origination and destination points for the train;
    (iii) The type or types of equipment the train will haul; and
    (iv) The locations where all train brake and mechanical inspections 
and tests will be performed.
    (2) A Class I brake test pursuant to Sec. 232.205 shall be 
performed at the initial terminal for the train by a qualified 
mechanical inspector as defined in Sec. 232.5.
    (3) A freight car inspection pursuant to part 215 of this chapter 
shall be performed at the initial terminal for the train and shall be 
performed by an inspector designated under Sec. 215.11 of this chapter.
    (4) All cars having conditions not in compliance with part 215 of 
this chapter at the initial terminal for the train shall be either 
repaired or removed from the train. Except for a car developing such a 
condition en route, no car shall be moved pursuant to the provisions of 
Sec. 215.9 of this chapter in the train.
    (5) The train shall have no more than one pick-up and one set-out en 
route, except for the set-out of defective equipment pursuant to the 
requirements of this chapter.

[[Page 609]]

    (i) Cars added to the train en route shall be inspected pursuant to 
the requirements contained in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(5) of this 
section at the location where they are added to the train.
    (ii) Cars set out of the train en route shall be inspected pursuant 
to the requirements contained in paragraph (a)(6) of this section at the 
location where they are set out of the train.
    (6) At the point of destination, if less than 1,500 miles from the 
train's initial terminal, or at the point designated by the railroad 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, not to exceed 1,500 
miles, an inbound inspection of the train shall be conducted by a 
qualified mechanical inspector to identify any defective, inoperative, 
or ineffective brakes or any other condition not in compliance with this 
part as well as any conditions not in compliance with part 215 and part 
231 of this chapter. After April 1, 2007, the inbound inspection 
described in this paragraph shall not be required unless FRA provides 
notification to the industry extending the requirement to perform 
inbound inspections on extended haul trains. FRA's determination to 
extend the inbound inspection requirement will be based on the records 
required to be maintained pursuant to paragraph (a)(7) of this section 
and any other relevant safety data. FRA's notification will be published 
in the Federal Register and will contain the basis of any determination.
    (7) The railroad shall maintain a record of all defective, 
inoperative, or ineffective brakes as well as any conditions not in 
compliance with part 215 and part 231 of this chapter discovered at 
anytime during the movement of the train. These records shall be 
retained for a period of one year and made available to FRA upon 
request. The records required by this section may be maintained either 
electronically or in writing. After April 1, 2007, the records described 
in this paragraph need not be maintained unless FRA provides the 
notification required in paragraph (a)(6) of this section extending the 
requirement to conduct inbound inspections on extended haul trains.
    (8) In order for an extended haul train to proceed beyond 1,500 
miles, the following requirements shall be met:
    (i) If the train will move 1,000 miles or less from that location 
before receiving a Class IA brake test or reaching destination, a Class 
I brake test shall be conducted pursuant to Sec. 232.205 to ensure 100 
percent effective and operative brakes. The inbound inspection required 
by paragraph (a)(6) of this section may be used to meet this requirement 
provided it encompasses all the inspection elements contained in Sec. 
232.205.
    (ii) If the train will move greater than 1,000 miles from that 
location without another brake inspection, the train must be identified 
as an extended haul train for that movement and shall meet all the 
requirements contained in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this 
section. Such trains shall receive a Class I brake test pursuant to 
Sec. 232.205 by a qualified mechanical inspector to ensure 100 percent 
effective and operative brakes, a freight car inspection pursuant to 
part 215 of this chapter by an inspector designated under Sec. 215.11 
of this chapter, and all cars containing non-complying conditions under 
part 215 of this chapter shall either be repaired or removed from the 
train. The inbound inspection required by paragraph (a)(6) of this 
section may be used to meet these inspection requirements provided it 
encompasses all the inspection elements contained paragraphs (a)(2) 
through (a)(4) of this section.
    (9) FRA inspectors shall have physical access to visually observe 
all brake and freight car inspections and tests required by this 
section.
    (b) Failure to comply with any of the requirements contained in 
paragraph (a) of this section will be considered an improper movement of 
a designated priority train for which appropriate civil penalties may be 
assessed as outlined in Appendix A to this part. Furthermore, FRA's 
Associate Administrator for Safety may revoke a railroad's ability to 
designate any or all trains as extended haul trains for repeated or 
willful noncompliance with any of the requirements contained in this 
section. Such a determination will

[[Page 610]]

be made in writing and will state the basis for such action.

Sec. 232.217  Train brake tests conducted using yard air.

    (a) When a train air brake system is tested from a yard air source, 
an engineer's brake valve or a suitable test device shall be used to 
provide any increase or reduction of brake pipe air pressure at the 
same, or slower, rate as an engineer's brake valve.
    (b) The yard air test device must be connected to the end of the 
train or block of cars that will be nearest to the controlling 
locomotive. However, if the railroad adopts and complies with written 
procedures to ensure that potential overcharge conditions to the train 
brake system are avoided, the yard air test device may be connected to 
other than the end nearest to the controlling locomotive.
    (c) Except as provided in this section, when yard air is used the 
train air brake system must be charged and tested as prescribed by Sec. 
232.205(c) and when practicable should be kept charged until road motive 
power is coupled to train, after which, a Class III brake test shall be 
performed as prescribed by Sec. 232.211.
    (1) If the cars are off air for more than four hours, the cars shall 
be retested in accordance with Sec. 232.205(c) through (f).
    (2) At a minimum, yard air pressure shall be 60 psi at the end of 
the consist or block of cars opposite from the yard test device and 
shall be within 15 psi of the regulator valve setting on yard test 
device.
    (3) If the air pressure of the yard test device is less than 80 psi, 
then a brake pipe leakage or air flow test shall be conducted at the 
operating pressure of the train when the locomotives are attached in 
accordance with Sec. 232.205(c)(1).
    (d) Mechanical yard air test devices and gauges shall be calibrated 
every 92 days. Electronic yard test devices and gauges shall be 
calibrated annually. Mechanical and electronic yard air test devices and 
gauges shall be calibrated so that they are accurate to within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>3 psi.
    (e) If used to test a train, a yard air test device and any yard air 
test equipment shall be accurate and function as intended.

         Subpart D_Periodic Maintenance and Testing Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 232.301  Scope.

    This subpart contains the periodic brake system maintenance and 
testing requirements for equipment used in freight and other non-
passenger trains.


<R05>
Sec. 232.303  General requirements.

    (a) Definitions. The following definitions are intended solely for 
the purpose of identifying what constitutes a shop or repair track under 
this subpart.
    (1) Shop or repair track means:
    (i) A fixed repair facility or track designated by the railroad as a 
shop or repair track;
    (ii) A fixed repair facility or track which is regularly and 
consistently used to perform major repairs;
    (iii) track which is used at a location to regularly and 
consistently perform both minor and major repairs where the railroad has 
not designated a certain portion of that trackage as a repair track;
    (iv) A track designated by a railroad as a track where minor repairs 
will be conducted or used by a railroad to regularly and consistently 
perform minor repairs during the period when the track is used to 
conduct major repairs; however, such trackage is considered a shop or 
repair track only for each car receiving major repairs on such trackage 
and not for a car receiving only minor repairs; and
    (v) The facilities and tracks identified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) 
through (a)(1)(iv) shall be considered shop or repair tracks regardless 
of whether a mobile repair vehicle is used to conduct the repairs.
    (2) Major repair means a repair that normally would require greater 
than four person-hours to accomplish or would involve the use of 
specialized tools and equipment. Major repairs include such activities 
as coupler replacement, draft gear repair, and repairs requiring the use 
of an air jack but exclude changing wheels on intermodal loading ramps 
either with or without an air jack.
    (3) Minor repair means repairs, other than major repairs, that can 
be accomplished in a short period of time with limited tools and 
equipment. Minor repairs would include such things as safety appliance 
straightening, handhold replacement, air hose replacement, lading 
adjustment, and coupler knuckle or knuckle pin replacement.
    (b) A car on a shop or repair track shall be tested to determine 
that the air brakes apply and remain applied until a release is 
initiated.
    (c) A car on a shop or repair track shall have its piston travel 
inspected. For cars equipped with 8\1/2\-inch or 10-

[[Page 612]]

inch diameter brake cylinders, piston travel shall be within 7 to 9 
inches. If piston travel is found to be less than 7 inches or more than 
9 inches, it must be adjusted to nominally 7\1/2\ inches. For cars not 
equipped with 8\1/2\-inch or 10-inch diameter brake cylinders, piston 
travel shall be within the piston travel stenciled or marked on the car 
or badge plate.
    (d) Before a car is released from a shop or repair track, a 
qualified person shall ensure:
    (1) The brake pipe is securely clamped;
    (2) Angle cocks are properly located with suitable clearance and 
properly positioned to allow maximum air flow;
    (3) Valves, reservoirs, and cylinders are tight on supports and the 
supports are securely attached to the car;
    (4) Hand brakes are tested, inspected, and operate as intended; and
    (5) Brake indicators, on cars so equipped, are accurate and operate 
as intended.
    (e) If the single car air brake test required by Sec. 232.305 
cannot be conducted at the point where repairs can be made to the car, 
the car may be moved after the repairs are made to the next forward 
location where the test can be performed. Inability to perform a single 
car air brake test does not constitute an inability to make the 
necessary repairs.
    (1) If it is necessary to move a car from the location where the 
repairs are performed in order to perform a single car air brake test 
required by this part, a tag or card shall be placed on both sides of 
the equipment, or an automated tracking system approved for use by FRA, 
shall contain the following information about the equipment:
    (i) The reporting mark and car number;
    (ii) The name of the inspecting railroad;
    (iii) The location where repairs were performed and date;
    (iv) Indication whether the car requires a single car air brake 
test;
    (v) The location where the appropriate test is to be performed; and
    (vi) The name, signature, if possible, and job title of the 
qualified person approving the move.
    (2) The tag or card required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section 
shall remain affixed to the equipment until the necessary test has been 
performed.
    (3) An electronic or written record or copy of each tag or card 
attached to or removed from a car or locomotive shall be retained for 90 
days and, upon request, shall be made available within 15 calendar days 
for inspection by FRA or State inspectors.
    (4) The record or copy of each tag or card removed from a car or 
locomotive shall contain the date, location, and the signature or 
identification of the qualified person removing it from the piece of 
equipment.
    (f) The location and date of the last single car air brake test 
required by Sec. 232.305 shall be clearly stenciled, marked, or labeled 
in two-inch high letters or numerals on the side of the equipment. 
Alternatively, the railroad industry may use an electronic or automated 
tracking system to track the required information and the performance of 
the test required by Sec. 232.305.
    (1) Electronic or automated tracking systems used to meet the 
requirement contained in this paragraph shall be capable of being 
reviewed and monitored by FRA at any time to ensure the integrity of the 
system. FRA's Associate Administrator for Safety may prohibit or revoke 
the railroad industry's authority to utilize an electronic or automated 
tracking system in lieu of stenciling or marking if FRA finds that the 
electronic or automated tracking system is not properly secure, is 
inaccessible to FRA or railroad employees, or fails to adequately track 
and monitor the equipment. FRA will record such a determination in 
writing, include a statement of the basis for such action, and will 
provide a copy of the document to the affected railroads.
    (2) [Reserved]

engineer of the train shall communicate with the conductor, to ensure 
that a member of the crew with a working two-way radio is stationed in 
the car with the rearmost readily accessible emergency brake valve on 
the train when the train begins its descent; and
    (iv) While the train is descending a section of track with an 
average grade of two percent or greater over a distance of two 
continuous miles, a member of the train crew shall occupy the car that 
contains the rearmost readily accessible emergency brake valve on the 
train and be in constant radio communication with the locomotive 
engineer. The crew member shall remain in this car until the train has 
completely traversed the heavy grade.
    (f) Specific requirements for use. If a train is required to use a 
two-way end-of-train device:
    (1) That device shall be armed and operable from the time the train 
departs from the point where the device is installed until the train 
reaches its destination. If a loss of communication occurs at the 
location where the device is installed, the train may depart the

[[Page 618]]

location at restricted speed for a distance of no more than one mile in 
order to establish communication. When communication is established, the 
quantitative values of the head and rear unit shall be compared pursuant 
to Sec. 232.409(b) and the device tested pursuant to Sec. 232.409(c), 
unless the test was performed prior to installation.
    (2) The rear unit batteries shall be sufficiently charged at the 
initial terminal or other point where the device is installed and 
throughout the train's trip to ensure that the end-of-train device will 
remain operative until the train reaches its destination.
    (3) The device shall be activated to effectuate an emergency brake 
application either by using the manual toggle switch or through 
automatic activation, whenever it becomes necessary for the locomotive 
engineer to initiate an emergency application of the air brakes using 
either the automatic brake valve or the conductor's emergency brake 
valve.
    (g) En route failure of device on a freight or other non-passenger 
train. Except on passenger trains required to be equipped with a two-way 
end-of-train device (which are provided for in paragraph (h) of this 
section), en route failures of a two-way end-of-train device shall be 
handled in accordance with this paragraph. If a two-way end-of-train 
device or equivalent device fails en route (i.e., is unable to initiate 
an emergency brake application from the rear of the train due to certain 
losses of communication (front to rear) or due to other reasons, the 
speed of the train on which it is installed shall be limited to 30 mph 
until the ability of the device to initiate an emergency brake 
application from the rear of the train is restored. This limitation 
shall apply to a train using a device that uses an alternative 
technology to serve the purpose of a two-way end-of-train device. With 
regard to two-way end-of-train devices, a loss of communication between 
the front and rear units is an en route failure only if the loss of 
communication is for a period greater than 16 minutes and 30 seconds. 
Based on the existing design of the devices, the display to an engineer 
of a message that there is a communication failure indicates that 
communication has been lost for 16 minutes and 30 seconds or more.
    (1) If a two-way end-of-train device fails en route, the train on 
which it is installed, in addition to observing the 30-mph speed 
limitation, shall not operate over a section of track with an average 
grade of two percent or greater for a distance of two continuous miles, 
unless one of the following alternative measures is provided:
    (i) Use of an occupied helper locomotive at the end of the train. 
This alternative may be used only if the following requirements are met:
    (A) The helper locomotive engineer shall initiate and maintain two-
way voice radio communication with the engineer on the head end of the 
train; this contact shall be verified just prior to passing the crest of 
the grade.
    (B) If there is a loss of communication prior to passing the crest 
of the grade, the helper locomotive engineer and the head-end engineer 
shall act immediately to stop the train until voice communication is 
resumed, in accordance with the railroad's operating rules.
    (C) If there is a loss of communication once the descent has begun, 
the helper locomotive engineer and the head-end engineer shall act to 
stop the train, in accordance with the railroad's operating rules, if 
the train has reached a predetermined rate of speed that indicates the 
need for emergency braking.
    (D) The brake pipe of the helper locomotive shall be connected and 
cut into the train line and tested to ensure operation.
    (ii) Use of an occupied caboose at the end of the train with a 
tested, functioning brake valve capable of initiating an emergency brake 
application from the caboose. This alternative may be used only if the 
train service employee in the caboose and the engineer on the head end 
of the train establish and maintain two-way voice radio communication 
and respond appropriately to the loss of such communication in the same 
manner as prescribed for helper locomotives in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of 
this section.
    (iii) Use of a radio-controlled locomotive at the rear of the train 
under continuous control of the engineer in

[[Page 619]]

the head end by means of telemetry, but only if such radio-controlled 
locomotive is capable of initiating an emergency application on command 
from the lead (controlling) locomotive.
    (2) If a two-way end-of-train device fails en route while the train 
on which it is installed is operating over a section of track with an 
average grade of two percent or greater for a distance of two continuous 
miles, the train shall be brought safely to a stop at the first 
available location in accordance with the railroad's operating rule, 
except the train may continue in operation if the railroad provides one 
of the alternative measures detailed in paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section.
    (h) En route failure of device on a passenger train. (1) A passenger 
train required to be equipped with a two-way end-of-train device that 
develops an en route failure of the device (as explained in paragraph 
(g) of this section) shall not operate over a section of track with an 
average grade of two percent or greater over a distance of two 
continuous miles until an operable two-way end-of-train device is 
installed on the train or an alternative method of initiating an 
emergency brake application from the rear of the train is achieved.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, a 
passenger train required to be equipped with a two-way end-of-train 
device that develops an en route failure of the device (as explained in 
paragraph (g) of this section) shall be operated in accordance with the 
following:
    (i) A member of the train crew shall be immediately positioned in 
the car which contains the rearmost readily accessible emergency brake 
valve on the train and shall be equipped with an operable two-way radio 
that communicates with the locomotive engineer; and
    (ii) The locomotive engineer shall periodically make running tests 
of the train's air brakes until the failure is corrected; and
    (3) Each en route failure shall be corrected at the next location 
where the necessary repairs can be conducted or at the next location 
where a required brake test is to be performed, whichever is reached 
first.

Sec. 232.409  Inspection and testing of end-of-train devices.

    (a) After each installation of either the front or rear unit of an 
end-of-train device, or both, on a train and before the train departs, 
the railroad shall determine that the identification code entered into 
the front unit is identical to the unique identification code on the 
rear unit.
    (b) After each installation of either the front or rear unit of an 
end-of-train device, or both, on a train and before the train departs, 
the functional capability of the device shall be determined, after 
charging the train, by comparing the quantitative value of the air 
pressure displayed on the front unit with the quantitative value of the 
air pressure displayed on the rear unit or on a properly calibrated air 
gauge. The end-of-train device shall not be used if the difference 
between the two readings exceeds three pounds per square inch.
    (c) A two-way end-of-train device shall be tested at the initial 
terminal or other point of installation to determine that the device is 
capable of initiating an emergency power brake application from the rear 
of the train. If this test is conducted by a person other than a member 
of the train crew, the locomotive engineer shall be notified that a 
successful test was performed. The notification required by this 
paragraph may be provided to the locomotive engineer by any means 
determined appropriate by the railroad; however, a written or electronic 
record of the notification shall be maintained in the cab of the 
controlling locomotive and shall include the date and time of the test, 
the location where the test was performed, and the name of the person 
conducting the test.
    (d) The telemetry equipment shall be tested for accuracy and 
calibrated if necessary according to the manufacturer's specifications 
and procedures at least every 368 days. The 368 days shall not include a 
shelf-life of up to 92 days prior to placing the unit in service. This 
test shall include testing radio

[[Page 620]]

frequencies and modulation of the device. The date and location of the 
last calibration or test as well as the name of the person performing 
the calibration or test shall be legibly displayed on a weather-
resistant sticker or other marking device affixed to the outside of both 
the front unit and the rear unit; however, if the front unit is an 
integral part of the locomotive or is inaccessible, then the information 
may recorded on Form FRA F6180-49A instead, provided that the serial 
number of the unit is recorded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ A penalty may be assessed against an individual only for a willful
  violation. Generally, when two or more violations of these regulations
  are discovered with respect to a single unit of equipment that is
  placed or continued in service by a railroad, the appropriate
  penalties set forth above are aggregated up to a maximum of $16,000
  per day. An exception to this rule is the $15,000 penalty for willful
  violation of Sec.  232.503 (failure to get FRA approval before
  introducing new technology) with respect to a single unit of
  equipment; if the unit has additional violative conditions, the
  penalty may routinely be aggregated to $15,000. Although the penalties
  listed for failure to perform the brake inspections and tests under
  Sec.  232.205 through Sec.  232.209 may be assessed for each train
  that is not properly inspected, failure to perform any of the
  inspections and tests required under those sections will be treated as
  a violation separate and distinct from, and in addition to, any
  substantive violative conditions found on the equipment contained in
  the train consist. Moreover, the Administrator reserves the right to
  assess a penalty of up to $27,000 for any violation where
  circumstances warrant. See 49 CFR part 209, appendix A.
Failure to observe any condition for movement of defective equipment set
  forth in Sec.  232.15(a) will deprive the railroad of the benefit of
  the movement-for-repair provision and make the railroad and any
  responsible individuals liable for penalty under the particular
  regulatory section(s) concerning the substantive defect(s) present on
  the equipment at the time of movement.
Failure to provide any of the records or plans required by this part
  pursuant to Sec.  232.19 will be considered a failure to maintain or
  develop the record or plan and will make the railroad liable for
  penalty under the particular regulatory section(s) concerning the
  retention or creation of the document involved.
Failure to properly perform any of the inspections specifically
  referenced in Sec.  232.209, Sec.  232.213, and Sec.  232.217 may
  be assessed under each section of this part or this chapter, or both,
  that contains the requirements for performing the referenced
  inspection.

the general railroad system of transportation.
    (e) Any person (including a railroad and any manager, supervisor, 
official, or other employee or agent of a railroad) who violates any 
requirement of this part or causes the violation of any such requirement 
is subject to a civil penalty of at least $250 and not more than $10,000 
per violation, except that: Penalties may be assessed against 
individuals only for willful violations, and, where a grossly negligent 
violation or a pattern of repeated violations has created an imminent 
hazard of death or injury to persons, or has caused death or injury, a 
penalty not to exceed $20,000 per violation may be assessed. Each day a 
violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.

    Where a carman is to perform the inspection and test under existing 
or future collective bargaining agreement, in those circumstances a 
carman alone will be considered a qualified person.
    (2) A qualified person participating in the test and inspection or 
who has knowledge that it was made shall notify the engineer that the 
initial terminal road train air brake test has been satisfactorily 
performed. The qualified person shall provide the notification in 
writing if the road crew will report for duty after the qualified person 
goes off duty. The qualified person also shall provide the notification 
in writing if the train that has been inspected is to be moved in excess 
of 500 miles without being subjected to another test pursuant to either 
this section or Sec. 232.13 of this part.
    (b) Each carrier shall designate additional inspection points not 
more than 1,000 miles apart where intermediate inspection will be made 
to determine that--
    (1) Brake pipe pressure leakage does not exceed five pounds per 
minute;
    (2) Brakes apply on each car in response to a 20-pound service brake 
pipe pressure reduction; and
    (3) Brake rigging is properly secured and does not bind or foul.
    (c) Train airbrake system must be charged to required air pressure, 
angle cocks and cutout cocks must be properly positioned, air hose must 
be properly coupled and must be in condition for service. An examination 
must be made for leaks and necessary repairs made to reduce leakage to a 
minimum. Retaining valves and retaining valve pipes must be inspected 
and known to be in condition for service. If train is to be operated in 
electro-pneumatic brake operation, brake circuit cables must be properly 
connected.
    (d)(1) After the airbrake system on a freight train is charged to 
within 15 pounds of the setting of the feed valve on the locomotive, but 
to not less than 60 pounds, as indicated by an accurate gauge at rear 
end of train, and on a passenger train when charged to not less than 70 
pounds, and upon receiving the signal to apply brakes for test, a 15-
pound brake pipe service reduction must be made in automatic brake 
operations, the brake valve lapped, and the number of pounds of brake 
pipe leakage per minute noted as indicated by brake pipe guage, after 
which brake pipe reduction must be increased to full service. Inspection 
of the train brakes must be made to determine that angle cocks are 
properly positioned, that the brakes are applied on each car, that 
piston travel is correct, that brake rigging does not bind or foul, and 
that all parts of the brake equipment are properly secured. When this 
inspection has been completed, the release signal must be given and 
brakes released and each brake inspected to see that all have released.
    (2) When a passenger train is to be operated in electro-pneumatic 
brake operation and after completion of test of brakes as prescribed by 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section the brake system must be recharged to 
not less than 90 pounds air pressure, and upon receiving the signal to 
apply brakes for test, a

[[Page 627]]

minimum 20 pounds electro-pneumatic brake application must be made as 
indicated by the brake cylinder gage. Inspection of the train brakes 
must then be made to determine if brakes are applied on each car. When 
this inspection has been completed, the release signal must be given and 
brakes released and each brake inspected to see that all have released.
    (3) When the locomotive used to haul the train is provided with 
means for maintaining brake pipe pressure at a constant level during 
service application of the train brakes, this feature must be cut out 
during train airbrake tests.
    (e) Brake pipe leakage must not exceed 5 pounds per minute.
    (f)(1) At initial terminal piston travel of body-mounted brake 
cylinders which is less than 7 inches or more than 9 inches must be 
adjusted to nominally 7 inches.
    (2) Minimum brake cylinder piston travel of truck-mounted brake 
cylinders must be sufficient to provide proper brake shoe clearance when 
brakes are released. Maximum piston travel must not exceed 6 inches.
    (3) Piston travel of brake cylinders on freight cars equipped with 
other than standard single capacity brake, must be adjusted as indicated 
on badge plate or stenciling on car located in a conspicuous place near 
the brake cylinder.
    (g) When test of airbrakes has been completed the engineman and 
conductor must be advised that train is in proper condition to proceed.
    (h) During standing test, brakes must not be applied or released 
until proper signal is given.
    (i)(1) When train airbrake system is tested from a yard test plant, 
an engineer's brake valve or an appropriate test device shall be used to 
provide increase and reduction of brake pipe air pressure or electro-
pneumatic brake application and release at the same or a slower rate as 
with engineer's brake valve and yard test plant must be connected to the 
end which will be nearest to the hauling road locomotive.
    (2) When yard test plant is used, the train airbrakes system must be 
charged and tested as prescribed by paragraphs (c) to (g) of this 
section inclusive, and when practicable should be kept charged until 
road motive power is coupled to train, after which, an automatic brake 
application and release test of airbrakes on rear car must be made. If 
train is to be operated in electro-pneumatic brake operation, this test 
must also be made in electro-pneumatic brake operation before 
proceeding.
    (3) If after testing the brakes as prescribed in paragraph (i)(2) of 
this section the train is not kept charged until road motive power is 
attached, the brakes must be tested as prescribed by paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section and if train is to be operated in electro-pneumatic brake 
operation as prescribed by paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (j) Before adjusting piston travel or working on brake rigging, 
cutout cock in brake pipe branch must be closed and air reservoirs must 
be drained. When cutout cocks are provided in brake cylinder pipes, 
these cutout cocks only may be closed and air reservoirs need not be 
drained.

Sec. 232.13 Road train and intermediate terminal train air brake tests.

    (a) Passenger trains. Before motive power is detached or angle cocks 
are closed on a passenger train operated in either automatic or electro-
pneumatic brake operation, except when closing angle cocks for cutting 
off one or more cars from the rear end of train, automatic air brake 
must be applied. After recouping, brake system must be recharged to 
required air pressure and before proceeding and upon receipt of proper 
request or signal, application and release tests of brakes on rear car 
must be made from locomotive in automatic brake operation. If train is 
to be operated in electro-pneumatic brake operation, this test must also 
be made in electro-pneumatic brake operation before proceeding. 
Inspector or trainman must determine if brakes on rear car of train 
properly apply and release.
    (b) Freight trains. Before motive power is detached or angle cocks 
are closed on a freight train, brakes must be applied with not less than 
a 20-pound brake pipe reduction. After recoupling, and after angle cocks 
are opened, it must be known that brake pipe air pressure is being 
restored as indicated by a rear car gauge or device. In the absence of a 
rear car gauge or device, an air brake test must be made to determine 
that the brakes on the rear car apply and release.
    (c)(1)At a point other than an initial terminal where a locomotive 
or caboose is changed, or where one or more consecutive cars are cut off 
from the rear end or head end of a train with the consist otherwise 
remaining intact, after the train brake system is charged to within 15 
pounds of the feed valve setting on the locomotive, but not less than 60 
pounds as indicated at the rear of a freight train and 70 pounds on a 
passenger train, a 20-pound brake pipe reduction must be made and it 
must be determined that the brakes on the rear car apply and release. As 
an alternative to the rear car brake application and release test, it 
shall be determined that brake pipe pressure of the train is being 
reduced as indicated by a rear car gauge or device and then that brake 
pipe pressure of the train is being restored as indicated by a rear car 
gauge or device.
    (2) Before proceeding it must be known that brake pipe pressure as 
indicated at rear of freight train is being restored.
    (3) On trains operating with electro-pneumatic brakes, with brake 
system charged to

[[Page 628]]

not less than 70 pounds, test must be made to determine that rear brakes 
apply and release properly from a minimum 20 pounds electro-pneumatic 
brake application as indicated by brake cylinder gauge.
    (d)(1) At a point other than a terminal where one or more cars are 
added to a train, after the train brake system is charged to not less 
than 60 pounds as indicated by a gauge or device at the rear of a 
freight train and 70 pounds on a passenger train. A brake test must be 
made by a designated person as described in Sec. 232.12 (a)(1) to 
determine that brake pipe leakage does not exceed five (5) pounds per 
minute as indicated by the brake pipe gauge after a 20-pound brake pipe 
reduction has been made. After the test is completed, it must be 
determined that piston travel is correct, and the train airbrakes of 
these cars and on the rear car of the train apply and remain applied, 
until the release signal is given. As an alternative to the rear car 
brake application and release portion of the test, it shall be 
determined that brake pipe pressure of the train is being reduced as 
indicated by a rear car gauge or device and then that brake pipe 
pressure of the train is being restored as indicated by a rear car gauge 
or device. Cars added to a train that have not been inspected in 
accordance with Sec. 232.12 (c) through (j) must be so inspected and 
tested at the next terminal where facilities are available for such 
attention.
    (d)(2)(i) At a terminal where a solid block of cars, which has been 
previously charged and tested as prescribed by Sec. 232.13 (c) through 
(j), is added to a train, it must be determined that the brakes on the 
rear car of the train apply and release. As an alternative to the rear 
car application and release test, it shall be determined that brake pipe 
pressure of the train is being reduced as indicated by a rear car gauge 
or device and then that brake pipe pressure of the train is being 
restored as indicated by a rear car gauge or device.
    (d)(2)(ii) When cars which have not been previously charged and 
tested as prescribed by Sec. 232.12 (c) through (j) are added to a 
train, such cars may either be given inspection and tests in accordance 
with Sec. 232.12 (c) through (j), or tested as prescribed by paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section prior to departure in which case these cars must 
be inspected and tested in accordance with Sec. 232.12 (c) through (j) 
at next terminal.
    (3) Before proceeding it must be known that the brake pipe pressure 
at the rear of freight train is being restored.
    (e)(1) Transfer train and yard train movements not exceeding 20 
miles, must have the air brake hose coupled between all cars, and after 
the brake system is charged to not less than 60 pounds, a 15 pound 
service brake pipe reduction must be made to determine that the brakes 
are applied on each car before releasing and proceeding.
    (2) Transfer train and yard train movements exceeding 20 miles must 
have brake inspection in accordance with Sec. 232.12 (c)-(j).
    (f) The automatic air brake must not be depended upon to hold a 
locomotive, cars or train, when standing on a grade, whether locomotive 
is attached or detached from cars or train. When required, a sufficient 
number of hand brakes must be applied to hold train, before air brakes 
are released. When ready to start, hand brakes must not be released 
until it is known that the air brake system is properly charged.
    (g) As used in this section, device means a system of components 
designed and inspected in accordance with Sec. 232.19.
    (h) When a device is used to comply with any test requirement in 
this section, the phrase brake pipe pressure of the train is being 
reduced means a pressure reduction of at least five pounds and the 
phrase brake pipe pressure of the train is being restored means a 
pressure increase of at least five pounds.

            Sec. 232.14 Inbound Brake Equipment Inspection.

    (a) At points where inspectors are employed to make a general 
inspection of trains upon arrival at terminals, visual inspection must 
be made of retaining valves and retaining valve pipes, release valves 
and rods, brake rigging, safety supports, hand brakes, hose and position 
of angle cocks and make necessary repairs or mark for repair tracks any 
cars to which yard repairs cannot be promptly made.
    (b) Freight trains arriving at terminals where facilities are 
available and at which special instructions provide for immediate brake 
inspection and repairs, trains shall be left with air brakes applied by 
a service brake pipe reduction of 20 pounds so that inspectors can 
obtain a proper check of the piston travel. Trainmen will not close any 
angle cock or cut the locomotive off until the 20 pound service 
reduction has been made. Inspection of the brakes and needed repairs 
should be made as soon thereafter as practicable.

             Sec. 232.15 Double Heading and Helper Service.

    (a) When more than one locomotive is attached to a train, the 
engineman of the leading locomotive shall operate the brakes. On all 
other motive power units in the train the brake pipe cutout cock to the 
brake valve must be closed, the maximum main reservoir pressure 
maintained and brake valve handles kept in the prescribed position. In 
case it becomes necessary for the leading locomotive to give up control 
of the train short of the destination of the train, a test of the brakes 
must be made to see that the brakes are operative from the automatic 
brake valve of the locomotive taking control of the train.

[[Page 629]]

    (b) The electro-pneumatic brake valve on all motive power units 
other than that which is handling the train must be cut out, handle of 
brake valve kept in the prescribed position, and air compressors kept 
running if practicable.

                       Sec. 232.16 Running Tests.

    When motive power, engine crew or train crew has been changed, angle 
cocks have been closed except for cutting off one or more cars from the 
rear end of train or electro-pneumatic brake circuit cables between 
power units and/or cars have been disconnected, running test of train 
air brakes on passenger train must be made, as soon as speed of train 
permits, by use of automatic brake if operating in automatic brake 
operation or by use of electro-pneumatic brake if operating in electro-
pneumatic brake operation. Steam or power must not be shut off unless 
required and running test must be made by applying train air brakes with 
sufficient force to ascertain whether or not brakes are operating 
properly. If air brakes do not properly operate, train must be stopped, 
cause of failure ascertained and corrected and running test repeated.

          Sec. 232.17 Freight and passenger train car brakes.

    (a) Testing and repairing brakes on cars while on shop or repair 
tracks. (1) When a freight car having brake equipment due for periodic 
attention is on shop or repair tracks where facilities are available for 
making air brake repairs, brake equipment must be given attention in 
accordance with the requirements of the currently effective AAR Code of 
Rules for cars in interchange. Brake equipment shall then be tested by 
use of a single car testing device as prescribed by the currently 
effective AAR Code of Tests.
    (2)(i) When a freight car having an air brake defect is on a shop or 
repair track, brake equipment must be tested by use of a single car 
testing device as prescribed by currently effective AAR Code of Tests.
    (ii) All freight cars on shop or repair tracks shall be tested to 
determine that the air brakes apply and release. Piston travel on a 
standard body mounted brake cylinder which is less than 7 inches or more 
than 9 inches must be adjusted to nominally 7 inches. Piston travel of 
brake cylinders on all freight cars equipped with other than standard 
single capacity brake, must be adjusted as indicated on badge plate or 
stenciling on car located in a conspicuous place near brake cylinder. 
After piston travel has been adjusted and with brakes released, 
sufficient brake shoe clearance must be provided.
    (iii) When a car is equipped for use in passenger train service not 
due for periodical air brake repairs, as indicated by stenciled or 
recorded cleaning dates, is on shop or repair tracks, brake equipment 
must be tested by use of single car testing device as prescribed by 
currently effective AAR Code of Tests. Piston travel of brake cylinders 
must be adjusted if required, to the standard travel for that type of 
brake cylinder. After piston travel has been adjusted and with brakes 
released, sufficient brake shoe clearance must be provided.
    (iv) Before a car is released from a shop or repair track, it must 
be known that brake pipe is securely clamped, angle cocks in proper 
position with suitable clearance, valves, reservoirs and cylinders tight 
on supports and supports securely attached to car.
    (b)(1) Brake equipment on cars other than passenger cars must be 
cleaned, repaired, lubricated and tested as often as required to 
maintain it in a safe and suitable condition for service but not less 
frequently than as required by currently effective AAR Code of Rules for 
cars in interchange.
    (2) Brake equipment on passenger cars must be clean, repaired, 
lubricated and tested as often as necessary to maintain it in a safe and 
suitable condition for service but not less frequently than as required 
in Standard S-045 in the Manual of Standards and Recommended Practices 
of the AAR.

                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 234.1  Scope.

    This part imposes minimum maintenance, inspection, and testing 
standards for highway-rail grade crossing warning systems. This part 
also prescribes standards for the reporting of failures of such systems 
and prescribes minimum actions railroads must take when such warning 
systems malfunction. This part does not restrict a railroad from 
adopting and enforcing additional or more stringent requirements not 
inconsistent with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 234.3  Application.

    This part applies to all railroads except:
    (a) A railroad that exclusively operates freight trains only on 
track which is not part of the general railroad system of 
transportation;
    (b) Rapid transit operations within an urban area that are not 
connected to the general railroad system of transportation; and
    (c) A railroad that operates passenger trains only on track inside 
an installation that is insular; i.e., its operations are limited to a 
separate enclave in such a way that there is no reasonable expectation 
that the safety of the public--except a business guest, a licensee of 
the railroad or an affiliated entity, or a trespasser--would be affected 
by the operation. An operation will not be considered insular if one or 
more of the following exists on its line:
    (1) A public highway-rail crossing that is in use;
    (2) An at-grade rail crossing that is in use;
    (3) A bridge over a public road or waters used for commercial 
navigation; or
    (4) A common corridor with a railroad, i.e., its operations are 
within 30 feet of those of any railroad.


<R05>
Sec. 234.4  Preemptive effect.

    Under 49 U.S.C. 20106 (formerly Sec. 205 of the Federal Railroad 
Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 434)), issuance of these regulations 
preempts any State law,

[[Page 633]]

rule, regulation, order, or standard covering the same subject matter, 
except a provision directed at an essentially local safety hazard that 
is consistent with this part and that does not impose an undue burden on 
interstate commerce.


<R05>
Sec. 234.5  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Activation failure means the failure of an active highway-rail grade 
crossing warning system to indicate the approach of a train at least 20 
seconds prior to the train's arrival at the crossing, or to indicate the 
presence of a train occupying the crossing, unless the crossing is 
provided with an alternative means of active warning to highway users of 
approaching trains. (This failure indicates to the motorist that it is 
safe to proceed across the railroad tracks when, in fact, it is not safe 
to do so.) A grade crossing signal system does not indicate the approach 
of a train within the meaning of this paragraph if--more than 50% of the 
flashing lights (not gate arm lights) on any approach lane to the 
crossing are not functioning as intended, or in the case of an approach 
lane for which two or more pairs of flashing lights are provided, there 
is not at least one flashing light pair operating as intended. Back 
lights on the far side of the crossing are not considered in making 
these determinations.
    Appropriately equipped flagger means a person other than a train 
crewmember who is equipped with a vest, shirt, or jacket of a color 
appropriate for daytime flagging such as orange, yellow, strong yellow 
green or fluorescent versions of these colors or other generally 
accepted high visibility colors. For nighttime flagging, similar outside 
garments shall be retro reflective. Acceptable hand signal devices for 
daytime flagging include `` STOP/SLOW'' paddles or red flags. For 
nighttime flagging, a flashlight, lantern, or other lighted signal shall 
be used. Inasmuch as Part VI of the Federal Highway Administration's 
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices addresses standards and guides 
for flaggers and flagging equipment for highway traffic control, FRA 
recommends that railroads be aware of the standards and follow them to 
the greatest extent possible. Copies of the latest MUTCD provisions 
regarding flagging will be available from FRA, as well as FMCSA, as 
changes are made in this area.
    Credible report of system malfunction means specific information 
regarding a malfunction at an identified highway-rail crossing, supplied 
by a railroad employee, law enforcement officer, highway traffic 
official, or other employee of a public agency acting in an official 
capacity.
    False activation means the activation of a highway-rail grade 
crossing warning system caused by a condition that requires correction 
or repair of the grade crossing warning system. (This failure indicates 
to the motorist that it is not safe to cross the railroad tracks when, 
in fact, it is safe to do so.)
    Highway-rail grade crossing means a location where a public highway, 
road, street, or private roadway, including associated sidewalks and 
pathways, crosses one or more railroad tracks at grade.
    Partial activation means activation of a highway-rail grade crossing 
warning system indicating the approach of a train, however, the full 
intended warning is not provided due to one of the following conditions:
    (1) At non-gated crossings equipped with one pair of lights designed 
to flash alternately, one of the two lights does not operate properly 
(and approaching motorists can not clearly see flashing back lights from 
the warning lights on the other side of the crossing);
    (2) At gated crossings, the gate arm is not in a horizontal 
position; or
    (3) At gated crossings, any portion of a gate arm is missing if that 
portion normally had a gate arm flashing light attached.
    Train means one or more locomotives, with or without cars.
    Warning system malfunction means an activation failure, a partial 
activation, or a false activation of a highway-rail grade crossing 
warning system.


<R05>
Sec. 234.6  Penalties.

    (a) Civil penalty. Any person (an entity of any type covered under 1 
U.S.C. 1, including but not limited to the following: a railroad; a 
manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or

[[Page 634]]

agent of a railroad; any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of 
railroad equipment, track, or facilities; any independent contractor 
providing goods or services to a railroad; and any employee of such 
owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor) who 
violates any requirement of this part or causes the violation of any 
such requirement is subject to a civil penalty of at least $550, but not 
more than $16,000 per violation, except that: penalties may be assessed 
against individuals only for willful violations, and where a grossly 
negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violations has created an 
imminent hazard of death or injury to persons, or has caused death or 
injury, a penalty not to exceed $27,000 per violation may be assessed. 
Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. 
Appendix A to this part contains a schedule of civil penalty amounts 
used in connection with this rule. The railroad is not responsible for 
compliance with respect to any condition inconsistent with the technical 
standards set forth in this part where such variance arises as a result 
of actions beyond the control of the railroad and the railroad could not 
have prevented the variance through the exercise of due diligence. The 
foregoing sentence does not excuse any instance of noncompliance 
resulting from the actions of the railroad's employees, agents, or 
contractors.
    (b) Criminal penalty. Whoever knowingly and willfully makes, causes 
to be made, or participates in the making of a false entry in reports 
required to be filed by this part, or files a false report or other 
document required to be filed by this part is subject to a $5,000 fine 
and 2 years imprisonment as prescribed by 49 U.S.C. 522(a) and section 
209(e) of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970, as amended (45 U.S.C. 
438(e)).

    (c) Nothing in this subpart requires repair of a warning system, if, 
acting in accordance with applicable State law, the railroad proceeds to 
discontinue or dismantle the warning system. However, until repair, 
correction, discontinuance, or dismantling of the warning system is 
completed, the railroad shall comply with this subpart to ensure the 
safety of the traveling public and railroad employees.


<R05>
Sec. 234.105  Activation failure.

    Upon receipt of a credible report of warning system malfunction 
involving an activation failure, a railroad having maintenance 
responsibility for the warning system shall promptly initiate efforts to 
warn highway users and railroad employees at the subject crossing by 
taking the following actions:
    (a) Prior to any train's arrival at the crossing, notify the train 
crew of the report of activation failure and notify any other railroads 
operating over the crossing;
    (b) Notify the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the 
crossing, or railroad police capable of responding and controlling 
vehicular traffic; and
    (c) Provide for alternative means of actively warning highway users 
of approaching trains, consistent with the following requirements (see 
appendix B for a summary chart of alternative means of warning):
    (1)(i) If an appropriately equipped flagger provides warning for 
each direction of highway traffic, trains may proceed through the 
crossing at normal speed.
    (ii) If at least one uniformed law enforcement officer (including a 
railroad police officer) provides warning to highway traffic at the 
crossing, trains may proceed through the crossing at normal speed.
    (2) If an appropriately equipped flagger provides warning for 
highway traffic, but there is not at least one flagger providing warning 
for each direction of highway traffic, trains may proceed with caution

speed may be resumed after the locomotive has passed through the 
crossing.
    (3) If there is not an appropriately equipped flagger or uniformed 
law enforcement officer providing warning to highway traffic at the 
crossing, each train must stop before entering the crossing and permit a 
crewmember to dismount to flag highway traffic to a stop. The locomotive 
may then proceed through the crossing, and the flagging crewmember may 
reboard the locomotive before the remainder of the train proceeds 
through the crossing.
    (d) A locomotive's audible warning device shall be activated in 
accordance with railroad rules regarding the approach to a grade 
crossing.


<R05>
Sec. 234.106  Partial activation.

    Upon receipt of a credible report of a partial activation, a 
railroad having maintenance responsibility for the warning system shall 
promptly initiate efforts to warn highway users and railroad employees 
at the subject crossing in the same manner as required for false 
activations (Sec. 234.107).


<R05>
Sec. 234.107  False activation.

    Upon receipt of a credible report of a false activation, a railroad 
having maintenance responsibility for the highway-rail grade crossing 
warning system shall promptly initiate efforts to warn highway users and 
railroad employees at the crossing by taking the following actions:
    (a) Prior to a train's arrival at the crossing, notify the train 
crew of the report of false activation and notify any other railroads 
operating over the crossing;
    (b) Notify the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the 
crossing, or railroad police capable of responding and controlling 
vehicular traffic; and
    (c) Provide for alternative means of actively warning highway users 
of approaching trains, consistent with the

[[Page 636]]

following requirements (see Appendix B for a summary chart of 
alternative means of warning).
    (1)(i) If an appropriately equipped flagger is providing warning for 
each direction of highway traffic, trains may proceed through the 
crossing at normal speed.
    (ii) If at least one uniformed law enforcement officer (including a 
railroad police officer) provides warning to highway traffic at the 
crossing, trains may proceed through the crossing at normal speed.
    (2) If there is not an appropriately equipped flagger providing 
warning for each direction of highway traffic, or if there is not at 
least one uniformed law enforcement officer providing warning, trains 
with the locomotive or cab car leading, may proceed with caution through 
the crossing at a speed not exceeding 15 miles per hour. Normal speed 
may be resumed after the locomotive has passed through the crossing. In 
the case of a shoving move, a crewmember shall be on the ground to flag 
the train through the crossing.
    (3) In lieu of complying with paragraphs (c) (1) or (2) of this 
section, a railroad may temporarily take the warning system out of 
service if the railroad complies with all requirements of Sec. 234.105, 
``Activation failure.''
    (d) A locomotive's audible warning device shall be activated in 
accordance with railroad rules regarding the approach to a grade 
crossing.

                Requirements for Processor-Based Systems


<R05>
Sec. 234.275  Processor-based systems.

    (a) Applicable definitions. The definitions in Sec. 236.903 of this 
chapter shall apply to this section, where applicable.
    (b) Use of performance standard authorized or required.
    (1) In lieu of compliance with the requirements of this subpart, a 
railroad may elect to qualify an existing processor-based product under 
part 236, subpart H of this chapter.
    (2) Highway-rail grade crossing warning systems, subsystems, or 
components that are processor-based and that are first placed in service 
after June 6, 2005, which contain new or novel technology, or which 
provide safety-critical data to a railroad signal or train control 
system that is governed by part 236, subpart H of this chapter, shall 
also comply with those requirements. New or novel technology refers to a 
technology not previously recognized for use as of March 7, 2005.
    (3) Products designed in accordance with subparts A through D of 
this part, which are not in service but are in the developmental stage 
prior to December 5, 2005 (or for which a request for exclusion was 
submitted prior to June 6, 2005 pursuant to Sec. 236.911 of this 
chapter), may be excluded from the requirements of part 236, subpart H 
of this chapter upon notification to FRA by March 6, 2006, if placed in 
service by December 5, 2008 (or March 7, 2008 for those products for 
which a request for exclusion was submitted to FRA prior to June 6, 
2005). Railroads may continue to implement and use these products and 
components from these existing products. A railroad may at any time 
elect to have products that are excluded made subject to 49 CFR part 
236, subpart H, by submitting a Product Safety Plan as prescribed in 
Sec. 236.913 of this chapter and otherwise complying with part 236, 
subpart H of this chapter.
    (c) Product safety plan justifications. The Product Safety Plan (see 
Sec. 236.903 of this chapter) must explain how the performance 
objective sought to be addressed by each of the particular requirements 
of this subpart is met by the product, why the objective is not relevant 
to the product's design, or how safety requirements are satisfied using 
alternative means. Deviation from those particular requirements is 
authorized if an adequate explanation is provided, making reference to 
relevant elements of the Product Safety Plan, and if the product 
satisfies the performance standard set forth in Sec. 236.909 of this 
chapter. (See Sec. 236.907(a)(14) of this chapter.)
    (d) Specific requirements. The following exclusions from the 
latitude provided by this section apply:
    (1) Nothing in this section authorizes deviation from applicable 
design requirements for automated warning devices at highway-rail grade 
crossings in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), 2000 
Millennium Edition, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), dated 
December 18, 2000, including Errata <greek-i>1 to MUTCD 2000 Millennium 
Edition dated June 14, 2001 (http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/).
    (2) Nothing in this section authorizes deviation from the following 
requirements of this subpart:
    (i) Sec. 234.207(b) (Adjustment, repair, or replacement of a 
component);
    (ii) Sec. 234.209(b) (Interference with normal functioning of 
system);
    (iii) Sec. 234.211 (Security of warning system apparatus);

    (vii) Sec. 234.223 (Gate arm);
    (viii) Sec. 234.225 (Activation of warning system);
    (ix) Sec. 234.227 (Train detection apparatus)--if a train detection 
circuit is employed to determine the train's presence;
    (x) Sec. 234.229 (Shunting sensitivity)--if a conventional track 
circuit is employed;
    (xi) Sec. 234.231 (Fouling wires)--if a conventional train 
detection circuit is employed;
    (xii) Sec. 234.233 (Rail joints)--if a track circuit is employed;

[[Page 642]]

    (xiii) Sec. 234.235 (Insulated rail joints)--if a track circuit is 
employed;
    (xiv) Sec. 234.237 (Reverse switch cut-out circuit); or
    (xv) Sec. 234.245 (Signs).
    (e) Separate justification for other than fail-safe design. 
Deviation from the requirement of Sec. 234.203 (Control circuits) that 
circuits be designed on a fail-safe principle must be separately 
justified at the component, subsystem, and system level using the 
criteria of Sec. 236.909 of this chapter.
    (f) Software management control for certain systems not subject to a 
performance standard. Any processor-based system, subsystem, or 
component subject to this part, which is not subject to the requirements 
of part 236, subpart H of this chapter but which provides safety-

    (ii) Each record necessary to ensure the safety of the system that 
is associated with periodic maintenance, inspections, tests, repairs, 
replacements, adjustments, and the system's resulting conditions, 
including records of component failures resulting in safety-relevant 
hazards (see Sec. 236.917(e)(3));
    (19) A complete description of any safety-critical assumptions 
regarding availability of the product, and a complete description of all 
backup methods of operation; and
    (20) A complete description of all incremental and predefined 
changes (see paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section).
    (b) What requirements apply to predefined changes? (1) Predefined 
changes are not considered design modifications requiring an entirely 
new safety verification process, a revised PSP, and an informational 
filing or petition for approval in accordance with Sec. 236.915. 
However, the risk assessment for the product must demonstrate that 
operation of the product, as modified by any predefined change, 
satisfies the minimum performance standard.
    (2) The PSP must identify configuration/revision control measures 
designed to ensure that safety-functional requirements and safety-
critical hazard mitigation processes are not compromised as a result of 
any such change. (Software changes involving safety functional 
requirements or safety critical hazard mitigation processes for 
components in use are also addressed in paragraph (c) of this section.)
    (c) What requirements apply to other product changes? (1) 
Incremental changes are planned product version changes described in the 
initial PSP where slightly different specifications are used to allow 
the gradual enhancement of the product's capabilities. Incremental 
changes shall require verification and validation to the extent the 
changes involve safety-critical functions.
    (2) Changes classified as maintenance require validation.
    (d) What are the responsibilities of the railroad and product 
supplier regarding communication of hazards? (1) The PSP shall specify 
all contractual arrangements with hardware and software suppliers for 
immediate notification of any and all safety critical software upgrades, 
patches, or revisions for their processor-based system, sub-system, or 
component, and the reasons for such changes from the suppliers, whether 
or not the railroad has experienced a failure of that safety-critical 
system, sub-system, or component.

[[Page 686]]

    (2) The PSP shall specify the railroad's procedures for action upon 
notification of a safety-critical upgrade, patch, or revision for this 
processor-based system, sub-system, or component, and until the upgrade, 
patch, or revision has been installed; and such action shall be 
consistent with the criterion set forth in Sec. 236.915(d) as if the 
failure had occurred on that railroad.
    (3) The PSP must identify configuration/revision control measures 
designed to ensure that safety-functional requirements and safety-
critical hazard mitigation processes are not compromised as a result of 
any such change, and that any such change can be audited.
    (4) Product suppliers entering into contractual arrangements for 
product support described in a PSP must promptly report any safety-
relevant failures and previously unidentified hazards to each railroad 
using the product.


<R05>
Sec. 236.909  Minimum performance standard.

    (a) What is the minimum performance standard for products covered by 
this subpart? The safety analysis included in the railroad's PSP must 
establish with a high degree of confidence that introduction of the 
product will not result in risk that exceeds the previous condition. The 
railroad shall determine, prior to filing its petition for approval or 
informational filing, that this standard has been met and shall make 
available the necessary analyses and documentation as provided in this 
subpart.
    (b) How does FRA determine whether the PSP requirements for products 
covered by subpart H have been met? With respect to any FRA review of a 
PSP, the Associate Administrator for Safety independently determines 
whether the railroad's safety case establishes with a high degree of 
confidence that introduction of the product will not result in risk that 
exceeds the previous condition. In evaluating the sufficiency of the 
railroad's case for the product, the Associate Administrator for Safety 
considers, as applicable, the factors pertinent to evaluation of risk 
assessments, listed in Sec. 236.913(g)(2).
    (c) What is the scope of a full risk assessment required by this 
section? A full risk assessment performed under this subpart must 
address the safety risks affected by the introduction, modification, 
replacement, or enhancement of a product. This includes risks associated 
with the previous condition which are no longer present as a result of 
the change, new risks not present in the previous condition, and risks 
neither newly created nor eliminated whose nature (probability of 
occurrence or severity) is nonetheless affected by the change.
    (d) What is an abbreviated risk assessment, and when may it be used? 
(1) An abbreviated risk assessment may be used in lieu of a full risk 
assessment to show compliance with the performance standard if:
    (i) No new hazards are introduced as a result of the change;
    (ii) Severity of each hazard associated with the previous condition 
does not increase from the previous condition; and
    (iii) Exposure to such hazards does not change from the previous 
condition.
    (2) An abbreviated risk assessment supports the finding required by 
paragraph (a) of this section if it establishes that the resulting MTTHE 
for the proposed product is greater than or equal to the MTTHE for the 
system, component or method performing the same function in the previous 
condition. This determination must be supported by credible safety 
analysis sufficient to persuade the Associate Administrator for Safety 
that the likelihood of the new product's MTTHE being less than the MTTHE 
for the system, component, or method performing the same function in the 
previous condition is very small.
    (3) Alternatively, an abbreviated risk assessment supports the 
finding required by paragraph (a) of this section if:
    (i) The probability of failure for each hazard of the product is 
equal to or less the corresponding recommended Specific Quantitative 
Hazard Probability Ratings classified as more favorable than 
``undesirable'' by AREMA Manual Part 17.3.5 (Recommended Procedure for 
Hazard Identification and Management of Vital Electronic/Software-Based 
Equipment Used in Signal and

[[Page 687]]

Train Control Applications), or--in the case of a hazard classified as 
undesirable--the Associate Administrator for Safety concurs that 
mitigation of the hazard within the framework of the electronic system 
is not practical and the railroad proposes reasonable steps to undertake 
other mitigation. The Director of the Federal Register approves the 
incorporation by reference of the entire AREMA Communications and Signal 
Manual, Volume 4, Section 17--Quality Principles (2005) in this section 
in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. You may obtain a 
copy of the incorporated standard from American Railway Engineering and 
Maintenance of Way Association, 8201 Corporation Drive, Suite 1125, 
Landover, MD 20785-2230. You may inspect a copy of the incorporated 
standard at the Federal Railroad Administration, Docket Clerk, 1120 
Vermont Ave., NW., Suite 7000, or at the National Archives and Records 
Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this 
material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to http://www.archives.gov/
federal--register/code--of--federal--regulations/ibr--locations.html;
    (ii) The product is developed in accordance with:
    (A) AREMA Manual Part 17.3.1 (Communications and Signal Manual of 
Recommended Practices, Recommended Safety Assurance Program for 
Electronic/Software Based Products Used in Vital Signal Applications);
    (B) AREMA Manual Part 17.3.3 (Communications and Signal Manual of 
Recommended Practices, Recommended Practice for Hardware Analysis for 
Vital Electronic/Software-Based Equipment Used in Signal and Train 
Control Applications);
    (C) AREMA Manual Part 17.3.5 (Communications and Signal Manual of 
Recommended Practices, Recommended Practice for Hazard Identification 
and Management of Vital Electronic/Software-Based Equipment Used in 
Signal and Train Control Applications);
    (D) Appendix C of this subpart; and
    (iii) Analysis supporting the PSP suggests no credible reason for 
believing that the product will be less safe than the previous 
condition.
    (e) How are safety and risk measured for the full risk assessment? 
Risk assessment techniques, including both qualitative and quantitative 
methods, are recognized as providing credible and useful results for 
purposes of this section if they apply the following principles:
    (1) Safety levels must be measured using competent risk assessment 
methods and must be expressed as the total residual risk in the system 
over its expected life-cycle after implementation of all mitigating 
measures described in the PSP. Appendix B to this part provides criteria 
for acceptable risk assessment methods. Other methods may be acceptable 
if demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Associate Administrator for 
Safety to be equally suitable.
    (2) For the previous condition and for the life-cycle of the 
product, risk levels must be expressed in units of consequences per unit 
of exposure.
    (i) In all cases exposure must be expressed as total train miles 
traveled per year. Consequences must identify the total cost, including 
fatalities, injuries, property damage, and other incidental costs, such 
as potential consequences of hazardous materials involvement, resulting 
from preventable accidents associated with the function(s) performed by 
the system. A railroad may, as an alternative, use a risk metric in 
which consequences are measured strictly in terms of fatalities.
    (ii) In those cases where there is passenger traffic, a second risk 
metric must be calculated, using passenger-miles traveled per year as 
the exposure, and total societal costs of passenger injuries and 
fatalities, resulting from preventable accidents associated with the 
function(s) performed by the system, as the consequences.
    (3) If the description of railroad operations for the product 
required by Sec. 236.907(a)(2) involves changes to the physical or 
operating conditions on the railroad prior to or within the expected 
life cycle of the product subject to review under this subpart, the 
previous condition shall be adjusted to reflect the lower risk 
associated with systems

[[Page 688]]

needed to maintain safety and performance at higher speeds or traffic 
volumes. In particular, the previous condition must be adjusted for 
assumed implementation of systems necessary to support higher train 
speeds as specified in Sec. 236.0, as well as other changes required to 
support projected increases in train operations. The following specific 
requirements apply:
    (i) If the current method of operation would not be adequate under 
Sec. 236.0 for the proposed operations, then the adjusted previous 
condition must include a system as required under Sec. 236.0, applied 
as follows:
    (A) The minimum system where a passenger train is operated at a 
speed of 60 or more miles per hour, or a freight train is operated at a 
speed of 50 or more miles per hour, shall be a traffic control system;
    (B) The minimum system where a train is operated at a speed of 80 or 
more miles per hour, but not more than 110 miles per hour, shall be an 
automatic cab signal system with automatic train control; and
    (C) The minimum system where a train is operated at a speed of more 
than 110 miles per hour shall be a system determined by the Associate 
Administrator for Safety to provide an equivalent level of safety to 
systems required or authorized by FRA for comparable operations.
    (ii) If the current method of operation would be adequate under 
Sec. 236.0 for the proposed operations, but the current system is not 
at least as safe as a traffic control system, then the adjusted previous 
condition must include a traffic control system in the event of any 
change that results in:
    (A) An annual average daily train density of more than twelve trains 
per day; or
    (B) An increase in the annual average daily density of passenger 
trains of more than four trains per day.
    (iii) Paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section shall apply in all 
situations where train volume will exceed more than 20 trains per day 
but shall not apply to situations where train volume will exceed 12 
trains per day but not exceed 20 trains per day, if in its PSP the 
railroad makes a showing sufficient to establish, in the judgment of the 
Associate Administrator for Safety, that the current method of operation 
is adequate for a specified volume of traffic in excess of 12 trains per 
day, but not more than 20 trains per day, without material delay in the 
movement of trains over the territory and without unreasonable 
expenditures to expedite those movements when compared with the expense 
of installing and maintaining a traffic control system.
    (4) In the case review of a PSP that has been consolidated with a 
proceeding pursuant to part 235 of this subchapter (see Sec. 
236.911(b)), the base case shall be determined as follows:
    (i) If FRA determines that discontinuance or modification of the 
system should be granted without regard to whether the product is 
installed on the territory, then the base case shall be the conditions 
that would obtain on the territory following the discontinuance or 
modification. Note: This is an instance in which the base case is 
posited as greater risk than the actual (unadjusted) previous condition 
because the railroad would have obtained relief from the requirement to 
maintain the existing signal or train control system even if no new 
product had been proffered.
    (ii) If FRA determines that discontinuance or modification of the 
system should be denied without regard to whether the product is 
installed on the territory, then the base case shall remain the previous 
condition (unadjusted).
    (iii) If, after consideration of the application and review of the 
PSP, FRA determines that neither paragraph (e)(4)(i) nor paragraph 
(e)(4)(ii) of this section should apply, FRA will establish a base case 
that is consistent with safety and in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 236.911  Exclusions.

    (a) Does this subpart apply to existing systems? The requirements of 
this subpart do not apply to products in service as of June 6, 2005. 
Railroads may continue to implement and use these products and 
components from these existing products.
    (b) How will transition cases be handled? Products designed in 
accordance with subparts A through G of this part

[[Page 689]]

which are not in service but are developed or are in the developmental 
stage prior to March 7, 2005, may be excluded upon notification to FRA 
by June 6, 2005, if placed in service by March 7, 2008. Railroads may 
continue to implement and use these products and components from these 
existing products. A railroad may at any time elect to have products 
that are excluded made subject to this subpart by submitting a PSP as 
prescribed in Sec. 236.913 and otherwise complying with this subpart.
    (c) How are office systems handled? The requirements of this subpart 
do not apply to existing office systems and future deployments of 
existing office system technology. However, a subsystem or component of 
an office system must comply with the requirements of this subpart if it 
performs safety-critical functions within, or affects the safety 
performance of, a new or next-generation train control system. For 
purposes of this section, ``office system'' means a centralized 
computer-aided train-dispatching system or centralized traffic control 
board.
    (d) How are modifications to excluded products handled? Changes or 
modifications to products otherwise excluded from the requirements of 
this subpart by this section are not excluded from the requirements of 
this subpart if they result in a degradation of safety or a material 
increase in safety-critical functionality.
    (e) What other rules apply to excluded products? Products excluded 
by this section from the requirements of this subpart remain subject to 
subparts A through G of this part as applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 236.913  Filing and approval of PSPs.

    (a) Under what circumstances must a PSP be prepared? A PSP must be 
prepared for each product covered by this subpart. A joint PSP must be 
prepared when:
    (1) The territory on which a product covered by this subpart is 
normally subject to joint operations, or is operated upon by more than 
one railroad; and
    (2) The PSP involves a change in method of operation.
    (b) Under what circumstances must a railroad submit a petition for 
approval for a PSP or PSP amendment, and when may a railroad submit an 
informational filing? Depending on the nature of the proposed product or 
change, the railroad shall submit either an informational filing or a 
petition for approval. Submission of a petition for approval is required 
for PSPs or PSP amendments concerning installation of new or next-
generation train control systems. All other actions that result in the 
creation of a PSP or PSP amendment require an informational filing and 
are handled according to the procedures outlined in paragraph (c) of 
this section. Applications for discontinuance and material modification 
of signal and train control systems remain governed by parts 235 and 211 
of this chapter; and petitions subject to this section may be 
consolidated with any relevant application for administrative handling.
    (c) What are the procedures for informational filings? The following 
procedures apply to PSPs and PSP amendments which do not require 
submission of a petition for approval, but rather require an 
informational filing:
    (1) Not less than 180 days prior to planned use of the product in 
revenue service as described in the PSP or PSP amendment, the railroad 
shall submit an informational filing to the Associate Administrator for 
Safety, FRA, 1120 Vermont Avenue, NW., Mail Stop 25, Washington, DC 
20590. The informational filing must provide a summary description of 
the PSP or PSP amendment, including the intended use of the product, and 
specify the location where the documentation as described in Sec. 
236.917(a)(1) is maintained.
    (2) Within 60 days of receipt of the informational filing, FRA:
    (i) Acknowledges receipt of the filing;
    (ii) Acknowledges receipt of the informational filing and requests 
further information; or
    (iii) Acknowledges receipt of the filing and notifies the railroad, 
for good cause, that the filing will be considered as a petition for 
approval as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, and requests 
such further information as may be required to initiate action on the 
petition for approval. Examples of good cause, any one of which is 
sufficient, include: the PSP describes a product with unique 
architectural concepts; the

[[Page 690]]

PSP describes a product that uses design or safety assurance concepts 
considered outside existing accepted practices (see Appendix C); and the 
PSP describes a locomotive-borne product that commingles safety-critical 
train control processing functions with locomotive operational 
functions. In addition, good cause includes any instance where the PSP 
or PSP amendment does not appear to support its safety claim of 
satisfaction of the performance standard, after FRA has requested 
further information as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (d) What procedures apply to petitions for approval? The following 
procedures apply to PSPs and PSP amendments which require submission of 
a petition for approval:
    (1) Petitions for approval involving prior FRA consultation. (i) The 
railroad may file a Notice of Product Development with the Associate 
Administrator for Safety not less than 30 days prior to the end of the 
system design review phase of product development and 180 days prior to 
planned implementation, inviting FRA to participate in the design review 
process and receive periodic briefings and updates as needed to follow 
the course of product development. At a minimum, the Notice of Product 
Development must contain a summary description of the product to be 
developed and a brief description of goals for improved safety.
    (ii) Within 15 days of receipt of the Notice of Product Development, 
the Associate Administrator for Safety either acknowledges receipt or 
acknowledges receipt and requests more information.
    (iii) If FRA concludes that the Notice of Product Development 
contains sufficient information, the Associate Administrator for Safety 
determines the extent and nature of the assessment and review necessary 
for final product approval. FRA may convene a technical consultation as 
necessary to discuss issues related to the design and planned 
development of the product.
    (iv) Within 60 days of receiving the Notice of Product Development, 
the Associate Administrator for Safety provides a letter of preliminary 
review with detailed findings, including whether the design concepts of 
the proposed product comply with the requirements of this subpart, 
whether design modifications are necessary to meet the requirements of 
this subpart, and the extent and nature of the safety analysis necessary 
to comply with this subpart.
    (v) Not less than 60 days prior to use of the product in revenue 
service, the railroad shall file with the Associate Administrator for 
Safety a petition for final approval.
    (vi) Within 30 days of receipt of the petition for final approval, 
the Associate Administrator for Safety either acknowledges receipt or 
acknowledges receipt and requests more information. Whenever possible, 
FRA acts on the petition for final approval within 60 days of its filing 
by either granting it or denying it. If FRA neither grants nor denies 
the petition for approval within 60 days, FRA advises the petitioner of 
the projected time for decision and conducts any further consultations 
or inquiries necessary to decide the matter.
    (2) Other petitions for approval. The following procedures apply to 
petitions for approval of PSPs which do not involve prior FRA 
consultation as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (i) Not less than 180 days prior to use of a product in revenue 
service, the railroad shall file with the Associate Administrator for 
Safety a petition for approval.
    (ii) Within 60 days of receipt of the petition for approval, FRA 
either acknowledges receipt, or acknowledges receipt and requests more 
information.
    (iii) Whenever possible, considering the scope, complexity, and 
novelty of the product or change, FRA acts on the petition for approval 
within 180 days of its filing by either granting it or denying it. If 
FRA neither grants nor denies the petition for approval within 180 days, 
it remains pending, and FRA provides the petitioner with a statement of 
reasons why the petition has not yet been approved.
    (e) What role do product users play in the process of safety review? 
(1) FRA will publish in the Federal Register periodically a topic list 
including docket numbers for informational filings and a petition 
summary including docket numbers for petitions for approval.

[[Page 691]]

    (2) Interested parties may submit to FRA information and views 
pertinent to FRA's consideration of an informational filing or petition 
for approval. FRA considers comments to the extent practicable within 
the periods set forth in this section. In a proceeding consolidated with 
a proceeding under part 235 of this chapter, FRA considers all comments 
received.
    (f) Is it necessary to complete field testing prior to filing the 
petition for approval? A railroad may file a petition for approval prior 
to completion of field testing of the product. The petition for approval 
should additionally include information sufficient for FRA to arrange 
monitoring of the tests. The Associate Administrator for Safety may 
approve a petition for approval contingent upon successful completion of 
the test program contained in the PSP or hold the petition for approval 
pending completion of the tests.
    (g) How are PSPs approved? (1) The Associate Administrator for 
Safety grants approval of a PSP when:
    (i) The petition for approval has been properly filed and contains 
the information required in Sec. 236.907;
    (ii) FRA has determined that the PSP complies with the railroad's 
approved RSPP and applicable requirements of this subpart; and
    (iii) The risk assessment supporting the PSP demonstrates that the 
proposed product satisfies the minimum performance standard stated in 
Sec. 236.909.
    (2) The Associate Administrator for Safety considers the following 
applicable factors when evaluating the risk assessment:
    (i) The extent to which recognized standards have been utilized in 
product design and in the relevant safety analysis;
    (ii) The availability of quantitative data, including calculations 
of statistical confidence levels using accepted methods, associated with 
risk estimates;
    (iii) The complexity of the product and the extent to which it will 
incorporate or deviate from design practices associated with previously 
established histories of safe operation;
    (iv) The degree of rigor and precision associated with the safety 
analyses, including the comprehensiveness of the qualitative analyses, 
and the extent to which any quantitative results realistically reflect 
appropriate sensitivity cases;
    (v) The extent to which validation of the product has included 
experiments and tests to identify uncovered faults in the operation of 
the product;
    (vi) The extent to which identified faults are effectively 
addressed;
    (vii) Whether the risk assessment for the previous condition was 
conducted using the same methodology as that for operation under the 
proposed condition; and
    (viii) If an independent third-party assessment is required or is 
performed at the election of the supplier or railroad, the extent to 
which the results of the assessment are favorable.
    (3) The Associate Administrator for Safety also considers when 
assessing PSPs the safety requirements for the product within the 
context of the proposed method of operations, including:
    (i) The degree to which the product is relied upon as the primary 
safety system for train operations; and
    (ii) The degree to which the product is overlaid upon and its 
operation is demonstrated to be independent of safety-relevant rules, 
practices and systems that will remain in place following the change 
under review.
    (4) As necessary to ensure compliance with this subpart and with the 
RSPP, FRA may attach special conditions to the approval of the petition.
    (5) Following the approval of a petition, FRA may reopen 
consideration of the petition for cause. Cause for reopening a petition 
includes such circumstances as a credible allegation of error or fraud, 
assumptions determined to be invalid as a result of in-service 
experience, or one or more unsafe events calling into question the 
safety analysis underlying the approval.
    (h) Under what circumstances may a third-party assessment be 
required, and by whom may it be conducted? (1) The PSP must be supported 
by an independent third party assessment of the product when FRA 
concludes it is necessary based upon consideration of the following 
factors:

[[Page 692]]

    (i) Those factors listed in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (g)(2)(vii) 
of this section;
    (ii) The sufficiency of the assessment or audit previously conducted 
at the election of a supplier or railroad; and
    (iii) Whether applicable requirements of subparts A through G of 
this part are satisfied.
    (2) As used in this section, ``independent third party'' means a 
technically competent entity responsible to and compensated by the 
railroad (or an association on behalf of one or more railroads) that is 
independent of the supplier of the product. An entity that is owned or 
controlled by the supplier, that is under common ownership or control 
with the supplier, or that is otherwise involved in the development of 
the product is not considered ``independent'' within the meaning of this 
section. FRA may maintain a roster of recognized technically competent 
entities as a service to railroads selecting reviewers under this 
section; however, a railroad is not limited to entities currently listed 
on any such roster.
    (3) The third-party assessment must, at a minimum, consist of the 
activities and result in production of documentation meeting the 
requirements of Appendix D to this part. However, when requiring an 
assessment pursuant to this section, FRA specifies any requirements in 
Appendix D to this part which the agency has determined are not relevant 
to its concerns and, therefore, need not be included in the assessment. 
The railroad shall make the final assessment report available to FRA 
upon request.
    (i) How may a PSP be amended? A railroad may submit an amendment to 
a PSP at any time in the same manner as the initial PSP. Notwithstanding 
the otherwise applicable requirements found in this section and Sec. 
236.915, changes affecting the safety-critical functionality of a 
product may be made prior to the submission and approval of the PSP 
amendment as necessary in order to mitigate risk.
    (j) How may field testing be conducted prior to PSP approval? (1) 
Field testing of a product may be conducted prior to the approval of a 
PSP by the submission of an informational filing by a railroad. The FRA 
will arrange to monitor the tests based on the information provided in 
the filing, which must include:
    (i) A complete description of the product;
    (ii) An operational concepts document;
    (iii) A complete description of the specific test procedures, 
including the measures that will be taken to protect trains and on-track 
equipment;
    (iv) An analysis of the applicability of the requirements of 
subparts A through G of this part to the product that will not apply 
during testing;
    (v) The date testing will begin;
    (vi) The location of the testing; and
    (vii) A description of any effect the testing will have on the 
current method of operation.
    (2) FRA may impose such additional conditions on this testing as may 
be necessary for the safety of train operations. Exemptions from 
regulations other than those contained in this part must be requested 
through waiver procedures in part 211 of this chapter.

[70 FR 11095, Mar. 7, 2005, as amended at 70 FR 72385, Dec. 5, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 236.915  Implementation and operation.

    (a) When may a product be placed or retained in service? (1) Except 
as stated in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, a railroad 
may operate in revenue service any product 180 days after filing with 
FRA the informational filing for that product. The FRA filing date can 
be found in FRA's acknowledgment letter referred to in Sec. 
236.913(c)(2).
    (2) Except as stated in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if FRA 
approval is required for a product, the railroad shall not operate the 
product in revenue service until after the Associate Administrator for 
Safety has approved the petition for approval for that product pursuant 
to Sec. 236.913.
    (3) If after product implementation FRA elects, for cause, to treat 
the informational filing for the product as a petition for approval, the 
product may remain in use if otherwise consistent with the applicable 
law and regulations. FRA may impose special conditions for use of the 
product during the period of review for cause.

[[Page 693]]

    (b) How does the PSP relate to operation of the product? Each 
railroad shall comply with all provisions in the PSP for each product it 
uses and shall operate within the scope of initial operational 
assumptions and predefined changes identified by the PSP. Railroads may 
at any time submit an amended PSP according to the procedures outlined 
in Sec. 236.913.
    (c) What precautions must be taken prior to interference with the 
normal functioning of a product? The normal functioning of any safety-

          Sec. Appendix B to Part 236--Risk Assessment Criteria

    The safety-critical performance of each product for which risk 
assessment is required under this part must be assessed in accordance 
with the following criteria or other criteria if demonstrated to the 
Associate Administrator for Safety to be equally suitable:
    (a) How are risk metrics to be expressed? The risk metric for the 
proposed product must describe with a high degree of confidence the 
accumulated risk of a train system that operates over a life-cycle of 25 
years or greater. Each risk metric for the proposed product must be 
expressed with an upper bound, as estimated with a sensitivity analysis, 
and the risk value selected must be demonstrated to have a high degree 
of confidence.
    (b) How does the risk assessment handle interaction risks for 
interconnected subsystems/components? The safety-critical assessment of 
each product must include all of its interconnected subsystems and 
components and, where applicable, the interaction between such 
subsystems.
    (c) How is the previous condition computed? Each subsystem or 
component of the previous condition must be analyzed with a Mean Time to 
Hazardous Event (MTTHE) as

[[Page 701]]

specified subject to a high degree of confidence.
    (d) What major risk characteristics must be included when relevant 
to assessment? Each risk calculation must consider the total signaling 
and train control system and method of operation, as subjected to a list 
of hazards to be mitigated by the signaling and train control system. 
The methodology requirements must include the following major 
characteristics, when they are relevant to the product being considered:
    (1) Track plan infrastructure;
    (2) Total number of trains and movement density;
    (3) Train movement operational rules, as enforced by the dispatcher 
and train crew behaviors;
    (4) Wayside subsystems and components; and
    (5) Onboard subsystems and components.
    (e) What other relevant parameters must be determined for the 
subsystems and components? The failure modes of each subsystem or 
component, or both, must be determined for the integrated hardware/
software (where applicable) as a function of the Mean Time to Failure 
(MTTF) failure restoration rates, and the integrated hardware/software 
coverage of all processor-based subsystems or components, or both. Train 
operating and movement rules, along with components that are layered in 
order to enhance safety-critical behavior, must also be considered.
    (f) How are processor-based subsystems/components assessed? (1) An 
MTTHE value must be calculated for each processor-based subsystem or 
component, or both, indicating the safety-critical behavior of the 
integrated hardware/software subsystem or component, or both. The human 
factor impact must be included in the assessment, whenever applicable, 
to provide an integrated MTTHE value. The MTTHE calculation must 
consider the rates of failures caused by permanent, transient, and 
intermittent faults accounting for the fault coverage of the integrated 
hardware/software subsystem or component, phased-interval maintenance, 
and restoration of the detected failures.
    (2) MTTHE compliance verification and validation must be based on 
the assessment of the design for verification and validation process, 
historical performance data, analytical methods and experimental safety-
critical performance testing performed on the subsystem or component. 
The compliance process must be demonstrated to be compliant and 
consistent with the MTTHE metric and demonstrated to have a high degree 
of confidence.
    (g) How are non-processor-based subsystems/components assessed? (1) 
The safety-critical behavior of all non-processor-based components, 
which are part of a processor-based system or subsystem, must be 
quantified with an MTTHE metric. The MTTHE assessment methodology must 
consider failures caused by permanent, transient, and intermittent 
faults, phase-interval maintenance and restoration of failures and the 
effect of fault coverage of each non-processor-based subsystem or 
component.
    (2) MTTHE compliance verification and validation must be based on 
the assessment of the design for verification and validation process, 
historical performance data, analytical methods and experimental safety-
critical performance testing performed on the subsystem or component. 
The non-processor-based quantification compliance must be demonstrated 
to have a high degree of confidence.
    (h) What assumptions must be documented? (1) The railroad shall 
document any assumptions regarding the reliability or availability of 
mechanical, electric, or electronic components. Such assumptions must 
include MTTF projections, as well as Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) 
projections, unless the risk assessment specifically explains why these 
assumptions are not relevant to the risk assessment. The railroad shall 
document these assumptions in such a form as to permit later automated 
comparisons with in-service experience (e.g., a spreadsheet).
    (2) The railroad shall document any assumptions regarding human 
performance. The documentation shall be in such a form as to facilitate 
later comparisons with in-service experience.
    (3) The railroad shall document any assumptions regarding software 
defects. These assumptions shall be in a form which permits the railroad 
to project the likelihood of detecting an in-service software defect. 
These assumptions shall be documented in such a form as to permit later 
automated comparisons with in-service experience.
    (4) The railroad shall document all of the identified safety-
critical fault paths. The documentation shall be in such a form as to 
facilitate later comparisons with in-service faults.

  Sec. Appendix C to Part 236--Safety Assurance Criteria and Processes

    (a) What is the purpose of this appendix? This appendix seeks to 
promote full disclosure of safety risk to facilitate minimizing or 
eliminating elements of risk where practicable by providing minimum 
criteria and processes for safety analyses conducted in support of PSPs. 
The analysis required by this appendix is intended to minimize the 
probability of failure to an acceptable level, helping to optimize the 
safety of the product within the limitations of the available 
engineering science, cost, and other constraints. FRA uses the criteria 
and processes set forth

[[Page 702]]

in this appendix to evaluate analyses, assumptions, and conclusions 
provided in RSPP and PSP documents. An analysis performed under this 
appendix must:
    (1) Address each area of paragraph (b) of this appendix, explaining 
how such objectives are addressed or why they are not relevant, and
    (2) Employ a validation and verification process pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this appendix.
    (b) What categories of safety elements must be addressed? The 
designer shall address each of the following safety considerations when 
designing and demonstrating the safety of products covered by subpart H 
of this part. In the event that any of these principles are not 
followed, the PSP shall state both the reason(s) for departure and the 
alternative(s) utilized to mitigate or eliminate the hazards associated 
with the design principle not followed.
    (1) Normal operation. The system (including all hardware and 
software) must demonstrate safe operation with no hardware failures 
under normal anticipated operating conditions with proper inputs and 
within the expected range of environmental conditions. All safety-
critical functions must be performed properly under these normal 
conditions. Absence of specific operator actions or procedures will not 
prevent the system from operating safely. There must be no hazards that 
are categorized as unacceptable or undesirable. Hazards categorized as 
unacceptable must be eliminated by design.
    (2) Systematic failure. It must be shown how the product is designed 
to mitigate or eliminate unsafe systematic failures--those conditions 
which can be attributed to human error that could occur at various 
stages throughout product development. This includes unsafe errors in 
the software due to human error in the software specification, design or 
coding phases, or both; human errors that could impact hardware design; 
unsafe conditions that could occur because of an improperly designed 
human-machine interface; installation and maintenance errors; and errors 
associated with making modifications.
    (3) Random failure. (i) The product must be shown to operate safely 
under conditions of random hardware failure. This includes single as 
well as multiple hardware failures, particularly in instances where one 
or more failures could occur, remain undetected (latent) and react in 
combination with a subsequent failure at a later time to cause an unsafe 
operating situation. In instances involving a latent failure, a 
subsequent failure is similar to there being a single failure. In the 
event of a transient failure, and if so designed, the system should 
restart itself if it is safe to do so. Frequency of attempted restarts 
must be considered in the hazard analysis required by Sec. 
236.907(a)(8).
    (ii) There shall be no single point failures in the product that can 
result in hazards categorized as unacceptable or undesirable. Occurrence 
of credible single point failures that can result in hazards must be 
detected and the product must achieve a known safe state before falsely 
activating any physical appliance.
    (iii) If one non-self-revealing failure combined with a second 
failure can cause a hazard that is categorized as unacceptable or 
undesirable, then the second failure must be detected and the product 
must achieve a known safe state before falsely activating any physical 
appliance.
    (4) Common Mode failure. Another concern of multiple failure 
involves common mode failures in which two or more subsystems or 
components intended to compensate one another to perform the same 
function all fail by the same mode and result in unsafe conditions. This 
is of particular concern in instances in which two or more elements 
(hardware or software, or both) are used in combination to ensure 
safety. If a common mode failure exists, then any analysis performed 
under this appendix cannot rely on the assumption that failures are 
independent. Examples include: the use of redundancy in which two or 
more elements perform a given function in parallel and when one 
(hardware or software) element checks/monitors another element (of 
hardware or software) to help ensure its safe operation. Common mode 
failure relates to independence, which must be ensured in these 
instances. When dealing with the effects of hardware failure, the 
designer shall address the effects of the failure not only on other 
hardware, but also on the execution of the software, since hardware 
failures can greatly affect how the software operates.
    (5) External influences. The product must be shown to operate safely 
when subjected to different external influences, including:
    (i) Electrical influences such as power supply anomalies/transients, 
abnormal/improper input conditions (e.g., outside of normal range inputs 
relative to amplitude and frequency, unusual combinations of inputs) 
including those related to a human operator, and others such as 
electromagnetic interference or electrostatic discharges, or both;
    (ii) Mechanical influences such as vibration and shock; and
    (iii) Climatic conditions such as temperature and humidity.
    (6) Modifications. Safety must be ensured following modifications to 
the hardware or software, or both. All or some of the concerns 
identified in this paragraph may be applicable depending upon the nature 
and extent of the modifications.
    (7) Software. Software faults must not cause hazards categorized as 
unacceptable or undesirable.

[[Page 703]]

    (8) Closed Loop Principle. The product design must require positive 
action to be taken in a prescribed manner to either begin product 
operation or continue product operation.
    (9) Human Factors Engineering: The product design must sufficiently 
incorporate human factors engineering that is appropriate to the 
complexity of the product; the educational, mental, and physical 
capabilities of the intended operators and maintainers; the degree of 
required human interaction with the component; and the environment in 
which the product will be used.
    (c) What standards are acceptable for verification and validation? 
(1) The standards employed for verification or validation, or both, of 
products subject to this subpart must be sufficient to support 
achievement of the applicable requirements of subpart H of this part.
    (2) U.S. Department of Defense Military Standard (MIL-STD) 882C, 
``System Safety Program Requirements'' (January 19, 1993), is recognized 
as providing appropriate risk analysis processes for incorporation into 
verification and validation standards.

based signal and train control systems are recognized as acceptable with 
respect to applicable elements of safety analysis required by subpart H

  Sec. Appendix D to Part 236--Independent Review of Verification and 
                               Validation

    (a) What is the purpose of this appendix? This appendix provides 
minimum requirements for independent third-party assessment of product 
safety verification and validation pursuant to subpart H of this part. 
The goal of this assessment is to provide an independent evaluation of 
the product manufacturer's utilization of safety design practices during 
the product's development and testing phases, as required by the 
applicable railroad's RSPP, the product PSP, the requirements of subpart 
H of this part, and any other previously agreed-upon controlling 
documents or standards.
    (b) What general requirements apply to the conduct of third party 
assessments? (1) The supplier may request advice and assistance of the 
reviewer concerning the actions identified in paragraphs (c) through (g) 
of this appendix. However, the reviewer should not engage in design 
efforts, in order to preserve the reviewer's independence and maintain

[[Page 704]]

the supplier's proprietary right to the product.
    (2) The supplier shall provide the reviewer access to any and all 
documentation that the reviewer requests and attendance at any design 
review or walkthrough that the reviewer determines as necessary to 
complete and accomplish the third party assessment. The reviewer may be 
accompanied by representatives of FRA as necessary, in FRA's judgment, 
for FRA to monitor the assessment.
    (c) What must be done at the preliminary level? The reviewer shall 
evaluate with respect to safety and comment on the adequacy of the 
processes which the supplier applies to the design and development of 
the product. At a minimum, the reviewer shall compare the supplier 
processes with acceptable methodology and employ any other such tests or 
comparisons if they have been agreed to previously with FRA. Based on 
these analyses, the reviewer shall identify and document any significant 
safety vulnerabilities which are not adequately mitigated by the 
supplier's (or user's) processes. Finally, the reviewer shall evaluate 
the adequacy of the railroad's RSPP, the PSP, and any other documents 
pertinent to the product being assessed.
    (d) What must be done at the functional level? (1) The reviewer 
shall analyze the Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) for 
comprehensiveness and compliance with the railroad's RSPP.
    (2) The reviewer shall analyze all Fault Tree Analyses (FTA), 
Failure Mode and Effects Criticality Analysis (FMECA), and other hazard 
analyses for completeness, correctness, and compliance with the 
railroad's RSPP.
    (e) What must be done at the implementation level? The reviewer 
shall randomly select various safety-critical software modules for audit 
to verify whether the requirements of the RSPP were followed. The number 
of modules audited must be determined as a representative number 
sufficient to provide confidence that all unaudited modules were 
developed in compliance with the RSPP.
    (f) What must be done at closure? (1) The reviewer shall evaluate 
and comment on the plan for installation and test procedures of the 
product for revenue service.
    (2) The reviewer shall prepare a final report of the assessment. The 
report shall be submitted to the railroad prior to the commencement of 
installation testing and contain at least the following information:
    (i) Reviewer's evaluation of the adequacy of the PSP, including the 
supplier's MTTHE and risk estimates for the product, and the supplier's 
confidence interval in these estimates;
    (ii) Product vulnerabilities which the reviewer felt were not 
adequately mitigated, including the method by which the railroad would 
assure product safety in the event of a hardware or software failure 
(i.e., how does the railroad assure that all potentially hazardous 
failure modes are identified?) and the method by which the railroad 
addresses comprehensiveness of the product design for the requirements 
of the operations it will govern (i.e., how does the railroad assure 
that all potentially hazardous operating circumstances are identified? 
Who records any deficiencies identified in the design process? Who 
tracks the correction of these deficiencies and confirms that they are 
corrected?);
    (iii) A clear statement of position for all parties involved for 
each product vulnerability cited by the reviewer;
    (iv) Identification of any documentation or information sought by 
the reviewer that was denied, incomplete, or inadequate;
    (v) A listing of each RSPP procedure or process which was not 
properly followed;
    (vi) Identification of the software verification and validation 
procedures for the product's safety-critical applications, and the 
reviewer's evaluation of the adequacy of these procedures;
    (vii) Methods employed by the product manufacturer to develop 
safety-critical software, such as use of structured language, code 
checks, modularity, or other similar generally acceptable techniques; 
and
    (viii) Method by which the supplier or railroad addresses 
comprehensiveness of the product design which considers the safety 
elements listed in paragraph (b) of appendix C to this part.

[70 FR 11107, Mar. 7, 2005]


<R05>
    Sec. Appendix E to Part 236--Human-Machine Interface (HMI) Design

    (a) What is the purpose of this appendix? The purpose of this 
appendix is to provide HMI design criteria which will minimize negative 
safety effects by causing designers to consider human factors in the 
development of HMIs.
    (b) What is meant by ``designer'' and ``operator''? As used in this 
section, ``designer'' means anyone who specifies requirements for--or 
designs a system or subsystem, or both, for--a product subject to 
subpart H of this part, and ``operator'' means any human who is intended 
to receive information from, provide information to, or perform repairs 
or maintenance on a signal or train control product subject to subpart H 
of this part.
    (c) What kinds of human factors issues must designers consider with 
regard to the general function of a system?--(1) Reduced situational 
awareness and over-reliance. HMI design must give an operator active 
functions to perform, feedback on the results of the operator's actions, 
and information on the automatic functions of the system as well as its 
performance. The operator must be ``in-the-

[[Page 705]]

loop.'' Designers shall consider at minimum the following methods of 
maintaining an active role for human operators:
    (i) The system must require an operator to initiate action to 
operate the train and require an operator to remain ``in-the-loop'' for 
at least 30 minutes at a time;
    (ii) The system must provide timely feedback to an operator 
regarding the system's automated actions, the reasons for such actions, 
and the effects of the operator's manual actions on the system;
    (iii) The system must warn operators in advance when they require an 
operator to take action; and
    (iv) HMI design must equalize an operator's workload.
    (2) Expectation of predictability and consistency in product 
behavior and communications. HMI design must accommodate an operator's 
expectation of logical and consistent relationships between actions and 
results. Similar objects must behave consistently when an operator 
performs the same action upon them.
    (3) Limited memory and ability to process information. (i) HMI 
design must minimize an operator's information processing load. To 
minimize information processing load, the designer shall:
    (A) Present integrated information that directly supports the 
variety and types of decisions that an operator makes;
    (B) Provide information in a format or representation that minimizes 
the time required to understand and act; and
    (C) Conduct utility tests of decision aids to establish clear 
benefits such as processing time saved or improved quality of decisions.
    (ii) HMI design must minimize the load on an operator's memory.
    (A) To minimize short-term memory load, the designer shall integrate 
data or information from multiple sources into a single format or 
representation (``chunking'') and design so that three or fewer 
``chunks'' of information need to be remembered at any one time.
    (B) To minimize long-term memory load, the designer shall design to 
support recognition memory, design memory aids to minimize the amount of 
information that must be recalled from unaided memory when making 
critical decisions, and promote active processing of the information.
    (4) Miscellaneous Human Factors Concerns. System designers shall:
    (i) Design systems that anticipate possible user errors and include 
capabilities to catch errors before they propagate through the system;
    (ii) Conduct cognitive task analyses prior to designing the system 
to better understand the information processing requirements of 
operators when making critical decisions; and
    (iii) Present information that accurately represents or predicts 
system states.
    (d) What kinds of HMI design elements must a designer incorporate in 
the development of on-board train displays and controls?--(1) Location 
of displays and controls. Designers shall:
    (i) Locate displays as close as possible to the controls that affect 
them;
    (ii) Locate displays and controls based on an operator's position;
    (iii) Arrange controls to minimize the need for the operator to 
change position;
    (iv) Arrange controls according to their expected order of use;
    (v) Group similar controls together;
    (vi) Design for high stimulus-response compatibility (geometric and 
conceptual);
    (vii) Design safety-critical controls to require more than one 
positive action to activate (e.g., auto stick shift requires two 
movements to go into reverse); and
    (viii) Design controls to allow easy recovery from error.
    (2) Information management. HMI design must:
    (i) Display information in a manner which emphasizes its relative 
importance;
    (ii) Comply with the ANSI/HFS 100-1988 standard;
    (iii) Design for display luminance of the foreground or background 
of at least 35 cd/m\2\ (the displays should be capable of a minimum 
contrast 3:1 with 7:1 preferred, and controls should be provided to 
adjust the brightness level and contrast level);
    (iv) Design the interface to display only the information necessary 
to the user;
    (v) Where text is needed, using short, simple sentences or phrases 
with wording that an operator will understand;
    (vi) Use complete words where possible; where abbreviations are 
necessary, choose a commonly accepted abbreviation or consistent method 
and select commonly used terms and words that the operator will 
understand;
    (vii) Adopt a consistent format for all display screens by placing 
each design element in a consistent and specified location;
    (viii) Display critical information in the center of the operator's 
field of view by placing items that need to be found quickly in the 
upper left hand corner and items which are not time-critical in the 
lower right hand corner of the field of view;
    (ix) Group items that belong together;
    (x) Design all visual displays to meet human performance criteria 
under monochrome conditions and add color only if it will help the user 
in performing a task, and use color coding as a redundant coding 
technique;
    (xi) Limit the number of colors over a group of displays to no more 
than seven;
    (xii) Design warnings to match the level of risk or danger with the 
alerting nature of the signal;

[[Page 706]]

    (xiii) With respect to information entry, avoid full QWERTY 
keyboards for data entry; and
    (xiv) Use digital communications for safety-critical messages 
between the locomotive engineer and the dispatcher.
    (e) What kinds of HMI design elements must a designer consider with 
respect to problem management? (1) HMI design must enhance an operator's 
situation awareness. An operator must have access to:
    (i) Knowledge of the operator's train location relative to relevant 
entities;
    (ii) Knowledge of the type and importance of relevant entities;
    (iii) Understanding of the evolution of the situation over time;
    (iv) Knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of relevant 
entities; and
    (v) Knowledge of expected actions of relevant entities.
    (2) HMI design must support response selection and scheduling.
    (3) HMI design must support contingency planning.

generates the force to apply the brake shoe or brake pad to the wheel or 
disc. An actuator typically consists of a cylinder, piston, and piston 
rod.
    Administrator means the Administrator of the Federal Railroad 
Administration or the Administrator's delegate.
    Alerter means a device or system installed in the locomotive cab to 
promote continuous, active locomotive engineer attentiveness by 
monitoring select locomotive engineer-induced control activities. If 
fluctuation of a monitored locomotive engineer-induced control activity 
is not detected within a predetermined time, a sequence of audible and 
visual alarms is activated so as to progressively prompt a response by 
the locomotive engineer. Failure by the locomotive engineer to institute 
a change of state in a monitored control, or acknowledge the alerter 
alarm activity through a manual reset provision, results in a penalty 
brake application that brings the locomotive or train to a stop.
    Anti-climbing mechanism means the parts at the ends of adjoining 
vehicles in a train that are designed to engage when subjected to large 
buff loads to prevent the override of one vehicle by another.
    Bind means restrict the intended movement of one or more brake 
system components by obstruction, increased friction, or reduced 
clearance.

required designed retarding force on the train. A brake is not effective 
if its piston travel is in excess of the maximum prescribed limits. On 
vehicles equipped with nominal 12-inch stroke brake cylinders, the brake 
is not effective if its piston travel exceeds 10\1/2\ inches.
    Brake indicator means a device, actuated by brake cylinder pressure, 
which indicates whether brakes are applied or released.
    Brake, inoperative means a primary brake that, for any reason, no 
longer applies or releases as intended or is otherwise ineffective.

released by hand to prevent movement of a stationary rail car or 
locomotive.
    Brake pipe means the system of piping (including branch pipes, angle 
cocks, cutout cocks, dirt collectors, hoses, and hose couplings) used 
for connecting locomotives and all rail cars for the passage of air to 
control the locomotive and car brakes.
    Brake, power means ``air brake'' as that term is defined in this 
section.
    Brake, primary means those components of the train brake system 
necessary to stop the train within the signal spacing distance without

which develop supplemental brake retarding force that is not needed to 
stop the train within signal spacing distances or to prevent thermal 
damage to friction braking surfaces.
    Brake shoes or pads aligned with tread or disc means that the 
surface of the brake shoe or pad, respectively, engages the surface of 
the wheel tread or disc, respectively, to prevent localized thermal 
stress.
    Braking system, blended means a braking system where the primary 
brake and one or more secondary brakes are automatically combined to 
stop the train. If the secondary brakes are unavailable, the blended 
brake uses the primary brake alone to stop the train.
    Calendar day means a time period running from one midnight to the 
next midnight on a given date.
    Class I brake test means a complete passenger train brake system 
test and inspection (as further specified in Sec. 238.313) performed by 
a qualified maintenance person to ensure that the air brake system is 
100 percent effective.
    Class IA brake test means a test and inspection (as further 
specified in Sec. 238.315) performed by a qualified person of the air

which extend vertically from the underframe to the roof. Corner posts 
may be combined with collision posts to become part of the end 
structure.
    Crack means a fracture without complete separation into parts, 
except that, in a casting, a shrinkage crack or hot tear that does not 
significantly diminish the strength of the member is not a crack.
    Crash energy management means an approach to the design of rail 
passenger equipment which controls the dissipation of energy during a 
collision to protect the occupied volumes from crushing and to limit the 
decelerations on passengers and crewmembers in those volumes. This may 
be accomplished by designing energy-absorbing structures of low strength 
in the unoccupied volumes of a rail vehicle or passenger train to 
collapse in a controlled manner, while providing higher structural 
strength in the occupied volumes. Energy deflection can also be part of 
a crash energy management approach. Crash energy management can be used 
to help provide anti-climbing resistance and to reduce the risk of train 
buckling during a collision.
    Crash refuge means a volume with structural strength designed to 
maximize the survivability of crewmembers stationed in the locomotive 
cab during a collision.

Sec. 238.15  Movement of passenger equipment with power brake defects.

    Beginning on January 1, 2002, the following provisions of this 
section apply to railroads operating Tier I passenger equipment covered 
by this part. A railroad may request earlier application of these 
requirements upon written notification to FRA's Associate Administrator 
for Safety as provided in Sec. 238.1(c) of this part.
    (a) General. This section contains the requirements for moving 
passenger equipment with a power brake defect without liability for a 
civil penalty under this part. Railroads remain liable for the movement 
of passenger equipment under 49 U.S.C. 20303(c). For purposes of this 
section, Sec. 238.17, and Sec. 238.503, a ``power brake defect'' is a 
condition of a power brake component, or other primary brake component, 
that does not conform with this part. (Passenger cars and other 
passenger equipment classified as locomotives under part 229 of this 
chapter are also covered by the movement restrictions contained in Sec. 
229.9 of this chapter for those defective conditions covered by part 229 
of this chapter.)
    (b) Limitations on movement of passenger equipment containing a 
power brake defect at the time a Class I or IA brake test is performed. 
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section (which addresses 
brakes that become defective en route after a Class I or IA brake test 
was performed), a commuter or passenger train that has in its consist 
passenger equipment containing a power brake defect at the time that a 
Class I or IA brake test (or, for Tier II trains, the equivalent) is 
performed may only be moved, without civil penalty liability under this 
part--
    (1) If all of the following conditions are met:
    (i) The train is moved for purposes of repair, without passengers;
    (ii) The applicable operating restrictions in paragraphs (d) and (e) 
of this section are observed; and
    (iii) The passenger equipment is tagged, or information is recorded, 
as prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; or
    (2) If the train is moved for purposes of scrapping or sale of the 
passenger equipment that has the power brake defect and all of the 
following conditions are met:
    (i) The train is moved without passengers;
    (ii) The movement is at a speed of 15 mph or less; and
    (iii) The movement conforms with the railroad's air brake or power 
brake instructions.
    (c) Limitations on movement of passenger equipment in passenger 
service that becomes defective en route after a Class I or IA brake 
test. Passenger equipment hauled or used in service in a commuter or 
passenger train that develops inoperative or ineffective power brakes or 
any other power brake defect while en route to another location after 
receiving a Class I or IA brake test (or, for Tier II trains, the 
equivalent) may be hauled or used by a railroad for repair, without 
civil penalty liability under this part, if the applicable operating 
restrictions set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section are 
complied with and all of the following requisites are satisfied:
    (1) En route defect. At the time of the train's Class I or IA brake 
test, the passenger equipment in the train was properly equipped with 
power brakes that comply with this part. The power brakes on the 
passenger equipment become defective while it is en route to another 
location.
    (2) Record. A tag or card is placed on both sides of the defective 
passenger equipment, or an automated tracking system is provided, with 
the following

[[Page 719]]

information about the defective passenger equipment:
    (i) The reporting mark and car or locomotive number;
    (ii) The name of the inspecting railroad;
    (iii) The name of the inspector;
    (iv) The inspection location and date;
    (v) The nature of each defect;
    (vi) The destination of the equipment where it will be repaired; and
    (vii) The signature, if possible, and job title of the person 
reporting the defective condition.
    (3) Automated tracking system. Automated tracking systems used to 
meet the tagging requirements contained in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section may be reviewed and monitored by FRA at any time to ensure the 
integrity of the system. FRA's Associate Administrator for Safety may 
prohibit or revoke a railroad's ability to utilize an automated tracking 
system in lieu of tagging if FRA finds that the automated tracking 
system is not properly secure, is inaccessible to FRA or a railroad's 
employees, or fails to adequately track or monitor the movement of 
defective equipment. Such a determination will be made in writing and 
will state the basis for such action.
    (4) Conditional requirement. In addition, if an en route failure 
causes power brakes to be cut out or renders the brake inoperative on 
passenger equipment, the railroad shall:
    (i) Determine the percentage of operative power brakes in the train 
based on the number of brakes known to be cut out or otherwise 
inoperative, using the formula specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section;
    (ii) Notify the person responsible for the movement of trains of the 
percent of operative brakes and movement restrictions on the train 
imposed by paragraph (d) of this section;
    (iii) Notify the mechanical department of the failure; and
    (iv) Confirm the percentage of operative brakes by a walking 
inspection at the next location where the railroad reasonably judges 
that it is safe to do so.
    (d) Operating restrictions based on percent operative power brakes 
in train--(1) Computation of percent operative power brakes. (i) Except 
as specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the 
percentage of operative power brakes in a train shall be determined by 
dividing the number of axles in the train with operative power brakes by 
the total number of axles in the train.
    (ii) For trains equipped with only tread brake units (TBUs), the 
percentage of operative power brakes shall be determined by dividing the 
number of operative TBUs by the total number of TBUs in the train.
    (iii) Each cut-out axle on a locomotive that weighs more than 
200,000 pounds shall be counted as two cut-out axles for the purposes of 
calculating the percentage of operative brakes. Unless otherwise 
specified by the railroad, the friction braking effort over all other 
axles shall be considered uniform.
    (iv) The following brake conditions not in compliance with this part 
do not render power brakes inoperative for purposes of this calculation:
    (A) Failure or cutting out of secondary brake systems;
    (B) Inoperative or otherwise defective handbrakes or parking brakes;
    (C) Piston travel that is in excess of the Class I brake test limits 
required in Sec. 238.313 but that does not exceed the maximum 
prescribed limits for considering the brakes to be effective; and
    (D) Power brakes overdue for inspection, testing, maintenance, or 
stenciling under this part.
    (2) All passenger trains developing 50-74 percent operative power 
brakes. A passenger train that develops inoperative power brake 
equipment resulting in at least 50 percent but less than 75 percent 
operative power brakes may be used only as follows:
    (i) The train may be moved in passenger service only to the next 
forward passenger station;
    (ii) The speed of the train shall be restricted to 20 mph or less; 
and
    (iii) After all passengers are discharged, the defective equipment 
shall be moved to the nearest location where the necessary repairs can 
be made.
    (3) Commuter, short-distance intercity, and short-distance Tier II 
passenger trains developing 75-99 percent operative power brakes. (i) 
75-84 percent operative brakes. Commuter, short-distance intercity, and 
short-distance Tier II

[[Page 720]]

passenger trains which develop inoperative power brake equipment 
resulting in at least 75 percent but less than 85 percent operative 
brakes may be used only as follows:
    (A) The train may be moved in passenger service only to the next 
forward location where the necessary repairs can be made; however, if 
the next forward location where the necessary repairs can be made does 
not have the facilities to handle the safe unloading of passengers, the 
train may be moved past the repair location in service only to the next 
forward passenger station in order to facilitate the unloading of 
passengers; and
    (B) The speed of the train shall be restricted to 50 percent of the 
train's maximum allowable speed or 40 mph, whichever is less; and
    (C) After all passengers are discharged, the defective equipment 
shall be moved to the nearest location where the necessary repairs can 
be made.
    (ii) 85-99 percent operative brakes. Commuter, short-distance 
intercity, and short-distance Tier II passenger trains which develop 
inoperative power brake equipment resulting in at least 85 percent but 
less than 100 percent operative brakes may only be used as follows:
    (A) The train may be moved in passenger service only to the next 
forward location where the necessary repairs can be made; however, if 
the next forward location where the necessary repairs can be made does 
not have the facilities to handle the safe unloading of passengers, the 
train may be moved past the repair location in service only to the next 
forward passenger station in order to facilitate the unloading of 
passengers; and
    (B) After all passengers are discharged, the defective equipment 
shall be moved to the nearest location where the necessary repairs can 
be made.
    (4) Long-distance intercity and long-distance Tier II passenger 
trains developing 75-99 operative power brakes. (i) 75-84 percent 
operative brakes. Long-distance intercity and long-distance Tier II 
passenger trains which develop inoperative power brake equipment 
resulting in at least 75 percent but less than 85 percent operative 
brakes may be used only if all of the following restrictions are 
observed:
    (A) The train may be moved in passenger service only to the next 
forward repair location identified for repair of that equipment by the 
railroad operating the equipment in the list required by Sec.

conformity with this part at the time of its calendar day mechanical 
inspection may be moved from that location for repair if all of the 
following conditions are satisfied:
    (1) If the condition involves a running gear defect, the defective 
equipment is not used in passenger service and is moved in a non-revenue 
train;
    (2) If the condition involves a non-running gear defect, the 
defective equipment may be used in passenger service in a revenue train 
provided that a qualified maintenance person determines that it is safe 
to do so, and if so, the car is locked out and empty, and all movement 
restrictions are observed except that the car may be occupied by a 
member of the train crew or a railroad employee to the extent necessary 
to safely operate the train;
    (3) The requirements of paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section

passenger equipment that develops en route to its destination, after its 
calendar day mechanical inspection is performed and before its next 
calendar day mechanical inspection is performed, any condition not in 
compliance with this part, other than a power brake defect, may be moved 
only if the railroad complies with all of the following requirements or, 
if applicable, the specified requirements in paragraph (e) of this 
section:
    (1) Prior to movement of equipment with a potential running gear 
defect, a qualified maintenance person shall determine if it is safe to 
move the equipment in passenger service and, if so, the maximum speed 
and other restrictions necessary for safely conducting the movement. If 
appropriate, these determinations may be made based upon a description 
of the defective condition provided by a crewmember. If the 
determinations required by this paragraph are made by an off-site 
qualified

[[Page 722]]

maintenance person based on a description of the defective condition by 
on-site personnel, then a qualified maintenance person shall perform a 
physical inspection of the defective equipment, at the first location 
possible, to verify the description of the defect provided by the on-
site personnel.
    (2) Prior to movement of equipment with a non-running gear defect, a 
qualified person or a qualified maintenance person shall determine if it 
is safe to move the equipment in passenger service and, if so, the 
maximum speed and other restrictions necessary for safely conducting the

section may be reviewed and monitored by FRA at any time to ensure the 
integrity of the system. FRA's Associate Administrator for Safety may 
prohibit or revoke a railroad's ability to utilize an automated tracking 
system in lieu of tagging if FRA finds that the automated tracking 
system is not properly secure, is inaccessible to FRA or a railroad's 
employees, or fails to adequately track or monitor the movement of 
defective equipment. Such a determination will be made in writing and 
will state the basis for such action.
    (6) After a qualified maintenance person or a qualified person 
verifies that the defective equipment is safe to remain in service as 
required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, the defective 
equipment that develops a condition not in compliance with this part 
while en route may continue in passenger service not later than the next 
calendar day mechanical inspection, if the requirements of this 
paragraph are otherwise fully met.
    (d) Inspection of roller bearings on equipment involved in a 
derailment. (1) A railroad shall not continue passenger equipment in 
service that has a roller bearing whose truck was involved in a 
derailment unless the bearing has been inspected and tested in 
accordance with the railroad's procedures for handling defective 
equipment.
    (2) The roller bearing shall be disassembled from the axle and 
inspected internally if:
    (i) It shows any external sign of damage;
    (ii) It makes any unusual noise when its wheel set is spun freely 
(an on-track rolling test is acceptable) or when the bearing is manually 
rotated;
    (iii) Its truck was involved in a derailment at a speed of more than 
10 miles per hour; or
    (iv) Its truck was dragged on the ground for more than 100 feet.
    (e) Special requisites for movement of passenger equipment with 
safety appliance defects. Consistent with 49 U.S.C. 20303, passenger 
equipment with a safety appliance not in compliance with

[[Page 723]]

this part or with part 231 of this chapter, if applicable, may be 
moved--
    (1) If necessary to effect repair of the safety appliance;
    (2) From the point where the safety appliance defect was first 
discovered by the railroad to the nearest available location on the 
railroad where the necessary repairs required to bring the passenger 
equipment into compliance can be made or, at the option of the receiving 
railroad, the equipment may be received and hauled for repair to a point 
on the receiving railroad's line that is no farther than the point on 
the delivering railroad's line where the repair of the defect could have 
been made;
    (3) If a tag placed on both sides of the passenger equipment or an 
automated tracking system contains the information required under 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section; and
    (4) After notification of the crewmember in charge of the movement 
of the defective equipment, who in turn shall inform all other 
crewmembers of the presence of the defective condition(s).
    (f) Special Notice for Repair. Nothing in this section authorizes 
the movement of equipment subject to a Special Notice for Repair under 
part 216 of this chapter unless the movement is made in accordance with 
the restrictions contained in the Special Notice.

records described in paragraph (a) of this section for one periodic 
maintenance interval for each specific type of equipment as described in 
the railroad's inspection, testing, and maintenance plan required by 
Sec. 238.107. FRA strongly encourages railroads to keep these records 
for longer periods of time because they form the basis for future 
reliability-based decisions concerning test and maintenance intervals 
that may be developed pursuant to Sec. 238.307(b).
    (c) Availability of records. Railroads shall make defect reporting 
and tracking records available to FRA upon request.
    (d) List of power brake repair points. Railroads operating long-
distance intercity and long-distance Tier II passenger equipment shall 
designate locations, in writing, where repairs to passenger equipment 
with a power brake defect will be made and shall provide the list to 
FRA's Associate Administrator for Safety and make it available to FRA 
for inspection and copying upon request. Railroads operating these 
trains shall designate a sufficient number of repair locations to ensure 
the safe and timely repair of passenger equipment. These designations 
shall not be changed without at least 30 days' advance written notice to 
FRA's Associate Administrator for Safety.

<R04>
           Subpart B_Safety Planning and General Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 238.101  Scope.

    This subpart contains safety planning and general safety 
requirements for all railroad passenger equipment subject to this part.


<R05>
Sec. 238.103  Fire safety.

    (a) Materials. (1) Materials used in constructing a passenger car or 
a cab of a locomotive ordered on or after September 8, 2000, or placed 
in service for the first time on or after September 9, 2002, shall meet 
the test performance criteria for flammability and smoke emission 
characteristics as specified in Appendix B to this part, or alternative 
standards issued or recognized by an expert consensus organization after 
special approval of FRA under Sec. 238.21.
    (2) On or after November 8, 1999, materials introduced in a 
passenger car or a locomotive cab, as part of any kind of rebuild, 
refurbishment, or overhaul of the car or cab, shall meet the test 
performance criteria for flammability and smoke emission characteristics 
as specified in Appendix B to this part, or alternative standards issued 
or recognized by an expert consensus organization after special approval 
of FRA under Sec. 238.21.
    (3) For purposes of complying with the requirements of this 
paragraph, a railroad may rely on the results of tests of material 
conducted in accordance with the standards and performance criteria for 
flammabilitiy and smoke emission characteristics as specified in 
Appendix B to this part in effect on July 12, 1999 (see 49 CFR parts 
200-399, revised as of October 1, 1999), if prior to June 25, 2002 the 
material is--
    (i) Installed in a passenger car or locomotive;
    (ii) Held in inventory by the railroad; or
    (iii) Ordered by the railroad.
    (b) Certification. A railroad shall require certification that a 
representative sample of combustible materials to be--
    (1) Used in constructing a passenger car or a locomotive cab, or
    (2) Introduced in a passenger car or a locomotive cab, as part of 
any kind of rebuild, refurbishment, or overhaul of the car or cab, has 
been tested by a recognized independent testing laboratory and that the 
results show the representative sample complies with the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section at the time it was tested.
    (c) Fire safety analysis for procuring new passenger cars and 
locomotives. In procuring new passenger cars and locomotives, each 
railroad shall ensure that fire safety considerations and features in 
the design of this equipment reduce the risk of personal injury caused 
by fire to an acceptable level in its operating environment using a 
formal safety methodology such as MIL-STD-882. To this end, each 
railroad shall complete a written fire safety analysis for the passenger 
equipment being procured. In conducting the analysis, the railroad 
shall--
    (1) Identify, analyze, and prioritize the fire hazards inherent in 
the design of the equipment.
    (2) Take effective steps to design the equipment and select 
materials which help provide sufficient fire resistance to reasonably 
ensure adequate time to detect a fire and safely evacuate the passengers 
and crewmembers, if a fire

[[Page 726]]

cannot be prevented. Factors to consider include potential ignition 
sources; the type, quantity, and location of the materials; and 
availability of rapid and safe egress to the exterior of the equipment 
under conditions secure from fire, smoke, and other hazards.
    (3) Reasonably ensure that a ventilation system in the equipment 
does not contribute to the lethality of a fire.
    (4) Identify in writing any train component that is a risk of 
initiating fire and which requires overheat protection. An overheat 
detector shall be installed in any component when the analysis 
determines that an overheat detector is necessary.
    (5) Identify in writing any unoccupied train compartment that 
contains equipment or material that poses a fire hazard, and analyze the 
benefit provided by including a fire or smoke detection system in each 
compartment so identified. A fire or smoke detector shall be installed 
in any unoccupied compartment when the analysis determines that such 
equipment is necessary to ensure sufficient time for the safe evacuation 
of passengers and crewmembers from the train. For purposes of this 
section, an unoccupied train compartment means any part of the equipment 
structure that is not normally occupied during operation of the train, 
including a closet, baggage compartment, food pantry, etc.
    (6) Determine whether any occupied or unoccupied space requires a 
portable fire extinguisher and, if so, the proper type and size of the 
fire extinguisher for each location. As required by Sec. 239.101 of 
this chapter, each passenger car is required to have a minimum of one 
portable fire extinguisher. If the analysis performed indicates that one 
or more additional portable fire extinguishers are needed, such shall be 
installed.
    (7) On a case-by-case basis, analyze the benefit provided by 
including a fixed, automatic fire-suppression system in any unoccupied 
train compartment that contains equipment or material that poses a fire 
hazard, and determine the proper type and size of the automatic fire-
suppression system for each such location. A fixed, automatic fire-
suppression system shall be installed in any unoccupied compartment when 
the analysis determines that such equipment is practical and necessary 
to ensure sufficient time for the safe evacuation of passengers and 
crewmembers from the train.
    (8) Explain how safety issues are resolved in the design of the 
equipment and selection of materials to reduce the risk of each fire 
hazard.
    (9) Describe the analysis and testing necessary to demonstrate that 
the fire protection approach taken in the design of the equipment and 
selection of materials meets the fire protection requirements of this 
part.
    (d) Fire safety analysis for existing passenger cars and 
locomotives. (1) Not later than January 10, 2001, each passenger 
railroad shall complete a preliminary fire safety analysis for each 
category of existing passenger cars and locomotives and rail service.
    (2) Not later than July 10, 2001, each such railroad shall--
    (i) Complete a final fire safety analysis for any category of 
existing passenger cars and locomotives and rail service evaluated 
during the preliminary fire safety analysis as likely presenting an 
unacceptable risk of personal injury. In conducting the analysis, the 
railroad shall consider the extent to which materials comply with the 
test performance criteria for flammability and smoke emission 
characteristics as specified in Appendix B to this part or alternative 
standards approved by FRA under this part.
    (ii) Take remedial action to reduce the risk of personal injuries to 
an acceptable level in any such category, if the railroad finds the risk 
to be unacceptable. In considering remedial action, a railroad is not 
required to replace material found not to comply with the test 
performance criteria for flammability and smoke emission characteristics 
required by this part, if:
    (A) The risk of personal injuries from the material is negligible 
based on the railroad's operating environment and the material's size, 
or location, or both; or
    (B) The railroad takes alternative action which reduces the risk of 
personal injuries to an acceptable level.

[[Page 727]]

    (3) Not later than July 10, 2003, each such railroad shall--
    (i) Complete a final fire safety analysis for all categories of 
existing passenger cars and locomotives and rail service. In completing 
this analysis, the railroad shall, as far as practicable, determine the 
extent to which remaining materials comply with the test performance 
criteria for flammability and smoke emission characteristics as 
specified in Appendix B to this part or alternative standards approved 
by FRA under this part.
    (ii) Take remedial action to reduce the risk of personal injuries to 
an acceptable level in any such category, if the railroad finds the risk 
to be unacceptable. In considering remedial action, a railroad is not 
required to replace material found not to comply with the test 
performance criteria for flammability and smoke emission characteristics 
required by this part, if:
    (A) The risk of personal injuries from the material is negligible 
based on the railroad's operating environment and the material's size, 
or location, or both; or
    (B) The railroad takes alternative action which reduces the risk of 
personal injuries to an acceptable level.
    (4) Where possible prior to transferring existing passenger cars and 
locomotives to a new category of rail service, but in no case more than 
90 days following such a transfer, the passenger railroad shall complete 
a new fire safety analysis taking into consideration the change in 
railroad operations and shall effect prompt action to reduce any 
identified risk to an acceptable level.
    (5) As used in this paragraph, a ``category of existing passenger 
cars and locomotives and rail service'' shall be determined by the 
railroad based on relevant fire safety risks, including available 
ignition sources, presence or absence of heat/smoke detection systems, 
known variations from the required material test performance criteria or 
alternative standards approved by FRA, and availability of rapid and 
safe egress to the exterior of the vehicle under conditions secure from 
fire, smoke, and other hazards.
    (e) Inspection, testing, and maintenance. Each railroad shall 
develop and adopt written procedures for the inspection, testing, and 
maintenance of all fire safety systems and fire safety equipment on the 
passenger equipment it operates. The railroad shall comply with those 
procedures that it designates as mandatory for the safety of the 
equipment and its occupants.

Sec. 238.111  Pre-revenue service acceptance testing plan.

    (a) Passenger equipment that has previously been used in revenue 
service in the United States. For passenger equipment that has 
previously been used in revenue service in the United States, each 
railroad shall test the equipment on its system prior to placing such 
equipment in revenue service for the first time on its railroad to 
ensure the compatibility of the equipment with the railroad's operating 
system (including the track, and signal system). A description of such 
testing shall be retained by the railroad and made available to FRA for 
inspection and copying upon request. For purposes of this paragraph, 
passenger equipment that has previously been used in revenue service in 
the United States means:
    (1) The actual equipment used in such service;
    (2) Equipment manufactured identically to that actual equipment; and
    (3) Equipment manufactured similarly to that actual equipment with 
no material differences in safety-critical components or systems.
    (b) Passenger equipment that has not been used in revenue service in 
the United States. Before using passenger equipment for the first time 
on its system that has not been used in revenue service in the United 
States, each railroad shall:
    (1) Prepare a pre-revenue service acceptance testing plan for the 
equipment which contains the following elements:

[[Page 730]]

    (i) An identification of any waivers of FRA or other Federal safety 
regulations required for the testing or for revenue service operation of 
the equipment;
    (ii) A clear statement of the test objectives. One of the principal 
test objectives shall be to demonstrate that the equipment meets the 
safety requirements specified in this part when operated in the 
environment in which it is to be used;
    (iii) A planned schedule for conducting the testing;
    (iv) A description of the railroad property or facilities to be used 
to conduct the testing;
    (v) A detailed description of how the testing is to be conducted, 
including a description of the criteria to be used to evaluate the 
equipment's performance;
    (vi) A description of how the test results are to be recorded;
    (vii) A description of any special instrumentation to be used during 
the tests;
    (viii) A description of the information or data to be obtained;
    (ix) A description of how the information or data obtained is to be 
analyzed or used;
    (x) A description of any criteria to be used as safety limits during 
the testing;
    (xi) A description of the criteria to be used to measure or 
determine the success or failure of the tests. If acceptance is to be 
based on extrapolation of less than full-level testing results, the 
analysis to be done to justify the validity of the extrapolation shall 
be described;
    (xii) Quality control procedures to ensure that the inspection, 
testing, and maintenance procedures are followed;
    (xiii) Criteria to be used for the revenue service operation of the 
equipment; and
    (xiv) A description of any testing of the equipment that has 
previously been performed.
    (2) Submit a copy of the plan to FRA at least 30 days prior to 
testing the equipment and include with that submission notification of 
the times and places of the pre-revenue service tests to permit FRA 
observation of such tests. For Tier II passenger equipment, the railroad 
shall obtain FRA approval of the plan under the procedures specified in 
Sec. 238.21.
    (3) Comply with the plan, including fully executing the tests 
required by the plan.
    (4) Document in writing the results of the tests. For Tier II 
passenger equipment, the railroad shall report the results of the tests 
to the FRA Associate Administrator for Safety at least 90 days prior to 
its intended operation of the equipment in revenue service.
    (5) Correct any safety deficiencies identified in the design of the 
equipment or in the inspection, testing, and maintenance procedures, 
uncovered during the testing. If safety deficiencies cannot be corrected 
by design changes, the railroad shall impose operational limitations on 
the revenue service operation of the equipment that are designed to 
ensure that the equipment can operate safely. For Tier II passenger 
equipment, the railroad shall comply with any operational limitations 
imposed by the FRA Associate Administrator for Safety on the revenue 
service operation of the equipment for cause stated following FRA review 
of the results of the test program. This section does not restrict a 
railroad from petitioning FRA for a waiver of a safety regulation under 
the procedures specified in part 211 of this chapter.
    (6) Make the plan and documentation kept pursuant to that plan 
available for inspection and copying by FRA upon request.
    (7) For Tier II passenger equipment, obtain approval from the FRA 
Associate Administrator for Safety prior to placing the equipment in 
revenue service. The Associate Administrator grants such approval upon a 
showing of the railroad's compliance with the applicable requirements of 
this part.
    (c) If a railroad plans a major upgrade or introduction of new 
technology on Tier II passenger equipment that has been used in revenue 
service in the United States and that affects a safety system on such 
equipment, the railroad shall follow the procedures specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section prior to placing the equipment in

[[Page 731]]

revenue service with such a major upgrade or introduction of new 
technology.

equipment if used exclusively on a rail line:
    (i) With no public highway-rail grade crossings;
    (ii) On which no freight operations occur at any time;
    (iii) On which only passenger equipment of compatible design is 
utilized; and
    (iv) On which trains operate at speeds not exceeding 79 mph. Any 
such passenger equipment remains subject to the requirements of Sec. 
229.141 of this chapter, as applicable.
    (b) Alternative compliance. Passenger equipment of special design 
shall be deemed to comply with this subpart, other than Sec. 238.203, 
for the service environment in which the petitioner proposes to operate 
the equipment if the FRA Associate Administrator for Safety determines 
under paragraph (c) of this section that the equipment provides at least 
an equivalent level of safety in such environment with respect to the 
protection of its occupants from serious injury in the case of a 
derailment or collision. In making a determination under paragraph (c) 
the Associate Administrator shall consider, as a whole, all of those 
elements of casualty prevention or mitigation relevant to the integrity 
of the equipment that are addressed by the requirements of this subpart.
    (c)(1) The Associate Administrator may only make a finding of 
equivalent safety and compliance with this subpart, other than Sec. 
238.203, based upon a submission of data and analysis sufficient to 
support that determination. The petition shall include:
    (i) The information required by Sec. 238.21(c);
    (ii) Information, including detailed drawings and materials 
specifications, sufficient to describe the actual construction of the 
equipment of special design;
    (iii) Engineering analysis sufficient to describe the likely 
performance of the equipment in derailment and collision scenarios 
pertinent to the safety requirements for which compliance is required 
and for which the equipment does not conform to the specific 
requirements of this subpart; and
    (iv) A quantitative risk assessment, incorporating the design 
information and engineering analysis described in this paragraph, 
demonstrating that the equipment, as utilized in the service environment 
for which recognition is sought, presents no greater hazard of serious 
personal injury than equipment that conforms to the specific 
requirements of this subpart.
    (2) Any petition made under this paragraph is subject to the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 238.21, and will be disposed of in 
accordance with Sec. 238.21(g).

<R05>
Sec. 238.203  Static end strength.

    (a)(1) Except as further specified in this paragraph or in paragraph 
(d), on or after November 8, 1999 all passenger equipment shall resist a 
minimum static end load of 800,000 pounds applied on the line of draft 
without permanent deformation of the body structure.
    (2) For a passenger car or a locomotive, the static end strength of 
unoccupied volumes may be less than 800,000 pounds if:

[[Page 745]]

    (i) Energy absorbing structures are used as part of a crash energy 
management design of the passenger car or locomotive, and
    (ii) The passenger car or locomotive resists a minimum static end 
load of 800,000 pounds applied on the line of draft at the ends of its 
occupied volume without permanent deformation of the body structure.
    (3) For a locomotive placed in service prior to November 8, 1999, as 
an alternative to resisting a minimum static end load of 800,000 pounds 
applied on the line of draft without permanent deformation of the body 
structure, the locomotive shall resist a horizontal load of 1,000,000 
pounds applied along the longitudinal center line of the locomotive at a 
point on the buffer beam construction 12 inches above the center line of 
draft without permanent deformation of the body structure. The 
application of this load shall not be distributed over an area greater 
than 6 inches by 24 inches. The alternative specified in this paragraph 
is not applicable to a cab car or an MU locomotive.
    (4) The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to:
    (i) A private car; or
    (ii) Unoccupied passenger equipment operating at the rear of a 
passenger train.
    (b) Passenger equipment placed in service before November 8, 1999 is 
presumed to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, unless the railroad operating the equipment has knowledge, or 
FRA makes a showing, that such passenger equipment was not built to the 
requirements specified in paragraph (a)(1).
    (c) When overloaded in compression, the body structure of passenger 
equipment shall be designed, to the maximum extent possible, to fail by 
buckling or crushing, or both, of structural members rather than by 
fracture of structural members or failure of structural connections.

equipment placed in service on a rail line or lines before November 8, 
1999 that does not comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) may 
continue to be operated on that particular line or (those particular 
lines) if the operator of the equipment files a petition seeking 
grandfathering approval under paragraph (d)(3) before November 8, 1999. 
Such usage may continue while the petition is being processed, but in no 
event later than May 8, 2000, unless the petition is approved.
    (3) Petitions for grandfathering. Petitions for grandfathering shall 
include:
    (i) The name, title, address, and telephone number of the primary

necessary or desirable, FRA will conduct a hearing on a petition in 
accordance with the procedures provided in Sec. 211.25 of this chapter.
    (2) If FRA finds that the petition complies with the requirements of 
this section and that the proposed usage is in the public interest and 
consistent with railroad safety, the petition will be granted, normally 
within 90 days of its receipt. If the petition is neither granted nor 
denied within 90 days, the petition remains pending for decision. FRA 
may attach special conditions to the approval of the petition. Following 
the approval of a petition, FRA may reopen consideration of the petition 
for cause stated.
    (3) If FRA finds that the petition does not comply with the 
requirements of this section or that the proposed usage is not in the 
public interest and consistent with railroad safety, the petition will 
be denied, normally within 90 days of its receipt.

238.205(a), such passenger equipment also complies with the requirements 
of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 238.209  Forward-facing end structure of locomotives.

    The skin covering the forward-facing end of each locomotive shall 
be:

[[Page 747]]

    (a) Equivalent to a \1/2\ inch steel plate with a 25,000 pounds-per-
square-inch yield strength--material of a higher yield strength may be 
used to decrease the required thickness of the material provided at 
least an equivalent level of strength is maintained;
    (b) Designed to inhibit the entry of fluids into the occupied cab 
area of the equipment; and
    (c) Affixed to the collision posts or other main vertical structural 
members of the forward end structure so as to add to the strength of the 
end structure.
    (d) As used in this section, the term ``skin'' does not include 
forward-facing windows and doors.


<R05>
Sec. 238.211  Collision posts.

    (a) Except as further specified in this paragraph and paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section--
    (1) All passenger equipment placed in service for the first time on 
or after September 8, 2000 shall have either:
    (i) Two full-height collision posts, located at approximately the 
one-third points laterally, at each end. Each collision post shall have 
an ultimate longitudinal shear strength of not less than 300,000 pounds 
at a point even with the top of the underframe member to which it is 
attached. If reinforcement is used to provide the shear value, the 
reinforcement shall have full value for a distance of 18 inches up from 
the underframe connection and then taper to a point approximately 30 
inches above the underframe connection; or
    (ii) An equivalent end structure that can withstand the sum of 
forces that each collision post in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section 
is required to withstand. For analysis purposes, the required forces may 
be assumed to be evenly distributed at the end structure at the 
underframe joint.
    (2) The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to unoccupied 
passenger equipment operating in a passenger train, or to the rear end 
of a locomotive if the end is unoccupied by design.
    (b) Each locomotive, including a cab car and an MU locomotive, 
ordered on or after September 8, 2000, or placed in service for the 
first time on or after September 9, 2002, shall have at its forward end, 
in lieu of the structural protection described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, either:
    (1) Two forward collision posts, located at approximately the one-
third points laterally, each capable of withstanding:
    (i) A 500,000-pound longitudinal force at the point even with the 
top of the underframe, without exceeding the ultimate strength of the 
joint; and
    (ii) A 200,000-pound longitudinal force exerted 30 inches above the 
joint of the post to the underframe, without exceeding the ultimate 
strength; or
    (2) An equivalent end structure that can withstand the sum of the 
forces that each collision post in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section 
is required to withstand.
    (c) The end structure requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section apply only to the ends of a semi-permanently coupled consist of 
articulated units, provided that:
    (1) The railroad submits to the FRA Associate Administrator for 
Safety under the procedures specified in Sec. 238.21 a documented 
engineering analysis establishing that the articulated connection is 
capable of preventing disengagement and telescoping to the same extent 
as equipment satisfying the anti-climbing and collision post 
requirements contained in this subpart; and
    (2) FRA finds the analysis persuasive.

Sec. 238.215  Rollover strength.

    (a) Each passenger car shall be designed to rest on its side and be 
uniformly supported at the top (``roof rail''), the bottom cords (``side 
sill'') of the side frame, and, if bi-level, the intermediate floor 
rail. The allowable stress in the structural members of the occupied 
volumes for this condition shall be one-half yield or one-half the 
critical buckling stress, whichever is less. Local yielding to the outer 
skin of the passenger car is allowed provided that the resulting 
deformations in no way intrude upon the occupied volume of the car.
    (b) Each passenger car shall also be designed to rest on its roof so 
that any damage in occupied areas is limited to roof sheathing and 
framing. Other than roof sheathing and framing, the allowable stress in 
the structural members of the occupied volumes for this condition shall 
be one-half yield or one-half the critical buckling stress, whichever is 
less. Deformation to the roof sheathing and framing is allowed to the 
extent necessary to permit the vehicle to be supported directly on the 
top chords of the side frames and end frames.

    (a) Side posts and corner braces. (1) For modified girder, semi-
monocoque, or truss construction, the sum of the section moduli in 
inches \3\--about a longitudinal axis, taken at the weakest horizontal 
section between the side sill and side plate--of all posts and braces on 
each side of the car located between the body corner posts shall be not 
less than 0.30 multiplied by the distance in feet between the centers of 
end panels.
    (2) For modified girder or semi-monocoque construction only, the sum 
of the section moduli in inches \3\--about a transverse axis, taken at 
the weakest horizontal section between the side sill and side plate--of 
all posts, braces and pier panels, to the extent available, on each side 
of the car located between body corner posts shall be not less than 0.20 
multiplied by the distance in feet between the centers of end panels.
    (3) The center of an end panel is the point midway between the 
center of the body corner post and the center of the adjacent side post.
    (4) The minimum section moduli or thicknesses specified in paragraph 
(a) of this section may be adjusted in proportion to the ratio of the 
yield strength of the material used to that of mild open-hearth steel 
for a car whose structural members are made of a higher strength steel.
    (b) Sheathing. (1) Outside sheathing of mild, open-hearth steel when 
used flat, without reinforcement (other than side posts) in a side frame 
of modified girder or semi-monocoque construction shall not be less than 
1/8 inch nominal thickness. Other metals may be used of a thickness in 
inverse proportion to their yield strengths.
    (2) Outside metal sheathing of less than \1/8\ inch thickness may be 
used only if it is reinforced so as to produce at least an equivalent 
sectional area at a right angle to reinforcements as that of the flat 
sheathing specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (3) When the sheathing used for truss construction serves no load-
carrying function, the minimum thickness of that sheathing shall be not 
less than 40 percent of that specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this

<R05>
Sec. 238.229  Safety appliances--general.

    (a) Except as provided in this part, all passenger equipment 
continues to be subject to the safety appliance requirements contained 
in Federal statute at 49 U.S.C. chapter 203 and in Federal regulations 
at part 231 of this chapter.
    (b) Except as provided in this part, FRA interprets the provisions 
in part 231 of this chapter that expressly mandate that the manner of 
application of a safety appliance be a bolt, rivet, or screw to mean 
that the safety appliance and any related bracket or support used to 
attach that safety appliance to the equipment shall be so affixed to the 
equipment. Specifically, FRA prohibits the use of welding as a method of 
attachment of any such safety appliance or related bracket or support. A 
``safety appliance bracket or support'' means a component or part 
attached to the equipment for the sole purpose of securing or attaching 
of the safety appliance. FRA does allow the welded attachment of a brace 
or stiffener used in connection with a mechanically fastened safety 
appliance. In order to be considered a ``brace'' or ``stiffener,'' the 
component or part shall not be necessary for the attachment of the 
safety appliance to the equipment and is used solely to provide extra 
strength or steadiness to the safety appliance.
    (c) Welded Safety Appliances. (1) Passenger equipment placed in 
service prior to January 1, 2007, that is equipped with a safety 
appliance, required by the ``manner of application'' provisions in part 
231 of this chapter to be attached by a mechanical fastener (i.e., 
bolts, rivets, or screws), and the safety appliance is mechanically 
fastened to a bracket or support that is attached to the equipment by 
welding may continue to be used in service provided all of the 
requirements in paragraphs (e) through (k) of this section are met. The 
welded safety appliance bracket or support only needs to receive the 
initial visual inspection required under paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section if all of the following conditions are met:
    (i) The welded safety appliance bracket or support meets all of the 
conditions contained in Sec. 238.230(b)(1) for being considered part of 
the car body;
    (ii) The weld on the safety appliance bracket or support does not 
contain any defect as defined in paragraph (d) of this section; and
    (iii) The railroad submits a written list to FRA identifying each 
piece of passenger equipment equipped with a welded safety appliance 
bracket or support as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section and provides a description of the specific safety appliance 
bracket or support.
    (2) Passenger equipment placed in service prior to January 1, 2007, 
that is equipped with a safety appliance that is directly attached to 
the equipment by welding (i.e., no mechanical fastening of any kind) 
shall be considered defective and immediately handled for repair 
pursuant to the requirements contained in Sec. 238.17(e) unless the 
railroad meets the following:
    (i) The railroad submits a written list to FRA that identifies each 
piece of passenger equipment equipped with a welded safety appliance as 
described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and provides a description 
of the specific safety appliance; and
    (ii) The involved safety appliance(s) on such equipment are

Sec. 238.307  Periodic mechanical inspection of passenger cars and unpowered 

vehicles used in passenger trains.

    (a) General. (1) Railroads shall conduct periodic mechanical 
inspections of all passenger cars and all unpowered vehicles used in a 
passenger train as required by this section or as warranted and 
justified by data developed pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section. A periodic inspection conducted under part 229 of this chapter 
satisfies the requirement of this section with respect to the features 
inspected.

[[Page 766]]

    (2) A railroad may, upon written notification to FRA's Associate 
Administrator for Safety, adopt and comply with alternative periodic 
mechanical inspection intervals for specific components or equipment in 
lieu of the requirements of this section. Any alternative interval must 
be based upon a documented reliability assessment conducted under a 
system safety plan subject to periodic peer audit. (See Appendix E to 
this part for a discussion of the general principles of reliability-
based maintenance programs.) The periodic inspection intervals provided 
in this section may be changed only when justified by accumulated, 
verifiable data that provides a high level of confidence that the 
component(s) will not fail in a manner resulting in harm to persons. FRA 
may monitor and review a railroad's implementation and compliance with 
any alternative interval adopted. FRA's Associate Administrator for 
Safety may prohibit or revoke a railroad's ability to utilize an 
alternative inspection interval if FRA determines that the adopted 
interval is not supported by credible data or does not provide adequate 
safety assurances. Such a determination will be made in writing and will 
state the basis for such action.
    (b) Each periodic mechanical inspection required by this section 
shall be performed by a qualified maintenance person.
    (c) The periodic mechanical inspection shall specifically include 
the following interior and exterior mechanical components, which shall 
be inspected not less frequently than every 184 days. At a minimum, this 
inspection shall determine that:
    (1) Seats and seat attachments are not broken or loose. If a car is 
found with a seat that is not in compliance with this requirement while 
being used between periodic mechanical inspections, the equipment may 
continue to be used in passenger service until the performance of an 
interior calendar day mechanical inspection pursuant to Sec. 238.305 on 
the day following the discovery of the defective condition provided the 
seat is rendered unuseable, a notice is prominently displayed on the 
seat, and a record is maintained with the date and time that the non-
complying condition was discovered.
    (2) Luggage racks are not broken or loose.
    (3) All beds and bunks are not broken or loose, and all restraints 
or safety latches and straps are in place and function as intended.

whichever occurs first, that the train remains in continuous passenger 
service.
    (c) Each passenger car and each unpowered vehicle added to a 
passenger train shall receive a Class I or Class IA brake test at the 
time it is added to the train unless notice is provided to the train 
crew that a Class I brake test was performed on the car within the 
previous calendar day and the car has not been disconnected from a 
source of compressed air for more than four hours prior to being added 
to the train. The notice required by this section shall contain the 
date, time, and location of the last Class I brake test.
    (d) Each Class I brake test shall be performed by a qualified 
maintenance person.
    (e) Each Class I brake test may be performed either separately or in 
conjunction with the exterior calendar day mechanical inspection 
required under Sec. 238.303.

or haul a passenger train in passenger service from a location where a 
Class I brake test has been performed, or was required by this part to 
have been performed, with less than 100 percent operative brakes.

[[Page 770]]

    (g) A Class I brake test shall be performed at the air pressure at 
which the train's air brakes will be operated, but not less than 90 psi, 
and shall be made to determine and ensure that:
    (1) The friction brakes apply and remain applied on each car in the 
train until a release of the brakes has been initiated on each car in 
response to train line electric, pneumatic, or other signals. This test 
shall include a verification that each side of each car's brake system 
responds properly to application and release signals;
    (2) The brake shoes or pads are firmly seated against the wheel or 
disc with the brakes applied;
    (3) Piston travel is within prescribed limits, either by direct 
observation, observation of a piston travel indicator, or in the case of 
tread or disc brakes by determining that the brake shoe or pad provides 
pressure to the wheel. For vehicles equipped with 8\1/2\-inch or 10-inch 
diameter brake cylinders, piston travel shall be within 7 to 9 inches. 
If piston travel is found to be less than 7 inches or more than 9 
inches, it must be adjusted to nominally 7\1/2\ inches. Proper release 
of the brakes can be determined by observation of the clearance between 
the brake shoe and the wheel or between the brake pad and the brake 
disc.
    (4) The communicating signal system is tested and known to be 
operating as intended; a tested and operating two-way radio system meets 
this requirement;
    (5) Each brake shoe or pad is securely fastened and correctly 
aligned in relation to the wheel or to the disc;
    (6) The engineer's brake valve or controller will cause the proper 
train line commands for each position or brake level setting;
    (7) Brake pipe leakage does not exceed 5 pounds per square inch per 
minute if leakage will affect service performance;
    (8) The emergency brake application and deadman pedal or other 
emergency control devices function as intended;
    (9) Each brake shoe or pad is not below the minimum thickness 
established by the railroad. This thickness shall not be less than the 
minimum thickness necessary to safely travel the maximum distance 
allowed between Class I brake tests;
    (10) Each angle cock and cutout cock is properly positioned;
    (11) The brake rigging or the system mounted on the car for the 
transmission of the braking force operates as intended and does not bind 
or foul so as to impede the force delivered to a brake shoe, impede the 
release of a brake shoe, or otherwise adversely affect the operation of 
the brake system;
    (12) If the train is equipped with electropneumatic brakes, an 
electropneumatic application of the brakes is made and the train is 
walked to determine that the brakes on each car in the train properly 
apply;
    (13) Each brake disc is free of any crack in accordance with the 
manufacturer's specifications or, if no specifications exist, free of 
any crack to the extent that the design permits;
    (14) If the equipment is provided with a brake indicator, the brake 
indicator operates as intended; and
    (15) The communication of brake pipe pressure changes at the rear of 
the train is verified, which may be accomplished by observation of an 
application and release of the brakes on the last car in the train.
    (h) Records. A record shall be maintained of each Class I brake test 
performed.
    (1) This record may be maintained in writing or electronically, 
provided FRA has access to the record upon request.
    (2) The written or electronic record must contain the following 
information:
    (i) The date and time that the Class I brake test was performed;
    (ii) The location where the test was performed;
    (iii) The identification number of the controlling locomotive of the 
train;
    (iv) The total number of cars inspected during the test; and
    (v) The signature or electronic identification of the inspector.
    (3) This record shall be maintained at the place where the 
inspection is conducted or at one central location and shall be retained 
for at least 92 days.
    (i) A long-distance, intercity passenger train that misses a 
scheduled calendar day Class I brake test due to

[[Page 771]]

a delay en route may proceed to the point where the Class I brake test 
was scheduled to be performed. A Class I brake test shall be completed 
at that point prior to placing the train back in service.
    (j) In addition to complying with all the Class I brake test 
requirements performed by a qualified maintenance person as contained in 
paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section, railroads operating 
passenger equipment that is not designed to permit the visual 
observation of the brake actuation and release without the inspector 
going on, under, or between the equipment in accordance with Sec. 
238.231(b) shall perform an additional inspection. At a minimum, the 
additional inspection requirement for such equipment shall include all 
of the following:
    (1) An additional inspection by a qualified maintenance person of 
all items and components contained in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(15) 
of this section;
    (2) The additional inspection shall be conducted at an interval not 
to exceed five (5) in-service days and shall be conducted while the 
equipment is over an inspection pit or on a raised inspection track; and
    (3) A record of the additional inspection shall be maintained 
pursuant to the requirements contained in paragraph (h) of this section. 
This record can be combined with the Class I brake test record.

    (b) A commuter or short-distance intercity passenger train that 
provides continuing late night service that began prior to midnight may 
complete its daily operating cycle after midnight without performing 
another Class I or Class IA brake test. A Class I or Class IA brake test 
shall be performed on such a train before it starts a new daily 
operating cycle.
    (c) A Class IA brake test may be performed at a shop or yard site 
and is not required to be repeated at the first passenger terminal if 
the train remains on a source of compressed air and:
    (1) The train remains in the custody of the train crew; or
    (2) The train crew receives notice that the Class IA brake test has 
been performed.
    (d) The Class IA brake test shall be performed by either a qualified 
person or a qualified maintenance person.
    (e) Except as provided in Sec. 238.15(b), a railroad shall not use 
or haul a passenger train in passenger service from a location where a 
Class IA brake test has been performed, or was required by this part to 
have been performed, with less than 100 percent operative brakes.
    (f) A Class IA brake test shall be performed at the air pressure at 
which the train's air brakes will be operated and shall determine and 
ensure that:
    (1) Brake pipe leakage does not exceed 5 pounds per square inch per 
minute if brake pipe leakage will affect service performance;
    (2) Each brake sets and releases by inspecting in the manner 
described in paragraph (g) of this section;
    (3) For MU locomotives that utilize an electric signal to 
communicate a service brake application and only a pneumatic signal to 
propagate an emergency brake application, the emergency brake 
application functions as intended.
    (4) Each angle cock and cutout cock is properly set;
    (5) The communication of brake pipe pressure changes at the rear of 
the

[[Page 772]]

train is verified, which may be accomplished by observation of an 
application and release of the brakes on the last car in the train; and
    (6) The communicating signal system is tested and known to be 
operating as intended; a tested and operating two-way radio system meets 
this requirement.
    (g) In determining whether each brake sets and releases--
    (1) The inspection of the set and release of the brakes shall be 
completed by walking the train to directly observe the set and release 
of each brake, if the railroad determines that such a procedure is safe.
    (2) If the railroad determines that operating conditions pose a 
safety hazard to an inspector walking the brakes, brake indicators may 
be used to verify the set and release on cars so equipped. However, the 
observation of the brake indicators shall not be made from the cab of 
the locomotive. The inspector shall walk the train in order to position 
himself or herself to accurately observe each indicator.

brake test within the previous calendar day and have not been 
disconnected from a source of compressed air for more than four hours) 
are added to the train;
    (4) When cars or equipment are removed from the train; and
    (5) When an operator first takes charge of the train, except for 
face-to-face relief.
    (b) A Class II brake test shall be performed by a qualified person 
or a qualified maintenance person.
    (c) Except as provided in Sec. 238.15, a railroad shall not use or 
haul a passenger train in passenger service from a terminal or yard 
where a Class II brake test has been performed, or was required by this 
part to have been performed, with any of the brakes cut-out, 
inoperative, or defective.
    (d) In performing a Class II brake test on a train, a railroad shall 
determine that:
    (1) The brakes on the rear unit of the train apply and release in 
response to a signal from the engineer's brake valve or controller of 
the leading or controlling unit, or a gauge or similar device located at 
the rear of the train or in the cab of the rear unit indicates that 
brake pipe pressure changes are properly communicated at the rear of the 
train;
    (2) For MU locomotives that utilize an electric signal to 
communicate a service brake application and only a pneumatic signal to 
propagate an emergency brake application, the emergency brake 
application functions as intended.
    (3) The communicating signal system is tested and known to be 
operating as intended; a tested and operating two-way radio system meets 
this requirement.

stand used to control the train is changed to facilitate the movement of 
a passenger train from one track to another within a terminal complex 
while not in passenger service.

[[Page 773]]

    (c) The running brake test shall be conducted in accordance with the 
railroad's established operating rules, and shall be made by applying 
brakes in a manner that allows the engineer to ascertain whether the 
brakes are operating properly.
    (d) If the engineer determines that the brakes are not operating 
properly, the engineer shall stop the train and follow the procedures 
provided in Sec. 238.15.

    When a passenger car is out of service for 30 or more consecutive 
days or is out of service when it is due for any test or inspection 
required by Sec. 238.307 or Sec. 238.309 an out of use notation 
showing the number of out of service days shall be made in the records 
required under Sec. 238.307(e) and Sec. 238.309(f). If the passenger 
car is out of service for one or more periods of at least 30 consecutive 
days, the interval prescribed for any test or inspection required by 
Sec. 238.307 and Sec. 238.309 may be extended by the number of days in 
each period the passenger car is out of service since the last test or 
inspection in question. A movement made in accordance with Sec. 229.9 
of this chapter or Sec. 238.17 is not considered service for the 
purposes of determining the out-of-service credit.

     Subpart E_Specific Requirements for Tier II Passenger Equipment


<R05>
Sec. 238.401  Scope.

    This subpart contains specific requirements for railroad passenger 
equipment operating at speeds exceeding 125 mph but not exceeding 150 
mph. The requirements of this subpart apply beginning on September 9, 
1999. As stated in Sec. 238.433(b), all such passenger equipment 
remains subject to the requirements concerning couplers and uncoupling 
devices contained in Federal statute at 49 U.S.C. chapter 203 and in FRA 
regulations at part 231 and Sec. 232.2 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 238.403  Crash energy management.

    (a) Each power car and trailer car shall be designed with a crash 
energy management system to dissipate kinetic energy during a collision. 
The crash energy management system shall provide a controlled 
deformation and collapse of designated sections within the unoccupied 
volumes to absorb collision energy and to reduce the decelerations on 
passengers and crewmembers resulting from dynamic forces transmitted to 
occupied volumes.
    (b) The design of each unit shall consist of an occupied volume 
located between two normally unoccupied volumes. Where practical, 
sections within the unoccupied volumes shall be designed to be 
structurally weaker than the occupied volume. During a collision, the 
designated sections within the unoccupied volumes shall start to deform 
and eventually collapse in a controlled fashion to dissipate energy 
before any structural damage occurs to the occupied volume.
    (c) At a minimum, each Tier II passenger train shall be designed to 
meet the following requirements:
    (1) Thirteen megajoules (MJ) shall be absorbed at each end of the 
train through the controlled crushing of unoccupied volumes, and of this 
amount a minimum of 5 MJ shall be absorbed ahead of the operator's cab 
in each power car;
    (2) A minimum of an additional 3 MJ shall be absorbed by the power 
car structure between the operator's cab and the first trailer car; and
    (3) The end of the first trailer car adjacent to each power car 
shall absorb a minimum of 5 MJ through controlled crushing.
    (d) For a 30-mph collision of a Tier II passenger train on tangent, 
level track with an identical stationary train:
    (1) When seated anywhere in a trailer car, the velocity at which a 
50th-percentile adult male contacts the seat back ahead of him shall not 
exceed 25 mph; and
    (2) The deceleration of the occupied volumes of each trailer car 
shall not exceed 8g. For the purpose of demonstrating compliance with 
this paragraph, deceleration measurements may be processed through a 
low-pass filter having a bandwidth of 50 Hz.
    (e) Compliance with paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall 
be

[[Page 774]]

demonstrated by analysis using a dynamic collision computer model. For 
the purpose of demonstrating compliance, the following assumptions shall 
be made:
    (1) The train remains upright, in line, and with all wheels on the 
track throughout the collision; and
    (2) Resistance to structural crushing follows the force-versus-
displacement relationship determined during the structural analysis 
required as part of the design of the train.
    (f) Passenger seating shall not be permitted in the leading unit of 
a Tier II passenger train.

approach, validated through analysis and testing, and approved by FRA 
under the provisions of Sec. 238.21.
    (b) The underframe of the occupied volume of each trailer car shall 
resist a minimum longitudinal static compressive force of 800,000 pounds 
without permanent deformation to the car. To demonstrate compliance with 
this requirement, the 800,000-pound load shall be applied to the 
underframe of the occupied volume as it would be transmitted to the 
underframe by the full structure of the vehicle.
    (c) Unoccupied volumes of a power car or a trailer car designed to 
crush as part of the crash energy management design are not subject to 
the requirements of this section.


<R05>

    (a) Each power car shall have an anti-climbing mechanism at its 
forward end capable of resisting an ultimate upward or downward static 
vertical force of 200,000 pounds. A power car constructed with a crash 
energy management design is permitted to crush in a controlled manner 
before the anti-climbing mechanism fully engages.
    (b) Interior train coupling points between units, including between 
units of articulated cars or other permanently joined units of cars, 
shall have an anti-climbing mechanism capable of resisting an upward or 
downward vertical force of 100,000 pounds without yielding.

stress. In calculating the stress to show compliance with this 
requirement, local yielding of the side skin adjacent to the side sill 
and belt rail, and local yielding of the side sill bend radii at the 
crossbearer and floor-beam connections is allowed. For purposes of this 
paragraph, local yielding is allowed provided the resulting deformations 
in no way intrude upon the occupied volume of the car.

    (b) Each component of a truck (which include axles, wheels, 
bearings, the truck-mounted brake system, suspension system components, 
and any other components attached to the truck by design) shall remain 
attached to the truck when a force equivalent to 2g acting on the mass 
of the component is exerted in any direction on that component.

permanently installed lateral accelerometer mounted on the truck frame. 
The accelerometer output signals shall be processed through a filter 
having a band pass of 0.5 to 10 Hz to determine if hunting oscillations 
of the truck are occurring. If hunting oscillations are detected, the 
train monitoring system shall provide an alarm to the operator, and the 
train shall be slowed to a speed at least 5 mph less than the speed at 
which the hunting oscillations stopped. For purposes of this paragraph, 
hunting oscillations are considered a sustained cyclic oscillation of 
the truck which is evidenced by lateral accelerations in excess of 0.4g 
root mean square (mean-removed) for 2 seconds.
    (d) Overheat sensors. Overheat sensors for each wheelset journal 
bearing shall be provided. The sensors may be placed either onboard the 
equipment or at reasonable intervals along the railroad's right-of-way.

\1\ A penalty may be assessed against an individual only for a willful
  violation. Generally when two or more violations of these regulations
  are discovered with respect to a single unit of passenger equipment
  that is placed or continued in service by a railroad, the appropriate
  penalties set forth above are aggregated up to a maximum of $16,000
  per day. However, failure to perform, with respect to a particular
  unit of passenger equipment, any of the inspections and tests required
  under subparts D and F of this part will be treated as a violation
  separate and distinct from, and in addition to, any substantive
  violative conditions found on that unit of passenger equipment.
  Moreover, the Administrator reserves the right to assess a penalty of
  up to $27,000 for any violation where circumstances warrant. See 49
  CFR part 209, appendix A.
Failure to observe any condition for movement of defective equipment set
  forth in Sec.  238.17 will deprive the railroad of the benefit of the
  movement-for-repair provision and make the railroad and any
  responsible individuals liable for penalty under the particular
  regulatory section(s) concerning the substantive defect(s) present on
  the unit of passenger equipment at the time of movement.
Failure to observe any condition for the movement of passenger equipment
  containing defective safety appliances, other than power brakes, set
  forth in Sec.  238.17(e) will deprive the railroad of the movement-
  for-repair provision and make the railroad and any responsible
  individuals liable for penalty under the particular regulatory
  section(s) contained in part 231 of this chapter or Sec.  238.429
  concerning the substantive defective condition.
The penalties listed for failure to perform the exterior and interior
  mechanical inspections and tests required under Sec.  238.303 and
  Sec.  238.305 may be assessed for each unit of passenger equipment
  contained in a train that is not properly inspected. Whereas, the
  penalties listed for failure to perform the brake inspections and
  tests under Sec.  238.313 through Sec.  238.319 may be assessed for
  each train that is not properly inspected.
\2\ The penalty schedule uses section numbers from 49 CFR part 238. If
  more than one item is listed as a type of violation of a given
  section, each item is also designated by a ``penalty code,'' which is
  used to facilitate assessment of civil penalties, and which may or may
  not correspond to any subsection designation(s). For convenience,
  penalty citations will cite the CFR section and the penalty code, if
  any. FRA reserves the right, should litigation become necessary, to
  substitute in its complaint the CFR citation in place of the combined
  CFR and penalty code citation, should they differ.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this appendix--
    Average heat release rate (q<SUP>//</SUP><INF>180</INF>) means, as 
defined in ASTM E 1354-99, the average heat release rate per unit area 
in the time period beginning at the time of ignition and ending 180 
seconds later.
    Critical radiant flux (C.R.F.) means, as defined in ASTM E 648-00, a 
measure of the behavior of horizontally-mounted floor covering systems 
exposed to a flaming ignition source in a graded radiant heat energy 
environment in a test chamber.
    Flame spread index (I<INF>s</INF>) means, as defined in ASTM E 162-
98, a factor derived from the rate of progress of the flame front 
(F<INF>s</INF>) and the rate of heat liberation by the material under 
test (Q), such that I<INF>s</INF> = F<INF>s</INF> x Q.
    Flaming dripping means periodic dripping of flaming material from 
the site of material burning or material installation.
    Flaming running means continuous flaming material leaving the site 
of material burning or material installation.
    Heat release rate means, as defined in ASTM E 1354-99, the heat 
evolved from a specimen per unit of time.
    Specific extinction area ([sigma]<INF>f</INF>) means, as defined in 
ASTM E 1354-99, specific extinction area for smoke.
    Specific optical density (D<INF>s</INF>) means, as defined in ASTM E 
662-01, the optical density measured over unit path length within a 
chamber of unit volume, produced from a specimen of unit surface area, 
that is irradiated by a heat flux of 2.5 watts/cm\2\ for a specified 
period of time.
    Surface flammability means the rate at which flames will travel 
along surfaces.
    (c) Required test methods and performance criteria. The materials 
used in locomotive cabs and passenger cars shall be tested according to 
the methods and meet the performance criteria set forth in the following 
table and notes:

[[Page 798]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25JN02.000

    \1\ Materials tested for surface flammability shall not exhibit any 
flaming running or dripping.
    \2\ The ASTM E 662-01 maximum test limits for smoke emission 
(specific optical density) shall be measured in either the flaming or

[[Page 799]]

non-flaming mode, utilizing the mode which generates the most smoke.
    \3\ Testing of a complete seat assembly (including cushions, fabric 
layers, upholstery) according to ASTM E 1537-99 using the pass/fail 
criteria of Cal TB 133, and testing of a complete mattress assembly 
(including foam and ticking) according to ASTM E 1590-01 using the pass/
fail criteria of Cal TB 129 shall be permitted in lieu of the test 
methods prescribed herein, provided the assembly component units remain 
unchanged or new (replacement) assembly components possess equivalent 
fire performance properties to the original components tested. A fire 
hazard analysis must also be conducted that considers the operating 
environment within which the seat or mattress assembly will be used in 
relation to the risk of vandalism, puncture, cutting, or other acts 
which may expose the individual components of the assemblies to an 
ignition source. Notes 5, 6, 7, and 8 apply.
    \4\ Testing is performed without upholstery.
    \5\ The surface flammability and smoke emission characteristics 
shall be demonstrated to be permanent after dynamic testing according to 
ASTM D 3574-95, Test I <INF>2</INF> (Dynamic Fatigue Test by the Roller 
Shear at Constant Force) or Test I <INF>3</INF> (Dynamic Fatigue Test by 
Constant Force Pounding) both using Procedure B, except that the test 
samples shall be a minimum of 6 inches (154 mm) by 18 inches (457 mm) by 
the thickness of the material in its end use configuration, or multiples 
thereof. If Test I <INF>3</INF> is used, the size of the indentor 
described in paragraph 96.2 shall be modified to accommodate the 
specified test specimen.
    \6\ The surface flammability and smoke emission characteristics 
shall be demonstrated to be permanent by washing, if appropriate, 
according to FED-STD-191A Textile Test Method 5830.
    \7\ The surface flammability and smoke emission characteristics 
shall be demonstrated to be permanent by dry-cleaning, if appropriate, 
according to ASTM D 2724-87.
    \8\ Materials that cannot be washed or dry-cleaned shall be so 
labeled and shall meet the applicable performance criteria after being 
cleaned as recommended by the manufacturer.
    \9\ Signage is not required to meet any flammability or smoke 
emission performance criteria specified in this Appendix.
    \10\ Materials used to fabricate miscellaneous, discontinuous small 
parts (such as knobs, rollers, fasteners, clips, grommets, and small 
electrical parts) that will not contribute materially to fire growth in 
end use configuration are exempt from flammability and smoke emission 
performance requirements, provided that the surface area of any 
individual small part is less than 16 square inches (100 cm\2\) in end 
use configuration and an appropriate fire hazard analysis is conducted 
which addresses the location and quantity of the materials used, and the 
vulnerability of the materials to ignition and contribution to flame 
spread.
    \11\ If the surface area of any individual small part is less than 
16 square inches (100 cm\2\) in end use configuration, materials used to 
fabricate such a part may be tested in accordance with ASTM E 1354-99 as 
an alternative to both (a) the ASTM E 162-98 flammability test 
procedure, or the appropriate flammability test procedure otherwise 
specified in the table, and (b) the ASTM E 662-01 smoke generation test 
procedure. Testing shall be at 50 kW/m\2\ applied heat flux with a 
retainer frame. Materials tested in accordance with ASTM E 1354-99 shall 
meet the following performance criteria: average heat release rate (q\//
\ <INF>180</INF>) less than or equal to 100 kW/m\2\, and average 
specific extinction area ([sigma]<INF>f</INF>) less than or equal to 500 
m\2\/kg over the same 180-second period.
    \12\ Carpeting used as a wall or ceiling covering shall be tested 
according to ASTM E 162-98 and ASTM E 662-01 and meet the respective 
criteria of I <INF>s</INF> less than or equal to 35 and D <INF>s</INF> 
(1.5) less than or equal to 100 and D <INF>s</INF> (4.0) less than or 
equal to 200. Notes 1 and 2 apply.
    \13\ Floor covering shall be tested with padding in accordance with 
ASTM E 648-00, if the padding is used in the actual installation.
    \14\ For double window glazing, only the interior glazing is 
required to meet the requirements specified herein. (The exterior 
glazing is not required to meet these requirements.)
    \15\ Penetrations (ducts, etc.) shall be designed against acting as 
passageways for fire and smoke and representative penetrations shall be 
included as part of test assemblies.
    \16\ A structural flooring assembly separating the interior of a 
vehicle from its undercarriage shall meet the performance criteria 
during a nominal test period as determined by the railroad. The nominal 
test period must be twice the maximum expected time period under normal 
circumstances for a vehicle to stop completely and safely from its 
maximum operating speed, plus the time necessary to evacuate all the 
vehicle's occupants to a safe area. The nominal test period must not be 
less than 15 minutes. Only one specimen need be tested. A proportional 
reduction may be made in the dimensions of the specimen provided it 
serves to truly test the ability of the structural flooring assembly to 
perform as a barrier against under-vehicle fires. The fire resistance 
period required shall be consistent with the safe evacuation of a full 
load of passengers from the vehicle under worst-case conditions.
    \17\ Portions of the vehicle body which separate major ignition 
sources, energy sources, or sources of fuel-load from vehicle interiors, 
shall have sufficient fire endurance as determined by a fire hazard 
analysis acceptable to

[[Page 800]]

the railroad which addresses the location and quantity of the materials 
used, as well as vulnerability of the materials to ignition, flame 
spread, and smoke generation. These portions include equipment carrying 
portions of a vehicle's roof and the interior structure separating the 
levels of a bi-level car, but do not include a flooring assembly subject 
to Note 16. A railroad is not required to use the ASTM E 119-00a test 
method.

   Sec. Appendix C to Part 238--Suspension System Safety Performance 

                                Standards

    This appendix contains the minimum suspension system safety 
performance standards for Tier II passenger equipment as required by 
Sec. 238.427. These requirements shall be the basis for evaluating 
suspension system safety performance until an industry standard 
acceptable to FRA is developed and approved under the procedures 
provided in Sec. 238.21.
    (a) Passenger equipment suspension systems shall be designed to 
limit the lateral and vertical forces and lateral to vertical (L/V) 
ratios, for the time duration required to travel five feet at any 
operating speed or over any class of track, under all operating 
conditions as determined by the railroad, as follows:
    (1) The maximum single wheel lateral to vertical force (L/V) ratio 
shall not exceed Nadal's limit as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12MY99.005

where:

[delta]=flange angle (deg).
[mu]=coefficient of friction of 0.5.

    (2) The net axle lateral force shall not exceed 0.5 times the static 
vertical axle load.
    (3) The vertical wheel/rail force shall not be less than or equal to 
10 percent of the static vertical wheel load.
    (4) The sum of the vertical wheel loads on one side of any truck 
shall not be less than or equal to 20 percent of the static vertical 
axle load. This shall include the effect of a crosswind allowance as 
specified by the railroad for the intended service.
    (5) The maximum truck side L/V ratio shall not exceed 0.6.
    (6) When stopped on track with a uniform 6-inch superelevation, 
vertical wheel loads, at all wheels, shall not be less than or equal to 
60 percent of the nominal vertical wheel load on level track.
    (b) For purposes of this appendix, wheel/rail force measurements 
shall be processed through a low pass filter having a cut-off frequency 
of 25 Hz.


<R05>
  Sec. Appendix D to Part 238--Requirements for External Fuel Tanks on 

                           Tier I Locomotives

    The requirements contained in this appendix are intended to address 
the structural and puncture resistance properties of the locomotive fuel 
tank to reduce the risk of fuel spillage to acceptable levels under 
derailment and minor collision conditions.
    (a) Structural strength--(1) Load case 1--minor derailment. The end 
plate of the fuel tank shall support a sudden loading of one-half the 
weight of the car body at a vertical acceleration of 2g, without 
exceeding the ultimate strength of the material. The load is assumed to 
be supported on one rail, within an eight inch band (plus or minus) at a 
point nominally above the head of the rail, on tangent track. 
Consideration should be given in the design of the fuel tank to maximize 
the vertical clearance between the top of the rail and the bottom of the 
fuel tank.
    (2) Load case 2--jackknifed locomotive. The fuel tank shall support 
transversely at the center a sudden loading equivalent to one half the 
weight of the locomotive at a vertical acceleration of 2g, without 
exceeding the ultimate strength of the material. The load is assumed to 
be supported on one rail, distributed between the longitudinal center 
line and the edge of the tank bottom, with a rail head surface of two 
inches.
    (3) Load case 3--side impact. In a side impact collision by an 
80,000 pound Gross Vehicle Weight tractor/trailer at the longitudinal 
center of the fuel tank, the fuel tank shall withstand, without 
exceeding the ultimate strength, a 200,000 pound load (2.5g) distributed 
over an area of six inches by forty-eight inches (half the bumper area) 
at a height of thirty inches above the rail (standard DOT bumper 
height).
    (4) Load case 4--penetration resistance. The minimum thickness of 
the sides, bottom sheet and end plates of the fuel tank shall be 
equivalent to a \5/16\-inch steel plate with a 25,000 pounds-per-square-
inch yield strength (where the thickness varies inversely with the 
square root of yield strength). The lower one third of the end plates 
shall have the equivalent penetration resistance by the above method of 
a \3/4\-inch steel plate with a 25,000 pounds-per-square-inch yield 
strength. This may be accomplished by any combination of materials or 
other mechanical protection.
    (b) Sideswipe. To minimize fuel tank damage during sideswipes 
(railroad vehicles and grade crossings), all drain plugs, clean-out 
ports, inspection covers, sight glasses, gauge openings, etc., must be 
flush with the tank surface or adequately protected to avoid catching 
foreign objects or breakage. All seams must be protected or flush to 
avoid catching foreign objects.

[[Page 801]]

    (c) Spill controls. Vents and fills shall be designed to avert 
spillage of fuel in the event of a roll over.


<R05>
  Sec. Appendix E to Part 238--General Principles of Reliability-Based 

                          Maintenance Programs

    (a) Any maintenance program has the following four basic objectives:
    (1) To ensure realization of the design level of safety and 
reliability of the equipment;
    (2) To restore safety and reliability to their design levels when 
deterioration has occurred;
    (3) To obtain the information necessary for design improvements of 
those items whose design reliability proves inadequate; and
    (4) To accomplish these goals at a minimum total cost, including 
maintenance costs and the costs of residual failures.
    (b) Reliability-based maintenance programs are based on the 
following general principles. A failure is an unsatisfactory condition. 
There are two types of failures: functional and potential. Functional 
failures are usually reported by operating crews. Conversely, 
maintenance crews usually discover potential failures. A potential 
failure is an identifiable physical condition, which indicates that a 
functional failure is imminent. The consequences of a functional failure 
determine the priority of a maintenance effort. These consequences fall 
into the following general categories:
    (1) Safety consequences, involving possible loss of the equipment 
and its occupants;
    (2) Operational consequences, which involve an indirect economic 
loss as well as the direct cost of repair;
    (3) Non-operational consequences, which involve only the direct cost 
of repair; or
    (4) Hidden failure consequences, which involve exposure to a 
possible multiple failure as a result of the undetected failure of a 
hidden function.
    (c) In a reliability-based maintenance program, scheduled 
maintenance is required for any item whose loss of function or mode of 
failure could have safety consequences. If preventative tasks cannot 
reduce the risk of such failures to an acceptable level, the item 
requires redesign to alter its failure consequences. Scheduled 
maintenance is also required for any item whose functional failure will 
not be evident to the operating crew, and therefore reported for 
corrective action. In all other cases the consequences of failure are 
economic, and maintenance tasks directed at preventing such failures 
must be justified on economic grounds. All failure consequences, 
including economic consequences, are established by the design 
characteristics of the equipment and can be altered only by basic 
changes in the design. Safety consequences can, in nearly all cases, be 
reduced to economic consequences by the use of redundancy. Hidden 
functions can usually be made evident by instrumentation or other design 
features. The feasibility and cost effectiveness of scheduled 
maintenance depend on the inspectablility of the component, and the cost 
of corrective maintenance depends on its failure modes and design 
reliability.
    (d) The design reliability of equipment or components will only be 
achieved with an effective maintenance program. This level of 
reliability is established by the design of each component and the 
manufacturing processes that produced it. Scheduled maintenance can 
ensure that design reliability of each component is achieved, but 
maintenance alone cannot yield a level of reliability beyond the design 
reliability.
    (e) When a maintenance program is developed, it includes tasks that 
satisfy the criteria for both applicability and effectiveness. The 
applicability of a task is determined by the characteristics of the 
component or equipment to be maintained. The effectiveness is stated in 
terms of the consequences that the task is designed to prevent. The 
basics types of tasks that are performed by maintenance personnel are 
each applicable under a unique set of conditions. Tasks may be directed 
at preventing functional failures or preventing a failure event 
consisting of the sequential occurrence of two or more independent 
failures which may have consequences that would not be produced by any 
of the failures occurring separately. The task types include:
    (1) Inspections of an item to find and correct any potential 
failures;
    (2) Rework/remanufacture/overhaul of an item at or before some 
specified time or age limit;
    (3) Discard of an item (or parts of it) at or before some specified 
life limit; and
    (4) Failure finding inspections of a hidden-function item to find 
and correct functional failures that have already occurred but were not 
evident to the operating crew.
    (b) Components or systems in a reliability-based maintenance program 
may be defined as simple or complex. A simple component or system is one 
that is subject to only one or a very few failure modes. This type of 
component or system frequently shows decreasing reliability with 
increasing operating age. An age/time limit may be used to reduce the 
overall failure rate of simple components or systems. Here, safe-life 
limits, fail-safe designs, or damage tolerance-based residual life 
calculations may be imposed on a single component or system to play a 
crucial role in controlling critical failures. Complex components or 
systems are ones whose functional failure may result from many different 
failure modes and show little or no decrease in overall reliability with 
increasing age unless there is a dominant failure mode. Therefore, age 
limits imposed on complex

[[Page 802]]

components or systems have little or no effect on their overall failure 
rates.
    (g) When planning the maintenance of a component or system to 
protect the safety and operating capability of the equipment, a number 
of items must be considered in the reliability assessment process:
    (1) The consequences of each type of functional failure;
    (2) The visibility of a functional failure to the operating crew 
(evidence that a failure has occurred);
    (3) The visibility of reduced resistance to failure (evidence that a 
failure is imminent);
    (4) The age-reliability characteristics of each item;
    (5) The economic tradeoff between the cost of scheduled maintenance 
and the benefits to be derived from it;
    (6) A multiple failure, resulting from a sequence of independent 
failures, may have consequences that would not be caused by any one of 
the individual failures alone. These consequences are taken into account 
in the definition of the failure consequences for the first failure; and
    (7) A default strategy governs decision making in the absence of 
full information or agreement. This strategy provides for conservative 
initial decisions, to be revised on the basis of information derived 
from operating experience.
    (h) A successful reliability-based maintenance program must be 
dynamic. Any prior-to-service program is based on limited information. 
As such, the operating organization must be prepared to collect and 
respond to real data throughout the operating life of the equipment. 
Management of the ongoing maintenance program requires an organized 
information system for surveillance and analysis of the performance of 
each item under actual operating conditions. This information is needed 
to determine the refinements and modifications to be made in the initial 
maintenance program (including the adjustment of task intervals) and to 
determine the need for product improvement. The information derived from 
operating experience may be considered to have the following hierarchy 
of importance in the reliability-based maintenance program:
    (1) Failures that could affect operating safety;
    (2) Failures that have operational consequences;
    (3) The failure modes of units removed as a result of failures;
    (4) The general condition of unfailed parts in units that have 
failed; and
    (5) The general condition of serviceable units inspected as samples.
    (i) At the time an initial maintenance program is developed, 
information is usually available to determine the tasks necessary to 
protect safety and operating capability. However, the information 
required to determine optimum task intervals and the applicability of 
age or life limits can be obtained only from age or life exploration 
after the equipment enters service. With any new equipment there is 
always the possibility of unanticipated failure modes. The first 
occurrence of any serious unanticipated failure should immediately set 
into motion the following improvement cycle:
    (1) An inspection task is developed to prevent recurrences while the 
item is being redesigned;
    (2) The operating fleet is modified to incorporate the redesigned 
part; and
    (3) After the modification has proved successful, the special 
inspection task is eliminated from the maintenance program.
    (j) Component improvements based on identification of the actual 
reliability characteristics of each item through age or life 
exploration, is part of the normal development cycle of all complex 
equipment.

    (b) Approval--(1) Preliminary review. (i) Within 90 days of receipt 
of each proposed emergency preparedness plan, and within 45 days of 
receipt of each plan for passenger operations to be commenced after the 
initial deadline for plan submissions, FRA will conduct a preliminary 
review of the proposed plan to determine if the elements prescribed in 
Sec. 239.101 are sufficiently addressed and discussed in the railroad's 
plan submission. FRA will then notify the primary contact person of each 
affected railroad in writing of the results of the review, whether the 
proposed plan has been conditionally approved by FRA, and if not 
conditionally approved, the specific points in which the plan is 
deficient.
    (ii) If a proposed emergency preparedness plan is not conditionally 
approved by FRA, the affected railroad or railroads shall amend the 
proposed

[[Page 811]]

plan to correct all deficiencies identified by FRA (and provide FRA with 
a corrected copy) not later than 30 days following receipt of FRA's 
written notice that the proposed plan was not conditionally approved.
    (2) Final review. (i) Within 18 months of receipt of each proposed 
plan, and within 180 days of receipt of each proposed plan for passenger 
operations to be commenced after the initial deadline for plan 
submissions, FRA will conduct a comprehensive review of the 
conditionally approved plan to evaluate implementation of the elements 
included. This review will include ongoing dialogues with rail 
management and labor representatives, and field analysis and 
verification. FRA will then notify the primary contact person of each 
affected railroad in writing of the results of the review, whether the 
conditionally approved plan has been finally approved by FRA, and if not 
approved, the specific points in which the plan is deficient.
    (ii) If an emergency preparedness plan of a railroad or railroads is 
not finally approved by FRA, the affected railroad or railroads shall 
amend the plan to correct all deficiencies (and provide FRA with a 
corrected copy) not later than 30 days following receipt of FRA's 
written notice that the plan was not finally approved.
    (3) Review of amendments. (i) FRA will review each proposed plan 
amendment within 45 days of receipt. FRA will then notify the primary 
contact person of each affected railroad of the results of the review, 
whether the proposed amendment has been approved by FRA, and if not 
approved, the specific points in which the proposed amendment is 
deficient.
    (ii) If the amendment is not approved, the railroad shall correct 
any deficiencies identified by FRA and file the corrected amendment 
prior to implementing the amendment.
    (4) Reopened review. Following initial approval of a plan, or 
amendment, FRA may reopen consideration of the plan, or amendment, for 
cause stated.

Sec. 240.115  Criteria for consideration of prior safety conduct as a motor 

vehicle operator.

    (a) Each railroad's program shall include criteria and procedures 
for implementing this section.
    (b) When evaluating a person's motor vehicle driving record, a 
railroad shall not consider information concerning motor vehicle driving 
incidents that occurred more than 36 months before the month in which 
the railroad is making its certification decision and shall only 
consider information concerning the following types of motor vehicle 
incidents:
    (1) A conviction for, or completed state action to cancel, revoke, 
suspend, or deny a motor vehicle drivers license for, operating a motor 
vehicle while under the influence of or impaired by alcohol or a 
controlled substance;
    (2) A conviction for, or completed state action to cancel, revoke, 
suspend, or deny a motor vehicle driver's license for, refusal to 
undergo such testing as is required by State law when a law enforcement 
official seeks to determine whether a person is operating a vehicle 
while under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance.
    (c) If such an incident is identified,
    (1) The railroad shall provide the data to the railroad's EAP 
Counselor, together with any information concerning the person's 
railroad service record, and shall refer the person for evaluation to 
determine if the person has an active substance abuse disorder;
    (2) The person shall cooperate in the evaluation and shall provide 
any requested records of prior counseling or treatment for review 
exclusively by the EAP Counselor in the context of such evaluation; and
    (3) If the person is evaluated as not currently affected by an 
active substance abuse disorder, the subject data shall not be 
considered further with respect to certification. However, the railroad 
shall, on recommendation of the EAP Counselor, condition certification 
upon participation in any needed aftercare and/or follow-up testing for 
alcohol or drugs deemed necessary by the EAP Counselor consistent with 
the technical standards specified in Sec. 240.119(d)(3) of this part.
    (4) If the person is evaluated as currently affected by an active 
substance abuse disorder, the person shall not be currently certified 
and the provisions of Sec. 240.119(b) will apply.


<R05>
Sec. 240.117  Criteria for consideration of operating rules compliance data.

    (a) Each railroad's program shall include criteria and procedures 
for implementing this section.
    (b) A person who has demonstrated a failure to comply, as described 
in paragraph (e) of this section, with railroad rules and practices for 
the safe operation of trains shall not be currently certified as a 
locomotive engineer.
    (c)(1) A certified engineer who has demonstrated a failure to 
comply, as described in paragraph (e) of this section, with railroad 
rules and practices for the safe operation of trains shall have his or 
her certification revoked.

[[Page 824]]

    (2) A Designated Supervisor of Locomotive Engineers, a certified 
locomotive engineer pilot or an instructor engineer who is monitoring, 
piloting or instructing a locomotive engineer and fails to take 
appropriate action to prevent a violation of paragraph (e) of this 
section, shall have his or her certification revoked. Appropriate action 
does not mean that a supervisor, pilot or instructor must prevent a 
violation from occurring at all costs; the duty may be met by warning an 
engineer of a potential or foreseeable violation. A Designated 
Supervisor of Locomotive Engineers will not be held culpable under this 
section when this monitoring event is conducted as part of the 
railroad's operational compliance tests as defined in Sec. Sec. 217.9 
and 240.303 of this chapter.
    (3) A person who is a certified locomotive engineer but is called by 
a railroad to perform the duty of a train crew member other than that of 
locomotive engineer, and is performing such other duty, shall not have 
his or her certification revoked based on actions taken or not taken 
while performing that duty.
    (d) Limitations on consideration of prior operating rule compliance 
data. Except as provided for in paragraph (i) of this section, in 
determining whether a person may be or remain certified as a locomotive 
engineer, a railroad shall consider as operating rule compliance data 
only conduct described in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this 
section that occurred within a period of 36 consecutive months prior to 
the determination. A review of an existing certification shall be 
initiated promptly upon the occurrence and documentation of any conduct 
described in this section.
    (e) A railroad shall only consider violations of its operating rules 
and practices that involve:
    (1) Failure to control a locomotive or train in accordance with a 
signal indication, excluding a hand or a radio signal indication or a 
switch, that requires a complete stop before passing it;
    (2) Failure to adhere to limitations concerning train speed when the 
speed at which the train was operated exceeds the maximum authorized 
limit by at least 10 miles per hour. Where restricted speed is in 
effect, railroads shall consider only those violations of the 
conditional clause of restricted speed rules (i.e., the clause that 
requires stopping within one half of the locomotive engineer's range of 
vision), or the operational equivalent thereof, which cause reportable 
accidents or incidents under part 225 of this chapter, except for 
accidents and incidents that are classified as ``covered data'' under 
Sec. 225.5 of this chapter (i.e., employee injury/illness cases 
reportable exclusively because a physician or other licensed health care 
professional either made a one-time topical application of a 
prescription-strength medication to the employee's injury or made a 
written recommendation that the employee: Take one or more days away 
from work when the employee instead reports to work (or would have 
reported had he or she been scheduled) and takes no days away from work 
in connection with the injury or illness; work restricted duty for one 
or more days when the employee instead works unrestricted (or would have 
worked unrestricted had he or she been scheduled) and takes no other 
days of restricted work activity in connection with the injury or 
illness; or take over-the-counter medication at a dosage equal to or 
greater than the minimum prescription strength, whether or not the 
employee actually takes the medication, as instances of failure to 
adhere to this section;
    (3) Failure to adhere to procedures for the safe use of train or 
engine brakes when the procedures are required for compliance with the 
initial terminal, intermediate terminal, or transfer train and yard test 
provisions of 49 CFR part 232 or when the procedures are required for 
compliance with the class 1, class 1A, class II, or running brake test 
provisions of 49 CFR part 238;
    (4) Occupying main track or a segment of main track without proper 
authority or permission;
    (5) Failure to comply with prohibitions against tampering with 
locomotive mounted safety devices, or knowingly operating or permitting 
to

[[Page 825]]

be operated a train with an unauthorized disabled safety device in the 
controlling locomotive. (See 49 CFR part 218, subpart D and Appendix C 
to part 218);
    (6) Incidents of noncompliance with Sec. 219.101 of this chapter; 
however such incidents shall be considered as a violation only for the 
purposes of paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section;
    (f)(1) If in any single incident the person's conduct contravened 
more than one operating rule or practice, that event shall be treated as 
a single violation for the purposes of this section.
    (2) A violation of one or more operating rules or practices 
described in paragraph (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section that occurs 
during a properly conducted operational compliance test subject to the 
provisions of this chapter shall be counted in determining the periods 
of ineligibility described in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (3) An operational test that is not conducted in compliance with 
this part, a railroad's operating rules, or a railroad's program under 
Sec. 217.9 of this chapter, will not be considered a legitimate test of 
operational skill or knowledge, and will not be considered for 
certification, recertification or revocation purposes.
    (g) A period of ineligibility described in this paragraph shall:
    (1) Begin, for a person not currently certified, on the date of the 
railroad's written determination that the most recent incident has 
occurred; or
    (2) Begin, for a person currently certified, on the date of the 
railroad's notification to the person that recertification has been 
denied or certification has been revoked; and
    (3) Be determined according to the following standards:
    (i) In the case of a single incident involving violation of one or 
more of the operating rules or practices described in paragraphs (e)(1) 
through (e)(5) of this section, the person shall have his or her 
certificate revoked for a period of one month.
    (ii) In the case of two separate incidents involving a violation of 
one or more of the operating rules or practices described in paragraphs 
(e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section, that occurred within 24 months of 
each other, the person shall have his or her certificate revoked for a 
period of six months.
    (iii) In the case of three separate incidents involving violations 
of one or more of the operating rules or practices, described in 
paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(6) of this section, that occurred within 
36 months of each other, the person shall have his or her certificate 
revoked for a period of one year.
    (iv) In the case of four separate incidents involving violations of 
one or more of the operating rules or practices, described in paragraphs 
(e)(1) through (e)(6) of this section, that occurred within 36 months of 
each other, the person shall have his or her certificate revoked for a 
period of three years.
    (v) Where, based on the occurrence of violations described in 
paragraph (e)(6) of this section, different periods of ineligibility may 
result under the provisions of this section and Sec. 240.119, the 
longest period of revocation shall control.
    (4) Be reduced to the shorter periods of ineligibility imposed by 
paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section as amended, and effective 
January 7, 2000 if the incident:
    (i) Occurred prior to January 7, 2000; and
    (ii) Involved violations described in paragraphs (e)(1) through 
(e)(5) of this section; and
    (iii) Did not occur within 60 months of a prior violation as 
described in paragraph (e)(6) of this section.
    (h) Future eligibility to hold certificate. A person whose 
certification has been denied or revoked shall be eligible for grant or 
reinstatement of the certificate prior to the expiration of the initial 
period of revocation only if:
    (1) The denial or revocation of certification in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraph (g)(3) of this section is for a period of one 
year or less;
    (2) Certification was denied or revoked for reasons other than 
noncompliance with Sec. 219.101 of this chapter;
    (3) The person has been evaluated by a Designated Supervisor of 
Locomotive Engineers and determined to have received adequate remedial 
training;
    (4) The person has successfully completed any mandatory program of

[[Page 826]]

training or retraining, if that was determined to be necessary by the 
railroad prior to return to service; and
    (5) At least one half the pertinent period of ineligibility 
specified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section has elapsed.
    (i) In no event shall incidents that meet the criteria of paragraphs 
(i)(1) through (4) of this section be considered as prior incidents for 
the purposes of paragraph (g)(3) of this section even though such 
incidents could have been or were validly determined to be violations at 
the time they occurred. Incidents that shall not be considered under 
paragraph (g)(3) of this section are those that:
    (1) Occurred prior to May 10, 1993;
    (2) Involved violations of one or more of the following operating 
rules or practices:
    (i) Failure to control a locomotive or train in accordance with a 
signal indication;
    (ii) Failure to adhere to limitations concerning train speed;
    (iii) Failure to adhere to procedures for the safe use of train or 
engine brakes; or
    (iv) Entering track segment without proper authority;
    (3) Were or could have been found to be violations under this 
section contained in the 49 CFR, parts 200 to 399, edition revised as of 
October 1, 1992; and
    (4) Would not be a violation of paragraph (e) of this section.
    (j) In no event shall incidents that meet the criteria of paragraphs 
(j)(1) through (2) of this section be considered as prior incidents for 
the purposes of paragraph (g)(3) of this section even though such 
incidents could have been or were validly determined to be violations at 
the time they occurred. Incidents that shall not be considered under 
paragraph (g)(3) of this section are those that:

of this part, certification may be reinstated as provided in paragraph 
(d) of this section.
    (3) In the case of a current employee of the railroad evaluated as 
having an active substance abuse disorder (including a person identified 
under the procedures of Sec. 240.115), the employee may, if otherwise 
eligible, voluntarily self-refer for substance abuse counseling or 
treatment under the policy required by Sec. 219.403 of this chapter; 
and the railroad shall then treat the substance abuse evaluation as 
confidential except with respect to current ineligibility for 
certification.
    (c) Prior alcohol/drug conduct; Federal rule compliance. (1) In 
determining whether a person may be or remain certified as a locomotive 
engineer, a railroad shall consider conduct described in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section that occurred within a period of 60 consecutive 
months prior to the review. A review of certification shall be initiated 
promptly upon the occurrence and documentation of any incident of 
conduct described in this paragraph.

[[Page 827]]

    (2) A railroad shall consider any violation of Sec. 219.101 or 
Sec. 219.102 of this chapter and any refusal or failure to provide a 
breath or body fluid sample for testing under the requirements of part 
219 of this chapter when instructed to do so by a railroad 
representative.
    (3) A period of ineligibility described in this paragraph shall:
    (i) Begin, for a person not currently certified, on the date of the 
railroad's written determination that the most recent incident has 
occurred; or
    (ii) Begin, for a person currently certified, on the date of the 
railroad's notification to the person that recertification has been 
denied or certification has been revoked; and
    (4) The period of ineligibility described in this paragraph shall be 
determined in accordance with the following standards:
    (i) In the case of a single violation of Sec. 219.102 of this 
chapter, the person shall be ineligible to hold a certificate during 
evaluation and any required primary treatment as described in paragraph 
(d) of this section. In the case of two violations of Sec. 219.102, the 
person shall be ineligible to hold a certificate for a period of two 
years. In the case of more than two such violations, the person shall be 
ineligible to hold a certificate for a period of five years.
    (ii) In the case of one violation of Sec. 219.102 of this chapter 
and one violation of Sec. 219.101 of this chapter, the person shall be 
ineligible to hold a certificate for a period of three years.
    (iii) In the case of one violation of Sec. 219.101 of this chapter, 
the person shall be ineligible to hold a certificate for a period of 9 
months (unless identification of the violation was through a qualifying 
``co-worker report'' as described in Sec. 219.405 of this chapter and 
the engineer waives investigation, in which case the certificate shall 
be deemed suspended during evaluation and any required primary treatment 
as described in paragraph (d)). In the case of two or more violations of 
Sec. 219.101, the person shall be ineligible to hold a certificate for 
a period of five years.
    (iv) In the case of a refusal or failure to provide a breath or body 
fluid sample for testing under the requirements of part 219 of this 
chapter when instructed to do so by a railroad representative, the 
refusal or failure shall be treated for purposes of ineligibility under 
this paragraph in the same manner as a violation of--
    (A) Sec. 219.102, in the case of a refusal or failure to provide a 
urine specimen for testing; or
    (B) Sec. 219.101, in the case of a refusal or failure to provide a 
breath sample (subpart D), or a blood specimen for mandatory post-
accident toxicological testing (subpart C)).
    (d) Future eligibility to hold certificate following alcohol/drug 
violation. The following requirements apply to a person who has been 
denied certification or who has had certification suspended or revoked 
as a result of conduct described in paragraph (c) of this section:
    (1) The person shall not be eligible for grant or reinstatement of 
the certificate unless and until the person has--
    (i) Been evaluated by an EAP Counselor to determine if the person 
currently has an active substance abuse disorder;
    (ii) Successfully completed any program of counseling or treatment 
determined to be necessary by the EAP Counselor prior to return to

treatment deemed necessary by the EAP Counselor and shall be subject to 
a reasonable program of follow-up alcohol and drug testing without prior 
notice for a period of not more than 60 months following return to 
service. Follow-up tests shall include not fewer than 6 alcohol tests 
and 6 drug tests during the first 12 months following return to service.
    (3) Return-to-service and follow-up alcohol and drug tests shall be 
performed consistent with the requirements of subpart H of part 219 of 
this chapter.

[[Page 828]]

    (4) This paragraph does not create an entitlement to utilize the 
services of a railroad EAP Counselor, to be afforded leave from 
employment for counseling or treatment, or to employment as a locomotive 
engineer. Nor does it restrict any discretion available to the railroad 
to take disciplinary action based on conduct described herein.
    (e) Confidentiality protected. Nothing in this part shall affect the 
responsibility of the railroad under Sec. 219.403 of this chapter 
(``Voluntary Referral Policy'') to treat voluntary referrals for 
substance abuse counseling and treatment as confidential; and the 
certification status of an engineer who is successfully assisted under 
the procedures of that section shall not be adversely affected. However, 
the railroad shall include in its voluntary referral policy required to 
be issued pursuant to Sec. 219.403 of this chapter a provision that, at 
least with respect to a certified locomotive engineer or a candidate for 
certification, the policy of confidentiality is waived (to the extent 
that the railroad shall receive from the EAP Counselor official notice 
of the substance abuse disorder and shall suspend or revoke the 
certification, as appropriate) if the person at any time refuses to 
cooperate in a recommended course of counseling or treatment.

Sec. 240.121  Criteria for vision and hearing acuity data.

    (a) Each railroad's program shall include criteria and procedures 
implementing this section.
    (b) Fitness requirement. In order to be currently certified as a 
locomotive engineer, except as permitted by paragraph (e) of this 
section, a person's vision and hearing shall meet or exceed the 
standards prescribed in this section and appendix F to this part. It is 
recommended that each test conducted pursuant to this section should be 
performed according to any directions supplied by the manufacturer of 
such test and any American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards 
that are applicable.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (e), each person shall have 
visual acuity that meets or exceeds the following thresholds:
    (1) For distant viewing either
    (i) Distant visual acuity of at least 20/40 (Snellen) in each eye 
without corrective lenses or
    (ii) Distant visual acuity separately corrected to at least 20/40 
(Snellen) with corrective lenses and distant binocular acuity of at 
least 20/40 (Snellen) in both eyes with or without corrective lenses;
    (2) A field of vision of at least 70 degrees in the horizontal 
meridian in each eye; and
    (3) The ability to recognize and distinguish between the colors of 
railroad signals as demonstrated by successfully completing one of the 
tests in appendix F to this part.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, each person 
shall have hearing acuity that meets or exceeds the following thresholds 
when tested by use of an audiometric device (calibrated to American 
National Standard Specification for Audiometers, S3.6-1969): the person 
does not have an average hearing loss in the better ear greater than 40 
decibels at 500Hz, 1,000 Hz, and 2,000 Hz with or without use of a 
hearing aid.
    (e) A person not meeting the thresholds in paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
this section shall, upon request, be subject to further medical 
evaluation by a railroad's medical examiner to determine that person's 
ability to safely operate a locomotive. In accordance with the guidance 
prescribed in appendix F to this part, a person is entitled to one 
retest without making any showing and to another retest if the person 
provides evidence substantiating that circumstances have changed since 
the last test to the extent that the person could now arguably operate a 
locomotive or train safely. The railroad shall provide its medical 
examiner with a copy of this part, including all appendices. If, after 
consultation with one of the railroad's designated supervisors of 
locomotive engineers, the medical examiner concludes that, despite not 
meeting the threshold(s) in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the 
person has the ability to safely operate a locomotive, the person may be 
certified as

[[Page 829]]

a locomotive engineer and such certification conditioned on any special 
restrictions the medical examiner determines in writing to be necessary.
    (f) As a condition of maintaining certification, each certified 
locomotive engineer shall notify his or her employing railroad's medical 
department or, if no such department exists, an appropriate railroad 
official if the person's best correctable vision or hearing has 
deteriorated to the extent that the person no longer meets one or more 
of the prescribed vision or hearing standards or requirements of this 
section. This notification is required prior to any subsequent operation 
of a locomotive or train which would require a certified locomotive 
engineer.

Sec. 240.219  Denial of certification.

    (a) A railroad shall notify a candidate for certification or 
recertification of information known to the railroad that forms the 
basis for denying the person certification and provide the person a 
reasonable opportunity to explain or rebut that adverse information in 
writing prior to denying certification.
    (b) This section does not require further opportunity to comment if 
the railroad's denial is based solely on factors addressed by Sec. Sec. 
240.115, 240.117, and 240.119 and the opportunity to comment afforded by 
those sections has been provided.
    (c) If it denies a person certification or recertification, a 
railroad shall notify the person of the adverse decision

[[Page 837]]

and explain, in writing, the basis for its denial decision. The document 
explaining the basis for the denial shall be mailed or delivered to the 
person within 10 days after the railroad's decision and shall give the 
date of the decision.

offices, or both. Requests for such approval shall be filed in writing 
with the Associate Administrator for Safety and contain sufficient 
information to explain how FRA will be given access to the data that is 
fully equivalent to that created by compliance with paragraph (e).


<R05>
Sec. 240.223  Criteria for the certificate.

    (a) As a minimum, each certificate issued in compliance with this 
part shall:
    (1) Identify the railroad or parent company that is issuing it;
    (2) Indicate that the railroad, acting in conformity with this part, 
has determined that the person to whom it is being issued has been 
determined to be qualified to operate a locomotive;
    (3) Identify the person to whom it is being issued (including the 
person's name, date of birth and employee identification number, and 
either a physical description or photograph of the person);

Sec. 240.225  Reliance on qualification determinations made by other 

railroads.

    (a) After December 31, 1991, a railroad that is considering 
certification of a person as a qualified engineer may rely

[[Page 838]]

on determinations made by another railroad concerning that person's 
qualifications. The railroad's certification program shall address how 
the railroad will administer the training of previously uncertified 
engineers with extensive operating experience or previously certified 
engineers who have had their certification expire. If a railroad's 
certification program fails to specify how to train a previously 
certified engineer hired from another railroad, then the railroad shall 
require the newly hired engineer to take the hiring railroad's entire 
training program. A railroad relying on another's certification shall 
determine that:
    (1) The prior certification is still valid in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 240.201, 240.217, and 240.307;
    (2) The prior certification was for the same classification of 
locomotive or train service as the certification being issued under this 
section;
    (3) The person has received training on and visually observed the 
physical characteristics of the new territory in accordance with Sec. 
240.123;
    (4) The person has demonstrated the necessary knowledge concerning 
the railroad's operating rules in accordance with Sec. 240.125;
    (5) The person has demonstrated the necessary performance skills 
concerning the railroad's operating rules in accordance with Sec. 
240.127.

Sec. 240.227  Reliance on qualification requirements of other countries.

    (a) A railroad that conducts joint operations with a Canadian 
railroad may certify, for the purposes of compliance with this part, 
that a person is qualified to be a locomotive or train service engineer 
provided it determines that:
    (1) The person is employed by the Canadian railroad; and
    (2) The person meets or exceeds the qualifications standards issued 
by Transport Canada for such service.
    (b) Any Canadian railroad that is required to comply with this 
regulation may certify that a person is qualified to be a locomotive or 
train service engineer provided it determines that:
    (1) The person is employed by the Canadian railroad; and
    (2) The person meets or exceeds the qualifications standards issued 
by Transport Canada for such service.


<R05>
Sec. 240.229  Requirements for joint operations territory.

    (a) Except for minimal joint operations provided for in paragraph 
(f) of this section, no railroad that is responsible for controlling the 
conduct of joint operations with another railroad shall permit or 
require any person to operate a locomotive in any class of train or 
engine service unless that person has been certified as a qualified 
locomotive engineer for the purposes of joint operations and issued a 
certificate that complies with Sec. 240.223.
    (b) Each railroad that is responsible for controlling the conduct of 
joint operations with another railroad shall certify a person as a 
qualified locomotive engineer for the purposes of joint operations 
either by making the determinations required under subpart C of this 
part or by relying on the certification issued by another railroad under 
this part.
    (c) A railroad that controls joint operations may rely on the 
certification issued by another railroad under the following conditions:
    (1) The controlling railroad shall determine:
    (i) That the person has been certified as a qualified engineer under 
the provisions of this part by the railroad which employs that 
individual;
    (ii) That the person certified as a locomotive engineer by the other 
railroad has demonstrated the necessary knowledge concerning the 
controlling railroad's operating rules, if the rules are different;
    (iii) That the person certified as a locomotive engineer by the 
other railroad has the necessary operating skills concerning the joint 
operations territory; and
    (iv) That the person certified as a locomotive engineer by the other 
railroad has the necessary familiarity with the physical characteristics 
for the joint operations territory; and,
    (2) The railroad which employs the individual shall determine that 
the person called to operate on the controlling railroad is a certified 
engineer who

[[Page 839]]

is qualified to operate on that track segment; and
    (3) Each locomotive engineer who is called to operate on another 
railroad shall:
    (i) Be qualified on the segment of track upon which he or she will 
operate in accordance with the requirements set forth by the controlling 
railroad; and,
    (ii) Immediately notify the railroad upon which he or she is 
employed if he or she is not qualified to perform that service.
    (d) A railroad that controls joint operations and certifies 
locomotive engineers from a different railroad may comply with the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by noting its supplemental 
certification decision on the original certificate as provided for in 
Sec. 240.223(c).
    (e) A railroad responsible for controlling the conduct of joint 
operations with another railroad shall be deemed to be in compliance 
with paragraph (a) of this section when it provides a qualified person 
to accompany a locomotive engineer who lacks joint operations 
certification during that engineer's operations in joint operations 
territory. As used in this section qualified person means either a 
designated supervisor of locomotive engineers or a certified train 
service engineer determined by the controlling railroad to have the 
necessary knowledge concerning the controlling railroad's operating 
rules and to have the necessary operating skills including familiarity 
with its physical characteristics concerning the joint operations 
territory.
    (f) A railroad that is responsible for controlling the conduct of 
joint operations with another railroad may permit a certified locomotive 
engineer to operate a locomotive in any class of train or engine service 
without determining that the person has been certified as a qualified 
locomotive engineer for the purposes of joint operations when a minimal 
joint operation is involved. For the purposes of this section a minimal 
joint operation exists when a locomotive or train belonging to one 
railroad is being operated on the same track on which operations are 
conducted by the railroad controlling operations, under the following 
conditions:
    (1) The maximum authorized speed for operations on the track does 
not exceed 20 miles per hour;
    (2) The track is other than a main track;
    (3) Operations are conducted under operating rules that require 
every locomotive and train to proceed at a speed that permits stopping 
within one half the range of vision of the locomotive engineer; and
    (4) The maximum distance for joint operations on the track does not 
exceed one mile.

<R05>
Sec. 240.231  Requirements for locomotive engineers unfamiliar with physical 

characteristics in other than joint operations.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no 
locomotive engineer shall operate a locomotive over a territory unless 
he or she is qualified on the physical characteristics of the territory 
pursuant to the railroad's certification program.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if a 
locomotive engineer lacks qualification on the physical characteristics 
required by paragraph (a) of this section, he or she shall be assisted 
by a pilot qualified over the territory pursuant to the railroad's 
certification program.
    (1) For a locomotive engineer who has never been qualified on the 
physical characteristics of the territory over which he or she is to 
operate a locomotive or train, the pilot shall be a person qualified and 
certified as a locomotive engineer who is not an assigned crew member.
    (2) For a locomotive engineer who was previously qualified on the 
physical characteristics of the territory over which he or she is to 
operate a locomotive or train, but whose qualification has expired, the 
pilot may be any person, who is not an assigned crew member, qualified 
on the physical characteristics of the territory.
    (c) Pilots are not required if the movement is on a section of track 
with

[[Page 840]]

an average grade of less than 1% over 3 continuous miles, and
    (1) The track is other than a main track; or
    (2) The maximum distance the locomotive or train will be operated 
does not exceed one mile; or
    (3) The maximum authorized speed for any operation on the track does 
not exceed 20 miles per hour; or
    (4) Operations are conducted under operating rules that require 
every locomotive and train to proceed at a speed that permits stopping 
within one half the range of vision of the locomotive engineer.

<R05>
Sec. 240.301  Replacement of certificates.

    A railroad shall have a system for the prompt replacement of lost, 
stolen or mutilated certificates and that system shall be reasonably 
accessible to certified locomotive engineers in need of a replacement 
certificate.


<R05>
Sec. 240.303  Operational monitoring requirements.

    (a) After December 31, 1991, each railroad to which this part 
applies shall, prior to FRA approval of its program in accordance with 
Sec. 240.201, have a program to monitor the conduct of its certified 
locomotive engineers by performing both operational monitoring 
observations and by conducting unannounced operating rules compliance 
tests.
    (b) The program shall be conducted so that each locomotive engineer 
shall be given at least one operational monitoring observation by a 
qualified supervisor of locomotive engineers in each calendar year.
    (c) The program shall be conducted so that each locomotive engineer 
shall be given at least one unannounced compliance test each calendar 
year.
    (d) The unannounced test program shall:
    (1) Test engineer compliance with one or more provisions of the 
railroad's operating rules that require response to signals that display 
less than a ``clear'' aspect, if the railroad operates with a signal 
system that must comply with part 236 of this chapter;
    (2) Test engineer compliance with one or more provisions of the 
railroad's operating rules, timetable or other mandatory directives that 
require affirmative response by the locomotive engineer to less 
favorable conditions than that which existed prior to initiation of the 
test;
    (3) Test engineer compliance with provisions of the railroad's 
operating rules, timetable or other mandatory directives the violations 
of which by engineers were cited by the railroad as the cause of train 
accidents or train incidents in accident reports filed in compliance 
with part 225 of this chapter for the preceding year;
    (4) Be conducted that so that the administration of these tests is 
effectively distributed throughout whatever portion of a 24-hour day 
that the railroad conducts its operations;
    (5) Be conducted so that individual tests are administered without 
prior notice to the locomotive engineer being tested; and
    (6) Be conducted so that the results of the test are recorded on the 
certificate and entered on the record established under Sec. 240.215 
within 30 days of the day the test is administered.


<R05>
Sec. 240.305  Prohibited conduct.

    After December 31, 1991,
    (a) It shall be unlawful to:
    (1) Operate a locomotive or train past a signal indication, 
excluding a hand or a radio signal indication or a switch, that requires 
a complete stop before passing it; or
    (2) Operate a locomotive or train at a speed which exceeds the 
maximum authorized limit by at least 10 miles per hour. Where restricted 
speed is in effect, only those violations of the conditional clause of 
restricted speed rules (i.e., the clause that requires stopping within 
one half of the locomotive engineer's range of vision), or the 
operational equivalent thereof, which cause reportable accidents or 
incidents under part 225 of this chapter, shall be considered instances 
of failure to adhere to this section; or
    (3) Operate a locomotive or train without adhering to procedures for 
the safe use of train or engine brakes when

[[Page 841]]

the procedures are required for compliance with the initial terminal, 
intermediate terminal, or transfer train and yard test provisions of 49 
CFR part 232 or when the procedures are required for compliance with the 
class 1, class 1A, class II, or running brake test provisions of 49 CFR 
part 238;
    (4) Fail to comply with any mandatory directive concerning the 
movement of a locomotive or train by occupying main track or a segment 
of main track without proper authority or permission;
    (5) Fail to comply with prohibitions against tampering with 
locomotive mounted safety devices, or knowingly operate or permit to be 
operated a train with an unauthorized disabled safety device in the 
controlling locomotive. (See 49 CFR part 218, subpart D, and appendix C 
to part 218);
    (6) Be a Designated Supervisor of Locomotive Engineers, a certified 
locomotive engineer pilot or an instructor engineer who is monitoring, 
piloting or instructing a locomotive engineer and fails to take 
appropriate action to prevent a violation of paragraphs (a)(1) through 
(a)(5) of this section. Appropriate action does not mean that a 
supervisor, pilot or instructor must prevent a violation from occurring 
at all costs; the duty may be met by warning an engineer of a potential 
or foreseeable violation. A Designated Supervisor of Locomotive 
Engineers will not be held culpable under this section when this 
monitoring event is conducted as part of the railroad's operational 
compliance tests as defined in Sec. Sec. 217.9 and 240.303 of this 
chapter.
    (b) Each locomotive engineer who has received a certificate required 
under this part shall:
    (1) Have that certificate in his or her possession while on duty as 
an engineer; and
    (2) Display that certificate upon the receipt of a request to do so 
from
    (i) A representative of the Federal Railroad Administration,
    (ii) An officer of the issuing railroad, or
    (iii) An officer of another railroad when operating a locomotive or 
train in joint operations territory.
    (c) Any locomotive engineer who is notified or called to operate a 
locomotive or train and such operation would cause the locomotive 
engineer to exceed certificate limitations, set forth in accordance with 
subpart B of this part, shall immediately notify the railroad that he or 
she is not qualified to perform that anticipated service and it shall be 
unlawful for the railroad to require such service.
    (d) During the duration of any certification interval, a locomotive 
engineer who has a current certificate from more than one railroad shall 
immediately notify the other certifying railroad(s) if he or she is 
denied recertification by a railroad or has his or her certification 
revoked by a railroad.
    (e) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to alter a certified 
locomotive engineer's duty to comply with other provisions of this 
chapter concerning railroad safety.

<R05>
Sec. 240.307  Revocation of certification.

    (a) Except as provided for in Sec. 240.119(e), a railroad that 
certifies or recertifies a person as a qualified locomotive engineer 
and, during the period that certification is valid, acquires information 
which convinces the railroad that the person no longer meets the 
qualification requirements of this part, shall revoke the person's 
certificate as a qualified locomotive engineer.
    (b) Pending a revocation determination under this section, the 
railroad shall:
    (1) Upon receipt of reliable information indicating the person's 
lack of qualification under this part, immediately suspend the person's 
certificate;
    (2) Prior to or upon suspending the person's certificate, provide 
notice of the reason for the suspension, the pending revocation, and an 
opportunity for a hearing before a presiding officer other than the 
investigating officer. The notice may initially be given either orally 
or in writing. If given orally, it must be confirmed in writing and the 
written confirmation must be made promptly. Written confirmation which 
conforms to the notification provisions of an applicable collective 
bargaining agreement shall be deemed to satisfy

[[Page 842]]

the written confirmation requirements of this section. In the absence of 
an applicable collective bargaining agreement provision, the written 
confirmation must be made within 96 hours.
    (3) Convene the hearing within the deadline prescribed by either 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section or the applicable collective bargaining 
agreement as permitted under paragraph (d) of this section;
    (4) Determine, on the record of the hearing, whether the person no 
longer meets the qualification requirements of this part stating 
explicitly the basis for the conclusion reached;
    (5) When appropriate, impose the pertinent period of revocation 
provided for in Sec. 240.117 or Sec. 240.119; and
    (6) Retain the record of the hearing for 3 years after the date the 
decision is rendered.
    (c) Except as provided for in paragraphs (d), (f), (i) and (j) of 
this section, a hearing required by this section shall be conducted in 
accordance with the following procedures:
    (1) The hearing shall be convened within 10 days of the date the 
certificate is suspended unless the locomotive engineer requests or 
consents to delay in the start of the hearing.
    (2) The hearing shall be conducted by a presiding officer, who can 
be any qualified person authorized by the railroad other than the 
investigating officer.
    (3) The presiding officer will exercise the powers necessary to 
regulate the conduct of the hearing for the purpose of achieving a 
prompt and fair determination of all material issues in controversy.
    (4) The presiding officer shall convene and preside over the 
hearing.
    (5) Testimony by witnesses at the hearing shall be recorded 
verbatim.
    (6) All relevant and probative evidence shall be received unless the 
presiding officer determines the evidence to be unduly repetitive or so 
extensive and lacking in relevancy that its admission would impair the 
prompt, orderly, and fair resolution of the proceeding.
    (7) The presiding officer may:
    (i) Adopt any needed procedures for the submission of evidence in 
written form;
    (ii) Examine witnesses at the hearing;
    (iii) Convene, recess, adjourn or otherwise regulate the course of 
the hearing; and
    (iv) Take any other action authorized by or consistent with the 
provisions of this part and permitted by law that may expedite the 
hearing or aid in the disposition of the proceeding.
    (8) Parties may appear and be heard on their own behalf or through 
designated representatives. Parties may offer relevant evidence 
including testimony and may conduct such examination of witnesses as may 
be required for a full disclosure of the relevant facts.
    (9) The record in the proceeding shall be closed at conclusion of 
the hearing unless the presiding officer allows additional time for the 
submission of information. In such instances the record shall be left 
open for such time as the presiding officer grants for that purpose.
    (10) No later than 10 days after the close of the record, a railroad 
official, other than the investigating officer, shall prepare and sign a 
written decision in the proceeding.
    (11) The decision shall:
    (i) Contain the findings of fact as well as the basis therefor, 
concerning all material issues of fact presented on the record; and
    (ii) Be served on the employee.
    (12) The railroad shall have the burden of proving that the 
locomotive engineer's conduct was not in compliance with the applicable 
railroad operating rule or practice or part 219 of this chapter.
    (d) A hearing required by this section which is conducted in a 
manner that conforms procedurally to the applicable collective 
bargaining agreement shall be deemed to satisfy the procedural 
requirements of this section.
    (e) A hearing required under this section may be consolidated with 
any disciplinary or other hearing arising from the same facts, but in 
all instances a railroad official, other than the investigating officer, 
shall make separate findings as to the revocation required under this 
section.

[[Page 843]]

    (f) A person may waive the right to the hearing provided under this 
section. That waiver shall:
    (1) Be made in writing;
    (2) Reflect the fact that the person has knowledge and understanding 
of these rights and voluntarily surrenders them; and
    (3) Be signed by the person making the waiver.
    (g) A railroad that has relied on the certification by another 
railroad under the provisions of Sec. 240.227 or Sec. 240.229, shall 
revoke its certification if, during the period that certification is 
valid, the railroad acquires information which convinces it that another 
railroad has revoked its certification after determining, in accordance 
with the provisions of this section, that the person no longer meets the 
qualification requirements of this part. The requirement to provide a 
hearing under this section is satisfied when any single railroad holds a 
hearing and no additional hearing is required prior to a revocation by 
more than one railroad arising from the same facts.
    (h) The period of certificate suspension prior to the commencement 
of a hearing required under this section shall be credited towards 
satisfying any applicable revocation period imposed in accordance with 
the provisions of Sec. 240.117.
    (i) A railroad:
    (1) Shall not determine that the person failed to meet the 
qualification requirements of this part and shall not revoke the 
person's certification as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section 
if sufficient evidence exists to establish that an intervening cause 
prevented or materially impaired the locomotive engineer's ability to 
comply with the railroad operating rule or practice which constitutes a 
violation under Sec. 240.117(e)(1) through (e)(5) of this part; or
    (2) May determine that the person meets the qualification 
requirements of this part and decide not to revoke the person's 
certification as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section if 
sufficient evidence exists to establish that the violation of Sec. 
240.117(e)(1) through (e)(5) of this part was of a minimal nature and 
had no direct or potential effect on rail safety.
    (j) The railroad shall place the relevant information in the records 
maintained in compliance with Sec. 240.309 for Class I (including the 
National Railroad Passenger Corporation) and Class II railroads, and 
Sec. 240.15 for Class III railroads if sufficient evidence meeting the 
criteria provided in paragraph (i) of this section, becomes available 
either:
    (1) Prior to a railroad's action to suspend the certificate as 
provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; or
    (2) Prior to the convening of the hearing provided for in this 
section;
    (k) Provided that the railroad makes a good faith determination 
after a reasonable inquiry that the course of conduct provided for in 
paragraph (i) of this section is appropriate, the railroad which does 
not suspend a locomotive engineer's certification, as provided for in 
paragraph (a) of this section, is not in violation of paragraph (a) of 
this section.

railroad shall conduct a formal annual review and analysis concerning 
the administration of its program for responding to detected instances 
of poor safety conduct by certified locomotive engineers during the 
prior calendar year.
    (b) Each review and analysis shall involve:
    (1) The number and nature of the instances of detected poor safety 
conduct including the nature of the remedial action taken in response 
thereto;
    (2) The number and nature of FRA reported train accidents attributed 
to poor safety performance by locomotive engineers;
    (3) The number and type of operational monitoring test failures and 
observations of inadequate skill performance recorded by supervisors of 
locomotive engineers; and
    (4) If it conducts joint operations with another railroad, the 
number of

disabled safety device in the controlling locomotive;
    (9) Incidents involving noncompliance with the railroad's operating 
practices (including train handling procedures) resulting in excessive 
in-train force levels; and
    (f) For reporting purposes each category of detected poor safety 
conduct identified in paragraph (d) of this section shall be capable of

[[Page 847]]


<R05>
Sec. 240.409  Hearings.

    (a) An administrative hearing for a locomotive engineer 
qualification petition shall be conducted by a presiding officer, who 
can be any person authorized by the Administrator, including an 
administrative law judge.
    (b) The presiding officer may exercise the powers of the 
Administrator to regulate the conduct of the hearing for the purpose of 
achieving a prompt and fair determination of all material issues in 
controversy.
    (c) The presiding officer shall convene and preside over the 
hearing. The hearing shall be a de novo hearing to find the relevant 
facts and determine the correct application of this part to those facts. 
The presiding officer may determine that there is no genuine issue 
covering some or all material facts and limit evidentiary proceedings to 
any issues of material fact as to which there is a genuine dispute.
    (d) The presiding officer may authorize discovery of the types and 
quantities which in the presiding officer's discretion will contribute 
to a fair hearing without unduly burdening the parties. The presiding 
officer may impose appropriate non-monetary sanctions, including 
limitations as to the presentation of evidence and issues, for any 
party's willful failure or refusal to comply with approved discovery 
requests.
    (e) Every petition, motion, response, or other authorized or 
required document shall be signed by the party filing the same, or by a 
duly authorized officer or representative of record, or by any other 
person. If signed by such other person, the reason therefor must be 
stated and the power of attorney or other authority authorizing such 
other person to subscribe the document must be filed with the document. 
The signature of the person subscribing any document constitutes a 
certification that he or she has read the document; that to the best of 
his or her knowledge, information and belief every statement contained 
in the document is true and no such statements are misleading; and that 
it is not interposed for delay or to be vexatious.
    (f) After the request for a hearing is filed, all documents filed or 
served upon one party must be served upon all parties. Each party may 
designate a person upon whom service is to be made when not specified by 
law, regulation, or directive of the presiding officer. If a party does 
not designate a person upon whom service is to be made, then service may 
be made upon any person having subscribed to a submission of the party 
being served, unless otherwise specified by law, regulation, or 
directive of the presiding officer. Proof of service shall accompany all 
documents when they are tendered for filing.
    (g) If any document initiating, filed, or served in, a proceeding is 
not in substantial compliance with the applicable law, regulation, or 
directive of the presiding officer, the presiding officer may strike or 
dismiss all or part of such document, or require its amendment.
    (h) Any party to a proceeding may appear and be heard in person or 
by an authorized representative.
    (i) Any person testifying at a hearing or deposition may be 
accompanied, represented, and advised by an attorney or other 
representative, and may be examined by that person.
    (j) Any party may request to consolidate or separate the hearing of 
two or more petitions by motion to the presiding officer, when they 
arise from the same or similar facts or when the matters are for any 
reason deemed more efficiently heard together.
    (k) Except as provided in Sec. 240.407(c) of this part and 
paragraph (u)(4) of this section, whenever a party has the right or is 
required to take action within a period prescribed by this part, or by 
law, regulation, or directive of the presiding officer, the presiding 
officer may extend such period, with or without notice, for good cause, 
provided another party is not substantially prejudiced by such 
extension. A request to extend a period which has already expired may be 
denied as untimely.
    (l) An application to the presiding officer for an order or ruling 
not otherwise specifically provided for in this part shall be by motion. 
The motion shall be filed with the presiding officer and, if written, 
served upon all parties. All motions, unless made during the hearing, 
shall be written. Motions made during hearings may be made

[[Page 848]]

orally on the record, except that the presiding officer may direct that 
any oral motion be reduced to writing. Any motion shall state with 
particularity the grounds therefor and the relief or order sought, and 
shall be accompanied by any affidavits or other evidence desired to be 
relied upon which is not already part of the record. Any matter 
submitted in response to a written motion must be filed and served 
within fourteen (14) days of the motion, or within such other period as 
directed by the presiding officer.
    (m) Testimony by witnesses at the hearing shall be given under oath 
and the hearing shall be recorded verbatim. The presiding officer shall 
give the parties to the proceeding adequate opportunity during the 
course of the hearing for the presentation of arguments in support of or 
in opposition to motions, and objections and exceptions to rulings of 
the presiding officer. The presiding officer may permit oral argument on 
any issues for which the presiding officer deems it appropriate and 
beneficial. Any evidence or argument received or proffered orally shall 
be transcribed and made a part of the record. Any physical evidence or 
written argument received or proffered shall be made a part of the 
record, except that the presiding officer may authorize the substitution 
of copies, photographs, or descriptions, when deemed to be appropriate.
    (n) The presiding officer shall employ the Federal Rules of Evidence 
for United States Courts and Magistrates as general guidelines for the 
introduction of evidence. Notwithstanding paragraph (m) of this section, 
all relevant and probative evidence shall be received unless the 
presiding officer determines the evidence to be unduly repetitive or so 
extensive and lacking in relevancy that its admission would impair the 
prompt, orderly, and fair resolution of the proceeding.
    (o) The presiding officer may:
    (1) Administer oaths and affirmations;
    (2) Issue subpoenas as provided for in Sec. 209.7 of part 209 in 
this chapter;
    (3) Adopt any needed procedures for the submission of evidence in 
written form;
    (4) Examine witnesses at the hearing;
    (5) Convene, recess, adjourn or otherwise regulate the course of the 
hearing; and
    (6) Take any other action authorized by or consistent with the 
provisions of this part and permitted by law that may expedite the 
hearing or aid in the disposition of the proceeding.
    (p) The petitioner before the Locomotive Engineer Review Board, the 
railroad involved in taking the certification action, and FRA shall be 
parties at the hearing. All parties may participate in the hearing and 
may appear and be heard on their own behalf or through designated 
representatives. All parties may offer relevant evidence, including 
testimony, and may conduct such cross-examination of witnesses as may be 
required to make a record of the relevant facts.
    (q) The party requesting the administrative hearing shall be the 
``hearing petitioner.'' The hearing petitioner shall have the burden of 
proving its case by a preponderance of the evidence. Hence, if the 
hearing petitioner is the railroad involved in taking the certification 
action, that railroad will have the burden of proving that its decision 
to deny certification, deny recertification, or revoke certification was 
correct. Conversely, if the petitioner before the Locomotive Engineer 
Review Board is the hearing petitioner, that person will have the burden 
of proving that the railroad's decision to deny certification, deny 
recertification, or revoke certification was incorrect. Between the 
petitioner before the Locomotive Engineer Review Board and the railroad 
involved in taking the certification action, the party who is not the 
hearing petitioner will be a respondent.
    (r) FRA will be a mandatory party to the administrative hearing. At 
the start of each proceeding, FRA will be a respondent.
    (s) The record in the proceeding shall be closed at the conclusion 
of the evidentiary hearing unless the presiding officer allows 
additional time for the submission of additional evidence. In such 
instances the record shall be left open for such time as the presiding 
officer grants for that purpose.

[[Page 849]]

    (t) At the close of the record, the presiding officer shall prepare 
a written decision in the proceeding.
    (u) The decision:
    (1) Shall contain the findings of fact and conclusions of law, as 
well as the basis for each concerning all material issues of fact or law 
presented on the record;
    (2) Shall be served on the hearing petitioner and all other parties 
to the proceeding;
    (3) Shall not become final for 35 days after issuance;
    (4) Constitutes final agency action unless an aggrieved party files 
an appeal within 35 days after issuance; and
    (5) Is not precedential.

[60 FR 53137, Oct. 12, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 240.411  Appeals.

    (a) Any party aggrieved by the presiding officer's decision may file 
an appeal. The appeal must be filed within 35 days of issuance of the 
decision with the Federal Railroad Administrator, 400 Seventh Street 
SW., Washington, DC 20590. A copy of the appeal shall be served on each 
party. The appeal shall set forth objections to the presiding officer's 
decision, supported by reference to applicable laws and regulations and 
with specific reference to the record. If no appeal is timely filed, the 
presiding officer's decision constitutes final agency action.
    (b) A party may file a reply to the appeal within 25 days of service 
of the appeal. The reply shall be supported by reference to applicable 
laws and regulations and with specific reference to the record, if the 
party relies on evidence contained in the record.
    (c) The Administrator may extend the period for filing an appeal or 
a response for good cause shown, provided that the written request for 
extension is served before expiration of the applicable period provided 
in this section.
    (d) The Administrator has sole discretion to permit oral argument on 
the appeal. On the Administrator's own initiative or written motion by 
any party, the Administrator may grant the parties an opportunity for 
oral argument.
    (e) The Administrator may remand, vacate, affirm, reverse, alter or 
modify the decision of the presiding officer and the Administrator's 
decision constitutes final agency action except where the terms of the 
Administrator's decision (for example, remanding a case to the presiding 
officer) show that the parties' administrative remedies have not been 
exhausted.
    (f) Where a party files an appeal from a Locomotive Engineer Review 
Board decision pursuant to Sec. 240.403(e), the Administrator may 
affirm or vacate the Board's decision, and may remand the petition to 
the Board for further proceedings. An Administrator's decision to affirm 
the Board's decision constitutes final agency action.

 Sec. Appendix B to Part 240--Procedures for Submission and Approval of 

               Locomotive Engineer Qualification Programs

    This appendix establishes procedures for the submission and approval 
of a railroad's program concerning the training, testing, and evaluating 
of persons seeking certification or recertification as a locomotive 
engineer in accordance with the requirements of this part (see 
Sec. Sec. 240.101, 240.103, 240.105, 240.107, 240.123, 240.125, 240.127 
and 240.129). lt also contains guidance on how FRA will exercise its 
review and approval responsibilities.

                        Submission by a Railroad

    As provided for in Sec. 240.101, each railroad must have a program 
for determining the qualifications of each person it permits or requires 
to operate a locomotive. In designing its program a railroad must take 
into account the trackage and terrain over which it operates, the 
system(s) for train control that are employed, the operational design 
characteristics of the track and equipment being operated including 
train length, train makeup, and train speeds. Each railroad must submit 
its individual program to FRA for approval as provided for in Sec. 
240.103. Each program must be accompanied by a request for approval 
organized in accordance with this appendix. Requests for approval must 
contain appropriate references to the relevant portion of the program 
being discussed. Requests should be submitted in writing on standard 
sized paper (8-1/2x11) and can be in letter or narrative format. The 
railroad's submission shall be sent to the Associate Administrator for 
Safety, FRA. The mailing address for FRA is 400 Seventh Street, SW., 
Washington, DC 20590.

                     Organization of the Submission

    Each request should be organized to present the required information 
in the following standardized manner. Each section must begin by giving 
the name, title, telephone number, and mailing address of the person to 
be contacted concerning the matters addressed by that section. If a 
person is identified in a prior section, it is sufficient to merely 
repeat the person's name in a subsequent section.

     Section 1 of the Submission: General Information and Elections

    The first section of the request must contain the name of the 
railroad, the person to be contacted concerning the request (including 
the person's name, title, telephone number, and mailing address) and a 
statement electing either to accept responsibility for educating 
previously untrained persons to be qualified locomotive engineers or 
recertify only engineers previously certified by other railroads (see 
Sec. 240.103(b)).
    If a railroad elects not to conduct the training of persons not 
previously trained to be a locomotive engineer, the railroad is not 
obligated to submit information on how the previously untrained will be 
trained. A railroad that makes this election will be limited to 
recertifying persons initially certified by another railroad. A railroad 
that initially elects not to accept responsibility for training its own 
locomotive engineers can rescind its initial election by obtaining FRA 
approval of a modification of its program (see Sec. 240.103(e)).
    If a railroad elects to accept responsibility for conducting the 
education of persons not previously trained to be locomotive engineers, 
the railroad is obligated to submit information on how such persons will 
be trained but has no duty to actually conduct such training. A railroad 
that elects to accept the responsibility for the training of such 
persons may authorize another railroad or a non-railroad entity to 
perform the actual training effort. The electing railroad remains 
responsible for assuring that such other training providers adhere to 
the training program the railroad submits.

[[Page 853]]

    This section must also state which class or classes of service the 
railroad will employ. (See Sec. 240.107).

  Section 2 of the Submission: Selection of Supervisors of Locomotive 
                                Engineers

    The second section of the request must contain information 
concerning the railroad's procedure for selecting the person or persons 
it will rely on to evaluate the knowledge, skill, and ability of persons 
seeking certification or recertification. As provided for in Sec. 
240.105 each railroad must have a procedure for selecting supervisors of 
locomotive engineers which assures that persons so designated can 
appropriately test and evaluate the knowledge, skill, and ability of 
individuals seeking certification or recertification.
    Section 240.105 provides a railroad latitude to select the criteria 
and evaluation methodology it will rely on to determine which person or 
persons have the required capacity to perform as a supervisor of 
locomotive engineers. The railroad must describe in this section how it 
will use that latitude and evaluate those it designates as supervisors 
of locomotive engineers so as to comply with the performance standard 
set forth in Sec. 240.105(b). The railroad must identify, in sufficient 
detail to permit effective review by FRA, the criteria for evaluation it 
has selected. For example, if a railroad intends to rely on one or more 
of the following, a minimum level of prior experience as an engineer, 
successful completion of a course of study, or successful passage of a 
standardized testing program, the submission must state which criteria 
it will employ.

   Section 3 of the Submission: Training Persons Previously Certified

    The third section of the request must contain information concerning 
the railroad's program for training previously certified locomotive 
engineers. As provided for in Sec. 240.123(b) each railroad must have a 
program for the ongoing education of its locomotive engineers to assure 
that they maintain the necessary knowledge concerning personal safety, 
operating rules and practices, mechanical condition of equipment, 
methods of safe train handling (including familiarity with physical 
characteristics), and relevant Federal safety rules.
    Section 240.123(b) provides a railroad latitude to select the 
specific subject matter to be covered, duration of the training, method 
of presenting the information, and the frequency with which the training 
will be provided. The railroad must describe in this section how it will 
use that latitude to assure that its engineers remain knowledgeable 
concerning the safe discharge of their train operation responsibilities 
so as to comply with the performance standard set forth in Sec. 
240.123(b). This section must contain sufficient detail to permit 
effective evaluation of the railroad's training program in terms of the 
subject matter covered, the frequency and duration of the training 
sessions, the training environment employed (for example, and use of 
classroom, use of computer based training, use of simulators, use of 
film or slide presentations, use of on-job-training) and which aspects 
of the program are voluntary or mandatory.
    Safe train handling involves both abstract knowledge about the 
appropriate use of engine controls and the application of that knowledge 
to trains of differing composition traversing varying terrain. Time and 
circumstances have the capacity to diminish both abstract knowledge and 
the proper application of that knowledge to discrete events. Time and 
circumstances also have the capacity to alter the value of previously 
obtained knowledge and the application of that knowledge. In formulating 
how it will use the discretion being afforded, each railroad must design 
its program to address both loss of retention of knowledge and changed 
circumstances, and this section of the submission to FRA must address 
these matters.
    For example, locomotive engineers need to have their fundamental 
knowledge of train operations refreshed periodically. Each railroad 
needs to advise FRA how that need is satisfied in terms of the interval 
between attendance at such training, the nature of the training being 
provided, and methods for conducting the training. A matter of 
particular concern to FRA is how each railroad acts to assure that 
engineers remain knowledgeable about safe train handling procedures if 
the territory over which a locomotive engineer is authorized to operate 
is territory from which the engineer has been absent. The railroad must 
have a plan for the familiarization training that addresses the question 
of how long a person can be absent before needing more education and, 
once that threshold is reached, how the person will acquire the needed 
education. Similarly, the program must address how the railroad responds 
to changes such as the introduction of new technology, new operating 
rule books, or significant changes in operations including alteration in 
the territory engineers are authorized to operate over.

 Section 4 of the Submission: Testing and Evaluating Persons Previously 
                                Certified

    The fourth section of the request must contain information 
concerning the railroad's program for testing and evaluating previously 
certified locomotive engineers. As provided for in Sec. 240.125 and 
Sec. 240.127, each railroad must have a program for the ongoing testing 
and evaluating of its locomotive

[[Page 854]]

engineers to assure that they have the necessary knowledge and skills 
concerning personal safety, operating rules and practices, mechanical 
condition of equipment, methods of safe train handling (including 
familiarity with physical characteristics), and relevant Federal safety 
rules. Similarly, each railroad must have a program for ongoing testing 
and evaluating to assure that its locomotive engineers have the 
necessary vision and hearing acuity as provided for in Sec. 240.121.
    Sections 240.125 and 240.127 require that a railroad rely on written 
procedures for determining that each person can demonstrate his or her 
knowledge of the railroad's rules and practices and skill at applying 
those rules and practices for the safe operation of a locomotive or 
train. Section 240.125 directs that, when seeking a demonstration of the 
person's knowledge, a railroad must employ a written test that contains 
objective questions and answers and covers the following subject 
matters: (i) Personal safety practices; (ii) operating practices; (iii) 
equipment inspection practices; (iv) train handling practices (including 
familiarity with the physical characteristics of the territory); and (v) 
compliance with relevant Federal safety rules. The test must accurately 
measure the person's knowledge of all of these areas.
    Section 240.125 provides a railroad latitude in selecting the design 
of its own testing policies (including the number of questions each test 
will contain, how each required subject matter will be covered, 
weighting (if any) to be given to particular subject matter responses, 
selection of passing scores, and the manner of presenting the test 
information). The railroad must describe in this section how it will use 
that latitude to assure that its engineers will demonstrate their 
knowledge concerning the safe discharge of their train operation 
responsibilities so as to comply with the performance standard set forth 
in Sec. 240.125.
    Section 240.127 directs that, when seeking a demonstration of the 
person's skill, a railroad must employ a test and evaluation procedure 
conducted by a designated supervisor of locomotive engineers that 
contains an objective evaluation of the person's skills at applying the 
railroad's rules and practices for the safe operation of trains. The 
test and evaluation procedure must examine the person's skills in terms 
of all of the following subject matters: (i) Operating practices; (ii) 
equipment inspection practices; (iii) train handling practices 
(including familiarity with the physical characteristics of the 
territory); and (iv) compliance with relevant Federal safety rules. The 
test must be sufficient to effectively examine the person's skills while 
operating a train in the most demanding type of service which the person 
is likely to encounter in the normal course of events once he or she is 
deemed qualified.
    Section 240.127 provides a railroad latitude in selecting the design 
of its own testing and evaluation procedures (including the duration of 
the evaluation process, how each required subject matter will be 
covered, weighing (if any) to be given to particular subject matter 
response, selection of passing scores, and the manner of presenting the 
test information). The section should provide information concerning the 
procedures which the railroad will follow that achieve the objectives 
described in FRA's recommended practices (see appendix E) for conducting 
skill performance testing. The section also gives a railroad the 
latitude to employ either a Type 1 or a Type 2 simulator (properly 
programmed) to conduct the test and evaluation procedure. A railroad 
must describe in this section how it will use that latitude to assure 
that its engineers will demonstrate their skills concerning the safe 
discharge of their train operation responsibilities so as to comply with 
the performance standard set forth in Sec. 240.127.
    Section 240.121 provides a railroad latitude to rely on the 
professional medical opinion of the railroad's medical examiner 
concerning the ability of a person with substandard acuity to safely 
operate a locomotive. The railroad must describe in this section how it 
will assure that its medical examiner has sufficient information 
concerning the railroad's operations to effectively form appropriate 
conclusions about the ability of a particular individual to safely 
operate a train.

 Section 5 of the Submission: Training, Testing, and Evaluating Persons 
                        Not Previously Certified

    Unless a railroad has made an election not to accept responsibility 
for conducting the initial training of persons to be locomotive 
engineers, the fifth section of the request must contain information 
concerning the railroad's program for educating, testing, and evaluating 
persons not previously trained as locomotive engineers. As provided for 
in Sec. 240.123(c), a railroad that is issuing an initial certification 
to a person to be a locomotive engineer must have a program for the 
training, testing, and evaluating of its locomotive engineers to assure 
that they acquire the necessary knowledge and skills concerning personal 
safety, operating rules and practices, mechanical condition of 
equipment, methods of safe train handling (including familiarity with 
physical characteristics), and relevant Federal safety rules.
    Section 240.123 establishes a performance standard and gives a 
railroad latitude in selecting how it will meet that standard. A 
railroad must describe in this section how it will use that latitude to 
assure that its engineers will acquire sufficient knowledge and skill 
and demonstrate their knowledge and

[[Page 855]]

skills concerning the safe discharge of their train operation 
responsibilities. This section must contain the same level of detail 
concerning initial training programs as that described for each of the 
components of the overall program contained in sections 2 through 4 of 
this appendix. A railroad that plans to accept responsibility for the 
initial training of locomotive engineers may authorize another railroad 
or a non-railroad entity to perform the actual training effort. The 
authorizing railroad may submit a training program developed by that 
authorized trainer but the authorizing railroad remains responsible for 
assuring that such other training providers adhere to the training 
program submitted. Railroads that elect to rely on other entities, to 
conduct training away from the railroad's own trackage, must indicate 
how the student will be provided with the required familiarization with 
the physical characteristics for its trackage.

   Section 6 of the Submission: Monitoring Operational Performance by 
                           Certified Engineers

    The final section of the request must contain information concerning 
the railroad's program for monitoring the operation of its certified 
locomotive engineers. As provided for in Sec. 240.129, each railroad 
must have a program for the ongoing monitoring of its locomotive 
engineers to assure that they operate their locomotives in conformity 
with the railroad's operating rules and practices including methods of 
safe train handling and relevant Federal safety rules.
    Section 240.129 requires that a railroad annually observe each 
locomotive engineer demonstrating his or her knowledge of the railroad's 
rules and practices and skill at applying those rules and practices for 
the safe operation of a locomotive or train. Section 240.129 directs 
that the observation be conducted by a designated supervisor of 
locomotive engineers but provides a railroad latitude in selecting the 
design of its own observation procedures (including the duration of the 
observation process, reliance on tapes that record the specifics of 
train operation, and the specific aspects of the engineer's performance 
to be covered). The section also gives a railroad the latitude to employ 
either a Type 1 or a Type 2 simulator (properly programmed) to conduct 
monitoring observations. A railroad must describe in this section how it 
will use that latitude to assure that the railroad is monitoring that 
its engineers demonstrate their skills concerning the safe discharge of 
their train operation responsibilities. A railroad that intends to 
employ train operation event recorder tapes to comply with this 
monitoring requirement shall indicate in this section how it anticipates 
determining what person was at the controls and what signal indications 
or other operational constraints, if any, were applicable to the train's 
movement.

 Section 7 of the Submission: Procedures for Routine Administration of 
                   the Engineer Certification Program

    The final section of the request must contain a summary of how the 
railroad's program and procedures will implement the various specific 
aspects of the regulatory provisions that relate to routine 
administration of its certification program for locomotive engineers. At 
a minimum this section needs to address the procedural aspects of the 
rule's provisions identified in the following paragraph.
    Section 240.109 provides that each railroad must have procedures for 
review and comment on adverse prior safety conduct, but allows the 
railroad to devise its own system within generalized parameters. 
Sections 240.115, 240.117 and 240.119 require a railroad to have 
procedures for evaluating data concerning prior safety conduct as a 
motor vehicle operator and as railroad workers, yet leave selection of 
many details to the railroad. Sections 240.203, 240.217, and 240.219 
place a duty on the railroad to make a series of determinations but 
allow the railroad to select what procedures it will employ to assure 
that all of the necessary determinations have been made in a timely 
fashion; who will be authorized to conclude that person is or is not 
qualified; and how it will communicate adverse decisions. Documentation 
of the factual basis the railroad relied on in making determinations 
under Sec. Sec. 240.205, 240.207, 240.209, 240.211, and 240.213 is 
required, but these sections permit the railroad to select the 
procedures it will employ to accomplish compliance with these 
provisions. Sections 240.225 and 240.227 permit reliance on 
qualification determinations made by other entities and permit a 
railroad latitude in selecting the procedures it will employ to assure 
compliance with these provisions. Similarly, Sec. 240.229 permits use 
of railroad selected procedures to meet the requirements for 
certification of engineers performing service in joint operations 
territory. Sections 240.301 and 240.307 allow a railroad a certain 
degree of discretion in complying with the requirements for replacing 
lost certificates or the conduct of certification revocation 
proceedings.
    This section of the request should outline in summary fashion the 
manner in which the railroad will implement its program so as to comply 
with the specific aspects of each of the rule's provisions described in 
preceding paragraph.

                               FRA Review

    The submissions made in conformity with this appendix will be deemed 
approved within 30 days after the required filing date or

[[Page 856]]

the actual filing date whichever is later. No formal approval document 
will be issued by FRA. The brief interval for review reflects FRA's 
judgment that railroads generally already have existing programs that 
will meet the requirements of this part. FRA has taken the 
responsibility for notifying a railroad when it detects problems with 
the railroad's program. FRA retains the right to disapprove a program 
that has obtained approval due to the passage of time as provided for in 
section Sec. 240.103.
    FRA initially proposed specifying the details for most aspects of 
the programs being submitted under this appendix. The proposed rule 
contained a distillation of the essential elements of pre-existing 
training, testing, evaluating, and monitoring programs that appear to 
result in railroads having locomotive engineers who operate locomotives 
and trains safely. The proposal contained very specific details for each 
aspect of the program that appeared to contribute to that result. Those 
details included such things as the duration of classes intended to 
teach operating rules as well as the interval and methodology for 
acquiring familiarization with physical characteristics of an engineer's 
operational territory. Railroads commenting on the proposed rule did not 
question the validity of the FRA's views concerning the essential 
elements of an effective program but did convince FRA that they should 
be given more discretion to formulate the design of their individual 
programs.
    Rather than establish rigid requirements for each element of the 
program as initially proposed, FRA has given railroads discretion to 
select the design of their individual programs within a specified 
context for each element. The proposed rule, however, provides a good 
guide to the considerations that should be addressed in designing a 
program that will meet the performance standards of this final rule. In 
reviewing program submissions, FRA will focus on the degree to which a 
particular program deviates from the norms identified in its proposed 
rule. To the degree that a particular program submission materially 
deviates from the norms set out in its proposed rule which was published 
in the Federal Register on December 11, 1989 (54 FR 50890), FRA's review 
and approval process will be focused on determining the validity of the 
reasoning relied on by a railroad for selecting its alternative approach 
and the degree to which the alternative approach is likely to be 
effective in producing locomotive engineers who have the knowledge, 
skill, and ability to safely operate trains.

  Sec. Appendix C to Part 240--Procedures for Obtaining and Evaluating 

                    Motor Vehicle Driving Record Data

    The purpose of this appendix is to outline the procedures available 
to individuals and railroads for complying with the requirements of 
section 4(a) of the Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 1988 and 
Sec. Sec. 240.109, 240.111 and 240.205 of this part. Those provisions 
require that railroads consider the motor vehicle driving record of each 
person prior to issuing him or her certification or recertification as a 
qualified locomotive engineer.
    To fulfill that obligation, a railroad must review a certification 
candidate's recent motor vehicle driving record. Generally, that will be 
a single record on file with the state agency that issued the 
candidate's current license. However, it can include multiple records if 
the candidate has been issued a motor vehicle driving license by more 
than one state agency. In addition, the railroad must determine whether 
the certification candidate is listed in the National Driver Register 
and, if so listed, to review the data that caused the candidate to be so 
listed.

            Access to State Motor Vehicle Driving Record Data

    The right of railroad workers, their employers, or prospective 
employers to have access to a state motor vehicle licensing agency's 
data concerning an individual's driving record is controlled by state 
law. Although many states have mechanisms through which employers and 
prospective employers such as railroads can obtain such data, there are 
some states in which privacy concerns make such access very difficult or 
impossible. Since individuals generally are entitled to obtain access to 
driving record data that will be relied on by a state motor vehicle 
licensing agency when that agency is taking action concerning their 
driving privileges, FRA places responsibility on individuals, who want 
to serve as locomotive engineers to request that their current state 
drivers licensing agency or agencies furnish such data directly to the 
railroad considering certifying them as a locomotive operator. Depending 
on the procedures adopted by a particular state agency, this will 
involve the candidate's either sending the state agency a brief letter 
requesting such action or executing a state agency form that 
accomplishes the same effect. It will normally involve payment of a 
nominal fee established by the state agency for such a records check. In 
rare instances, when a certification candidate has been issued multiple 
licenses, it may require more than a single request.

[[Page 857]]

                      The National Driver Register

    In addition to seeking an individual state's data, each engineer 
candidate is required to request that a search and retrieval be 
performed of any relevant information concerning his or her driving 
record contained in the National Driver Register. The National Driver 
Register (NDR) is a system of information created by Congress in 1960. 
In essence it is a nationwide repository of information on problem 
drivers that was created in an effort to protect motorists. It is a 
voluntary State/Federal cooperative program that assists motor vehicle 
driver licensing agencies in gaining access to data about actions taken 
by other state agencies concerning an individual's motor vehicle driving 
record. The NDR is designed to address the problem that occurs when 
chronic traffic law violators, after losing their license in one State 
travel to and receive licenses in another State. Currently the NDR is 
maintained by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) 
of the Department of Transportation under the provisions of the National 
Driver Register Act (23 U.S.C. 401 note). Under that statute, state 
motor vehicle licensing authorities voluntarily notify NHTSA when they 
take action to deny, suspend, revoke or cancel a person's motor vehicle 
driver's license and, under the provisions of a 1982 change to the 
statute, states are also authorized to notify NHTSA concerning 
convictions for operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence 
of, or impaired by, alcohol or a controlled substance, and for traffic 
violations arising in connection with a fatal traffic accident, reckless 
driving or racing on the highway even if these convictions do not result 
in an immediate loss of driving privileges.
    The information submitted to NHTSA contains, at a minimum, three 
specific pieces of data: the identification of the state authority 
providing the information, the name of the person whose license is being 
affected, and the date of birth of that person. It may be supplemented 
by data concerning the person's height, weight, color of eyes, and 
social security account number, if a State collects such data.

                           Access to NDR Data

    Essentially only individuals and state licensing agencies can obtain 
access to the NDR data. Since railroads have no direct access to the NDR 
data, FRA requires that individuals seeking certification as a 
locomotive engineer request that an NDR search be performed and direct 
that the results be furnished to the railroad. FRA requires that each 
person request the NDR information directly from NHTSA unless the 
prospective operator has a motor vehicle driver license issued by a 
state motor vehicle licensing agency that is ``participating'' under the 
provisions of the National Driver Register Act of 1982. Participating 
states can directly access the NDR data on behalf of the prospective 
engineer. The state agencies that currently are authorized to access NDR 
data in that manner are identified in appendix D of this regulation.

                Requesting NHTSA To Perform the NDR Check

    The procedures for requesting NHTSA performance of an NDR check are 
as follows:
    1. Each person shall submit a written request to National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration at the following address: Chief, National 
Driver Register, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 
Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.
    2. The request must contain:
    (a) The full legal name;
    (b) Any other names used by the person (e.g., nickname or 
professional name);
    (c) The date of birth;
    (d) Sex;
    (e) Height;
    (f) Weight;
    (g) Color of eyes;
    (h) Driver's license number (unless that is not available).
    3. The request must authorize NHTSA to perform the NDR check and to 
furnish the results of the search directly to the railroad.
    4. The request must identify the railroad to which the results are 
to be furnished, including the proper name of the railroad, and the 
proper mailing address of the railroad.
    5. The person seeking to become a certified locomotive engineer 
shall sign the request, and that signature must be notarized.
    FRA requires that the request be in writing and contain as much 
detail as is available to improve the reliability of the data search. 
Any person may supply additional information to that being mandated by 
FRA. Furnishing additional information, such as the person's Social 
Security account number, will help to more positively identify any 
records that may exist concerning the requester. Although no fee is 
charged for such NDR checks, a minimal cost may be incurred in having 
the request notarized. The requirement for notarization is designed to 
ensure that each person's right to privacy is being respected and that 
records are only being disclosed to legally authorized parties.

           Requesting a State Agency To Perform the NDR Check

    As discussed earlier in connection with obtaining data compiled by 
the state agency itself, a person can either write a letter to that 
agency asking for the NDR check or can use the agency's forms for making 
such a request. If a request is made by letter the individual must 
follow the same procedures required when directly seeking the data from 
NHTSA. At present there are only a limited

[[Page 858]]

number of state licensing agencies that have the capacity to make a 
direct NDR inquiry of this nature. It is anticipated that the number of 
states with such capability will increase in the near future; therefore, 
FRA will continue to update the identification of such states by 
revising appendix D to this regulation to identify such state agencies. 
Since it would be more efficient for a prospective locomotive engineer 
to make a single request for both aspects of the information required 
under this rule, FRA anticipates that state agency inquiry will 
eventually become the predominant method for making these NDR checks. 
Requests to state agencies may involve payment of a nominal fee 
established by the state agency for such a records check.
    State agencies normally will respond in approximately 30 days or 
less and advise whether there is or is not a listing for a person with 
that name and date of birth. If there is a potential match and the 
inquiry state was not responsible for causing that entry, the agency 
normally will indicate in writing the existence of a probable match and 
will identify the state licensing agency that suspended, revoked or 
canceled the relevant license or convicted the person of one of the 
violations referenced earlier in this appendix.

                Actions When a Probable NDR Match Occurs

    The response provided after performance of an NDR check is limited 
to either a notification that no potential record match was identified 
or a notification that a potential record match was identified. If the 
latter event occurs, the notification will include the identification of 
the state motor vehicle licensing authority which possesses the relevant 
record. If the NDR check results indicate a potential match and that the 
state with the relevant data is the same state which furnished detailed 
data (because it had issued the person a driving license), no further 
action is required to obtain additional data. If the NDR check results 
indicate a potential match and the state with the relevant data is 
different from the state which furnished detailed data, it then is 
necessary to contact the individual state motor vehicle licensing 
authority that furnished the NDR information to obtain the relevant 
record. FRA places responsibility on the railroad to notify the engineer 
candidate and on the candidate to contact the state with the relevant 
information. FRA requires the certification candidate to write to the 
state licensing agency and request that the agency inform the railroad 
concerning the person's driving record. If required by the state agency, 
the person may have to pay a nominal fee for providing such data and may 
have to furnish written evidence that the prospective operator consents 
to the release of the data to the railroad. FRA does not require that a 
railroad or a certification candidate go beyond these efforts to obtain 
the information in the control of such a state agency, and a railroad 
may act upon the pending certification without the data if an individual 
state agency fails or refuses to supply the records.
    If the non-issuing state licensing agency does provide the railroad 
with the available records, the railroad must verify that the record 
pertains to the person being considered for certification. It is 
necessary to perform this verification because in some instances only 
limited identification information is furnished for use in the NDR and 
this might result in data about a different person being supplied to the 
railroad. Among the available means for verifying that the additional 
state record pertains to the certification candidate are physical 
description, photographs and handwriting comparisons.
    Once the railroad has obtained the motor vehicle driving record 
which, depending on the circumstance, may consist of more than two 
documents, the railroad must afford the prospective engineer an 
opportunity to review that record and respond in writing to its contents 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 240.219. The review 
opportunity must occur before the railroad evaluates that record. The 
railroad's required evaluation and subsequent decision making must be 
done in compliance with the provisions of this part.


<R05>
   Sec. Appendix D to Part 240--Identification of State Agencies That 

                 Perform National Driver Register Checks

    Under the provisions of Sec. 240.111 of this part, each person 
seeking certification or recertification as a locomotive operator must 
request that a check of the National Driver Register (NDR) be conducted 
and that the resulting information be furnished to his or her employer 
or prospective employer. Under the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e) 
of Sec. 240.111, each person seeking certification or recertification 
as a locomotive engineer must request that National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration conduct the NDR check, unless he or she was issued 
a motor vehicle driver license by one of the state agencies identified 
in this appendix. If the certification candidate received a license from 
one of the designated state agencies, he or she must request the state 
agency to perform the NDR check. The state motor vehicle licensing 
agencies listed in this appendix participate in a program that 
authorizes these state agencies, in accordance with the National Driver 
Register Act of 1982, to obtain information from the NDR on behalf of 
individuals seeking data about themselves.

[[Page 859]]

Since these state agencies can more efficiently supply the desired data 
and, in some instances, can provide a higher quality of information, FRA 
requires that certification candidates make use of this method in 
preference to directly contacting NHTSA.
    Although the number of state agencies that participate in this 
manner is limited, FRA anticipates that an increasing number of states 
will do so in the future. This appendix will be revised periodically to 
reflect current participation in the program. As of December 31, 1989, 
the motor vehicle licensing agencies of the following states participate 
under the provisions of the 1982 changes to the NDR Act: North Dakota, 
Ohio, Virginia, and Washington.


<R05>
Sec. Appendix E to Part 240--Recommended Procedures for Conducting Skill 

                            Performance Tests

    FRA requires (see Sec. 240.127 and Sec. 240.211) that locomotive 
engineers be given a skill performance test prior to certification or 
recertification and establishes certain criteria for the conduct of that 
test. Railroads are given discretion concerning the manner in which to 
administer the required testing. FRA has afforded railroads this 
discretion to allow individual railroad companies latitude to tailor 
their testing procedures to the specific operational realities. This 
appendix contains FRA's recommendations for the administration of skill 
performance testing that occurs during operation of an actual train. It 
can be modified to serve in instances where a locomotive simulator is 
employed for testing purposes. These recommended practices, if followed, 
will ensure a more thorough and systematic assessment of locomotive 
engineer performance.

                   The Need for a Systematic Approach

    There are numerous criteria that should be monitored when a 
designated supervisor of locomotive engineers is observing a person to 
determine whether that individual should be certified or recertified as 
a qualified locomotive engineer. The details of those criteria will vary 
for the different classes of service, types of railroads, and terrain 
over which trains are being operated. At a minimum, the attention of a 
designated supervisor of locomotive engineers should concentrate on 
several general areas during any appraisal. Compliance with the 
railroad's operating rules, including its safety directives and train 
handling rules, and compliance with Federal regulations should be 
carefully monitored. But, in order to effectively evaluate employees, it 
is necessary to have something against which to compare their 
performance. In order to hold a locomotive engineer accountable for 
compliance, a railroad must have adequate operating, safety and train 
handling rules. Any railroad that fails to have adequate operating, 
safety, or train handling rules will experience difficulty in 
establishing an objective method of measuring an individual's skill 
level. Any railroad that requires the evaluation of an individual's 
performance relative to its train handling rules needs to have 
established preferred operating ranges for throttle use, brake 
application, and train speed. The absence of such criteria results in 
the lack of a meaningful yardstick for the designated supervisor of 
locomotive engineers to use in measuring the performance of locomotive 
engineers. It also is essential to have a definite standard so that the 
engineer and any reviewing body can know what the certification 
candidate is being measured against.
    Evaluating the performance of certain train operation skills will 
tend to occur in all situations. For example, it would be rare for a 
designated supervisor of locomotive engineers to observe any operator 
for a reasonable period of time and not have some opportunity to review 
that engineer's compliance with some basic safety rules, compliance with 
basic operating rules, and performance of a brake test. As the 
complexity of the operation increases, so does the number of items that 
the operator must comply with. Higher speeds, mountainous terrain, and 
various signal systems place increased emphasis on the need for operator 
compliance with more safety, operating, and train handling rules. 
Accounting for such variables in any universal monitoring scheme 
immediately results in a fairly complex system.
    FRA therefore recommends that designated supervisors of locomotive 
engineers employ a written aid to help record events and procedures that 
as a minimum should be observed for when conducting a skills performance 
test. FRA is providing the following information to assist railroads in 
developing such a written aid so as to ensure meaningful testing. When 
conducting a skills performance test, a designated supervisor of 
locomotive engineers should be alert to the following:

--Does the employee have the necessary books (Operating Rules, Safety 
Rules, Timetable, etc.)?
--Are predeparture inspections properly conducted (Radio, Air Brake 
Tests, Locomotive, etc.)?
--Does the employee comply with applicable safety rules?
--Does the employee read the bulletins, general orders, etc.?
--Enroute, does the employee:
    --Comply with applicable Federal Rules?
    --Monitor gauges?
    --Properly use the horn, whistle, headlight?
    --Couple to cars at a safe speed?

[[Page 860]]

    --Properly control in train slack and buff forces?
    --Properly use the train braking systems?
    --Comply with speed restrictions?
    --Display familiarity with the physical characteristics?
    --Comply with signal indications?
    --Respond properly to unusual conditions?
--At the conclusion of the trip, does the employee:
    --Apply a hand brake to the locomotives?
    --Properly report locomotive defects?

    Obviously, the less sophisticated the railroad's operations are, the 
fewer the number of identified practices that would be relevant. Hence, 
this list should modified accordingly.

            The Need for Objectivity, Use of Observation Form

    It is essential that railroads conduct the performance skills 
testing in the most objective manner possible, whether this testing is 
the locomotive engineer's initial qualification testing or periodic 
retesting. There will always be some potential for the subjective views, 
held by the designated supervisor of locomotive engineers conducting the 
testing, to enter into evaluations concerning the competency of a 
particular individual to handle the position of locomotive engineer. 
Steps can be taken, and need to be taken, to minimize the risk that 
personality factors adversely influence the testing procedure.
    One way to reduce the entry of subjective matters into the 
qualification procedures is through the use of a document that specifies 
those criteria that the designated supervisor of locomotive engineers is 
to place emphasis on. The use of an observation form will reduce but not 
eliminate subjectivity. Any skill performance test will contain some 
amount of subjectivity. While compliance with the operating rules or the 
safety rules is clear in most cases, with few opportunities for 
deviation, train handling offers many options with few absolute right 
answers. The fact that an engineer applies the train air brakes at one 
location rather than a few yards away does not necessarily indicate a 
failure but a question of judgment. The use of dynamic braking versus 
air brakes at a particular location may be a question of judgment unless 
the carrier has previously specified the use of a preferred braking 
method. In any case the engineer's judgment, to apply or not apply a 
braking system at a given location, is subject to the opinion of the 
designated supervisor of locomotive engineers.
    A railroad should attempt to reduce or eliminate such subjectivity 
through use of some type of observation or evaluation. For railroads 
developing any evaluation form, the areas of concern identified earlier 
will not be relevant in all instances. Railroads that do not have 
sophisticated operations would only need a short list of subjects. For 
example, most smaller railroads would not require line items pertaining 
to compliance with signal rule compliance or the use of dynamic brakes. 
Conversely, in all instances the observation forms should include the 
time and location that the observer started and ended the observation. 
FRA believes that there should be a minimum duration for all performance 
skills examinations. FRA allows railroads to select a duration 
appropriate for their individual circumstances, requiring only that the 
period be ``of sufficient length to effectively evaluate the person.'' 
In exercising its discretion FRA suggests that the minimums selected by 
a railroad be stated in terms of a distance since the examination has to 
be of a sufficient duration to adequately monitor the operator's skills 
in a variety of situations. FRA also suggests that the format for the 
observation form include a space for recording the observer's comments. 
Provision for comments ideally would allow for the inclusion of 
``constructive criticism'' without altering the import of the evaluation 
and would permit subjective comments where merited.

    (3) In administering any of these protocols, the person conducting 
the examination should be aware that railroad signals do not always 
occur in the same sequence and that ``yellow signals'' do not always 
appear to be the same. It is not acceptable to use ``yarn'' or other 
materials to conduct a simple test to determine whether the 
certification candidate has the requisite vision. No person shall be 
allowed to wear chromatic lenses during an initial test of the person's 
color vision; the initial test is one conducted in accordance with one 
of the accepted tests in the chart and Sec. 240.121(c)(3).
    (4) An examinee who fails to meet the criteria in the chart, may be 
further evaluated as determined by the railroad's medical examiner. 
Ophthalmologic referral, field testing, or other practical color testing 
may be utilized depending on the experience of the examinee. The 
railroad's medical examiner will review all pertinent information and, 
under some circumstances, may restrict an examinee who does not meet the 
criteria from operating the train at night, during adverse weather 
conditions or under other circumstances. The intent of Sec. 240.121(e) 
is not to provide an examinee with the right to make an infinite number 
of requests for further evaluation, but to provide an examinee with at 
least one opportunity to prove that a hearing or vision test failure 
does not mean the examinee cannot safely operate a locomotive or train. 
Appropriate further medical evaluation could include providing another 
approved scientific screening test or a field test. All railroads should 
retain the discretion to limit the number of retests that an examinee 
can request but any cap placed on the number of retests should not limit 
retesting when changed circumstances would make such retesting 
appropriate. Changed circumstances would most likely occur if the 
examinee's medical condition has improved in some way or if technology 
has advanced to the extent that it arguably could compensate for a 
hearing or vision deficiency.
    (5) Engineers who wear contact lenses should have good tolerance to 
the lenses and should be instructed to have a pair of corrective glasses 
available when on duty.

Sec. 241.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of this part is to prevent railroad accidents and 
incidents, and consequent injuries, deaths, and

[[Page 862]]

property damage, that would result from improper dispatching of railroad 
operations in the United States by individuals located outside of the 
United States.
    (b) This part prohibits extraterritorial dispatching of railroad 
operations, conducting railroad operations that are extraterritorially 
dispatched, and allowing track to be used for such operations, subject 
to certain stated exceptions. This part does not restrict a railroad 
from adopting and enforcing additional or more stringent requirements 
not inconsistent with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 241.3  Application and responsibility for compliance.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this part 
applies to all railroads.
    (b) This part does not apply to--
    (1) A railroad that operates only on track inside an installation 
that is not part of the general railroad system of transportation; or
    (2) Rapid transit operations in an urban area that are not connected 
to the general railroad system of transportation.
    (c) Although the duties imposed by this part are generally stated in 
terms of a duty of a railroad, each person, including a contractor for a 
railroad, who performs a function covered by this part, shall perform 
that function in accordance with this part.


<R05>

    As used in this part:
    Administrator means the Administrator of the Federal Railroad 
Administration or the Administrator's delegate.
    Dispatch means--
    (1) To perform a function that would be classified as a duty of a 
``dispatching service employee,'' as that term is defined by the hours 
of service laws at 49 U.S.C. 21101(2), if the function were to be 
performed in the United States. For example, to dispatch means, by the 
use of an electrical or mechanical device--
    (i) To control the movement of a train or other on-track equipment 
by the issuance of a written or verbal authority or permission affecting 
a railroad operation, or by establishing a route through the use of a 
railroad signal or train control system but not merely by aligning or 
realigning a switch; or
    (ii) To control the occupancy of a track by a roadway worker or 
stationary on-track equipment, or both; or
    (iii) To issue an authority for working limits to a roadway worker.
    (2) The term dispatch does not include the action of personnel in 
the field--
    (i) Effecting implementation of a written or verbal authority or 
permission affecting a railroad operation or an authority or permission 
affecting a railroad operation or an authority for working limits to a

authorizing a train to enter working limits); or
    (ii) Operating a function of a signal system designed for use by 
those personnel.
    Dispatcher means any individual who dispatches.
    Emergency means an unexpected and unforeseeable event or situation 
that affects a railroad's ability to use a dispatcher in the United 
States to dispatch a railroad operation in the United States and that, 
absent the railroad's use of an extraterritorial dispatcher to dispatch 
the railroad operation, would either materially disrupt rail service or 
pose a substantial safety hazard.
    Employee means an individual who is engaged or compensated by a 
railroad or by a contractor to a railroad to perform any of the duties 
defined in this part.
    Extraterritorial dispatcher means a dispatcher who, while located 
outside of the United States, dispatches a railroad operation that

operation that occurs on trackage in the United States by a dispatcher 
located outside of the United States.
    Fringe border dispatching means the act of extraterritorial 
dispatching a railroad operation that occurs on trackage in the United 
States immediately adjacent to the border between the United States and 
Canada or the

rail cars within a railroad yard for the purpose of making or breaking 
up trains.
    Occupancy of a track by a roadway worker or stationary on-track 
equipment or both refers to the physical presence of a roadway worker or 
stationary on-track equipment, or both, on a track for the purpose of 
making an inspection, repair, or another activity not associated with 
the movement of a train or other on-track equipment.
    Person means an entity of a type covered under 1 U.S.C. 1, including 
but not limited to the following: a railroad; a manager, supervisor, 
official, or other employee or agent of a railroad; an owner, 
manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, or 
facilities; an independent contractor providing goods or services to a 
railroad; and an employee of such owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee, 
or independent contractor.
    Railroad means any form of nonhighway ground transportation that 
runs on rails or electromagnetic guideways and any person providing such 
transportation, including--
    (1) Commuter or other short-haul railroad passenger service in a 
metropolitan or suburban area and commuter railroad service that was 
operated by the Consolidated Rail Corporation on January 1, 1979; and
    (2) High speed ground transportation systems that connect 
metropolitan areas, without regard to whether those systems use new 
technologies not associated with traditional railroads; but does not

subcontractor to a contractor to a railroad.
    Railroad operation means the movement of a train or other on-track 
equipment (other than on-track equipment used in a switching operation 
or where the operation is that of classifying and assembling rail cars 
within a railroad yard for the purpose of making or breaking up a 
train), or the activity that is the subject of an authority issued to a 
roadway worker for working limits.
    Roadway worker means any employee of a railroad, or of a contractor 
to a railroad, whose duties include inspection, construction, 
maintenance, or repair of railroad track, bridges, roadway, signal and 
communication systems, electric traction systems, roadway facilities, or 
roadway maintenance machinery on or near track or with the potential of 
fouling a track, and flagmen and watchmen/lookouts.
    State means a State of the United States of America or the District 
of Columbia.
    United States means all of the States.
    Working limits means a segment of track with definite boundaries 
established in accordance with part 214 of this chapter upon which 
trains and engines may move only as authorized by the roadway worker 
having control over that defined segment of track. Working limits may be 
established through ``exclusive track occupancy,'' ``inaccessible 
track,'' ``foul time,'' or ``train coordination'' as defined in part 214 
of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 241.7  Waivers.

    (a) General. (1) A person subject to a requirement of this part may 
petition the Administrator for a waiver of compliance with such 
requirement. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
filing of such a petition does not affect that person's responsibility 
for compliance with that requirement while the petition is being 
considered.
    (2) (i) Each petition for waiver under this section shall be filed 
in the manner and contain the information required by part 211 of this 
chapter.
    (ii) Petitions seeking approval to conduct fringe border operations 
shall

[[Page 864]]

also comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (iii) Petitioners not filing under paragraph (c) of this section 
should review the guidelines at 66 FR 63942 (Dec. 11, 2001), and frame 
their petitions to address the safety and security concerns articulated 
in the preamble, or contact the Office of the Chief Counsel, RCC-12, 
FRA, 1120 Vermont Avenue, NW., Stop 10, Washington, DC 20590, for a copy 
of the guidelines.
    (3) If the Administrator finds that a waiver of compliance is in the 
public interest and is consistent with railroad safety, the 
Administrator may grant the waiver subject to any conditions that the 
Administrator deems necessary.
    (b) Special dispensation for existing extraterritorial dispatching. 
(1) A railroad that files a waiver request seeking to continue 
extraterritorial dispatch of an operation that it has dispatched from 
Canada or Mexico pursuant to regulations contained in 49 CFR part 241, 
revised as of October 1, 2002, may continue extraterritorial dispatching 
of that operation until the railroad's waiver request is acted upon by 
FRA if the petition is filed no later than April 11, 2003.
    (2) If the waiver request is for an operation not listed in appendix 
A to this part, the waiver request must describe when the 
extraterritorial dispatching of the operation commenced and how the 
dispatching was authorized by regulations contained in 49 CFR part 241, 
revised as of October 1, 2002. FRA will notify the railroad if FRA 
determines that the operation was not permitted by the terms of those 
regulations.
    (c) Fringe border dispatching. (1) A waiver request to have a 
railroad employee located in Canada or in Mexico dispatch a railroad 
operation in the United States immediately adjacent to the border of the 
country in which the dispatcher conducts the dispatching will generally 
be approved by FRA, subject to any conditions imposed by FRA, if the 
waiver request meets all of the terms of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of 
this section. A proponent of a waiver request may seek relief from the 
terms of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section.
    (2) The railroad proposing to conduct the fringe border dispatching 
shall supply the following documents as part of the waiver request:
    (i) A description, by railroad division, applicable subdivision(s), 
and mileposts, of the line proposed to be dispatched;
    (ii) A copy of the operating rules of the railroad that would apply 
to the proposed fringe border dispatching, including hours of service 
limitations, and the railroad's program for testing the dispatchers in 
accordance with these operating rules and for ensuring that the 
dispatchers do not work in excess of the hours of service restrictions;
    (iii) A copy of the railroad's drug and alcohol abuse prevention 
program that applies to the fringe border dispatchers. The program 
shall, to the extent permitted by the laws of the country where the 
dispatching occurs, contain the following:
    (A) Preemployment drug testing;
    (B) A general prohibition on possession and use of alcohol and drugs 
while on duty;

dispatch center where the fringe border dispatching will take place;
    (v) The railroad's plans for complying with the requirements of 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and
    (vi) A verification from a government agency in the country where 
the dispatching will occur that the agency has safety jurisdiction over 
the railroad and the proposed dispatching, and that the railroad's 
safety programs referenced in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this 
section meet the safety requirements established by the agency or, in 
the absence of established safety requirements, that the programs are 
satisfactory to the agency.
    (3) Except as otherwise approved by FRA, fringe border dispatching 
must comply with the following requirements:

[[Page 865]]

    (i) The trackage in the United States being extraterritorially 
dispatched shall not exceed the following route miles, measured from the 
point that the trackage crosses the United States border:

<R05>
Sec. 241.9  Prohibition against extraterritorial dispatching; exceptions.

    (a) General. Except as provided in Sec. 241.7(d) and paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section, a railroad subject to this part shall not 
require or permit a dispatcher located outside the United States to 
dispatch a railroad operation that occurs in the United States if the 
dispatcher is employed by the railroad or by a contractor to the 
railroad.
    (b) Transitional period to continue existing extraterritorial 
dispatching. A railroad that has normally extraterritorially dispatched 
railroad track in the United States from Canada or Mexico pursuant to 
the regulations contained in 49 CFR part 241, revised as of October 1, 
2002, may continue extraterritorial dispatching of that railroad track 
until April 10, 2003, to permit the railroad an opportunity to file a 
waiver request pursuant to Sec. 241.7.
    (c) Emergencies. (1) In an emergency situation, a railroad may

States.

[[Page 866]]

    (b) Transitional period to continue existing extraterritorial 
dispatching. A railroad that has normally conducted, or contracted for 
the conduct of, a railroad operation in the United States that is 
extraterritorially dispatched pursuant to the regulations contained in 
49 CFR part 241, revised as of October 1, 2002, may continue to conduct 
or contract for the conduct of the operation until April 10, 2003, to 
permit the railroad an opportunity to file a waiver request pursuant to 
Sec. 241.7.
    (c) Emergencies. (1) In an emergency situation, a railroad may 
conduct, or contract for the conduct of, a railroad operation in the 
United States that is dispatched from a location outside the United 
States, provided that:
    (i) The dispatching railroad notifies the FRA Regional Administrator 
of each FRA region where the railroad operation was conducted, in 
writing as soon as practicable, of the emergency; and
    (ii) The extraterritorial dispatching is limited to the duration of

    (d) Liability. The Administrator may hold either the railroad that 
conducts the railroad operation or the railroad contractor that conducts 
the operation, or both, responsible for compliance with this section and 
subject to civil penalties under Sec. 241.15.


<R05>
Sec. 241.13  Prohibition against track owner's requiring or permitting use of 

its line for a railroad operation dispatched by an extraterritorial 

dispatcher; exceptions.

    (a) General. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, an owner of railroad track located in the United States shall 
not require or permit the track to be used for a railroad operation that

    (b) Transitional period to continue existing extraterritorial 
dispatching. An owner of a track segment located in the United States 
that is extraterritorially dispatched pursuant to the regulations 
contained in 49 CFR 241, revised as of October 1, 2002, may require or 
permit the track segment to be continued to be used for a railroad 
operation that is extraterritorially dispatched until April 10, 2003, to 
permit the railroad an opportunity to file a waiver request pursuant to 
Sec. 241.7.
    (c) Emergencies. In an emergency situation, an owner of railroad 
track located in the United States may require or permit the track to be 
used for a railroad operation that is dispatched from outside the United 
States, provided that:

responsible for compliance with this section and subject to civil 
penalties under Sec. 241.15. A common carrier by railroad that is 
directed by the Surface Transportation Board to provide service over the 
track in the United States of another railroad under 49 U.S.C. 11123 is 
considered the owner of that track for the purposes of the application 
of this section during the period that the directed service order 
remains in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 241.15  Penalties and other consequences for noncompliance.

    (a) Any person who violates any requirement of this part or causes 
the violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil penalty of 
at least $550 and not more than $16,000 per violation, except that: 
Penalties may be assessed against individuals only for willful 
violations, and, where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of 
repeated violations has created an imminent hazard of death or injury to 
persons, or has caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $27,000 
per violation may be assessed. Each day a violation continues shall 
constitute a separate offense.

[[Page 867]]

    (b) An individual who violates any requirement of this part or 
causes the violation of any such requirement may be subject to 
disqualification from safety-sensitive service in accordance with part 
209 of this chapter.
    (c) A person who knowingly and willfully falsifies a record or 
report required by this part may be subject to criminal penalties under 
49 U.S.C. 21311.

FR 51198, Sept. 6, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 241.17  Preemptive effect.

    Under 49 U.S.C. 20106, the regulations in this part preempt any 
State law, regulation, or order covering the same subject matter, except 
an additional or more stringent law, regulation, or order that is 
necessary to eliminate or reduce an essentially local safety hazard; is 
not incompatible with a law, regulation, or order of the United States 
Government; and does not impose an unreasonable burden on interstate 
commerce.


<R05>
Sec. 241.19  Information collection.

    (a) The information collection requirements of this part are being 
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).

<R05>
Sec. 244.1  Scope, application, and purpose.

    (a) This part prescribes requirements for filing and implementing a 
Safety Integration Plan with FRA whenever a Class I railroad proposes to 
consolidate with, merge with, or acquire control of another Class I 
railroad, or with a Class II railroad where there is a proposed 
amalgamation of operations.

[[Page 869]]

    (b) The purpose of this part is to achieve a reasonable level of 
railroad safety during the implementation of transactions described in 
paragraph (a) of this section. This part does not preclude a railroad 
from taking additional measures not inconsistent with this part to 
provide for safety in connection with a transaction.
    (c) The requirements prescribed under this part apply only to FRA's 
disposition of a regulated transaction filed by an applicant. The 
transactions covered by this part also require separate filing with and 
approval by the Surface Transportation Board. See 49 CFR part 1106.


<R05>
Sec. 244.3  Preemptive effect.

    Under 49 U.S.C. 20106, issuance of these regulations preempts any 
State law, regulation, or order covering the same subject matter, except 
an additional or more stringent law, regulation, or order that:
    (a) Is necessary to eliminate or reduce an essentially local safety 
hazard;
    (b) Is not incompatible with a law, regulation, or order of the 
United States Government; and
    (c) Does not unreasonably burden interstate commerce.


<R05>
Sec. 244.5  Penalties.

    (a) Any person who violates any requirement of this part or causes 
the violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil penalty of 
at least $550, but not more than $16,000 per day, except that: Penalties 
may be assessed against individuals only for willful violations, and, 
where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violations 
has created an imminent hazard of death or injury to persons, or has 
caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $27,000 per violation 
may be assessed. Each day a violation continues shall constitute a 
separate offense.
    (b) As specified in Sec. 244.21, FRA may also exercise any of its 
other enforcement remedies if a railroad fails to comply with Sec. 
244.21.
    (c) Any person who knowingly and willfully makes a false entry in a 
record or report required by this part shall be subject to criminal 
penalties under 49 U.S.C. 21311.

[67 FR 11604, Mar. 15, 2002, as amended at 69 FR 30595, May 28, 2004; 72 
FR 51198, Sept. 6, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 244.7  Waivers.

    (a) A person subject to a requirement of this part may petition the 
Administrator for a waiver of compliance with any requirement of this 
part. The filing of such a petition does not affect that person's 
responsibility for compliance with that requirement pending action on 
such a petition.
    (b) Each petition for a waiver under this section must be filed in 
the manner and contain the information required by part 211 of this 
chapter.
    (c) If the Administrator finds that a waiver of compliance is in the 
public interest and is consistent with railroad safety, the 
Administrator may grant the waiver subject to any conditions the 
Administrator deems necessary.
    (d) The procedures governing a petition for a waiver that are 
prescribed under this part apply only to FRA's disposition of such a 
petition. A person seeking a waiver of a Surface Transportation Board 
regulation would need to file a petition for a waiver with the Board. 
(See 49 CFR 1106.5.)

    (b) Beginning in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1991, each 
railroad subject to this part shall pay an annual user fee to the FRA. 
For fiscal years 1992 through 1995, the user shall be calculated by FRA 
in accordance with Sec. 245.101. The Secretary's authority to collect 
user fees shall expire on September 30, 1995, as provided for in section 
216(f) of the Safety Act.

area, as well as any commuter rail service which was operated by the 
Consolidated Rail Corporation as of January 1, 1979, and (2) high speed 
ground transportation systems that connect metropolitan areas, without 
regard to whether they use new technologies not associated with 
traditional railroads. Such term does not include rapid transit 
operations within an urban area that are not connected to the general 
railroad system of transportation (See, 45 U.S.C. 431(e)).
    (h) Responsible entity means the railroad subject to this part as of

means, yard switching miles may be computed at the rate of 6 mph for the 
time actually engaged in yard switching service.
    (o) Yard track means a system of tracks within defined limits used 
for the making up or breaking up of trains, for the storing of cars, and 
for other related purposes, over which movements not authorized by 
timetable, or by train order may be made subject to prescribed signals, 
rules or other special instructions. Sidings used exclusively as passing 
track and main line track within yard limits are not included in the 
term yard track.


<R05>
Sec. 245.7  Penalties.

    Any person (including a railroad and any manager, supervisor, 
official, or other employee or agent of a railroad) who violates any 
requirement of this part or causes the violation of any such requirement 
is subject to a civil penalty of at least $250 and not more than $10,000 
per violation. Civil penalties may be assessed against individuals only 
for willful violations. Each day a violation continues shall constitute

<R04>
                  Subpart B_Reporting and Recordkeeping


<R05>
Sec. 245.101  Reporting requirements.

    (a) Each railroad subject to this part shall submit to FRA, not 
later than March 1st of each year (August 1st, for

[[Page 876]]

the fiscal year ending September 30, 1992) a report identifying the 
railroad's total train miles for the prior calendar year, the total road 
miles owned, operated under lease, or controlled (but not including 
trackage rights) by the railroad as of December 31 of the previous 
calendar year, and the railroad's total number of employee hours for the 
prior calendar year. An entity shall be considered a railroad subject to 
this part if it conforms to the definitions found in Sec. 245.5(g) and 
(h) above. Each railroad shall report all of the data for the entire 
relevant calendar year whether or not its present operations generated 
all of the reportable data. This report shall be made on FRA Form 
6180.91--Annual Report of Railroads Subject to User Fees and shall be 
filed by the Responsible Entity (see Sec. 245.5(h)). The report shall 
include an explanation for an entry of zero for train miles, road miles, 
or employee hours. Each railroad shall also identify all subsidiary 
railroads for which it is reporting and provide a breakdown of train 
miles, road miles, and employee hours for each subsidiary. Finally, each 
railroad shall enter its corporate billing address for the user fees, 
and the name, title, telephone number, date, and a signature of the 
person submitting the form to FRA.
    (b) FRA anticipates mailing blank copies of FRA Form 6180.91--Annual 
Report of Railroads Subject to User Fees to each railroad during the 
month of January (the month of July for the fiscal year ending September 
30, 1992) for the railroad's use in preparing the report. This action by 
FRA is for the convenience of the railroads only and in no way affects 
the obligation of railroads subject to this part to obtain and submit 
FRA Form 6180.91 to FRA in a timely fashion in the event a blank form is 
not received from FRA. Blank copies of FRA Form 6180.91 may be obtained 
from the Office of Safety, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 
20590.
    (c) Train miles, as defined in Sec. 245.5(n), shall be calculated 
by the railroad in accordance with the following considerations:
    (1) Each railroad subject to this part is to report the train miles 
for the freight and passenger service it operates without regard to 
track or facility ownership.
    (2) Train miles are to be reported by both freight and passenger 
railroads and shall include miles run between terminals or stations, or 
both, miles run by trains consisting of empty freight cars or without 
cars, locomotive train miles run, miles run by trains consisting of 
deadhead passenger equipment, motor train miles run, yard-switching 
miles run, work train miles, and train switching miles.
    (d) Road miles, as defined in Sec. 245.5(i), shall be calculated by 
the railroad in accordance with the following considerations:
    (1) Road miles to be reported shall include all track owned, 
operated under lease, or controlled by the railroad but shall not 
include track used under trackage rights agreements. (Note: road miles 
consisting of leased track are to be reported by the lessee railroad). 
Road miles consisting of jointly-owned track or track jointly operated 
under lease shall be reported by the railroad controlling operations 
over the track. Road miles for a given section of railroad should be 
reported by only one railroad.
    (2) Road miles to be reported shall not include industrial track, 
yard tracks, sidings, and other tracks not regularly used by road trains 
operated in such specific service. The determination that a particular 
track segment qualifies as industrial track or yard track must be made 
on a reasonable and supportable basis. Road miles do not include track 
which was out of service for the entire calendar year that is the 
subject of the user fee report.
    (e) Employee hours, as defined in Sec. 245.5(a), shall be 
calculated by the railroad in accordance with the following 
considerations: Employees hours to be reported include the number of 
hours worked by all railroad employees, regardless of occupation, during 
the previous calendar year. Include all employees in the occupational 
categories shown in appendix D of the FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/
Incident Reports. Employee hours do not include time paid but not 
actually worked, such as holidays, vacations, etc. Employee hours do not 
include

[[Page 877]]

hours worked by volunteers. Employee hours do not include hours worked 
by individuals not employed directly by the reporting railroad (i.e. 
contractor employees).
    (f) In computing both train miles and road miles, fractions 
representing less than one-half mile shall be disregarded and other 
fractions considered as one mile.
    (g) Each railroad subject to this part has a continuing obligation 
to assure that the information provided to FRA on Form 6180.91--Annual 
Report of Railroads Subject to User Fees is accurate. Should a railroad 
learn at a later date that the information provided was not correct, it 
shall submit a revised Form 6180.91 along with a letter explaining in 
detail the discrepancy.
    (h) Each railroad subject to this part has an obligation to assure 
that the information provided to FRA under this part is consistent with 
information provided to FRA under other reporting requirements, in 
particular reports submitted under 49 CFR part 225--Railroad Accidents/
Incidents: Reports Classification, and Investigations. The railroad 
shall fully explain and resolve any discrepancies.
    (i) The FRA has prepared a questionnaire entitled ``Written 
Questionnaire on Whether Your Company Is a `Railroad' Subject to FRA 
User Fee Regulations'' (FRA Form 6180.90) in order to assist in 
determining whether certain entities meet the definition of ``railroad'' 
included in Sec. 245.5 or constitute railroads whose entire operations 
are confined within an industrial installation (``plant railroads'') 
excluded from this part under Sec. 245.3. Copies of FRA Form 6180.90 
are available from the Office of Safety, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., 
Washington, DC 20590.


<R05>
Sec. 245.103  Recordkeeping.

    Each railroad subject to this part shall maintain adequate records 
supporting its calculation of the railroad's total train miles for the 
prior calendar year, total road miles as of December 31 of the previous 
calendar year, and the total employee hours for the previous calendar 
year. Such records shall be sufficient to enable the FRA to verify the 
information provided by the railroad on FRA Form 6180.91--Annual Report 
of Railroads Subject to User Fees. Such records shall also be available 
for inspection and copying by the Administrator or the Administrator's 
designee during normal business hours.


<R05>
Sec. 245.105  Retention of records.

    Each railroad subject to this part shall retain records required by 
Sec. 245.103 for at least three years after the end of the calendar 
year to which they relate.


<R04>
                     Subpart C_User Fee Calculation


<R05>
Sec. 245.201  User fee calculation.

    (a) The fee to be paid by each railroad shall be determined as 
follows:
    (1) After March 15th of each year (August 1st for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 1992), FRA will tabulate the total train miles, 
total employee hours, and total road miles for railroads subject to this 
part for the preceding calendar year. FRA's calculations will be based 
on the information supplied by railroads under Sec. 245.101 hereof, and 
other reports and submissions which railroads are required to make to 
FRA under applicable regulations (i.e. 49 CFR parts 225 and 228). At the 
same time, FRA will calculate the total cost of administering the Safety 
Act for the current fiscal year (other than activities described in 
section 202(a)(2) thereof) which will represent the total amount of user 
fees to be collected.
    (2) Using tabulations of total train miles, total employee hours, 
total road miles, and the total cost of administering the Safety Act, 
FRA will calculate a railroad's user fee assessment as follows:
    (i) The assessment rate per train mile will be calculated by 
multiplying the total costs of administering the Safety Act by 0.55 and 
then dividing this amount (i.e., fifty-five percent of the total amount 
to be collected) by the total number of train miles reported to the FRA 
for the previous calendar year. The result will be the railroad user fee 
assessment rate per train mile for the current fiscal year.
    (ii) The assessment rate per employee hour will be calculated by 
multiplying the total costs of administering the Safety Act by 0.1 and 
then dividing this amount (i.e., 10 percent of

[[Page 878]]

the total amount to be collected) by the total number of employee hours 
reported to the FRA for the previous calendar year. The result will be 
the railroad user fee rate per employee hour for the fiscal year.
    (iii) The assessment rate per road mile will be calculated in three 
steps. First, FRA will determine a preliminary assessment rate per road 
mile by multiplying the total costs of administering the Safety Act by 
0.35 and dividing this amount (i.e., thirty-five percent of the total 
amount to be collected) by the total road miles reported to FRA for the 
previous calendar year. Second, FRA will adjust this preliminary rate 
per road mile for each light density railroad by multiplying the 
preliminary rate by the appropriate scaling factor identified in Sec. 
245.5(h). The result will be a reduced assessment rate per road mile for 
light density railroads. Third, FRA will adjust the preliminary 
assessment rate per road mile for all railroads except light density 
railroads by adding to their preliminary rate an incremental amount 
reflecting the reallocation of the relief provided to light density 
railroads under step 2 using the sliding scale. The incremental amount 
is calculated by subtracting (A) the total amount to be collected from 
light density railroads after application of the sliding scale from (B) 
the total amount that would have been collected from light density 
railroads using the preliminary assessment rate and developed under step 
1 and (C) dividing the resulting amount by the total road miles reported 
to FRA by all railroads except light density railroads. The incremental 
amount is then added to the preliminary assessment rate for all 
railroads except light density railroads to derive the assessment rate 
per road mile for all railroads except light density railroads. The 
results will be a modified assessment rate per road mile for light 
density railroads qualifying under step 2 and a general assessment rate 
applicable to all other railroads. In those cases where the computed fee 
is less than the defined minimum, the net increase attributable to the 
application of the minimum standard is not included in the reallocation 
process under step 3 and is instead added to total collections.
    (b) The user fee to be paid by each covered railroad is the greater 
of $500.00 or the sum of the railroad's train miles times the assessment 
rate per train mile, the railroad's employee hours times the assessment 
rate per employee hour, and the railroad's road miles times the 
applicable assessment rate per road mile.


<R04>
             Subpart D_Collection Procedures and Duty To Pay


<R05>
Sec. 245.301  Collection procedures.

    (a) After March 15th of each year (August 15th for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 1992), FRA will publish in the Federal Register a 
notice containing FRA's preliminary estimates of the total user fee to 
be collected, the assessment rate per train mile, the assessment rate 
per employee hour, and the assessment rate per road mile (as adjusted by 
the sliding scale). The information published by FRA will be sufficient 
to enable each railroad to calculate its estimated user fee bill for the 
fiscal year on the basis of the train mile, employee hour, and road mile 
information provided by the railroad to FRA.
    (b) After June 1st of each year, (August 15th for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 1992), FRA will provide to each covered railroad a 
notice (the ``Assessment Notice'') containing FRA's final calculations 
of the total user fee to be collected, the assessment rate per train 
mile, the assessment rate per employee hour, the assessment rate per 
road mile (as adjusted by the sliding scale), the train miles, employee 
hours, and road miles for the railroad for the prior calendar year, the 
user fee to be paid by the railroad, and a statement and payment record 
form. FRA will mail the Assessment Notice sufficiently in advance of the 
end of the fiscal year in order to allow all collections to be completed 
prior to the end of the fiscal year. FRA will mail the Assessment Notice 
to the billing address designated by the railroad on FRA Form 6180.91--
Annual Report of Railroads Subject to User Fees.

[[Page 879]]


<R05>
Sec. 245.303  Duty to pay.

    (a) Beginning in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1991, each 
railroad subject to this part shall pay an annual railroad user fee to 
the FRA. Payment in full shall be received by FRA no later than thirty 
days after the Assessment Notice is mailed. Payment is made only when 
received by FRA. Payments in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) 
shall be made by wire transfer through the Federal Reserve 
communications, commonly known as Fedwire, to the account of the U.S. 
Treasury in accordance with the instructions provided in the Assessment 
Notice. Payments of ten thousand dollars or less shall be by check or 
money order payable to the Federal Railroad Administration. The payment 
shall be identified as the railroad's user fee by noting it with the 
User Fee Bill Number as assigned by FRA and by returning the payment 
record received with the Assessment Notice. Payment shall be sent to the 
address stated in the assessment notice. Any railroad making an 
aggregate payment for one r more subsidiaries or affiliates should 
return the payment records for each and list all applicable Bill Numbers 
with the payment.
    (b) The responsibility for paying the user fee rests with the 
responsible entity (see Sec. 245.5(h)). Parties involved in purchase 
and sale transactions of railroad(s) or portions of a railroad shall be 
responsible for allocating the user fee amongst the interested entities 
in an appropriate fashion. FRA will not prorate user fee bills.
    (c) No user fee will be collected from railroads that properly 
report zero train miles and zero road miles on FRA Form 6180.91--Annual 
Report of Railroads Subject to User Fees.
    (d) Payments not received by the due date will be subject to 
allowable interest charges, penalties, and administrative charges (31 
U.S.C. 3717). Follow-up demands for payment and other actions intended 
to assure timely collection, including referral to local collection 
agencies or court action, will be conducted in accordance with Federal 
Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR chapter II) and Departmental 
procedures (49 CFR 89).

applicant are authorized to execute and deliver the certificate or other 
obligations evidencing the same, and to pledge and hypothecate any 
securities pledged as collateral; that the certificate or other 
obligations so executed and so delivered constitute the valid and

<R05>
Sec. 260.13  Credit reform.

    The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, 2 U.S.C. 661, requires 
Federal agencies to set aside the subsidy cost of new credit assistance 
provided in the form of direct loans or loan guarantees. The subsidy 
cost will be the estimated long term cost to the Government of the loan 
or loan guarantee. The subsidy cost associated with each direct loan or 
loan guarantee, which the Administrator must set aside, may be funded by 
Federal appropriations, direct payment of a Credit Risk Premium by the 
Applicant or a non-Federal infrastructure partner on behalf of the 
Applicant, or any combination thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 260.15  Credit risk premium.

    (a) Where available Federal appropriations are inadequate to cover 
the subsidy cost, a non-Federal infrastructure partner may pay to the 
Administrator a Credit Risk Premium adequate to cover that portion of 
the subsidy

[[Page 897]]

cost not covered by Federal appropriations. Where there is no Federal 
appropriation, the Credit Risk Premium must cover the entire subsidy 
cost.
    (b) The amount of the Credit Risk Premium required for each direct 
loan or loan guarantee, if any, shall be established by the 
Administrator. The Credit Risk Premium shall be determined based on the 
credit risk and anticipated recovery in the event of default, including 
the recovery of collateral.
    (c) The Credit Risk Premium must be paid before the disbursement of 
a direct or guaranteed loan. Where the borrower draws down the direct or 
guaranteed loan in several increments, the borrower may pay a portion of 
the total Credit Risk Premium for each increment equal to the proportion 
of that increment to the total amount of the direct or guaranteed loan.
    (d) Each direct loan and loan guarantee made by the Administrator 
will be included in one cohort of direct loans or one cohort of loan 
guarantees, respectively, made during that same fiscal year, or longer 
period, as may be determined by the Administrator. When all obligations 
in a cohort have been satisfied or liquidated, the amount of Credit Risk 
Premiums, paid by applicants or infrastructure partners, remaining in 
the cohort, after deductions made to mitigate losses from any loan or 
loan guarantee in the cohort, together with interest accrued thereon, 
will be repaid on a pro rata basis to each original payor of a Credit 
Risk Premium for any obligation which was fully satisfied. If the 
Administrator's estimate of the default risk cost of each loan is 
accurate, the aggregate of Credit Risk Premiums associated with each 
cohort of loans will fully offset all losses in the cohort and none will 
remain to be returned to the payees.

                          Financial Assistance


<R05>
Sec. 260.17  Credit risk premium analysis.

    (a) When Federal appropriations are not available to cover the total 
subsidy cost, the Administrator will determine the Credit Risk Premium 
necessary for each direct loan or loan guarantee by estimating the 
credit risk and the potential recovery in the event of a default of each 
project evaluating the factors described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section.
    (b) Establishing the credit risk.
    (1) Where an Applicant has received a recent credit rating from one 
or more nationally recognized rating agencies, that rating will be used 
to estimate the credit risk.
    (2) Where an Applicant has not received a credit rating from a 
credit rating agency, the Administrator will determine the credit risk 
based on an evaluation of the following factors:
    (i) Business risk, based on Applicant's:
    (A) Industry outlook;
    (B) Market position;
    (C) Management and financial policies;
    (D) Capital expenditures; and
    (E) Operating efficiency.
    (ii) Financial risk, based on Applicant?s past and projected:

    (B) Liquidity;
    (C) Financial strength;
    (D) Size; and
    (E) Level of capital expenditures; and

    (A) Potential for improving revenues, profitability and cash flow 
from operations; and
    (B) Reliance on third parties for success.
    (c) The potential recovery in the event of a default will be based 
on:
    (1) The nature of the Applicant's assets; and
    (2) Liquidation value of the collateral offered, including the terms 
and conditions of the lien securing the collateral.

    Re: Application for financial assistance under the Railroad 
Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program.

    Dear Sir or Madam: Being duly authorized by (jointly and severally/
if more than one) (the ``Applicant'') to convey the understandings 
hereinafter set forth, I respectfully submit this application and remit 
its investigation fee in the amount equal to one-half the total 
investigation fee established by the Administrator. By this filing, 
Applicant requests the Administrator to investigate the application and 
make the necessary findings upon which Applicant's eligibility for a 
direct loan or loan guarantee may be determined. Applicant understands 
that neither the acceptance of this filing, the deposit of the 
investigation charge, nor the commencement of an investigation 
acknowledges the sufficiency of the application's form, content or 
merit. Furthermore, Applicant understands that the Administrator will 
incur numerous expenses by this filing with respect to the investigation 
of the application, the appraisal of security being offered, and the 
making of the necessary determinations and findings, and promises to 
pay, within 60 days, the remainder of the investigation fee required by 
the Administrator. Applicant understands that the Administrator will 
establish the amount of Credit Risk Premium due from Applicant, if any, 
as provided in Sec. 260.15. Applicant agrees to pay such Credit Risk 
Premium prior to the disbursement of direct or guaranteed loan, as 
appropriate. Such Credit Risk Premium may be refunded as provided in 
Sec. 260.15.
     Respectfully submitted.

Applicant(s)
Seal(s) by Its(Their).

    (e) The original application and supporting papers, and two copies 
thereof for the use of the Administrator, shall be filed with the 
Associate Administrator for Railroad Development of the Federal Railroad 
Administration, 1120 Vermont Ave., NW., MailStop 20, Washington, DC 
20590. Each copy shall bear the dates and signatures that appear in the 
original and shall be complete in itself, but the signatures in the

<R05>
Sec. 260.33  Information requests.

    If an Applicant desires that any information submitted in its 
application or any supplement thereto not be released by the 
Administrator upon request from a member of the public, the Applicant 
must so state and must set forth any reasons why such information should 
not be released, including particulars as to any competitive harm which 
would probably result from release of such information. The 
Administrator will keep such information confidential to the extent 
permitted by law.


<R05>
Sec. 260.35  Environmental assessment.

    (a) The provision of financial assistance by the Administrator under 
this Part is subject to a variety of environmental and historic 
preservation statutes and implementing regulations including the 
National Environmental Policy Act (``NEPA'') (42 U.S.C. 4332 et seq.), 
Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. 303(c)), 
the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470(f)), the Coastal 
Zone Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1451), and the Endangered Species Act (16 
U.S.C. 1531). Appropriate environmental/historic preservation 
documentation must be completed and approved by the Administrator prior 
to a decision by the Administrator on the applicant's financial 
assistance request. FRA's ``Procedures for Considering Environmental 
Impacts'' (``FRA's Environmental Procedures'') (65 FR 28545 (May 26, 
1999)) or any replacement environmental review procedures that the FRA 
may later issue and the NEPA regulation of the Council on Environmental 
Quality (``CEQ Regulation'') (40 CFR Part 1500) will govern the FRA's 
compliance with applicable environmental/historic preservation review 
requirements.
    (b) The Administrator, in cooperation with the applicant, has the 
responsibility to manage the preparation of the appropriate 
environmental document. The role of the applicant will be determined by 
the Administrator in accordance with the CEQ Regulation and 
Environmental Procedures.
    (c) Depending on the type, size and potential environmental impact 
of the project for which the applicant is seeking financial assistance, 
FRA will need to determine whether the project is categorically excluded 
from detailed environmental review under FRA's Environmental Procedures 
and, if not, to

[[Page 903]]

prepare or have prepared an Environmental Assessment leading to an 
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or a Finding of No Significant 
Impact. At the discretion of the Administrator, Applicants may be 
required to prepare and submit an environmental assessment of the 
proposed project or to submit adequate documentation to support a 
finding that the project is categorically excluded from detailed 
environmental review. If the applicant is a public agency that has 
statewide jurisdiction or is a local unit of government acting through a 
statewide agency, and meets the requirements of section 102(2)(D) of 
NEPA, the applicant may be requested to prepare the EIS and other 
environmental documents under the Administrator's guidance.
    (d) Applicants are strongly urged to consult with the Associate 
Administrator for Railroad Development at the earliest possible stage in 
project development in order to assure that the environmental/historic 
preservation review process can be completed in a timely manner.
    (e) Applicants may not initiate any activities that would have an 
adverse environmental impact or limit the choice of reasonable 
alternatives in advance of the completion of the environmental review 
process. This does not preclude development by applicants of plans or 
designs or performance of other work necessary to support the 
application for financial assistance.

   Subpart D_Standards for Maintenance of Facilities Involved in the 

                                 Project


<R05>
Sec. 260.37  Applicability.

    This subpart prescribes standards governing the maintenance of 
facilities that are being, or have been, acquired, rehabilitated, 
improved, or constructed with the proceeds of a direct loan or a 
guaranteed loan issued under this part for the period during which any 
portion of the principal or interest of such obligation remains unpaid.


<R05>
Sec. 260.39  Maintenance standards.

    (a) When the proceeds of a direct loan or an obligation guaranteed 
by the Administrator under this part are, or were, used to acquire, 
rehabilitate, improve or construct track, roadbed, and related 
structures, Borrower shall, as long as any portion of the principal or 
interest of such obligation remains unpaid, maintain such facilities in 
at least the highest track class, as defined by FRA Track Safety 
Standards in part 213 of this chapter, specified in the Application at 
which the rehabilitated, improved, acquired, or constructed track is to 
be operated upon completion of the project.
    (b) When the proceeds of a direct loan or an obligation guaranteed 
by the Administrator under this part are, or were, used for equipment or 
facilities, the Borrower shall, during the period in which any portion 
of the principal or interest in such obligation remains unpaid, maintain 
such equipment or facilities in a manner consistent with sound 
engineering and maintenance practices and in a condition that will 
permit the level of use that existed upon completion of the acquisition, 
rehabilitation, improvement or construction of such equipment or 
facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 260.41  Inspection and reporting.

    (a) Equipment or facilities subject to the provisions of this 
subpart may be inspected at such times as the Administrator deems 
necessary to assure compliance with the standards set forth in Sec. 
260.39. Each Borrower shall permit representatives of the FRA to enter 
upon its property to inspect and examine such facilities at reasonable 
times and in a reasonable manner. Such representatives shall be 
permitted to use such testing devices as the Administrator deems 
necessary to insure that the maintenance standards imposed by this 
subpart are being followed.
    (b) Each Borrower shall submit annually to the Administrator 
financial records and other documents detailing the maintenance and 
inspections performed which demonstrate that the Borrower has complied 
with the standards in Sec. 260.39.


<R05>
Sec. 260.43  Impact on other laws.

    Standards issued under this subpart shall not be construed to 
relieve the Borrower of any obligation to comply with any other Federal, 
State, or local law or regulation.

<R04>
       Subpart E_Procedures To Be Followed in the Event of Default


<R05>
Sec. 260.45  Events of default for guaranteed loans.

    (a) If the Borrower is more than 30 days past due on a payment or is 
in violation of any covenant or condition of the loan documents and such 
violation constitutes a default under the provisions of the loan 
documents, Lender must notify the Administrator in writing and must 
continue to submit this information to the Administrator each month 
until such time as the loan is no longer in default; and the 
Administrator will pay the Lender of the obligation, or the Lenders's 
agent, an amount equal to the past due interest on the guaranteed 
portion of the defaulted loan. This payment will in no way reduce the 
Borrower's obligation to the Lender to make all payments of principal 
and interest in accordance with the note. If the loan is brought 
current, the Lender will repay to the Agency any interest payments made 
by the Agency, plus accrued interest at the note rate.
    (b) If the default has continued for more than 90 days, the 
Administrator will pay to the Lender, or the Lender's agent, 90 percent 
of the unpaid guaranteed principal. If, subsequent to this payment being 
made, the default is cured and liquidation is no longer appropriate, the 
Lender will repay such funds to the Administrator, plus interest at the 
note rate.
    (c) After the default has continued for more than 90 days, the 
Lender shall expeditiously submit to the Administrator, in writing, its 
proposed detailed plan to resolve the default by liquidating the 
collateral or by any other means. If the resolution will require the 
liquidation of the collateral, then the Lender's plan shall include:
    (1) Proof adequate to establish that the Lender is legally in 
possession of the obligation, or is the agent for a Holder who is 
legally in possession of the obligation, and a statement of the current 
loan balance and accrued interest to date and the method of computing 
the interest;
    (2) A full and complete list of all collateral, including any 
personal and corporate guarantees;
    (3) The recommended liquidation methods for making the maximum 
collection possible and the justification for such methods, including 
recommended action for acquiring and disposing of all collateral and 
collecting from any guarantors;
    (4) Necessary steps for preservation of the collateral;
    (5) Copies of the Borrower's latest available financial statements;
    (6) Copies of any guarantor's latest available financial statements;
    (7) An itemized list of estimated liquidation expenses expected to 
be incurred along with justification for each expense;
    (8) A schedule to periodically report to the FRA on the progress of 
liquidation;
    (9) Proposed protective bid amounts on collateral to be sold at 
auction and a breakdown to show how the amounts were determined;
    (10) If a voluntary conveyance is considered, the proposed amount to 
be credited to the guaranteed debt;
    (11) Legal opinions, as appropriate;
    (12) The Lender will obtain an independent appraisal on all 
collateral securing the loan which will reflect the fair market value 
and potential liquidation value. In order to formulate a liquidation 
plan that maximizes recovery, the appraisal shall consider the presence 
of hazardous substances, petroleum products, or other environmental 
hazards, which may adversely impact the market value of the collateral; 
and
    (13) The anticipated expenses associated with the liquidation will 
be considered a cost of liquidation.
    (d) The Administrator will inform the Lender in writing whether the 
Administrator concurs in the Lender's liquidation plan. Should the 
Administrator and the Lender not agree on the liquidation plan, 
negotiations will take place between the Administrator and the Lender to 
resolve the disagreement. When the liquidation plan is approved by the 
Administrator, the Lender will proceed expeditiously with liquidation. 
The liquidation plan may be modified when conditions warrant. All 
modifications must be approved in writing by the Administrator prior to 
implementation.

[[Page 905]]

    (e) Lender will account for funds during the period of liquidation 
and will provide the Administrator with reports at least quarterly on 
the progress of liquidation including disposition of collateral, 
resulting costs, and additional procedures necessary for successful 
completion of the liquidation.
    (f) Within 30 days after final liquidation of all collateral, the 
Lender will prepare and submit to the Administrator a final report in 
which the Lender must account for all funds during the period of 
liquidation, disposition of the collateral, all costs incurred, and any 
other information necessary for the successful completion of 
liquidation. Upon receipt of the final accounting and report of loss, 
the Administrator may audit all applicable documentation to confirm the 
final loss. The Lender will make its records available and otherwise 
assist the Administrator in making any investigation.
    (g) The Administrator shall be subrogated to all the rights of the 
Lender, or if Lender is agent for a Holder then to all of the rights of 
the Holder, with respect to the Borrower to the extent of the 
Administrator's payment to the Lender under this section.
    (h) When the Administrator finds the final report to be proper in 
all respects:
    (1) All amounts recovered in liquidation shall be paid to the 
Administrator; and
    (2) The remaining obligation of the Administrator to the Lender 
under the guarantee, if any, will be paid directly to Lender by the 
Administrator.
    (i) The Administrator shall not be required to make any payment 
under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if the Administrator finds, 
before the expiration of the periods described in such subsections, that 
the default has been remedied.
    (j) The Administrator shall have the right to charge Borrower 
interest, penalties and administrative costs, including all of the 
United States' legally assessed or reasonably incurred expenses of its 
counsel and court costs in connection with any proceeding brought or 
threatened to enforce payment or performance under applicable loan 
documents, in accordance with OMB Circular A-129 (www.whitehouse.gov/
omb), as it may be revised from time to time.


<R05>
Sec. 260.47  Events of default for direct loans.

    (a) Upon the Borrower's failure to make a scheduled payment, or upon 
the Borrower's violation of any covenant or condition of the loan 
documents which constitutes a default under the provisions of the loan 
documents, the Administrator, at the Administrator's discretion may:
    (1) Exercise any and all remedies available under the provisions of 
the loan agreement and other loan documents, including any guarantees, 
or inherent in law or equity;
    (2) Terminate further borrowing of funds;
    (3) Take possession of assets pledged as collateral; and
    (4) Liquidate pledged collateral.
    (b) The Administrator shall have the right to charge Borrower 
interest, penalties and administrative costs, including all of the 
United States' legally assessed or reasonably incurred expenses of its 
counsel and court costs in connection with any proceeding brought or 
threatened to enforce payment or performance under applicable loan 
documents, in accordance with OMB Circular A-129, as it may be revised 
from time to time.


<R05>
Sec. 260.49  Avoiding defaults.

    Borrowers are encouraged to contact the Administrator prior to the 
occurrence of an event of default to explore possible avenues for 
avoiding such an occurrence.


<R04>
                    Subpart F_Loan Guarantees_Lenders


<R05>
Sec. 260.51  Conditions of guarantee.

    (a) The percentage of the obligation for which Applicant seeks a 
guarantee is a matter of negotiation between the Lender and the 
Applicant, subject to the Administrator's approval. The maximum 
percentage of the total obligation that the Administrator will guarantee 
is 80 percent. The amount of guarantee allowed will depend on the total 
credit quality of the transaction and the level of risk believed to be 
assumed by the Administrator.
    (b) A guarantee under this part constitutes an obligation supported 
by the

[[Page 906]]

full faith and credit of the United States and is incontestable except 
for fraud or misrepresentation of which a Lender or Holder has actual 
knowledge at the time it becomes such Lender or Holder or which a Lender 
or Holder participates in or condones. In addition, the guarantee will 
be unenforceable by the Lender or the Holder to the extent any loss is 
occasioned by the violation of usury laws, negligent servicing, or 
failure to obtain the required security regardless of the time at which 
the Administrator acquires knowledge thereof. Any losses occasioned will 
be unenforceable to the extent that loan funds are used for purposes 
other than those specifically approved by FRA in its guarantee.
    (c) The Administrator may guarantee an Applicant's obligation to any 
Lender provided such Lender can establish to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator that it has the legal authority and sufficient expertise 
and financial strength to operate a successful lending program. Loan 
guarantees will only be approved for Lenders with adequate experience 
and expertise to make, secure, service, and collect the loans.
    (d) The Lender may sell all of the guaranteed portion of the loan on 
the secondary market, provided the loan is not in default, or retain the 
entire loan.
    (e) When a guaranteed portion of a loan is sold to a Holder, the 
Holder shall succeed to all rights of the Lender under the loan 
guarantee to the extent of the portion purchased. The Lender will remain 
bound to all obligations under the loan guarantee and the provisions of 
this part. In the event of material fraud, negligence or 
misrepresentation by the Lender or the Lender's participation in or 
condoning of such material fraud, negligence or misrepresentation, the 
Lender will be liable for payments made by the Agency to any Holder.


<R05>
Sec. 260.53  Lenders' functions and responsibilities.

    Lenders have the primary responsibility for the successful delivery 
of the program consistent with the policies and procedures outlined in 
this part. All Lenders obtaining or requesting a loan guarantee from the 
Administrator are responsible for:
    (a) Loan processing. Lender shall be responsible for all aspects of 
loan processing, including:
    (1) Processing applications for the loan to be guaranteed;
    (2) Developing and maintaining adequately documented loan files;
    (3) Recommending only loan proposals that are eligible and 
financially feasible;
    (4) Obtaining valid evidence of debt and collateral in accordance 
with sound lending practices;
    (5) Supervising construction, where appropriate;
    (6) Distributing loan funds;
    (7) Servicing guaranteed loans in a prudent manner, including 
liquidation if necessary; and
    (8) Obtaining the Administrator's approval or concurrence as 
required in the loan guarantee documentation;
    (b) Credit evaluation. Lender must analyze all credit factors 
associated with each proposed loan and apply its professional judgment 
to determine that the credit factors, considered in combination, ensure 
loan repayment. The Lender must have an adequate underwriting process to 
ensure that loans are reviewed by other than the originating officer. 
There must be good credit documentation procedures;
    (c) Environmental responsibilities. Lender has a responsibility to 
become familiar with Federal environmental requirements; to consider, in 
consultation with the prospective borrower, the potential environmental 
impacts of their proposals at the earliest planning stages; and to 
develop proposals that minimize the potential to adversely impact the 
environment. Lender must alert the Administrator to any controversial 
environmental issues related to a proposed project or items that may 
require extensive environmental review. Lender must assist borrowers as 
necessary to comply with the environmental requirements outlined in this 
part. Additionally, Lender will assist in the collection of additional 
data when the Agency needs such data to complete its environmental 
review of the proposal; and assist in the resolution of environmental 
problems;

[[Page 907]]

    (d) Loan closing. The Lender will conduct or arrange for loan 
closings; and
    (e) Fees and Charges. The Lender may establish charges and fees for 
the loan provided they are similar to those normally charged other 
Applicants for the same type of loan in the ordinary course of business.


<R05>
Sec. 260.55  Lender's loan servicing.

    (a) The lender is responsible for servicing the entire loan and for 
taking all servicing actions that are prudent. This responsibility 
includes but is not limited to the collection of payments, obtaining 
compliance with the covenants and provisions in the loan documents, 
obtaining and analyzing financial statements, verification of tax 
payments, and insurance premiums, and maintaining liens on collateral.
    (b) The lender must report the outstanding principal and interest 
balance on each guaranteed loan semiannually.
    (c) At the Administrator's request, the Lender will periodically 
meet with the Administrator to ascertain how the guaranteed loan is 
being serviced and that the conditions and covenants of the loan 
documents are being enforced.
    (d) The Lender must obtain and forward to the Administrator the 
Borrower's annual financial statements within 120 days after the end of 
the Borrower's fiscal year and the due date of other reports as required 
by the loan documents. The Lender must analyze the financial statements 
and provide the Agency with a written summary of the Lender's analysis 
and conclusions, including trends, strengths, weaknesses, extraordinary 
transactions, and other indications of the financial condition of the 
Borrower.
    (e) Neither the Lender nor the Holder shall alter, nor approve any 
amendments of, any loan instrument without the prior written approval of 
the Administrator.

[[Page 909]]


<R05>
Sec. 262.9  Criteria for selection of projects.

    Applicants must submit evidence sufficient for the FRA to determine 
whether projects proposed for Federal investment are cost-effective in 
terms of the benefits achieved in relation to the funds expended. To 
that end, the FRA will consider the anticipated public and private 
benefits associated with each rail line relocation or improvement 
project. In evaluating applications, FRA will consider the following 
factors in determining whether to grant an award to a State under this 
part.
    (a) The capability of the State to fund the rail line relocation 
project without Federal grant funding;
    (b) The requirement and limitation relating to allocation of grant 
funds provided in Sec. 262.5;
    (c) Equitable treatment of various regions of the United States;
    (d) The effects of the rail line, relocated or improved as proposed, 
on motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic, safety, community quality of 
life, and area commerce;
    (e) The effects of the rail line, relocated as proposed, on the 
freight rail and passenger rail operations on the line;
    (f) Any other factors FRA determines to be relevant to assessing the 
effectiveness and/or efficiency of the grant application in achieving 
the goals of the national program, including the level of commitment of 
non-Federal and/or private funds to a project and the anticipated public 
and private benefits.


<R05>
Sec. 262.11  Application process.

    (a) All grant applications for opportunities funded under this 
subsection must be submitted to FRA through www.grants.gov. 
Opportunities to apply will be posted by FRA on www.grants.gov only 
after funds have been appropriated for Capital Grants for Rail Line 
Relocation Projects. The electronic posting will contain all of the 
information needed to apply for the grant, including required supporting 
documentation.
    (b) In addition to the information required with an individual 
application, a State must submit a description of the anticipated public 
and private benefits associated with each rail line relocation or 
improvement project described in Sec. 262.7(a)(1) and (2) and the 
State's assessment of how those benefits outweigh the costs of the 
proposed project. The determination of such benefits shall be developed 
in consultation with the owner and user of the rail line being relocated 
or improved or other private entity involved in the project. The State 
should also identify any financial contributions or commitments it has 
secured from private entities that are expected to benefit from the 
proposed project.
    (c) Potential applicants may request a meeting with the FRA 
Associate Administrator for Railroad Development or his designee to 
discuss the nature of the project being considered.


<R05>
Sec. 262.13  Matching requirements.

    (a) A State or other non-Federal entity shall pay at least ten 
percent of the construction costs of a project that is funded in part by 
the grant awarded under this section.
    (b) The non-Federal share required by paragraph (a) of this section 
may be paid in cash or in-kind. In-kind contributions that are permitted 
to be counted under this section are as follows:
    (1) A contribution of real property or tangible personal property 
(whether provided by the State or a person for the state) needed for the 
project;
    (2) A contribution of the services of employees of the State or 
other non-Federal entity or allowable costs, calculated on the basis of 
costs incurred by the State or other non-Federal entity for the pay and 
benefits of the employees, but excluding overhead and general 
administrative costs;
    (3) A payment of any allowable costs that were incurred for the 
project before the filing of an application for a grant for the project 
under this part, and any in-kind contributions that were made for the 
project before the filing of the application; if and to the extent that 
the costs were incurred or in-kind contributions were made, as the case 
may be, to comply with a provision of a statute required to be satisfied 
in order to carry out the project.

[[Page 910]]

    (c) In determining whether to approve an application, FRA will 
consider the feasibility of seeking financial contributions or 
commitments from private entities involved with the project in 
proportion to the expected benefits determined under Sec. 262.11(b) 
that accrue to such entities from the project.


<R05>
Sec. 262.15  Environmental assessment.

    (a) The provision of grant funds by FRA under this Part is subject 
to a variety of environmental and historic preservation statutes and 
implementing regulations including, but not limited to, the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4332 et seq.), Section 4(f) 
of the Department of Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. 303(c)), the National 
Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470(f)), and the Endangered Species 
Act (16 U.S.C. 1531). Appropriate environmental and historic 
documentation must be completed and approved by the Administrator prior 
to a decision by FRA to approve a project for physical construction. 
FRA's ``Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts,'' as posted at 
http://www.fra.dot.gov/us/content/252, the NEPA regulation of the 
Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR part 1500) and the Advisory 
Council on Historic Preservation Protection of Historic Properties 
regulation (36 CFR part 800) will govern FRA's compliance with 
applicable environmental and historic preservation review requirements.
    (b) States have two options for proceeding with environmental/
historic preservation reviews. A State may file an application under 
subsection Sec. 262.11 seeking funds for preliminary design and 
environmental/historic preservation compliance for a potentially 
eligible project and FRA will review and decide on the application as 
outlined in this Part. Alternatively, a State may proceed with and fund 
any costs associated with environmental/historic preservation reviews 
(including environmental assessments and categorical excisions, but not 
environmental impact statements since there are restrictions on what 
types of entities can manage an environmental impact statement) and seek 
reimbursement from FRA for these costs to the extent they otherwise 
qualify as allowable costs if FRA later approves the project for 
physical construction and enters into a grant agreement with the State. 
If a State pays for the compliance work itself, it may apply this cost 
to the 10% matching requirement if a grant is awarded. Applicants should 
consult with FRA before beginning any environmental or historic 
preservation analysis.


<R05>
Sec. 262.17  Combining grant awards.

    Two or more States, but not political subdivisions of States, may, 
pursuant to an agreement entered into by the States, combine any part of 
the amounts provided through grants for a project under this section 
provided:
    (1) The project will benefit each of the States entering into the 
agreement; and
    (2) The agreement is not a violation of the law of any such State.


<R05>
Sec. 262.19  Close-out procedures.

    (a) Thirty days before the end of the grant period, FRA will notify 
the State that the period of performance for the grant is about to

    (b) Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of the grant, 
the State must submit to FRA any or all of the following information,

                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 265.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to effectuate the provisions of section 
905 of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 
(hereinafter referred to as the ``Act'') to ensure that no person in the 
United States shall on the grounds of race, color, national origin, or 
sex be excluded from participation in, or denied the benefits of, or be 
subjected to discrimination under, any project, program or activity 
funded in whole or in part through financial assistance under the Act, 
or any provision of law amended by the Act. Nothing contained in these 
regulations is intended todiminish or supersede the obligations made 
applicable by either title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, (42 
U.S.C. 2000d), or Executive Order No. 11246, (42 U.S.C. 2000e (note)). 
Subsection (d) of section 905 of the Act authorizes the Secretary to 
prescribe such regulations and take such actions as are necessary to 
monitor, enforce, and affirmatively carry out the purposes of that 
section. This authority coupled with the provisions of section 906 of 
the Act, which requires the establishment of a Minority Resource Center 
which is authorized to encourage, promote and assist in the 
participation by MBE enterprises in the restructuring, improvement, 
revitalization and maintenance of our Nation's railroads, provides the 
basis for requirements for the development of affirmative action 
programs by recipients of Federal financial assistance and certain of 
their contractors to insure that minorities and MBEs are afforded ample 
consideration with respect to employment and contractual opportunities 
produced as a result of the implementation of the Act and other 
provisions of law amended by the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 265.3  Applicability.

    This part applies to any project, program, or activity funded in 
whole or in part through financial assistance provided under the Act, 
and to any activity funded under any provision of the Regional Rail 
Reorganization Act of 1973, as amended (45 U.S.C. 701 et seq.) or the 
Rail Passenger Service Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 501 et seq.) amended 
by the Act including the financial assistance programs listed in 
appendix A. It applies to contracts awarded to implement the Northeast 
Corridor Project and to financial assistance programs administered by 
the United States Railway Association.

                         Subpart B_Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 265.7  Nondiscrimination clauses.

    (a) Each agreement for financial assistance made under any provision 
of the Rail Acts shall include, or in the case of agreements made prior 
to the effective date of this part, shall be amended to include, the 
following clauses:
    (1) As a condition to receiving Federal financial assistance under 
the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (``Act''), 
or the provisions of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, as 
amended (45 U.S.C. 701 et seq.), or the Rail Passenger Service Act of 
1970, as amended (45 U.S.C. 501 et seq.) amended by the Act 
(collectively called, together with the Act, the ``Rail Acts''), the 
recipient hereby agrees to observe and comply with the following:
    (i) No person in the United States shall on the ground of race, 
color, national origin or sex be excluded from participation in, or 
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any 
project, program, or activity funded in whole or in part through such 
assistance.
    (2) The following specific discriminatory actions are prohibited:
    (i) A recipient under any project, program or activity to which 
these clauses apply shall not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, on the ground of race, color, national origin, or sex:
    (A) Deny a person any service, financial aid, or other benefit 
provided under such project, program or activity;
    (B) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to a person 
which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that 
provided to others under such project, program or activity;

[[Page 913]]

    (C) Subject a person to segregation or separate treatment in any 
matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid or other 
benefit under such project, program or activity;
    (D) Restrict a person in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage 
or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid or 
other benefit under such project, program or activity; or
    (E) Deny a person an opportunity to participate in such project, 
program or activity through the provision of services or otherwise or 
afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded 
others under such project, program or activity.
    (ii) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial 
aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any 
such project, program or activity or the class of persons to whom, or 
the situations in which such services, financial aid, other benefits, or 
facilities will be provided under any such project, program or activity, 
or the class of persons to be afforded an opportunity to participate in 
any such project, program or activity shall not, directly or through 
contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of 
administration which have the effect of subjecting persons to 
discrimination because of their race, color, national origin, or sex, or 
have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment 
of the objectives of the project, program or activity, with respect to 
individuals of a particular race, color, national origin or sex.
    (iii) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient 
shall not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding 
persons from, de- nying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to 
discrimination under any project, program or activity to which these 
clauses apply on the grounds of race, color, national origin or sex, or 
with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the 
accomplishment of the objectives of these clauses.
    (iv) The recipient shall not discriminate against any employee or 
applicant for employment because of race, color, national origin or sex. 
Except as otherwise required by the regulations or orders of the 
Administrator, the recipient shall take affirmative action to insure 
that applicants for employment are employed, and that employees are 
treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, national 
origin or sex. Such action shall include but not be limited to the 
following: Employment, promotion, demotion, transfer, recruitment or 
recruitment advertising, layoff or termination, rates of pay or other 
forms of compensation, and selection for training, including 
apprenticeship. The recipient agrees to post in conspicuous places, 
available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be 
provided by the agency's representative setting forth the provisions of 
these nondiscrimination clauses. The recipient understands and agrees 
that it shall not be an excuse for the recipient's failure to provide 
affirmative actionthat the labor organizations with which the recipient 
has a collective bargaining agreement failed or refused to admit or 
qualify minorities for admission to the union, or that the provisions of 
such agreements otherwise prevent recipient from implementing its 
affirmative action program.
    (v) The recipient shall not discriminate against any business 
organization in the award of any contract because of race, color, 
national origin or sex of its employees, managers or owners. Except as 
otherwise required by the regulations or orders of the Administrator, 
the recipient shall take affirmative action to insure that business 
organizations are permitted to compete and are considered for awards of 
contracts without regard to race, color, national origin or sex.
    (3) As used in these clauses, the services, financial aid, or other 
benefits provided under a project, program, or activity receiving 
financial assistance under the Rail Acts include any service, financial 
aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility funded through 
financial assistance provided under the Rail Acts.
    (4) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination 
does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a)(1)(i) 
of this section.

[[Page 914]]

    (5) These clauses do not prohibit the consideration of race, color, 
national origin or sex if the purpose and effect are to remove or 
overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have 
restricted the availability of, or participation in, recipient's 
operations or activities on the grounds of race, color, national origin 
or sex. Where prior discriminatory or other practice or usage tends, on 
the grounds of race, color, national origin or sex, to exclude 
individuals or businesses from participation in, to deny them the 
benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any project, 
program or activity to which these clauses apply, the recipient must 
take affirmative action to remove or overcome the effects of the prior 
discriminatory practice or usage. Even in the absence of prior 
discriminatory practice or usage to which this partapplies, the 
recipient is expected to take affirmative action to insure that no 
person is excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of the 
project, program or activity on the grounds of race, color, national 
origin or sex, and that minorities and MBEs are afforded a reasonable 
opportunity to participate in employment and procurement opportunities 
that will result from financial assistance provided under the Rail Acts.
    (6) The recipient agrees to take such actions as are necessary to 
monitor its activities and those of its contractors who will be paid in 
whole or in part with funds provided by the Rail Acts, or from 
obligations guaranteed by the Administrator pursuant to the Rail Acts, 
except obligations guaranteed under section 602 of the Rail Passenger 
Service Act, in order to carry out affirmatively the purposes of 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and to implement the affirmative 
action program developed and implemented pursuant to 49 CFR part 265.
    (7) The recipient shall, in all advertisements for employees, or 
solicitations for services or materials from business organizations 
placed by or on behalf of the recipient, in connection with any project, 
program or activity funded in whole or in part with financial assistance 
under the Rail Acts, state that all applicants for employment will 
receive consideration for employment, and all business organizations 
will receive consideration for an award of a contract, without regard to 
race, color, national origin or sex.
    (8) The recipient shall send to each labor organization or 
representative of workers with which it has a collective bargaining 
agreement or other contract or understanding a notice to be provided by 
the agency's representative, advising the labor organization or workers' 
representative of the recipient's commitments under section 905 of the 
Act, and shall post copies of the notice in conspicuous places available 
to employees and applicants for employment.
    (9) The recipient shall comply with all provisions of section 905 of 
the Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, any other Federal civil rights 
act, and with the rules, regulations, and orders issued under such acts.
    (10) The recipient shall furnish all information and reports 
required by the rules, regulations, and orders of the Administrator, and 
will permit access to its books, records, and accounts by the 
Administrator for purposes of investigation to ascertain compliance with 
rules, regulations, and orders referred to in paragraph (a)(9) of this 
section.
    (11) Recipient shall furnish such relevant procurement information, 
not included in its affirmative action program as may be requested by 
the MBE Resource Center. Upon the request of the recipient, the Center 
shall keep such information confidential to the extent necessary to 
protect commercial or financial information or trade secrets to the 
extent permitted by law.
    (12) In the event of the recipient's noncompliance with the 
nondiscrimination clauses of this agreement, or with the provisions of 
section 905 of the Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or with any other 
Federal civil rights act, or with any rules, regulations, or orders 
issued under such acts, this contract will, after notice of such 
noncompliance, and after affording a reasonable opportunity for 
compliance, be canceled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part 
and the recipient may be declared ineligible for further

[[Page 915]]

Federal financial assistance in accordance with procedures authorized in 
section 905 of the Act, or as otherwise provided by law.
    (13) The recipient shall not enter into any contract or contract 
modification whether for the furnishing of supplies or services or for 
the use of real or personal property, including lease arrangements, or 
for construction, in connection with a project, program or activity 
which receives financial assistance under the Rail Acts with a 
contractor debarred from or who has not demonstrated eligibility for 
Federal or federally assisted contracts, and will carry out such 
sanctions and penalties for violation of this part as may be imposed 
upon contractors and subcontractors by the Administrator or any other 
authorized Federal official. The recipient shall insure that the clauses 
required by 41 CFR 60-1.46 implementing Executive Order 11246 will be 
placed in each non-exempt federally assisted construction contract.
    (14) The recipient agrees to comply with and implement the written 
affirmative action program as approved by the Administrator pursuant to 
Sec. 265.17 of title 49 CFR.
    (15) The recipient agrees to notify the Administrator promptly of 
any law suit or complaint filed against the recipient alleging 
discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin or sex.
    (16) The recipient shall include the preceding provisions of 
paragraphs (a) (1) through (15) of this section in every contract or 
purchase order, whether for the furnishing of supplies or services or 
for the use of real or personal property, including lease arrangements, 
or for construction relating to projects, programs or activities 
financed in whole or in part under the Rail Acts. The recipient shall 
cause each such contractor or vendor to include the provisions of 
paragraphs (a) (1) through (15) of this section in every subcontract. 
The recipient will take such action with respect to any such contract or 
purchase order as the Administrator may direct as a means of enforcing 
such provisions including sanctions for noncompliance; provided, 
however, that in the event the recipient becomes involved in, or is 
threatened with, litigation with a contractor or vendor as a result of 
such direction by the Administrator, the recipient may request the 
United States to enter into such litigation.


<R05>
Sec. 265.9  Affirmative action program--General.

    Recipients of financial assistance under the Rail Acts and their 
contractors, as specified herein, shall develop and maintain an 
affirmative action program to insure that persons and businesses are not 
discriminated against because of race, color, national origin or sex in 
programs, projects and activities financed in whole or in part through 
financial assistance provided under the Rail Acts, and that minorities 
and MBEs receive a fair proportion of employment and contractual 
opportunities which will result from such programs, projects and 
activities.


<R05>
Sec. 265.11  Submission of affirmative action program.

    (a) Each application for financial assistance under any of the Rail 
Acts shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any 
financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be 
accompanied by two copies of a written affirmative action program for 
review by and approval of the Administrator. Recipients that have 
already entered into an agreement or other arrangement providing for 
such assistance shall, within 60 days after the effective date of this 
part, develop and submit to the Administrator two copies of a written 
affirmative action program for review by and approval of the 
Administrator and thereafter maintain such program.
    (b)(1) Beginning 30 days after the effective date of this part, and 
until 120 days after such date, each recipient shall require any 
contractor, as a condition to an award of a contract, for $50,000 or 
more for services or products on a project receiving federal financial 
assistance under a program covered by section 905 of the Act:
    (i) To furnish to the recipient a written assurance that it will, 
within 90 days after the date of the award, develop and maintain a 
written affirmative action program meeting the requirements of this part 
for the project,

[[Page 916]]

program or activity covered by the contract,
    (ii) To require each of its subcontractors receiving an award of a 
subcontract for $50,000 or more within 120 days after the effective date 
of this part, to furnish to the contractor as a condition to such an 
award the written assurance described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section.
    (2) Beginning 120 days after the effective date of this part, each 
recipient shall require as a condition to the award of a contract or 
subcontract of $50,000 or more that the contractor or subcontractor 
furnish a certificate to the recipient or contractor as appropriate that 
a written affirmative action program meeting the requirements of this 
part has been developed and is being maintained.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, each 
contractor or subcontractor having a contract or $50,000 or more but 
less than 50 employees shall be required to develop and maintain a 
written affirmative action program only for contracts in accordance with 
Sec. 265.13(c) of this part.
    (4) A recipient or contractor shall not procure supplies or services 
in less than usual quantities or in a manner which is intended to have 
the effect of avoiding the applicability of this paragraph.


<R05>
Sec. 265.13  Contents of affirmative action program.

    (a) General. A prerequisite to the development of a satisfactory 
affirmative action program is the identification and analysis of problem 
areas inherent in minority employment and utilization of MBEs, and an 
evaluation of opportunities for utilization of minority group personnel 
and MBEs. Therefore, an affirmative action program to guarantee 
employment and contractual opportunities shall provide for specific 
actions keyed to the problems and needs of minority persons and MBEs 
including, where there are deficiencies based on past practices, and 
with respect to future plans for hiring and promoting employees or 
awarding contracts, the development of specific goals and timetables for 
the prompt achievement and maintenance of full opportunities for 
minority persons and MBEs with respect to programs, projects and 
activities subject to this part.
    (b) Employment practices. (1) The affirmative action program for 
employment showing the level of utilization of minority employees, and 
establishing a plan to insure representative opportunities for 
employment for minority persons shall be developed in accordance with 
the regulations of the Department of Labor at 41 CFR 60-2.
    (2) Railroad applicants or recipients shall develop their program 
for each establishment in their organization and by job categories in 
accordance with the requirements of the Joint Reporting Committee of the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Labor. 
Other applicants, recipients or contractors may use any program format 
or organization which has been approved for use by other Federal 
agencies enforcing equal opportunity laws.
    (3) The affirmative action program shall show the source of 
statistical data used.
    (4) The affirmative action program shall include a listing by job 
category of all jobs which may be established or filled by the 
applicant, recipient or contractor as a result of the project, program 
or activity funded by federal financial assistance under the Rail Acts 
for the first five years of such project, program or activity or the 
period during which such project, program or activity will be 
undertaken, whichever is the lesser (``program period'').
    (5) The affirmative action program shall set forth in detail a plan 
to insure that with respect to the project, program or activity financed 
in whole or in part through financial assistance under the Rail Acts, 
minority persons have an opportunity to participate in employment in 
proportion to the percentage of the minority work force in the area 
where the applicant's, recipient's or contractor's operations are 
located as compared to the total work force, and that such minority 
persons have an equal opportunity for promotion or upgrading. Where 
appropriate because of prior underutilization of minority employees, the 
program

[[Page 917]]

shall establish specific goals and timetables to utilize minority 
employees in such projects, programs or activities in the above-
mentioned proportion.
    (c) Contracts. (1) The affirmative action program shall include 
details of proposed contracts in excess of $10,000 to be awarded in 
connection with projects, programs and activities funded in whole or in 
part through financial assistance under the Rail Acts, including 
contracts for professional and financial services, for the program 
period. The details shall include a description of the services or 
products which will be sought including estimated quantities, the 
location where the services are to be provided, the manner in which 
proposals will be solicited (e.g., cost plus fixed fee, fixed price), 
the manner in which contracts will be awarded (e.g., competitive or sole 
source). The plan shall also give details as to bidding procedures, and 
information as to other qualifications for doing business with the 
applicant, recipient or contractor. Upon request by the applicant, 
recipient or contractor, any information submitted to the Administrator 
shall be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law.
    (2) The affirmative action program shall review the procurement 
practices of the applicant, recipient or contractor for the full year 
preceding the date of the submission of the affirmative action program 
and evaluate the utilization of MBE in its procurement activities. Such 
evaluation of utilization of MBEs shall include the following:
    (i) An analysis of awards of contracts to MBEs during such year 
describing the nature of goods and services purchased and the dollar 
amount involved; and
    (ii) A comparison of the percentage of awards of contracts to MBEs 
(by number of contracts and by total dollar amount involved) to the 
total procurement activity of the applicant, recipient or contractor for 
said year.
    (3) The affirmative action program shall set forth in detail 
applicant's, recipient's or contractor's plan to insure that MBEs are 
afforded a fair and representative opportunity to do business with 
applicant, recipient or contractor (both in terms of number of contracts 
and dollar amount involved) for the program period. Such plan shall 
identify specific actions to be taken to:
    (i) Designate a liaison officer who will administer the MBE program;
    (ii) Provide for adequate and timely consideration of the 
availability and potential of MBEs in all procurement decisions;
    (iii) Assure that MBEs will have an equitable opportunity to compete 
for contracts, by arranging solicitation time for the preparation of 
bids, quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules so as to 
facilitate the participation of MBEs and by assisting MBEs who are 
potential contractors in preparing bid materials and in obtaining and 
maintaining suitable bonding coverage in those instances where bonds are 
required;
    (iv) Maintain records showing that the policies set forth in this 
part are being complied with;
    (v) Submit quarterly reports of the records referred to in paragraph 
(c)(3)(iv) of this section in such form and manner as the Administrator 
may prescribe; and
    (vi) Where appropriate because of prior underutilization of MBEs, 
establish specific goals and timetables to utilize MBEs in the 
performance of contracts awarded.
    (d) Successor organizations. Where applicant, recipient or 
contractor is a successor organization, its affirmative action program 
shall review the hiring and procurement practices of its predecessor 
organization or organizations.


<R05>
Sec. 265.14  Determining the MBE status of a business.

    FRA or a recipient may, on the basis of available information, 
determine that a business is not an MBE within the meaning of this part. 
This determination shall be final, except as provided in Sec. 265.14-1, 
for that contract and other contracts being let by that contracting 
agency at the time of the determination. Businesses may correct 
deficiencies in their ownership and control and apply as MBEs only for 
future contracts.

[44 FR 36339, June 21, 1979]

[[Page 918]]


<R05>
Sec. 265.14-1  Appeals of determination of MBE status.

    (a) Filing. Any firm who believes that it has been wrongly 
determined not to be an MBE under Sec. 265.14 by the FRA or a recipient 
may file an appeal in writing with the Administrator. The appeal shall 
be filed no later than 30 days after the date of the determination. The 
Administrator may extend the time for filing or waive the time limit in 
the interest of justice, specifying in writing the reasons for so doing. 
Third parties who have reason to believe that a business has been 
wrongly denied or granted status as an MBE may advise the Administrator. 
This information is not considered an appeal pursuant to this section.
    (b) Decision to investigate. The Administrator ensures that a prompt 
investigation is made of those cases with investigative merit (except 
those being reviewed on the merits by the Comptroller General), pursuant 
to prescribed DOT Title VI (49 CFR part 21) investigation procedures.
    (c) Status during the investigation. The Administrator may deny the 
business in question eligibility to participate as an MBE in direct or 
FRA-assisted contracts let during the pendancy of the investigation,

Sec. 265.15  Implementation and maintenance of affirmative action program.

    The affirmative action program with respect to employment and 
procurement practices shall set forth in detail applicant's recipient's 
or contractor's program to implement and maintain its recommended action 
program to insure that persons and businesses are not discriminated 
against because of race, color, national origin or sex, and that 
minorities and MBEs have equal employment and contractual opportunities 
with applicant, recipient or contractor. In developing its maintenance 
program for employment, applicants, recipients and contractors shall 
follow the applicable regulations of the Department of Labor 
implementing Executive Order 11246 at 41 CFR 60-2, subpart C, which 
provisions may also be helpful in implementing and maintaining 
applicant's recipient's or contractor's procurement program.


<R05>
Sec. 265.17  Review of affirmative action program.

    (a) Except as provided for contractors and subcontractors in Sec. 
265.11(b), each affirmative action program to be acceptable must have 
the written approval of the Administrator.
    (b) The Administrator recognizes that there may be some exceptional 
situations where the requirements of Sec. 265.13 through Sec. 265.15 
may not fulfill the affirmative action objectives sought or that those 
objectives may be better achieved through modified or different 
requirements. Accordingly, the applicant, recipient or contractor may 
request approval for modified or different requirements that embody the 
objectives of Sec. Sec. 265.13 through 265.15. Such a request must 
include detailed showings that the particular situation is exceptional 
and that the modified or different proposals substantially comply with 
the objectives of this part. If the Administrator determines that the 
requirements for a detailed justification have been met, he

[[Page 919]]

may waive or modify these requirements or impose different requirements 
as he deems necessary to further the objectives sought herein.

participants, beneficiaries and other interested persons, such 
information regarding the provisions of this part and the applicability 
to the program, project or activity under which the recipient received

manner as the Administrator finds necessary to apprise such persons of 
the protections against discrimination assured them by the Act and this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 265.21  Conduct of investigations.

    (a) The Administrator shall from time to time review the practices 
of recipients and contractors to determine whether they are complying 
with this part. The Administrator shall to the fullest extent 
practicable seek the cooperation of recipients and contractors in 
obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and 
guidance to recipients and contractors to help them comply voluntarily 
with this part. As required by Sec. 265.7(a)(6) of this part recipients 
and contractors shall from time to time review the practices of their 
contractors and subcontractors to determine whether they are complying 
with this part.
    (b) Any person who believes himself or herself or any other person 
to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part, may file with 
the Administrator a written complaint. A complaint must be filed not 
later than sixty (60) days after the date complainant discovers the 
alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the 
Administrator.
    (c) The Administrator will make a prompt investigation in cases 
where a compliance review, report, complaint or other information 
indicates a possible failure to comply with this part.
    (d)(1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section 
indicates a failure to comply with this part, the Administrator shall 
within ten (10) days after such determination so inform the recipient or 
contractor in writing of the specific grounds for alleging noncompliance 
and the matter shall be resolved by informal means whenever possible. 
The notice shall provide that, if it has been determined that the matter 
is not resolved by informal means within thirty (30) days after the 
delivery of the notice, action will be taken as provided for in Sec. 
265.23.
    (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Administrator shall within ten 
(10) days after such determination so inform the recipient, or 
contractor and the complainant, if any, in writing.
    (e) No recipient, contractor or other person shall intimidate,

Act or this part, or because he or she made a complaint, testified, 
assisted or participated in

[[Page 920]]

any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under this part. 
The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential at their 
election during the conduct of any investigation, proceeding or hearing 
under this part. But when such confidentiality is likely to hinder the 
investigation the complainant will be advised for the purpose of waiving 
the privilege.


<R05>
Sec. 265.23  Procedures for effecting compliance.

    (a) Whenever the Administrator determines that any recipient, or 
contractor has failed to comply with the provisions of this part, or 
with any Federal civil rights statute, or with any order or regulation 
issued under such a statute, and such failure has not been resolved by 
informal means pursuant to Sec. 265.21 of this part, the Administrator 
shall within ten (10) days after such determination notify such 
recipient or contractor, and the appropriate labor organization if the 
matter may appear to affect a person who is covered by a collective 
bargaining agreement, in writing of the specific grounds for alleging 
noncompliance, and the right of such persons to respond to such 
determination in writing or to request an informal hearing. Where the 
Administrator determines that substantial noncompliance exists and it is 
unlikely that compliance will be obtained, or that lack of good 
faithexists, or that other good cause exists, he may order that further 
financial assistance be suspended in whole or in part pending a final 
decision in the matter. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b) 
through (e) of this section, the recipient or contractor shall have 
sixty (60) days from the date of delivery of the notice within which to 
comply. The recipient or contractor may be entitled to additional time 
if it is demonstrated that compliance is not possible within the sixty 
day period and that the necessary initial curative actions were 
undertaken promptly and have been diligently prosecuted toward 
completion. The Administrator shall specify the last day upon which 
curative action must be completed to his satisfaction. Unless the 
Administrator determines that compliance cannot be reasonably attained, 
failure to take curative action shall be grounds for the Administrator 
to:
    (1) Direct that no further Federal financial assistance be provided 
to the recipient;
    (2) Refer the matter to the Attorney General with a recommendation 
that an appropriate civil action be instituted;
    (3) Exercise the powers and functions provided by title VI of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.); or
    (4) Take such other actions as may be provided by law or this part.
    (b) Persons receiving notification and a directive pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section may within thirty (30) days after receipt 
respond to the notice in writing in lieu of requesting an informal 
hearing as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The Administrator 
will make a determination as to compliance within thirty (30) days after 
receipt of such written response, and advise the person in writing of 
his determination. If the Administrator determines that compliance is 
reasonably attainable and that such person has failed to comply with the 
provisions of this part or with his determination within 30 days after 
receipt of his determination, the Administrator shall pursue the 
remedies set forth in the last sentence of paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) Persons receiving notification and a directive pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section may within ten (10) days after receipt 
request an informal hearing in lieu of filing a written response as 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The Administrator may, in 
his discretion, grant a request for an informal hearing for the purpose 
of inquiring into the status of compliance of such person. The 
Administrator will advise persons subject to his directive in writing as 
to the time and place of the informal hearings and may direct such 
persons to bring specific documents and records, or furnish other 
relevant information concerning their compliance status. When so 
requested, such person shall attend and bring the requested information. 
The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to 
change for cause.

[[Page 921]]

The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the 
hearing. The failure of such person to request a hearing or to appear at 
a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a consent 
to the applicability of the procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (d) The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer appointed by 
the Administrator. Such hearings shall commence within twenty (20) days 
from the date the hearing is granted and shall be concluded no later 
than thirty (30) days from the commencement date. Parties to informal 
hearings may be represented by counsel or other authorized 
representative and shall have a fair opportunity to present any relevant 
material. Formal rules of evidence will not apply to such proceedings.
    (e) Decisions and notices. (1) Within ten (10) days after the 
conclusion of such hearings, the hearing officer will advise the 
Administrator, in writing, of his views and recommendations as to 
compliance with this part and a copy of such decision shall be sent by 
registered mail, return receipt requested, to the recipient or 
contractor and participating labor organization. If the hearing officer 
in his decision determines that the recipient or contractor is in 
noncompliance with this part, he may, if he determines that it is 
unlikely that compliance will be obtained, or that a lack of good faith 
exists, or for other good cause, order that further financial assistance 
be suspended in whole or in part, pending a decision by the 
Administrator in the matter.
    (2) The recipient, contractor or labor organization may file 
exceptions to the hearing officer's decision, with his reasons therefor, 
with the Administrator within thirty (30) days of receipt of the initial 
decision. Within twenty (20) days, after the time for filing exceptions, 
the Administrator shall determine, in writing, whether or not the 
parties involved are in compliance with this part. A copy of the 
Administrator's decision will be given to the recipient, contractor, 
labor organization, if appropriate, and to the complainant, if any.
    (3) If the Administrator determines that compliance can reasonably 
be attained, his decision shall provide that if such person fails or 
refuses to comply with the decision of the Administrator within thirty 
(30) days after receipt of the decision, the Administrator shall:
    (i) Direct that no further Federal assistance be provided to such a 
person;
    (ii) Refer the matter to the Attorney General with a recommendation 
that an appropriate civil action be instituted;
    (iii) Exercise the powers and functions provided by title VI of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964; and/or
    (iv) Take such other actions as may be provided by law or this part.
    (4) A recipient or contractor adversely affected by a decision of 
the Administrator issued under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section 
shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal assistance or 
award of a federally assisted contract if the recipient or contractor 
takes complete curative action to eliminate the noncompliance with this 
part and if the recipient or contractor provides reasonable assurance 
that the recipient or contractor will fully comply with this part.

Sec. 266.9  Federal/State share.

    (a) Federal share. The Federal share of allowable costs under the 
Rail Service Assistance Program is 80 percent, with the exception that 
the Federal share of payments to be covered by rail service continuation 
assistance shall be 70 percent for any third twelve month period which 
begins on or after October 1, 1980 that such assistance is provided.
    (b) State share-general. The State share of allowable costs under 
the Rail Service Assistance Program shall be provided either in cash or 
through eligible in-kind benefits which would not otherwise have been 
provided. When more than the required State share is provided during the 
Federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 1978, or thereafter, the amount 
in excess of the required State share may be carried forward to 
subsequent fiscal years. The State share of allowable costs under the 
Rail Service Assistance Program may not be satisfied directly or 
indirectly by any Federal funds unless the funds are provided through a 
Federal program which specifically authorizes the use of

[[Page 926]]

such funds to satisfy the non-Federal share of a Federally subsidized 
program.
    (c) In-kind benefits--(1) Eligible types of benefits and their 
valuation. The following types of in-kind benefits are eligible when 
they are provided for projects eligible under Sec. 266.7 of this part 
(whether or not Federal assistance is requested for the projects) or 
they are activities which would be eligible for planning and program 
operation assistance. Eligible in-kind benefits are valued as follows:
    (i) The value of forgiven taxes, such as those portions of gross 
receipts or revenue taxes which are applicable to an approved project or 
property taxes on project related property, shall be the amount which 
would otherwise have been levied by the taxing authority. Forgiveness 
may be through exemption or remission;
    (ii) The value of trackage rights secured by a State for a common 
carrier shall be the amount paid by railroads for comparable rights on 
comparable rail freight properties;
    (iii) The value of State salaries for State public employees working 
in the State Rail Service Assistance Program, shall be consistent with 
rates paid for similar work by state public employees working in 
comparable state programs but shall not include overhead or general 
administrative costs;
    (iv) The value of donations by the State or by a third party on 
behalf of the State of real property or tangible personal property of 
the kind necessary for safe and efficient operation of rail freight 
service, such as State or locally owned or leased buildings used in rail 
freight operations or equipment or materials, shall be determined as 
follows:
    (A) The value of State tangible personal property shall be 
established at the State's actual cost in accordance with Federal 
Management Circular 74-4;
    (B) The value of donated tangible personal property shall be 
determined in accordance with Attachment F of Office of Management and 
Budget Circular (OMB) A-102;
    (C) The value of State real property shall be established at the 
State's actual cost in accordance with Federal Management Circular 74-4, 
if at least one independent appraisal based on the results of a title 
search was performed when the property was purchased by the State, 
otherwise it shall be valued at the fair market value as established by 
at least one independent appraisal based on the results of a title 
search at the time the state proposes to make the property available as 
in-kind benefit; and
    (D) The value of donated real property shall be its fair market 
value, at the time of donation to the State, as established by at least 
one independent appraisal based on the results of a title search;
    (2) Eligibility criteria. To be applied toward the State share, in-
kind benefits must:
    (i) Be verifiable from the State's records;
    (ii) Be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient 
accomplishment of the objectives of the Rail Service Assistance Program;
    (iii) Be provided for in the approved grant budget; and
    (iv) Be approved under paragraph (3) of this paragraph (c).
    (v) The State shall submit such information as the Administrator may 
request to verify the value of in-kind benefits.
    (3) Request for approval. A request for approval of the in-kind 
benefits are to be applied and shall include the following:
    (i) Full name and principal business address of the contributor if 
other than grantee;
    (ii) Detailed documentation of the in-kind benefits including

    Allowable costs include only the following costs which are properly 
allocable to the work performed: Planning and program operation costs 
which are allowed under Federal Management

[[Page 927]]

Circular 74-4; and costs of projects eligible under Sec. 266.7 of this 
part. All allowable costs shall be authorized by a fully executed grant 
agreement. A State may incur costs prior to the execution of a grant 
agreement only if the Administrator, based on the State's demonstration 
of a compelling need to incur costs prior to the execution of a grant 
agreement, has authorized the costs in writing prior to their incurrence 
by the State.


<R05>
Sec. 266.13  Distribution of funds.

    (a) Formula. Funds appropriated for or reallocated in any fiscal 
year (in this section refered to jointly as ``funds'') are to be 
distributed to each State as follows:
    (1) Two-thirds of the funds will be allocated in the ratio which a 
State's rail mileage that, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 10904(d), is 
either potentially subject to abandonment or is to become the subject of 
an application for a certificate of abandonment or discontinuance which 
a carrier plans to submit, but has not yet submitted, bears to the total 
such rail mileage in all the States;
    (2) One-third of the funds will be allocated in the ratio which a 
State's rail mileage for which the Commission has found within three 
years prior to the first day of the fiscal year for which the funds are 
being allocated that the public convenience and necessity permits the 
abandonment, or the discontinuance, of rail service on such rail 
mileage, bears to the total such rail mileage in all the States. Until 
September 30, 1981, such rail mileage includes the rail mileage which 
was eligible under the Rail Service Assistance Program pursuant to 
section 402 of the Rail Act, and all rail mileage which, prior to 
October 1, 1978, had been included for formula allocation purposes. The 
Administrator will calculate rail mileage under this paragraph as of 
October 1 of each year; and
    (3) The above calculations will be adjusted if necessary so that no 
State receives less than 1 percent of the funds appropriated for a 
fiscal year.
    (b) Reallocation. The Administrator will reallocate among the States 
funds which have not been granted under an executed grant agreement by 
the end of the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated and 
funds determined by a Federal audit to be in excess of allowable costs 
when they have not been granted under an executed grant agreement by the 
end of the fiscal year in which the Federal audit is made. Reallocated 
funds are distributed in accordance with the allocation formula 
described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Interstate sharing of allocated funds. Where not in violation of 
State law, two or more States, which are eligible to receive assistance 
under the Rail Service Assistance Program pursuant to Sec. 266.5 of 
this part may combine any portion of their entitlements for purposes of 
conducting any eligible project of mutual benefit provided that they 
enter into an agreement for this purpose.

Sec. 266.19  Environmental impact.

    (a) General. The Administrator has determined that providing 
assistance to cover the following costs is not a major action 
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment: 
Rehabilitation or improvement consisting of work normally performed on a 
periodic basis which does not change the existing character of the 
facility (including work to overcome normal periodic maintenance that 
had been deferred) rail service continuation, acquisition, and planning.
    (b) Substitute service assistance, rail facility construction 
assistance, and non-exempt rehabilitation or improvement assistance--(1) 
Environmental assessment. (i) When an applicant requests substitute 
service assistance, rail facility construction assistance, or 
rehabilitation or improvement assistance (except for rehabilitation or 
improvement assistance which is exempt under paragraph (a) of this 
section), the applicant shall:
    (A) Prepare an environmental assessment to determine whether the 
future use of the property will significantly affect the quality of the 
human environment; or
    (B) Provide sufficient documentation to enable the Administrator to 
determine that the project satisfies the following criteria:
    (1) The action is not likely to be environmentally controversial 
from the point of view of people living within the environment affected 
by the action or controversial with respect to the availability of 
adequate relocation housing;
    (2) The action is not inconsistent with any Federal, State, or local 
law, regulation, ordinance, or judicial or administrative determination 
relating to environmental protection;
    (3) The action will not have any significant adverse impact in any 
natural, cultural, recreational, or scenic environment(s) in which the 
action takes place, or on the air or water quality or ambient noise 
levels of such environment(s);
    (4) The action will not: use 4(f)-protected properties; adversely 
affect properties under section 106 of the National Historic 
Preservation Act; involve new construction location in a wetlands area; 
or affect a base floodplain;
    (5) The action will not cause a significant short- or long-term 
increase in traffic congestion, or other significant adverse 
environmental impact on any mode of transportation;
    (6) The action is not an integral part of a program of actions 
which, when considered separately, would not be classified as major FRA 
actions, but when considered together would be so classified; and
    (7) Environmental assessment or documentation is not required by any 
Federal law, regulation, guideline, order, or judicial or administrative 
determination other than this part.
    (ii) Prior to submitting an application, FRA recommends that the 
applicant seek the Administrator's advice as to form and substance of 
the assessment for the project under consideration. The environmental 
assessment shall utilize an interdisciplinary approach in identifying 
the type, degree of effect, and probability of occurrence of primary, 
secondary and cumulative potential environmental impacts (positive and 
negative) of the proposed action and of alternative courses of action. 
The depth of coverage shall be consistent with the magnitude of the 
project and its expected environmental effects. The environmental 
assessment and all documents used as a basis for the assessment shall be 
submitted together with the application for assistance.
    (2) Environmental impact statement. A draft environmental impact 
statement (EIS) shall be submitted with each application when the 
environmental assessment concludes that the future use significantly 
affects the quality of human environment. FRA recommends that prior to 
submitting the application, the applicant seek the Administrator's 
advice as to form and substance of the EIS for the project under 
consideration.
    (3) Finding of no significant impact. A draft finding of no 
significant impact declaration shall be submitted with each application 
when the applicant's environmental assessment concludes that the figure 
use does not significantly affect the quality of the human

[[Page 936]]

environment. The finding of no significant impact shall include a 
description of the project, and sufficient data and environmental 
findings to support the conclusions as to the impact upon the quality of 
the human environment. FRA recommends that prior to submitting the 
application, the applicant seek the Administrator's advice as to the 
form and substance of this finding for the project under consideration.
    (4) Section 4(f) determination. For projects involving the use of 
any land from a public park, recreation area, wildlife and waterfowl 
refuge, or historic site of national, State or local significance as 
determined by the Federal, State, or local officials having jurisdiction 
thereon, information to support a determination pursuant to section 4(f) 
of the Act shall be submitted together with the application. The section 
4(f) determination shall document that:
    (i) There is no feasible and prudent alternative to the use of such 
land; and
    (ii) The project includes all planning to minimize harm resulting 
from such use.
    (5) Historic preservation. For projects involving the use of 
historic, cultural or archeological resources listed or eligible for 
listing in the National Register of Historic Places, information which 
documents that the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has been

Sec. 266.21  Grant agreement and disbursement.

    (a) Grant agreement. (1) Upon the approval of an application meeting 
the requirements of Sec. 266.17 of this part, a grant agreement for the 
Federal share of the approved amount of estimated program costs will be 
executed by the Administrator and the grantee.
    (2) The grant agreement will identify the amount of the grantee's 
share of program costs to be furnished in cash and through approved in-
kind benefits. The grantee shall expend a pro-rata share of its cash 
contribution at the same time payments of the Federal share are made 
available to the grantee.
    (b) Disbursement. (1) Federal funds are provided either in advance 
by a letter-of-credit or a Treasury check or by reimbursement in 
accordance with Attachment J of OMB Circular A-102.
    (2) Prior to receipt of advance payments, the grantee must have 
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that it has 
established procedures to comply with OMB Circular A-102, Attachment J, 
including procedures that will minimize the time elapsing between the 
receipt of funds by the grantee and their disbursement. Evidence of such 
compliance shall be provided to the Administrator at least 30 days prior 
to the anticipated date of receipt of advance payments. An advance by 
letter-of-credit is used when the rail service assistance is expected to 
be provided for a minimum of one (1) year, and is expected to involve 
annual payments aggregating at least $120,000. Otherwise, advance 
payments are made by Treasury check.
    (3) If the grantee is not eligible for advance payments or does not 
desire them, the grantee will be reimbursed for eligible expenditures at 
the end of each fiscal quarter upon submission of a request for 
reimbursement.
    (4) Before disbursement of Federal funds can be made to a grantee 
for payment to third parties under this subsection, the grantee must 
have executed an agreement with the third party.
    (5) Acquisition assistance will be disbursed only after the 
following have been approved by the Administrator:
    (i) A title opinion of the chief legal officer of the grantee that 
describe the type of title being acquired, and if a general warranty 
deed is not being given, it must explain why it could not be given. The 
opinion shall also advise of any need for use of the State's eminent 
domain powers to assure adequate title. In addition, the opinion shall 
explain how the defects disclosed by the

[[Page 937]]

title search might affect the marketability of the property;
    (ii) A written determination that the property acquired is limited 
to the land and facilities that are needed for the rail freight services 
which would have been curtailed or abandoned but for the acquistion has 
been accepted by the Administrator; and
    (iii) A written determination that the purchase price is consistent 
with the value of the property interest being acquired, and the evidence 
upon which the determination is based.
    (c) Settlement. (1) Settlement under the grant agreement is made on 
the basis of a Federal audit which has determined the allowable costs 
over the entire term of the grant agreement. If the Federal audit 
determines that the allowable costs under the grant agreement are less 
than the amount of the grant, the difference shall be refunded to FRA at 
the end of the fiscal year in which the audit was made unless it has 
become the subject of another executed grant agreement. Upon termination 
of a State's participation in the Rail Service Assistance Program, the 
State shall repay FRA the Federal share of any unused rehabilitation and 
improvement assistance and any accumulated interest.


<R05>
Sec. 266.23  Record, audit, and examination.

    (a) Retention and custodial requirements for financial records, 
supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records 
pertinent to a grant provided under this part shall be governed by 
Attachment C of OMB Circular A-102.
    (b) The Administrator and the Comptroller General of the United 
States or any of their duly authorized representatives shall, until the 
expiration of three years after submission to the Administrator of the 
grantee's final accounting of all program funds, and for any longer 
period necessary to resolve audit findings, have access for the purpose 
of audit and examination to any books, documents, papers, and records 
which in the opinion of the Administrator or the Comptroller General of 
the United States may be related or pertinent to the grants, contracts, 
or other arrangements arising out of, or in any way connected with, the 
rail service assistance program.


<R05>
Sec. 266.25  Waivers and modifications.

    The Administrator may, with respect to individual requests, upon 
good cause shown, waive or modify any requirement of this part not 
required by law or make any additional requirements the Administrator 
deems necessary. Procedures for submission and consideration of 
petitions for waiver or modification are governed by 49 CFR part 211.

<R05>
Sec. 268.5  Federal funding sources for the Maglev Deployment Program.

    (a) Federal Maglev Funds. Section 322 of Title 23 provides for the 
following funds for the Maglev Deployment Program:
    (1) Contract authority. Fifty-five million has been made available 
for the Maglev Deployment Program as contract authority from the Highway 
Trust Fund for Fiscal Years 1999 through 2001; this would be used to 
fund the competition in all its phases and could also be used for final 
design, engineering, and construction activities of the selected 
project. Of the $55 million, the Congress has made available up to $15 
million for Fiscal Year 1999, up to $15 million for Fiscal Year 2000, 
and $25 million for Fiscal Year 2001.
    (2) Authorization for appropriations. Nine hundred fifty million, 
also from the Highway Trust Fund, has been authorized to be appropriated 
for the Maglev Deployment Program for Fiscal Years 2000 through 2003. Of 
the $950 million, $200 million is authorized to be appropriated for each 
of Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001, $250 million for Fiscal Year 2002, and 
$300 million for Fiscal Year 2003. Any decision to proceed with possible 
Federal funding of the construction of a Maglev system will be 
contingent upon the receipt of appropriations, and upon completion of 
appropriate environmental documentation.
    (b) Other Federal funds. Section 322 of Title 23 provides that the 
portion of

[[Page 940]]

the Maglev project not covered by Federal Maglev Funds may be covered by 
any non-Federal funding sources--including private (debt and/or equity), 
State, local, regional, and other public or public/private entities--as 
well as by Federally-provided STP and CMAQ funds, and by other forms of 
financial assistance made available under title 23 and TEA 21, such as 
loans and loan guarantees.
    (c) Costs Incurred in Advance of Cooperative Agreement. Certain 
costs incurred in advance of the execution of a cooperative agreement 
between FRA and the grantee for pre-construction planning but after 
enactment of TEA 21 (June 9, 1998) will be eligible for reimbursement, 
but such costs are allowable only to the extent that they are otherwise 
allowable under the terms of a fully executed cooperative agreement.

              Subpart B_Procedures For Financial Assistance


<R05>
Sec. 268.9  Eligible participants.

    Any State, or any authority designated by one or more State(s) to 
carry out the preconstruction planning activities under the Maglev 
Deployment Program is eligible to participate in the Maglev Deployment 
Program.


<R05>
Sec. 268.11  Project eligibility standards.

    (a) Project eligibility standards for preconstruction planning 
financing. (1) As required by 23 U.S.C. 322(d)(4), in order to be 
eligible to receive financial assistance, a Maglev project shall:
    (i) Involve a segment or segments of a high-speed ground 
transportation corridor that exhibit Partnership Potential;
    (ii) Require an amount of Federal funds for project financing that 
will not exceed the sum of Federal Maglev Funds, and the amounts made 
available by States under STP and CMAQ;
    (iii) Result in an operating transportation facility that provides a 
revenue producing service;
    (iv) Be undertaken through a public and private partnership, with at 
least \1/3\ of Full Project Costs paid using non-Federal funds;
    (v) Satisfy applicable statewide and metropolitan planning 
requirements;
    (vi) Be approved by FRA based on an application submitted by a State 
or authority designated by one or more States;
    (vii) To the extent that non-United States Maglev technology is used 
within the United States, be carried out as a technology transfer 
project; and
    (viii) Be carried out using materials at least 70 percent of which 
are manufactured in the United States.
    (2) FRA recognizes that applicants for preconstruction planning 
grants will not have detailed information with respect to some of the 
requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and that the purpose 
of a preconstruction planning grant is to develop much of this 
information with respect to a particular Maglev project. As required by 
Sec. 268.15, an applicant will need to provide whatever information it 
has with respect to each of the requirements of

[[Page 941]]

paragraph (a)(1) of this section, together with a certification that the 
applicant fully intends to comply with the requirements of this 
paragraph (a) should its project be selected by FRA for final design, 
engineering and construction financing.
    (b) Project eligibility standards for final design, engineering, and 
construction financing. FRA will select the most promising Maglev 
project for final design, engineering, and construction financing. To be 
eligible to be considered, the project must meet each of the following 
requirements; these requirements restate the requirements in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, but with more detail and in a different order:
    (1) Purpose and significance of the project. (i) The project 
description shall point to a Maglev facility and daily operation the 
primary purpose of which is the conduct of a revenue-producing passenger 
transportation service between distinct points, rather than a service 
solely for the passengers' riding pleasure.
    (ii) The project description shall incorporate scheduled operation 
at a top speed of not less than 240 mph.
    (2) Benefits for the American economy. The project description shall 
include a certification as to paragraphs (b)(2) (i) and (ii) of this 
section and, as appropriate, a technology acquisition/transfer plan 
which describes the strategy for their accomplishment.
    (i) Processes will be established that will enable an American-owned 
and -sited firm (or firms) to gain, in the course of the project, the 
capability to participate in the design, manufacture, and installation 
of the facilities and vehicles needed for a Maglev operation, if the 
owner of the selected version of Maglev technology is not an American-
owned and -sited firm (thus meeting the technology transfer requirement 
of 23 U.S.C. 322).
    (ii) The 70 percent U.S. content requirement content of 23 U.S.C. 
322 will be carried out.
    (3) Partnership potential. The project shall exhibit Partnership 
potential by satisfying the following:
    (i) A private/public partnership must be in place that is ready, 
willing, and able to finance, construct, operate, and maintain the 
project;
    (ii) The private/public partnership either owns the version of 
Maglev technology proposed to be implemented in the project, or has an 
agreement with the owner which affords full cooperation to the 
partnership in progressing the project, including implementation of the 
technology acquisition/transfer plan if applicable; and
    (iii) The recipient of a preconstruction planning grant or the FRA 
has developed and endorsed a projection of system capital costs, demand, 
revenues, operating expenses, and total costs and benefits, that:
    (A) Covers either the entire corridor in which the Maglev project is 
involved (``Corridor''), or the project considered independently;
    (B) Demonstrates that private enterprise would be able to run the 
Corridor or the project--once built and paid for--as a completely self-
sustaining entity, in which revenues will cover operating expenses and 
continuing investment needs; and
    (C) Shows total benefits equal to or exceeding total costs.
    (4) Funding Limits and Sources. The project description shall 
include a financing plan that demonstrates project completion with the 
$950 million in Federal Maglev Funds, funds remaining unobligated from 
the $55 million in contract authority, and the funds made available 
under STP and CMAQ. The project that is selected will be eligible for 
other forms of financial assistance provided under title 23 and TEA 21, 
including loans, loan guarantees, and lines of credit. However, at least 
\1/3\ of Full Project Costs must come from non-Federal Funds.
    (5) Project Management. The State, the technology owner, and all 
other relevant project partners must include in the project description, 
an agreed upon--
    (i) Management plan that defines the partnership, responsibilities, 
and procedures for accomplishing the project;
    (ii) Project schedule that shows how timely implementation of the 
project will be accomplished, including, to the extent possible, a 
construction plan and schedule; and

[[Page 942]]

    (iii) Financial plan that shows how funds will flow, in accordance 
with the other requirements of this subsection.
    (6) Planning/environmental process--(i) Assessment of environmental 
consequences of the proposed project. Recipients of preconstruction 
planning grants shall conduct an EA in support of the project 
description; and will prepare additional environmental studies for the 
project. The EA shall include information to support the grantee's 
decision to pursue the proposed project. The grantee shall develop the 
information and discuss the environmental consequences of the proposed 
technology and route in sufficient detail for the preparation of 
appropriate documentation by FRA to support selection of one project. 
This shall include: the identification of potential positive and 
negative environmental effects resulting from the technology (e.g. 
energy consumption compared to other transportation options); generic 
noise emissions at various distances from the centerline of the 
guideway; changes in electromagnetic field levels at various distances 
from the centerline of the guideway; and environmental screening of the 
proposed route (e.g., identification of land use; identification of 
endangered species possibly present and location of their critical 
habitat; identification of navigable waterways, wetlands and other 
sensitive water resources; and identification of the location of parks, 
wildlife refuges, historic and archaeological sites of National, State 
or local significance and other sites protected by section 4(f) of the 
Department of Transportation Act). The latter information and analysis 
shall be submitted four months in advance of the remainder of the 
project description. The above list is illustrative only. Grantees will 
be expected to review proposed work statements with FRA at pre-
application meetings or through some other means to develop the final 
scope of this environmental review.
    (ii) The project description must also include letters of 
endorsement of project implementation from all the State departments of 
transportation involved, and from all Metropolitan Planning 
Organizations for metropolitan areas that would be served by the 
project.


<R05>

assist the FRA in evaluating the application;
    (c) Whatever information the applicant has to demonstrate that the 
project meets the project eligibility standards in Sec. 269.11(a), and 
the project selection criteria in Sec. 268.17. together with a 
certification that the applicant

[[Page 943]]

fully intends to comply with the requirements in Sec. 269.11 should its 
project be selected by FRA for final design, engineering and 
construction financing.
    (d) A statement of work for the preconstruction planning activities 
to be accomplished under the planning grant. The statement shall 
describe the work to be performed, including but not necessarily limited 
to:
    (1) Preconstruction planning work as is needed to develop a Maglev 
project, and project description that will satisfy the project 
eligibility standards in Sec. 268.11(b), and the project selection 
criteria in Sec. 268.17; and
    (2) Preparation of EAs, as described in Sec. 268.11(b)(6)(i);
    (e) Management plan, schedule, and financial plan for accomplishing 
the preconstruction planning work under the planning grant;

    (g) A certification from the State, or from the authority designated 
by one or more States, that the \1/3\ matching funds required for work 
under the planning grant are, or will be, available by the time the 
grants are announced. The source(s) of the matching must be shown in the 
financial plan under paragraph (e); and
    (h) If the applicant has made a definitive choice of the particular 
Maglev technology proposed to be included, a description of that 
technology and the degree to which it has been produced and tested 
should be submitted. Further, if the applicant has identified 
organizations that would form members of the team that would implement 
the project, the names of those organizations and the persons 
representing them should also be submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 268.17  Project selection criteria.

    Except as qualified by Sec. 268.19, the following criteria will 
govern FRA's selection of projects to receive funding under the Maglev 
Deployment Program.
    (a) Purpose and significance of the project. (1) The degree to which 
the project description demonstrates attractiveness to travelers, as 
measured in passengers and passenger-miles.
    (2) The extent to which implementation of the project will reduce 
congestion, and attendant delay costs, in other modes of transportation; 
will reduce emissions and/or energy consumption; or will reduce the rate 
of growth in needs for additional highway or airport construction. 
Measures for this criterion will include but not be limited to the 
present value of congestion reduction, pollution reduction, and/or 
facility cost-avoidance benefits.
    (3) The degree to which the project will demonstrate the variety of 
operating conditions which are to be expected in the United States.
    (4) The degree to which the project will augment a Maglev corridor 
or network that has been identified, by any State, group of States, or 
the FRA, as having Partnership Potential.
    (b) Timely implementation. The speed with which the project can 
realistically be brought into full revenue service, based on the project 
description and on the current and projected development status of the 
Maglev technology selected by the applicant for the project.
    (c) Benefits for the American economy. The extent to which the 
project is expected to create new jobs in traditional and emerging 
industries in the United States.
    (d) Partnership potential. The degree to which the project 
description demonstrates Partnership Potential for the corridor in which 
it is involved, and/or for the project independently.
    (e) Funding limits and sources. (1) The extent and proportion to 
which States, regions, and localities commit to financially contributing 
to the project, both in terms of their own locally-raised, entirely non-
Federal funds, and in terms of commitments of scarce Federal resources 
from non-Maglev funds; and
    (2) The extent and proportion to which the private sector 
contributes financially to the project.

    Note to Sec. 268.17: FRA recognizes that applicants for 
preconstruction planning assistance may not have detailed information 
with respect to each of these criteria, and that the purpose of the 
preconstruction planning

[[Page 944]]

assistance is to develop much of this information with respect to a 
particular Maglev project. The preconstruction planning application 
requirements of this part 268 are designed to elicit whatever 
information an applicant may have pertaining to these criteria.


<R05>
Sec. 268.19  Evaluation of applications for preconstruction planning 

assistance.

    The FRA will evaluate the applications for their completeness and 
responsiveness to the requirements listed in Sec. 268.15. In addition, 
applicants are advised that the Maglev Deployment Program contains a 
number of project eligibility standards (minimum threshold standards) 
and project evaluation criteria that will guide the FRA's review of the 
project descriptions produced under the Planning Grants. The FRA's 
implementation of these standards and criteria appears in Sec. 268.11 
and Sec. 268.17, respectively. Although subject to revision, the 
information in Sec. 268.11 and Sec. 268.17 should assist the States in 
completing their applications in the competition for planning grants, 
since the project descriptions will need to respond to the standards and 
criteria. In evaluating the applications for planning grants, FRA will 
consider how consistent the applicant's project is to the standards and 
criteria, and the application's likelihood of leading to a project that 
meets all the standards and criteria.


<R05>
Sec. 268.21  Down-selection of one or more Maglev projects for further study 

and selection of one project for final design, engineering, and construction 

funding.

    (a) Upon completion of Phase III of the Maglev Deployment Program, 
FRA will down-select one or more projects to complete additional 
environmental studies, investment grade revenue forecasts, and other 
studies and analyses necessary prior to initiation of construction. 
Final design and engineering work will also be initiated for the down-
selected project(s). To be down-selected a project must appear to meet 
the project eligibility standards contained in Sec. 268.11 (b), rate 
highly in the project selection criteria specified in Sec. 268.17, be 
judged by FRA to have a good chance of being constructed with the 
Federal funds authorized for this program, and be successfully operated 
by a public/private partnership.
    (b) Only one project will be selected in Phase IV of the Maglev 
Deployment Program and be eligible for any Federal construction funds 
that Congress chooses to make available. That one project must meet each 
and every project eligibility standard contained in Sec. 268.11 (b). If 
more than one project down-selected in Phase III and funded through 
Phase IV meets all of these standards, then FRA will evaluate and 
compare the eligible projects according to the set of project selection 
criteria contained in Sec. 268.17.
    (c) In reviewing competing projects under the project eligibility 
standards and project selection criteria, the FRA will exercise 
particular vigilance regarding the following elements of the 
preconstruction planning process, although not to the exclusion of 
others:
    (1) The credibility of the demand and revenue forecasts, cost 
estimates, and benefit/cost comparisons; and
    (2) The credibility of the financial plan.
    (d) FRA intends to make periodic reviews of the processes and 
products of grant recipients. Such reviews may include, at the FRA's 
option, reviews at key milestones in the preparation of project 
descriptions.
