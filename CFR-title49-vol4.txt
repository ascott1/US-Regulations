                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1996), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec. 209.7  Subpoenas; witness fees.

    (a) The Chief Counsel may issue a subpoena on his or her own 
initiative in any matter related to enforcement of the railroad safety 
laws. However, where a proceeding under subpart B, C, or D of this part 
has been initiated, only the presiding officer may issue subpoenas, and 
only upon the written request of any party to the proceeding who makes 
an adequate showing that the information sought will materially advance 
the proceeding.
    (b) A subpoena may require attendance of a witness at a deposition 
or hearing or the production of documentary or other tangible evidence 
in the possession or control of the person served, or both.
    (c) A subpoena may be served personally by any person who is not an 
interested person and is not less than eighteen (18) years of age, or by 
certified or registered mail.
    (d) Service of a subpoena shall be made by delivering a copy of the 
subpoena in the appropriate manner, as set forth below. Service of a 
subpoena requiring attendance of a person is not complete unless 
delivery is accompanied by tender of fees for one day's attendance and 
mileage as specified by paragraph (f) of this section. However, when a 
subpoena is issued upon the request of any officer or agency of the 
United States, fees and mileage need not be tendered at the time of 
service but will be paid by FRA at the place and time specified in the 
subpoena for attendance.

Delivery of a copy of the subpoena may be made:
    (1) To a natural person by:
    (i) Handing it to the person;
    (ii) Leaving it at his or her office with the person in charge 
thereof;
    (iii) Leaving it at his or her dwelling place or usual place of 
abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing 
therein;
    (iv) Mailing it by registered or certified mail to him or her at his 
or her last known address; or
    (v) Any method whereby actual notice of the issuance and content is 
given (and the fees are made available) prior to the return date.
    (2) To an entity other than a natural person by:
    (i) Handing a copy of the subpoena to a registered agent for service 
or to any officer, director, or agent in charge of any office of the 
person;

[[Page 20]]

    (ii) Mailing it by registered or certified mail to any 
representative listed in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section at his or 
her last known address; or
    (iii) Any method whereby actual notice is given to such 
representative (and the fees are made available) prior to the return 
date.
    (e) The original subpoena bearing a certificate of service shall be 
filed in accordance with Sec. 209.9.
    (f) A witness subpoenaed by the FRA shall be entitled to the same 
fees and mileage as would be paid to a witness in a proceeding in the 
district courts of the United States. See 28 U.S.C. 1821. The witness 
fees and mileage shall be paid by the person requesting that the 
subpoena be issued. In an appropriate case, the Chief Counsel or the 
hearing officer may direct the person requesting issuance of a subpoena 
for the production of documentary or other tangible evidence to 
reimburse the responding person for actual costs of producing and/or 
transporting such evidence.
    (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section, 
and upon request, witness fees and mileage or the costs of producing 
other evidence may be paid by the FRA if the official who issued the 
subpoena determines on the basis of good cause shown that:
    (1) The presence of the subpoenaed witness or evidence will 
materially advance the proceedings; and
    (2) The party at whose instance the subpoena was issued would suffer 
a serious financial hardship if required to pay the witness fees and 
mileage.
    (h) Any person to whom a subpoena is directed may, prior to the time 
specified therein for compliance, but in no event more than ten (10) 
days after the date of service of such subpoena, apply in writing to the 
official who issued the subpoena, or if that person is unavailable, to 
the Chief Counsel, to quash or modify the subpoena. The application 
shall contain a brief statement of the reasons relied upon in support of 
the action sought therein. The issuing official or the Chief Counsel, as 
the case may be, may:
    (1) Deny the application;
    (2) Quash or modify the subpoena; or
    (3) In the case of subpoena to produce documentary or other tangible 
evidence, condition denial of the application upon the advancement by 
the party in whose behalf the subpoena is issued of the reasonable cost 
of producing the evidence.
    (i) If there is a refusal to obey a subpoena served upon any person 
under the provisions of this section, the FRA may request the Attorney 
General to seek the aid of the United States District Court for any 
district in which the person is found to compel that person, after 
notice, to appear and give testimony, or to appear and produce the

[[Page 21]]

cause exists to take a person's deposition when the information sought 
is relevant to the subject matter involved in the proceeding and:
    (1) The information is not obtainable from some other source that is 
more convenient, less burdensome, and less expensive; or
    (2) The request is not unreasonably cumulative, unduly burdensome, 
or unduly expensive, taking into account the needs of the case, 
limitations on the parties' resources, and the importance of the issues 
in the case.
    (c) Such notice as the presiding officer shall order will be given 
for the taking of a deposition, but this shall not be less than 10 days' 
written notice unless the parties agree to a shorter period.
    (d) Each witness testifying upon deposition shall be sworn and the 
adverse party shall have the right to cross-examine. The questions 
propounded and the answers thereto, together with all objections made, 
shall be reduced to writing, subscribed by the witness, and certified by 
the reporter.
    (e) Depositions taken under this section may be used for discovery, 
to contradict or impeach the testimony of the deponent as a witness, or 
as evidence in the proceeding as permitted by paragraph (f) of this 
section and in accordance with the limitations of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 32 
as though it were applicable to these proceedings.
    (f) Subject to such objections to the questions and answers as were 
noted at the time of taking the deposition and as would be valid were 
the witness personally present and testifying, such deposition may be 
offered in evidence by any party to the proceeding.

Sec. 209.11  Request for confidential treatment.

    (a) This section governs the procedures for requesting confidential 
treatment of any document filed with or otherwise provided to FRA in 
connecton with its enforcement of statutes related to railroad safety. 
For purposes of this section, ``enforcement'' shall include all 
investigative and compliance activities, in addition to the development 
of violation reports and recommendations for prosecution.
    (b) A request for confidential treatment with respect to a document 
or portion thereof may be made on the basis that the information is--
    (1) Exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirements of the Freedom 
of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552);
    (2) Required to be held in confidence by 18 U.S.C. 1905; or
    (3) Otherwise exempt by law from public disclosure.
    (c) Any document containing information for which confidential 
treatment is requested shall be accompanied at the time of filing by a 
statement justifying nondisclosure and referring to the specific legal 
authority claimed.
    (d) Any document containing any information for which confidential 
treatment is requested shall be marked ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or ``CONTAINS 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION'' in bold letters. If confidentiality is 
requested as to the entire document, or if it is claimed that 
nonconfidential information in the document is not reasonably segregable 
from confidential information, the accompanying statement of 
justification shall so indicate. If confidentiality is requested as to a 
portion of the document, then the person filing the document shall file 
together with the document a second copy of the document from which the 
information for which confidential treatment is requested has been 
deleted. If the person filing a document of which only a portion is 
requested to be held in confidence does not submit a second copy of the 
document with the confidential information deleted. FRA may assume that 
there is no objection

[[Page 22]]

to public disclosure of the document in its entirety.
    (e) FRA retains the right to make its own determination with regard 
to any claim of confidentiality. Notice of a decision by the FRA to deny 
a claim, in whole or in part, and an opportunity to respond shall be 
given to a person claiming confidentiality of information no less than 
five days prior to its public disclosure.

matter(s) pending against the same respondent or with any related 
matter(s) pending against other respondent(s) under the same subpart. 
However, on certification by the presiding officer that a consolidated 
proceeding is unmanageable or otherwise undesirable, the Chief Counsel 
will rescind or modify the consolidation.

<R05>
Sec. 209.103  Minimum and maximum penalties.

    A person who knowingly violates a requirement of subchapter A or C 
of chapter I, Subtitle B of this title is liable for a civil penalty of

<R05>
Sec. 209.105  Notice of probable violation.

    (a) FRA, through the Chief Counsel, begins a civil penalty 
proceeding by serving a notice of probable violation on a person 
charging him or her with having violated one or more provisions of 
subchapter A or C of chapter I, subtitle B of this title. Appendix B to 
this part contains guidelines used by the chief counsel in making 
initial penalty assessments.
    (b) A notice of probable violation issued under this section 
includes:
    (1) A statement of the provision(s) which the respondent is believed 
to have violated;
    (2) A statement of the factual allegations upon which the proposed 
civil penalty is being sought;

[[Page 23]]

explanations, information or any materials in answer to the charges or 
in mitigation of the penalty; and
    (7) A statement of the respondent's right to request a hearing and 
the procedures for requesting a hearing.
    (c) The FRA may amend the notice of probable violation at any time 
prior to the entry of an order assessing a civil penalty. If the 
amendment contains any new material allegation of fact, the respondent 
is given an opportunity to respond. In an amended notice, FRA may change 
the penalty amount proposed to be assessed up to and including the 
maximum penalty amount of $25,000 for each violation.

good cause shown.
    (c) Failure of the respondent to reply by taking one of the three 
actions described in paragraph (a) of this section within the period 
provided constitutes a waiver of his or her right to appear and contest 
the allegations and authorizes the Chief Counsel, without further notice 
to the respondent, to find the facts to be as alleged in the notice of 
probable violation and to assess an appropriate civil penalty.


<R05>
Sec. 209.109  Payment of penalty; compromise.

    (a) Payment of a civil penalty should be made by certified check or 
money order payable to the Federal Railroad Administration and sent to 
the Accounting Division, Federal Railroad Administration, Department of 
Transportation, Washington, DC 20590.
    (b) At any time before an order assessing a penalty is referred to 
the Attorney General for collection, the respondent may offer to 
compromise for a specific amount by contracting the Chief Counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 209.111  Informal response and assessment.

    (a) If a respondent elects to make an informal response to a notice 
of probable violation, respondent shall submit to the Chief Counsel such 
written explanations, information or other materials as respondent may 
desire in answer to the charges or in mitigation of the proposed 
penalty.
    (b) The respondent may include in his or her informal written 
response a request for a conference. Upon receipt of such a request, the 
Chief Counsel arranges for a conference as soon as practicable at a time 
and place of mutual convenience.
    (c) Written explanations, information or materials, submitted by the 
respondent and relevant information presented during any conference held 
under this section are considered by the Chief Counsel in reviewing the 
notice of proposed violation and determining the fact of violation and 
the amount of any penalty to be assessed.
    (d) After consideration of an informal response, including any 
relevant information presented at a conference, the Chief Counsel may 
dismiss the notice of probable violation in whole or in part. If he or 
she does not dismiss it in whole, he or she may issue an order assessing 
a civil penalty.

signing the request if different from the respondent;
    (2) State with respect to each allegation whether it is admitted or 
denied; and
    (3) State with particularity the issues to be raised by the

of paragraph (a) of this section, the Chief Counsel schedules a hearing 
for the earliest practicable date.
    (c) The Chief Counsel or the hearing officer appointed under 
Sec. 209.115 may grant extensions of the time of the commencement of the 
hearing for good cause shown.

    (a) When a hearing is requested and scheduled under Sec. 209.113, a 
hearing officer designated by the Chief Counsel convenes and presides 
over the hearing. If requested by respondent and if practicable, the 
hearing is held in the general vicinity of the place where the alleged 
violation occurred, or at a place convenient to the respondent.

in the notice of proposed violation and may offer such relevant 
information as may be necessary fully to inform the presiding officer as 
to the matter concerned.
    (d) The respondent may appear and be heard on his or her own behalf 
or through counsel of his or her choice. The respondent or his or her 
counsel may offer relevant information including testimony which he or 
she believes should be considered in defense of the allegations or which 
may bear on the penalty proposed to be assessed and conduct such cross-
examination as may be required for a full disclosure of the material 
facts.

hearing officer shall provide, the parties may file proposed findings 
and conclusions, together with supporting reasons.

Sec. 209.117  Presiding officer's decision.

    (a) After consideration of the evidence of record, the presiding 
officer may dismiss the notice of probable violation in whole or in

Sec. 209.131  Criminal penalties generally.

    The Federal hazardous materials transportation safety laws (49 
U.S.C. 5124) provide a criminal penalty of a fine under title 18, United 
States Code, and imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or both, for 
any person who knowingly violates 49 U.S.C. 5104(b) or who willfully 
violates chapter 51 of title 49, United States Code, or a regulation

212 of this chapter, or other employee of FRA becomes aware of a 
possible willful violation of the Federal hazardous materials 
transportation safety laws (49 U.S.C. Chapter 51) or a regulation issued 
under those laws for which FRA exercises enforcement responsibility, he 
or she reports it to the Chief Counsel. If evidence exists tending to 
establish a prima facie case, and if it appears that assessment of a 
civil penalty would not be an adequate deterrent to future violations, 
the Chief Counsel refers the report to the Department of Justice for 
criminal prosecution of the offender.

issuance of compliance orders pursuant to the Federal railroad safety 
laws at 49 U.S.C. 5121(a) and/or 20111(b).
    (b) The FRA may commence a proceeding under this subpart when FRA 
has reason to believe that a person is engaging in conduct or a pattern 
of conduct that involves one or more violations of the Federal railroad 
safety laws or any regulation or order issued under those laws for which 
FRA exercises enforcement authority.

[61 FR 38647, July 25, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 209.203  Notice of investigation.

    (a) FRA begins a compliance order proceeding by serving a notice of 
investigation on the respondent.
    (b) The notice of investigation contains:
    (1) A statement of the legal authority for the proceeding;
    (2) A statement of the factual allegations upon which the remedial 
action is being sought; and
    (3) A statement of the remedial action being sought in the form of a 
proposed compliance order.
    (c) The FRA may amend the notice of investigation at any time prior 
to the entry of a final compliance order. If an amendment includes any 
new material allegation of fact or seeks new or additional remedial 
action, the respondent is given an opportunity to respond.


<R05>
Sec. 209.205  Reply.

    (a) Within thirty (30) days of service of a notice of investigation, 
the respondent may file a reply with the FRA. The Chief Counsel may 
extend the time for filing for good cause shown.

[[Page 26]]

    (b) The reply must be in writing, signed by the person filing it, 
and state with respect to each factual allegation whether it is admitted 
or denied. Even though formally denied, a factual allegation set forth 
in a notice of investigation is considered to be admitted for purposes 
of the proceeding unless:
    (1) Opposed by the affidavit of an individual having personal 
knowledge of the subject matter;
    (2) Challenged as defective on its face together with a supporting 
explanation as to why it is believed to be defective; or
    (3) Otherwise actively put at issue through the submission of 
relevant evidence.
    (c) The reply must set forth any affirmative defenses and include a 
statement of the form and nature of proof by which those defenses are to 
be established.
    (d) If it is necessary to respond to an amendment to the notice of 
investigation, the respondent may amend the reply concerning the 
substance of matters contained in the amendment to the notice at any 
time before the issuance of an order under Sec. 209.211.
    (e) If the respondent elects not to contest one or more factual 
allegations, he or she should so state in the reply. An election not to 
contest a factual allegation is an admission of that allegation solely 
for the purpose of issuing a compliance order. That election constitutes 
a waiver of hearing as to that allegation but does not, by itself, 
constitute a waiver of the right to be heard on other issues. In 
connection with a statement of election not to contest a factual 
allegation, the respondent may propose an appropriate order for issuance 
by the Administrator or propose the negotiation of a consent order.
    (f) Failure of the respondent to file a reply within the period 
provided constitutes a waiver of his or her right to appear and contest 
the allegation and authorizes the Administrator, without further notice 
to the respondent, to find the facts to be as alleged in the notice of 
proposed violation and to issue an appropriate order directing 
compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 209.207  Consent order.

    (a) At any time before the issuance of an order under Sec. 209.211, 
the Chief Counsel and the respondent may execute an agreement proposing 
the entry by consent of an order directing compliance. The Administrator 
may accept the proposed order by signing it. If the Administrator 
rejects the proposed order, he or she directs that the proceeding 
continue.
    (b) An agreement submitted to the Administrator under this section 
must include:
    (1) A proposed compliance order suitable for the Administrator's 
signature;
    (2) An admission of all jurisdictional facts;
    (3) An express waiver of further procedural steps and of all right 
to seek judicial review or otherwise challenge or contest the validity 
of the order; and
    (4) An acknowledgment that the notice of investigation may be used 
to construe the terms of the order.


<R05>
Sec. 209.209  Hearing.

    (a) When a respondent files a reply contesting allegations in a 
notice of investigation issued under Sec. 209.203 or when the FRA and 
the respondent fail to agree upon an acceptable consent order, the 
hearing officer designated by the Chief Counsel convenes and presides 
over a hearing on the proposed compliance order.
    (b) The presiding official may:
    (1) Administer oaths and affirmations;
    (2) Issue subpoenas as provided by Sec. 209.7;
    (3) Adopt procedures for the submission of evidence;
    (4) Take or cause depositions to be taken;
    (5) Rule on offers of proof and receive relevant evidence;
    (6) Examine witnesses at the hearing;
    (7) Convene, recess, reconvene, ad- journ and otherwise regulate the 
course of the hearing;
    (8) Hold conferences for settlement, simplification of the issues or 
any other proper purpose; and
    (9) Take any other action authorized by or consistent with the 
provisions of this subpart pertaining to compliance orders and permitted 
by law which may

[[Page 27]]

expedite the hearing or aid in the disposition of an issue raised 
therein.
    (c) The Chief Counsel has the burden of providing the facts alleged 
in the notice of investigation and may offer such relevant information 
as may be necessary fully to inform the presiding officer as to the 
matter concerned.
    (d) The respondent may appear and be heard on his or her own behalf 
or through counsel of his or her choice. The respondent or his or her 
counsel may offer relevant information, including testimony which he or 
she believes should be considered in defense of the allegations or which 
may bear on the remedial action being sought, and conduct such cross-
examination as may be required for a full disclosure of the material 
facts.
    (e) At the conclusion of the hearing or as soon thereafter as the 
hearing officer shall provide, the parties may file proposed findings 
and conclusions, together with supporting reasons therefor.


<R05>
Sec. 209.211  Presiding officer's decision.

    (a) After consideration of evidence, the presiding officer may 
dismiss the notice of investigation or issue a compliance order. The 
decision of the presiding officer will include a statement of findings 
and conclusions as well as the reasons therefor on all material issues 
of fact, law, and discretion.
    (b) A compliance order issued under this section is effective twenty 
(20) days from service on the respondent unless otherwise provided 
therein.


<R05>
Sec. 209.213  Appeal.

    (a) Any party aggrieved by a presiding officer's decision may file 
an appeal with the Administrator. The appeal must be filed within twenty

    (b) Prior to rendering a final determination on an appeal, the 
Administrator may remand the case for further proceedings before the 
hearing officer.
    (c) The filing of an appeal does not stay the effectiveness of a 
compliance order unless the Administrator expressly so provides.

<R05>
Sec. 209.301  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart prescribes the rules of practice for administrative 
proceedings relating to the determination of an individual's fitness for 
performing safety-sensitive functions under section 209(f) of the 
Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 438(f)).
    (b) The purpose of this subpart is to prevent accidents and 
casualties in railroad operations that result from the presence in the 
work force of railroad employees, including managers and supervisors, 
and agents of railroads who have demonstrated their unfitness to perform 
the safety-sensitive functions described in Sec. 209.303 by violating 
any rule, regulation, order or standard prescribed by FRA. Employees and 
agents who evidence such unfitness may be disqualified, under specified 
terms and conditions, temporarily or permanently, from performing such 
safety-sensitive functions.
    (c) This subpart does not preempt a railroad from initiating 
disciplinary proceedings and imposing disciplinary sanctions against its 
employees, including managers and supervisors, under its collective 
bargaining agreements or in the normal and customary manner. 
Disqualification determinations made under this subpart shall have no 
effect on prior or subsequent disciplinary actions taken against such 
employees by railroads.


<R05>
Sec. 209.303  Coverage.

    This subpart applies to the following individuals:
    (a) Railroad employees who are assigned to perform service subject 
to the Hours of Service Act (45 U.S.C. 61-64b) during a duty tour, 
whether or not the

[[Page 28]]

person has performed or is currently performing such service, and any 
person who performs such service.
    (b) Railroad employees or agents who:
    (1) Inspect, install, repair, or maintain track and roadbed;
    (2) Inspect, repair or maintain, locomotives, passenger cars, and 
freight cars;
    (3) Conduct training and testing of employees when the training or 
testing is required by the FRA's safety regulations; or
    (c) Railroad managers, supervisors, or agents when they:
    (1) Perform the safety-sensitive functions listed in paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section;
    (2) Supervise and otherwise direct the performance of the safety-
sensitive functions listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section; or
    (3) Are in a position to direct the commission of violations of any 
of the requirements of parts 213 through 236 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 209.305  Notice of proposed disqualification.

    (a) FRA, through the Chief Counsel, begins a disqualification 
proceeding by serving a notice of proposed disqualification on the 
respondent charging him or her with having violated one or more rules, 
regulations, orders, or standards promulgated by FRA, which render the 
respondent unfit to perform safety-sensitive functions described in 
Sec. 209.303.
    (b) The notice of proposed disqualification issued under this 
section shall contain:
    (1) A statement of the rule(s), regulation(s), order(s), or 
standard(s) that the respondent is alleged to have violated;
    (2) A statement of the factual allegations that form the basis of 
the initial determination that the respondent is not fit to perform 
safety-sensitive functions;
    (3) A statement of the effective date, duration, and other 
conditions, if any, of the disqualification order;
    (4) A statement of the respondent's right to answer the charges in 
writing and furnish affidavits and any other documentary evidence in 
support of the answer;
    (5) A statement of the respondent's right to make an informal 
response to the Chief Counsel;
    (6) A statement of the respondent's right to request a hearing and 
the procedures for requesting a hearing;
    (7) A statement of the respondent's right to counsel or other 
designated representative; and
    (8) Notice of the consequences of the respondent's failure to take 
any of the actions described in Sec. 209.307(a).
    (c) The Chief Counsel shall enclose with the notice of proposed 
disqualification a copy of the material that is relied on in support of 
the charges. Nothing in this section precludes the Chief Counsel from 
presenting at a subsequent hearing under Sec. 209.321 any evidence of 
the charges set forth in the notice that the Chief Counsel acquires 
after service thereof on the respondent. The Chief Counsel, however, 
shall serve a copy of any such evidence on the respondent at or before 
the prehearing conference required under Sec. 209.319. Failure to 
furnish such evidence to respondent at or before the prehearing 
conference bars its introduction at the hearing.
    (d) The Chief Counsel shall provide a copy of the notice of proposed 
disqualification to the railroad that employs the respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 209.307  Reply.

    (a) Within 30 days after receipt of the notice of proposed 
disqualification issued under Sec. 209.305, the respondent shall reply 
in writing to the charges. The respondent may furnish affidavits and any 
other documentary evidence in support of the reply. Further, the 
respondent may elect to--
    (1) Stipulate to the charges and consent to the imposition of the 
disqualification order under the conditions set forth in the notice;
    (2) Make an informal response as provided in Sec. 209.309; or
    (3) Request a hearing as provided in Sec. 209.311.
    (b) The Chief Counsel may extend the reply period for good cause 
shown, provided the request for extension is served before the 
expiration of the period provided in paragraph (a) of this section.

[[Page 29]]

    (c) Failure of the respondent to reply to the notice of proposed 
disqualification within the period provided in paragraph (a) of this 
section or an extension thereto provided under paragraph (b) of this 
section constitutes a waiver of the respondent's right to appear and 
contest the charges or the proposed disqualification. Respondent's 
failure to reply authorizes the Chief Counsel, without further notice to 
the respondent, to find the respondent unfit for the performance of the 
safety-sensitive functions described in Sec. 209.303 and to order the 
respondent disqualified from performing them for the period and under 
the other conditions described in the notice of proposed 
disqualification. The Chief Counsel shall serve respondent with the 
disqualification order and provide a copy of the order to the railroad 
by which the respondent is employed.


<R05>
Sec. 209.309  Informal response.

    (a) If the respondent elects to make an informal response to a 
notice of proposed disqualification, he or she shall submit to the Chief 
Counsel such written explanations, information, or other materials as 
respondent may desire in answer to the charges or in mitigation of the 
proposed disqualification.
    (b) The respondent may include in an informal written response a 
request for a conference. Upon receipt of such a request, the Chief 
Counsel shall arrange for a conference at a time and place designated by 
the Chief Counsel.
    (c) Written explanations, information, or materials submitted by the 
respondent and relevant information presented during any conference held 
under this section shall be considered by the Chief Counsel in reviewing 
the notice of proposed disqualification, including the question of the 
respondent's fitness and the conditions of any disqualification that may 
be imposed.
    (d) After consideration of an informal response, including any 
relevant information presented at a conference, the Chief Counsel shall 
take one of the following actions:
    (1) Dismiss all the charges and terminate the notice of proposed 
disqualification;
    (2) Dismiss some of the charges and mitigate the proposed 
disqualification;
    (3) Mitigate the proposed disqualification; or
    (4) Sustain the charges and proposed disqualification.
    (e) Should the Chief Counsel sustain, in whole or in part, the 
charges and proposed disqualification and reach settlement with the 
respondent, the Chief Counsel shall issue an appropriate 
disqualification order reflecting the settlement and shall provide a 
copy of that order to the railroad by which the respondent is employed. 
The duration of the disqualification period may be less than, but shall 
be no greater than, the period set forth in the notice. Any settlement 
reached shall be evidenced by a written agreement, which shall include 
declarations from the respondent stipulating to the charges contained in 
the disqualification order, consenting to the imposition of the 
disqualification under the conditions set forth in the disqualification 
order, and waiving his or her right to a hearing.
    (f) If settlement of the charges against the respondent is not 
achieved, the Chief Counsel shall terminate settlement discussions no 
later than 30 days from service of the informal response upon the Chief 
Counsel by serving respondent written notice of termination of 
settlement negotiations.
    (g) By electing to make an informal response to a notice of proposed 
disqualification, the respondent does not waive the right to a hearing. 
However, the respondent must submit the hearing request required by 
Sec. 209.311(a) within l0 days after receipt of the notice of 
termination of settlement negotiations from the Chief Counsel. Failure 
to submit such a request constitutes a waiver of the respondent's right 
to appear and contest the charges or the proposed disqualification.
    (h) The Chief Counsel may extend the period for requesting a hearing 
for good cause shown, provided the request for extension is served 
before the expiration of the period provided in paragraph (g) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 209.311  Request for hearing.

    (a) If the respondent elects to request a hearing, he or she must 
submit a written request within the time periods specified in 
Sec. 209.307(a) or Sec. 209.309(g) to the Chief Counsel referring to the 
case

[[Page 30]]

number that appears on the notice of proposed disqualification. The 
request must contain the following:
    (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the respondent and of 
the respondent's designated representative, if any;
    (2) A specific response admitting, denying, or explaining each 
allegation of the notice of disqualification order.
    (3) A description of the claims and defenses to be raised by the 
respondent at the hearing; and
    (4) The signature of the respondent or the representative, if any.
    (b) Upon receipt of a request for a hearing complying with the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the Chief Counsel shall 
arrange for the appointment of a presiding officer and transmit the 
disqualification file to the presiding officer, who shall schedule the 
hearing for the earliest practicable date within the time period set by 
Sec. 209.321(a) of this subpart.
    (c) Upon assignment of a presiding officer, further matters in the 
proceeding generally are conducted by and through the presiding officer, 
except that the Chief Counsel and respondent may settle or voluntarily 
dismiss the case without order of the presiding officer. The Chief 
Counsel shall promptly notify the presiding officer of any settlement or 
dismissal of the case.


<R05>
Sec. 209.313  Discovery.

    (a) Disqualification proceedings shall be conducted as expeditiously 
as possible with due regard to the rights of the parties. Discovery is 
designed to enable a party to obtain relevant information needed for 
preparation of the party's case. These regulations are intended to 
provide a simple, timely, and relatively economical system for 
discovery. They shall be interpreted and applied so as to avoid delay 
and facilitate adjudication of the case.
    (b) Discovery may be obtained by requests for admission under 
Sec. 209.6, requests for production of documentary or other tangible 
evidence under Sec. 209.7, and depositions under Sec. 209.8.
    (c) A party may initiate the methods of discovery permitted under 
paragraph (b) of this section at any time after respondent requests a 
hearing under Sec. 209.311.
    (d) Discovery shall be completed within 90 days after receipt of 
respondent's request for a hearing under Sec. 209.311. Upon motion for 
good cause shown, the presiding officer may extend this time period for 
an additional 30 days. The presiding officer may grant an additional 30 
day extension only when the party requesting the extension shows by 
clear and convincing evidence that the party was unable to complete 
discovery within the prescribed time period through no fault or lack of 
due diligence of such party, and that denial of the request would result 
in irreparable prejudice.
    (e) If a party fails to comply with a discovery order or an order to 
compel, the presiding officer may:
    (1) Strike any appropriate part of the pleadings or other 
submissions of the party failing to comply with such order;
    (2) Prohibit the party failing to comply with such order from 
introducing evidence relating to the information sought;
    (3) Draw an inference in favor of the requesting party with regard 
to the information sought; and
    (4) Permit the requesting party to introduce secondary evidence 
concerning the information sought.


<R05>
Sec. 209.315  Subpoenas.

    Once a notice of proposed disqualification has been issued in a 
particular matter, only the presiding officer may issue, deny, quash, or 
modify subpoenas under this subpart in accordance with Sec. 209.7.


<R05>
Sec. 209.317  Official record.

    The notice of proposed disqualification, respondent's reply, 
exhibits, and verbatim record of testimony, if a hearing is held, and 
all pleadings, stipulations, and admissions filed and rulings and orders 
entered in the course of the proceeding shall constitute the exclusive 
and official record.


<R05>
Sec. 209.319  Prehearing conference.

    (a) The parties shall confer with the presiding officer, either in 
person or by telephone, for a conference at least 10 days before the 
hearing to consider:
    (1) Formulation and simplification of the issues;

[[Page 31]]

    (2) Stipulations, admissions of fact, and admissions of the contents 
and authenticity of documents;
    (3) Advance rulings from the presiding officer on the admissibility 
of evidence;
    (4) Identification of witnesses, including the scope of their 
testimony, and of hearing exhibits;
    (5) Possibility of settlement; and
    (6) Such other matters as the presiding officer deems necessary to 
expedite the disposition of the proceeding.
    (b) The record shall show the matters disposed of by order and by 
agreement in such a prehearing conference. The subsequent course of the 
hearing shall be controlled by such action.
    (c) The prehearing conference shall be held within 150 days after 
receipt of respondent's request for a hearing under Sec. 209.311.


<R05>
Sec. 209.321  Hearing.

    (a) Upon receipt of a hearing request complying with Sec. 209.311, 
an administrative hearing for review of a notice of proposed 
disqualification shall be conducted by a presiding officer, who can be 
any person authorized by the FRA Administrator, including an 
administrative law judge. The hearing shall begin within 180 days from 
receipt of respondent's hearing request. Notice of the time and place of 
the hearing shall be given to the parties at least 20 days before the 
hearing. Testimony by witnesses shall be given under oath and the 
hearing shall be recorded verbatim. The hearing shall be open to the 
public, unless the presiding official determines that it would be in the 
best interests of the respondent, a witness, or other affected persons, 
to close all or any part of it. If the presiding official makes such a 
determination, an appropriate order, which sets forth the reasons 
therefor, shall be entered.
    (b) The presiding officer may:
    (1) Administer oaths and affirmations;
    (2) Issue subpoenas as provided by Sec. 209.7;
    (3) Adopt procedures for the submission of evidence in written form;
    (4) Take or cause depositions to be taken as provided in Sec. 209.8;
    (5) Rule on offers of proof and receive relevant evidence;
    (6) Examine witnesses at the hearing;
    (7) Convene, recess, reconvene, adjourn, and otherwise regulate the 
course of the hearing;
    (8) Hold conferences for settlement, simplification of the issues, 
or any other proper purpose; and
    (9) Take any other action authorized by or consistent with the 
provisions of this subpart and permitted by law that may expedite the 
hearing or aid in the disposition of an issue raised therein.
    (c) FRA has the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, 
as to the facts alleged in the notice of proposed disqualification, the 
reasonableness of the conditions of the qualification proposed, and, 
except as provided in Sec. 209.329(a), the respondent's lack of fitness 
to perform safety-sensitive functions. The Chief Counsel may offer 
relevant evidence, including testimony, in support of the allegations 
contained in the notice of proposed disqualification and conduct such 
cross-examination as may be required for a full disclosure of the 
material facts.
    (d) The respondent may appear and be heard on respondent's own 
behalf or through respondent's designated representative. The respondent 
may offer relevant evidence, including testimony, in defense of the 
allegations or in mitigation of the proposed disqualification and 
conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full disclosure 
of the material facts. Respondent has the burden of proof, by a 
preponderance of the evidence, as to any affirmative defense, including 
that respondent's actions were in obedience to the direct order of a 
railroad supervisor or higher level official.
    (e) The record shall be closed at the conclusion of the hearing, 
unless the parties request the opportunity to submit proposed findings 
and conclusions. When the presiding officer allows the parties to submit 
proposed findings and conclusions, documents previously identified for 
introduction into evidence, briefs, or other posthearing submissions the 
record shall be left open for such time as the presiding officer grants 
for that purpose.

the closing of the record. The initial decision may dismiss the notice 
of proposed disqualification, in whole or in part, sustain the charges 
and proposed disqualification, or sustain the charges and mitigate the 
proposed disqualification.
    (b) If the presiding officer sustains the charges and the proposed 
disqualification, dismisses some of the charges, or mitigates the 
proposed disqualification, the presiding officer shall issue and serve 
an appropriate order disqualifying respondent from engaging in the 
safety-sensitive functions described in Sec. 209.303. If the presiding 
officer dismisses all of the charges set forth in notice of proposed 
disqualification, a dismissal order shall be issued and served.

    (a) The initial decision of the presiding officer shall become final 
35 days after issuance. Such decisions are not precedent.
    (b) Exception. The initial decision shall not become final if, 
within 35 days after issuance of the decision, any party files an appeal

may grant the parties an opportunity for oral argument.
    (e) The Administrator may affirm, reverse, alter, or modify the 
decision of the presiding officer, or may remand the case for further 
proceedings before the presiding officer. The Administrator shall inform

    (f) The decision of the Administrator is final, constitutes final 
agency action, and is not subject to further administrative review.


<R05>
Sec. 209.329  Assessment considerations.

    (a) Proof of a respondent's willful violation of one of the 
requirements of parts 213 through 236 (excluding parts

[[Page 33]]

225, 228, and 233) of this title establishes a rebuttable presumption 
that the respondent is unfit to perform the safety-sensitive functions 
described in Sec. 209.303. Where such presumption arises, the respondent 
has the burden of establishing that, taking account of the factors in 
paragraph (b) of this section, he or she is fit to perform the foregoing 
safety-sensitive functions for the period and under the other 
conditions, if any, proposed in the notice of proposed disqualification.
    (b) In determining respondent's lack of fitness to perform safety-
sensitive functions and the duration and other conditions, if any, of 
appropriate disqualification orders under Secs. 209.309, 209.323, and 
209.327, the factors to be considered, to the extent: Each is pertinent 
to the respondent's case, include but are not limited to the following:
    (1) The nature and circumstances of the violation, including whether 
the violation was intentional, technical, or inadvertent, was committed 
willfully, or was frequently repeated;
    (2) The adverse impact or the potentially adverse impact of the 
violation on the health and safety of persons and the safety of 
property;
    (3) The railroad's operating rules, safety rules, and repair and 
maintenance standards;
    (4) Repair and maintenance standards adopted by the industry;
    (5) The consistency of the conditions of the proposed 
disqualification with disqualification orders issued against other 
employees for the same or similar violations;
    (6) Whether the respondent was on notice of any safety regulations 
that were violated or whether the respondent had been warned about the 
conduct in question;
    (7) The respondent's past record of committing violations of safety 
regulations, including previous FRA warnings issued, disqualifications 
imposed, civil penalties assessed, railroad disciplinary actions, and 
criminal convictions therefor;
    (8) The civil penalty scheduled for the violation of the safety 
regulation in question;
    (9) Mitigating circumstances surrounding the violation, such as the 
existence of an emergency situation endangering persons or property and 
the need for the respondent to take immediate action; and
    (10) Such other factors as may be warranted in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 209.331   Enforcement of disqualification order.

    (a) A railroad that employs or formerly employed an individual 
serving under a disqualification order shall inform prospective or 
actual employers of the terms and conditions of the order upon receiving 
notice that the disqualified employee is being considered for employment 
with or is employed by another railroad to perform any of the safety-
sensitive functions described in Sec. 209.303.
    (b) A railroad that is considering hiring an individual to perform 
the safety-sensitive functions described in Sec. 209.303 shall ascertain 
from the individual's previous employer, if such employer was a 
railroad, whether the individual is subject to a disqualification order.
    (c) An individual subject to a disqualification order shall inform 
his or her employer of the order and provide a copy thereof within 5 
days after receipt of the order. Such an individual shall likewise 
inform any prospective employer who is considering hiring the individual 
to perform any of the safety-sensitive functions described in 
Sec. 209.303 of the order and provide a copy thereof within 5 days after 
receipt of the order or upon application for the position, whichever 
first occurs.


<R05>
Sec. 209.333   Prohibitions.

    (a) An individual subject to a disqualification order shall not work 
for any railroad in any manner inconsistent with the order.
    (b) A railroad shall not employ any individual subject to a 
disqualification order in any manner inconsistent with the order.


<R05>
Sec. 209.335   Penalties.

<R04>
                Subpart E--Reporting of Remedial Actions

    Source: 59 FR 43676, Aug. 24, 1994, unless otherwise noted.

<R05>
Sec. 209.401  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of this subpart is to prevent accidents and 
casualties arising from the operation of a railroad that result from a 
railroad's failure to remedy certain violations of the Federal railroad 
safety laws for which assessment of a civil penalty has been 
recommended.
    (b) To achieve this purpose, this subpart requires that if an FRA 
Safety Inspector notifies a railroad both that assessment of a civil 
penalty will be recommended for its failure to comply with a provision 
of the Federal railroad safety laws and that a remedial actions report 
must be submitted, the railroad shall report to the FRA Safety 
Inspector, within 30 days after the end of the calendar month in which 
such notification is received, actions taken to remedy that failure.
    (c) This subpart does not relieve the railroad of the underlying 
responsibility to comply with a provision of the Federal railroad safety 
laws. The 30-day period after the end of the calendar month in which 
notification is received is intended merely to provide the railroad with 
an opportunity to prepare its report to FRA, and does not excuse 
continued noncompliance.
    (d) This subpart requires the submission of remedial actions reports 
for the general categories of physical defects, recordkeeping and 
reporting violations, and filing violations, where the railroad can 
literally and specifically correct a failure to comply with a provision 
of the Federal railroad safety laws, as reasonably determined by the FRA 
Safety Inspector. No railroad is required to submit a report for a 
failure involving either a completed or past transaction or a 
transaction that it can no longer remedy.


<R05>
Sec. 209.403  Applicability.

    This subpart applies to any railroad that receives written 
notification from an FRA Safety Inspector both (i) that assessment of a 
civil penalty will be recommended for its failure to comply with a 
provision of the Federal railroad safety laws and (ii) that it must 
submit a remedial actions report.


<R05>
Sec. 209.405  Reporting of remedial actions.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 209.407, each railroad that has 
received written notification on Form FRA F 6180.96 from an FRA Safety 
Inspector both that assessment of a civil penalty will be recommended 
for the railroad's failure to comply with a provision of the Federal 
railroad safety laws and that it must submit a remedial actions report, 
shall report on this form all actions that it takes to remedy that 
failure. The railroad shall submit the completed form to the FRA Safety 
Inspector within 30 days after the end of the calendar month in which 
the notification is received.
    (1) Date of receipt of notification. If the FRA Safety Inspector 
provides written notification to the railroad by first class mail, then 
for purposes of determining the calendar month in which notification is 
received, the railroad shall be presumed to have received the 
notification five business days following the date of mailing.
    (2) Completion of Form FRA F 6180.96, including selection of 
railroad remedial action code. Each railroad shall complete the remedial 
actions report in the manner prescribed on the report form. The railroad 
shall select the one remedial action code on the reporting form

[[Page 35]]

that most accurately reflects the action or actions that it took to 
remedy the failure, such as, repair or replacement of a defective 
component without movement, movement of a locomotive or car for repair 
(where permitted) and its subsequent repair, completion of a required 
test or inspection, removal of a noncomplying item from service but not 
for repair (where permitted), reduction of operating speed (where 
sufficient to achieve compliance), or any combination of actions 
appropriate to remedy the noncompliance cited. Any railroad selecting 
the remedial action code ``other remedial actions'' shall also furnish 
FRA with a brief narrative description of the action or actions taken.
    (3) Submission of Form FRA F 6180.96. The railroad shall return the 
form by first class mail to the FRA Safety Inspector whose name and 
address appear on the form.
    (b) Any railroad concluding that the violation alleged on the 
inspection report may not have occurred may submit the remedial actions 
report with an appropriate written explanation. Failure to raise all 
pertinent defenses does not foreclose the railroad from doing so in 
response to a penalty demand.


<R05>
Sec. 209.407  Delayed reports.

    (a) If a railroad cannot initiate or complete remedial actions 
within 30 days after the end of the calendar month in which the 
notification is received, it shall--
    (1) Prepare, in writing, an explanation of the reasons for such 
delay and a good faith estimate of the date by which it will complete 
the remedial actions, stating the name and job title of the preparer and 
including either:
    (i) A photocopy of both sides of the Form FRA F 6180.96 on which the 
railroad received notification; or
    (ii) The following information:
    (A) The inspection report number;
    (B) The inspection date; and
    (C) The item number; and
    (2) Sign, date, and submit such written explanation and estimate, by 
first class mail, to the FRA Safety Inspector whose name and address 
appear on the notification, within 30 days after the end of the calendar 
month in which the notification is received.
    (b) Within 30 days after the end of the calendar month in which all 
such remedial actions are completed, the railroad shall report in 
accordance with the remedial action code procedures referenced in 
Sec. 209.405(a). The additional time provided by this section for a 
railroad to submit a delayed report shall not excuse it from liability 
for any continuing violation of a provision of the Federal railroad 
safety laws.


<R05>
Sec. 209.409  Penalties.

    Any person who violates any requirement of this subpart or causes 
the violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil penalty of 
at least $500 and not more than $10,000 per violation, except that: 
Penalties may be assessed against individuals only for willful 
violations, and, where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of 
repeated violations has created an imminent hazard of death or injury to 
persons, or has caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $20,000 
per violation may be assessed. Each day a violation continues shall 
constitute a separate offense. A person may also be subject to the 
criminal penalties provided for in 49 U.S.C. 21311 (formerly codified in 
45 U.S.C. 438(e)) for knowingly and willfully falsifying reports 
required by this subpart.
Appendix A to Part 209--Interim Statement of Agency Policy Concerning 
Enforcement of the Federal Railroad Safety Laws
    The Federal Railroad Administration (``fra'') enforces the federal 
railroad safety statutes under delegation from the Secretary of 
Transportation. See 49 CFR 1.49 (c), (d), (f), (g), and (m). Those 
statutes include the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (``Safety 
Act''), 45 U.S.C. 421 et seq., and a group of statutes enacted prior to 
1970 referred to collectively herein as the ``older safety statutes'': 
The Safety Appliance Acts, 45 U.S.C. 1-16; the Locomotive Inspection 
Act, 45 U.S.C. 22-34; the Accident Reports Act, 45 U.S.C. 38-43; the 
Hours of Service Act, 45 U.S.C. 61-64b; and the Signal Inspection Act, 
49 App. U.S.C. 26. Regulations implementing those statutes are found at 
49 CFR parts 213 through 236. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988 
(Pub. L. No. 100-342, enacted June 22, 1988) (``RSIA'') raised the 
maximum civil penalties available under the railroad safety laws and 
made individuals liable for willful violations of those laws. FRA also 
enforces the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, 49 App. U.S.C. 1801 
et seq., as it pertains to

[[Page 36]]

the shipment or transportation of hazardous materials by rail.

                        The Civil Penalty Process

    The front lines in the civil penalty process are the FRA safety 
inspectors: FRA employs over 300 inspectors, and their work is 
supplemented by approximately 100 inspectors from states participating 
in enforcement of the federal rail safety laws. These inspectors 
routinely inspect the equipment, track, and signal systems and observe 
the operations of the nation's railroads. They also investigate hundreds 
of complaints filed annually by those alleging noncompliance with the 
laws. When inspection or complaint investigation reveals noncompliance 
with the laws, each noncomplying condition or action is listed on an 
inspection report. Where the inspector determines that the best method 
of promoting compliance is to assess a civil penalty, he or she prepares 
a violation report, which is essentially a recommendation to the FRA 
Office of Chief Counsel to assess a penalty based on the evidence 
provided in or with the report.
    In determining which instances of noncompliance merit penalty 
recommendations, the inspector considers:
    (1) The inherent seriousness of the condition or action;
    (2) The kind and degree of potential safety hazard the condition or 
action poses in light of the immediate factual situation;
    (3) Any actual harm to persons or property already caused by the 
condition or action;
    (4) The offending person's (i.e., railroad's or individual's) 
general level of current compliance as revealed by the inspection as a 
whole;
    (5) The person's recent history of compliance with the relevant set 
of regulations, especially at the specific location or division of the 
railroad involved;
    (6) Whether a remedy other than a civil penalty (ranging from a 
warning on up to an emergency order) is more appropriate under all of 
the facts; and
    (7) Such other factors as the immediate circumstances make relevant.
    The civil penalty recommendation is reviewed at the regional level 
by a specialist in the subject matter involved, who requires correction 
of any technical flaws and determines whether the recommendation is 
consistent with national enforcement policy in similar circumstances. 
Guidance on that policy in close cases is sometimes sought from Office 
of Safety headquarters. Violation reports that are technically and 
legally sufficient and in accord with FRA policy are sent from the 
regional office to the Office of Chief Counsel.
    The exercise of this discretion at the field and regional levels is 
a vital part of the enforcement process, ensuring that the exacting and 
time-consuming civil penalty process is used to address those situations 
most in need of the deterrent effect of penalties. FRA exercises that 
discretion with regard to individual violators in the same manner it 
does with respect to railroads.
    The Office of Chief Counsel's Safety Division reviews each violation 
report it receives from the regional offices for legal sufficiency and 
assesses penalties based on those allegations that survive that review. 
Historically, the Division has returned to the regional offices less 
than five percent of the reports submitted in a given year, often with a 
request for further work and resubmission.
    Where the violation was committed by a railroad, penalties are 
assessed by issuance of a penalty demand letter that summarizes the 
claims, encloses the violation report with a copy of all evidence on 
which FRA is relying in making its initial charge, and explains that the 
railroad may pay in full or submit, orally or in writing, information 
concerning any defenses or mitigating factors. The railroad safety 
statutes, in conjunction with the Federal Claims Collection Act, 
authorize FRA to adjust or compromise the initial penalty claims based 
on a wide variety of mitigating factors. This system permits the 
efficient collection of civil penalties in amounts that fit the actual 
offense without resort to time-consuming and expensive litigation. Over 
its history, FRA has had to request that the Attorney General bring suit 
to collect a penalty on only a very few occasions.
    Once penalties have been assessed, the railroad is given a 
reasonable amount of time to investigate the charges. Larger railroads 
usually make their case before FRA in an informal conference covering a 
number of case files that have been issued and investigated since the 
previous conference. Thus, in terms of the negotiating time of both 
sides, economies of scale are achieved that would be impossible if each 
case were negotiated separately. The settlement conferences, held either 
in Washington or another mutually agreed on location, include technical 
experts from both FRA and the railroad as well as lawyers for both 
parties. In addition to allowing the two sides to make their cases for 
the relative merits of the various claims, these conferences also 
provide a forum for addressing current compliance problems. Smaller 
railroads usually prefer to handle negotiations through the mail or over 
the telephone, often on a single case at a time. Once the two sides have 
agreed to an amount on each case, that agreement is put in writing and a 
check is submitted to FRA's accounting division covering the full amount 
agreed on.
    Cases brought under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, 49 
App. U.S.C. 1801

[[Page 37]]

et seq., are, due to certain statutory requirements, handled under more 
formal administrative procedures. See 49 CFR part 209, subpart B.

                   Civil Penalties Against Individuals

    The RSIA amended the penalty provisions of the railroad safety 
statutes to make them applicable to any ``person (including a railroad 
and any manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of a 
railroad)'' who fails to comply with the regulations or statutes. E.g., 
section 3 of the RSIA, amending section 209 of the Safety Act. However, 
the RSIA also provided that civil penalties may be assessed against 
individuals ``only for willful violations.''
    Thus, any individual meeting the statutory description of ``person'' 
is liable for a civil penalty for a willful violation of, or for 
willfully causing the violation of, the safety statutes or regulations. 
Of course, as has traditionally been the case with respect to acts of 
noncompliance by railroads, the FRA field inspector exercises discretion 
in deciding which situations call for a civil penalty assessment as the 
best method of ensuring compliance. The inspector has a range of 
options, including an informal warning, a more formal warning letter 
issued by the Safety Division of the Office of Chief Counsel, 
recommendation of a civil penalty assessment, recommendation of 
disqualification or suspension from safety-sensitive service, or, under 
the most extreme circumstances, recommendation of emergency action.
    The threshold question in any alleged violation by an individual 
will be whether that violation was ``willful.'' (Note that section 3(a) 
of the RSIA, which authorizes suspension or disqualification of a person 
whose violation of the safety laws has shown him or her to be unfit for 
safety-sensitive service, does not require a showing of willfulness. 
Regulations implementing that provision are found at 49 CFR part 209, 
subpart D.) FRA proposed this standard of liability when, in 1987, it 
originally proposed a statutory revision authorizing civil penalties 
against individuals. FRA believed then that it would be too harsh a 
system to collect fines from individuals on a strict liability basis, as 
the safety statutes permit FRA to do with respect to railroads. FRA also 
believed that even a reasonable care standard (e.g., the Hazardous 
Materials Transportation Act's standard for civil penalty liability, 49 
U.S.C. 1809(a)) would subject individuals to civil penalties in more 
situations than the record warranted. Instead, FRA wanted the authority 
to penalize those who violate the safety laws through a purposeful act 
of free will.
    Thus, FRA considers a ``willful'' violation to be one that is an 
intentional, voluntary act committed either with knowledge of the 
relevant law or reckless disregard for whether the act violated the 
requirements of the law. Accordingly, neither a showing of evil purpose 
(as is sometimes required in certain criminal cases) nor actual 
knowledge of the law is necessary to prove a willful violation, but a 
level of culpability higher than negligence must be demonstrated. See 
Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U.S. 111 (1985); Brock v. 
Morello Bros. Constr., Inc. 809 F.2d 161 (1st Cir. 1987); and Donovan v. 
Williams Enterprises, Inc., 744 F.2d 170 (D.C. Cir. 1984).
    Reckless disregard for the requirements of the law can be 
demonstrated in many ways. Evidence that a person was trained on or made 
aware of the specific rule involved--or, as is more likely, its 
corresponding industry equivalent--would suffice. Moreover, certain 
requirements are so obviously fundamental to safe railroading (e.g., the 
prohibition against disabling an automatic train control device) that 
any violation of them, regardless of whether the person was actually 
aware of the prohibition, should be seen as reckless disregard of the 
law. See Brock, supra, 809 F.2d 164. Thus, a lack of subjective 
knowledge of the law is no impediment to a finding of willfulness. If it 
were, a mere denial of the content of the particular regulation would 
provide a defense. Having proposed use of the word ``willful,'' FRA 
believes it was not intended to insulate from liability those who simply 
claim--contrary to the established facts of the case--they had no reason 
to believe their conduct was wrongful.
    A willful violation entails knowledge of the facts constituting the 
violation, but actual, subjective knowledge need not be demonstrated. It 
will suffice to show objectively what the alleged violator must have 
known of the facts based on reasonable inferences drawn from the 
circumstances. For example, a person shown to have been responsible for 
performing an initial terminal air brake test that was not in fact 
performed would not be able to defend against a charge of a willful 
violation simply by claiming subjective ignorance of the fact that the 
test was not performed. If the facts, taken as a whole, demonstrated 
that the person was responsible for doing the test and had no reason to 
believe it was performed by others, and if that person was shown to have 
acted with actual knowledge of or reckless disregard for the law 
requiring such a test, he or she would be subject to a civil penalty.
    This definition of ``willful'' fits squarely within the parameters 
for willful acts laid out by Congress in the RSIA and its legislative 
history. Section 3(a) of the RSIA amends the Safety Act to provide:
    For purposes of this section, an individual shall be deemed not to 
have committed a willful violation where such individual has acted 
pursuant to the direct order of a railroad official or supervisor, under 
protest

[[Page 38]]

communicated to the supervisor. Such individual shall have the right to 
document such protest.
    As FRA made clear when it recommended legislation granting 
individual penalty authority, a railroad employee should not have to 
choose between liability for a civil penalty or insubordination charges 
by the railroad. Where an employee (or even a supervisor) violates the 
law under a direct order from a supervisor, he or she does not do so of 
his or her free will. Thus, the act is not a voluntary one and, 
therefore, not willful under FRA's definition of the word. Instead, the 
action of the person who has directly ordered the commission of the 
violation is itself a willful violation subjecting that person to a 
civil penalty. As one of the primary sponsors of the RSIA said on the 
Senate floor:
    This amendment also seeks to clarify that the purpose of imposing 
civil penalties against individuals is to deter those who, of their free 
will, decide to violate the safety laws. The purpose is not to penalize 
those who are ordered to commit violations by those above them in the 
railroad chain of command. Rather, in such cases, the railroad official 
or supervisor who orders the others to violate the law would be liable 
for any violations his order caused to occur. One example is the 
movement of railroad cars or locomotives that are actually known to 
contain certain defective conditions. A train crew member who was 
ordered to move such equipment would not be liable for a civil penalty, 
and his participation in such movements could not be used against him in 
any disqualification proceeding brought by FRA.

133 Cong. Rec. S.15899 (daily ed. Nov. 5, 1987) (remarks of Senator 
Exon).

    It should be noted that FRA will apply the same definition of 
``willful'' to corporate acts as is set out here with regard to 
individual violations. Although railroads are strictly liable for 
violations of the railroad safety laws and deemed to have knowledge of 
those laws, FRA's penalty schedules contain, for each regulation, a 
separate amount earmarked as the initial assessment for willful 
violations. Where FRA seeks such an extraordinary penalty from a 
railroad, it will apply the definition of ``willful'' set forth above. 
In such cases--as in all civil penalty cases brought by FRA--the 
aggregate knowledge and actions of the railroad's managers, supervisors, 
employees, and other agents will be imputed to the railroad. Thus, in 
situations that FRA decides warrant a civil penalty based on a willful 
violation, FRA will have the option of citing the railroad and/or one or 
more of the individuals involved. In cases against railroads other than 
those in which FRA alleges willfulness or in which a particular 
regulation imposes a special standard, the principles of strict 
liability and presumed knowledge of the law will continue to apply.
    The RSIA gives individuals the right to protest a direct order to 
violate the law and to document the protest. FRA will consider such 
protests and supporting documentation in deciding whether and against 
whom to cite civil penalties in a particular situation. Where such a 
direct order has been shown to have been given as alleged, and where 
such a protest is shown to have been communicated to the supervisor, the 
person or persons communicating it will have demonstrated their lack of 
willfulness. Any documentation of the protest will be considered along 
with all other evidence in determining whether the alleged order to 
violate was in fact given.
    However, the absence of such a protest will not be viewed as 
warranting a presumption of willfulness on the part of the employee who 
might have communicated it. The statute says that a person who 
communicates such a protest shall be deemed not to have acted willfully; 
it does not say that a person who does not communicate such a protest 
will be deemed to have acted willfully. FRA would have to prove from all 
the pertinent facts that the employee willfully violated the law. 
Moreover, the absence of a protest would not be dispositive with regard 
to the willfulness of a supervisor who issued a direct order to violate 
the law. That is, the supervisor who allegedly issued an order to 
violate will not be able to rely on the employee's failure to protest 
the order as a complete defense. Rather, the issue will be whether, in 
view of all pertinent facts, the supervisor intentionally and 
voluntarily ordered the employee to commit an act that the supervisor 
knew would violate the law or acted with reckless disregard for whether 
it violated the law.
    FRA exercises the civil penalty authority over individuals through 
informal procedures very similar to those used with respect to railroad 
violations. However, FRA varies those procedures somewhat to account for 
differences that may exist between the railroad's ability to defend 
itself against a civil penalty charge and an individual's ability to do 
so. First, when the field inspector decides that an individual's actions 
warrant a civil penalty recommendation and drafts a violation report, 
the inspector or the regional director informs the individual in writing 
of his or her intention to seek assessment of a civil penalty and the 
fact that a violation report has been transmitted to the Office of Chief 
Counsel. This ensures that the individual has the opportunity to seek 
counsel, preserve documents, or take any other necessary steps to aid 
his or her defense at the earliest possible time.
    Second, if the Office of Chief Counsel concludes that the case is 
meritorious and issues a penalty demand letter, that letter

[[Page 39]]

makes clear that FRA encourages discussion, through the mail, over the 
telephone or in person, of any defenses or mitigating factors the 
individual may wish to raise. That letter also advises the individual 
that he or she may wish to obtain representation by an attorney and/or 
labor representative. During the negotiation stage, FRA considers each 
case individually on its merits and gives due weight to whatever 
information the alleged violator provides.
    Finally, in the unlikely event that a settlement cannot be reached, 
FRA sends the individual a letter warning of its intention to request 
that the Attorney General sue for the initially proposed amount and 
giving the person a sufficient interval (e.g., 30 days) to decide if 
that is the only alternative.
    FRA believes that the intent of Congress would be violated if 
individuals who agree to pay a civil penalty or are ordered to do so by 
a court are indemnified for that penalty by the railroad or another 
institution (such as a labor organization). Congress intended that the 
penalties have a deterrent effect on individual behavior that would be 
lessened, if not eliminated, by such indemnification.
    Although informal, face-to-face meetings are encouraged during the 
negotiation of a civil penalty charge, the RSIA does not require that 
FRA give individuals or railroads the opportunity for a formal, trial-
type administrative hearing as part of the civil penalty process. FRA 
does not provide that opportunity because such administrative hearings 
would be likely to add significantly to the costs an individual would 
have to bear in defense of a safety claim (and also to FRA's enforcement 
expenses) without shedding any more light on what resolution of the 
matter is fair than would the informal procedures set forth here. Of 
course, should an individual or railroad decide not to settle, that 
person would be entitled to a trial de novo when FRA, through the 
Attorney General, sued to collect the penalty in the appropriate United 
States district court.

           Penalty Schedules; Assessment of Maximum Penalties

    As recommended by the Department of Transportation in its initial 
proposal for rail safety legislative revisions in 1987, the RSIA raised 
the maximum civil penalties for violations of the safety regulations. 
Under the Hours of Service Act, the penalty was changed from a flat $500 
to a penalty of ``up to $1,000, as the Secretary of Transportation deems 
reasonable.'' Under all the other statutes, the maximum penalty was 
raised from $2,500 to $10,000 per violation, except that, ``where a 
grossly negligent violation or pattern of repeated violations has 
created an imminent hazard of death or injury to persons, or has caused 
death or injury,'' a penalty of up to $20,000 per violation may be 
assessed.
    FRA's traditional practice has been to issue penalty schedules 
assigning to each particular regulation specific dollar amounts for 
initial penalty assessments. The schedule (except where issued after 
notice and an opportunity for comment) constitutes a statement of agency 
policy, and is ordinarily issued as an appendix to the relevant part of 
the Code of Federal Regulations. For each regulation, the schedule shows 
two amounts within the $250 to $10,000 range in separate columns, the 
first for ordinary violations, the second for willful violations 
(whether committed by railroads or individuals). In one instance--part 
231--the schedule refers to sections of the relevant FRA defect code 
rather than to sections of the CFR text. Of course, the defect code, 
which is simply a reorganized version of the CFR text used by FRA to 
facilitate computerization of inspection data, is substantively 
identical to the CFR text.
    The schedule amounts are meant to provide guidance as to FRA's 
policy in predictable situations, not to bind FRA from using the full 
range of penalty authority where extraordinary circumstances warrant. 
The Senate report on the bill that became the RSIA stated:
    It is expected that the Secretary would act expeditiously to set 
penalty levels commensurate with the severity of the violations, with 
imposition of the maximum penalty reserved for violation of any 
regulation where warranted by exceptional circumstances.

S. Rep. No. 100-153, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1987).
    Accordingly, under each of the schedules (ordinarily in a footnote), 
and regardless of the fact that a lesser amount might be shown in both 
columns of the schedule, FRA reserves the right to assess the statutory 
maximum penalty of up to $20,000 per violation where a grossly negligent 
violation or a pattern of repeated violations has created an imminent 
hazard of death or injury to persons, or has caused death or injury. 
This authority to assess a penalty for a single violation above $10,000 
and up to $20,000 is used only in very exceptional cases to penalize 
egregious behavior. Where FRA avails itself of this right to use the 
higher penalties in place of the schedule amount it so indicates in its 
penalty demand letter.

          The Extent And Exercise Of FRA's Safety Jurisdiction

    The Safety Act and, as amended by the RSIA, the older safety 
statutes apply to ``railroads.'' Section 202(e) of the Safety Act 
defines railroad as follows:
    The term ``railroad'' as used in this title means all forms of non-
highway ground transportation that run on rails or electromagnetic 
guideways, including (1) commuter or other short-haul rail passenger 
service in

[[Page 40]]

a metropolitan or suburban area, as well as any commuter rail service 
which was operated by the Consolidated Rail Corporation as of January 1, 
1979, and (2) high speed ground transportation systems that connect 
metropolitan areas, without regard to whether they use new technologies 
not associated with traditional railroads. Such term does not include 
rapid transit operations within an urban area that are not connected to 
the general railroad system of transportation.
    Prior to 1988, the older safety statutes had applied only to common 
carriers engaged in interstate or foreign commerce by rail. The Safety 
Act, by contrast, was intended to reach as far as the Commerce Clause of 
the Constitution (i.e., to all railroads that affect interstate 
commerce) rather than be limited to common carriers actually engaged in 
interstate commerce. In reporting out the bill that became the 1970 
Safety Act, the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce 
stated:
    The Secretary's authority to regulate extends to all areas of 
railroad safety. This legislation is intended to encompass all those 
means of rail transportation as are commonly included within the term. 
Thus, ``railroad'' is not limited to the confines of ``common carrier by 
railroad'' as that language is defined in the Interstate Commerce Act.

H.R. Rep. No. 91-1194, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. at 16 (1970).
    FRA's jurisdiction was bifurcated until, in 1988, the RSIA amended 
the older safety statutes to make them coextensive with the Safety Act 
by making them applicable to railroads and incorporating the Safety 
Act's definition of the term (e.g., 45 U.S.C. 16, as amended). The RSIA 
also made clear that FRA's safety jurisdiction is not confined to 
entities using traditional railroad technology. The new definition of 
``railroad'' emphasized that all non-highway high speed ground 
transportation systems--regardless of technology used--would be 
considered railroads.
    Thus, with the exception of self-contained urban rapid transit 
systems, FRA's statutory jurisdiction extends to all entities that can 
be construed as railroads by virtue of their providing non-highway 
ground transportation over rails or electromagnetic guideways, and will 
extend to future railroads using other technologies not yet in use. For 
policy reasons, however, FRA does not exercise jurisdiction under all of 
its regulations to the full extent permitted by statute. Based on its 
knowledge of where the safety problems were occurring at the time of its 
regulatory action and its assessment of the practical limitations on its 
role, FRA has, in each regulatory context, decided that the best option 
was to regulate something less than the total universe of railroads.
    For example, all of FRA's regulations exclude from their reach 
railroads whose entire operations are confined to an industrial 
installation, i.e., ``plant railroads'' such as those in steel mills 
that do not go beyond the plant's boundaries. E.g., 49 CFR 225.3 
(accident reporting regulations). Other regulations (e.g., 49 CFR 213.3, 
track safety regulations) exclude not only plant railroads but all other 
railroads that are not part of, or operated over, the ``general railroad 
system of transportation,'' i.e., the network of standard gage railroads 
over which the interchange of goods and passengers throughout the nation 
is possible--including even certain railroads not physically connected 
to the continental system, such as a freight railroad in Alaska with 
which other American railroads interchange cars by means of intermediate 
modes of transport. (Note that FRA proposed the ``general system'' 
language now found in section 202(e) of the Safety Act, and its 
construction of that language is not bound by construction of similar 
phrases used in other statutes, e.g., 45 U.S.C. 151 First; those similar 
phrases are generally part of provisions in those laws limiting their 
reach--unlike that of the amended safety laws--to ``common carriers 
engaged in interstate commerce.'')
    Of course, even where a railroad operates outside the general 
system, other railroads that are definitely part of that system may have 
occasion to enter the first railroad's property (e.g., a major railroad 
goes into a chemical or auto plant to pick up or set out cars). In such 
cases, the railroad that is part of the general system remains part of 
that system while inside the installation; thus, all of its activities 
are covered by FRA's regulations during that period. The plant railroad 
itself, however, does not get swept into the general system by virtue of 
the other railroad's activity, except to the extent it is liable, as the 
track owner, for the condition of its track over which the other 
railroad operates during its incursion into the plant. Of course, in the 
opposite situation, where the plant railroad itself operates beyond the 
plant boundaries on the general system, it becomes a railroad with 
respect to those particular operations, during which its equipment, 
crew, and practices would be subject to FRA's regulations.
    In some cases, the plant railroad leases track immediately adjacent 
to its plant from the general system railroad. Assuming such a lease 
provides for, and actual practice entails, the exclusive use of that 
trackage by the plant railroad and the general system railroad for 
purposes of moving only cars shipped to or from the plant, the lease 
would remove the plant railroad's operations on that trackage from the 
general system for purposes of FRA's regulations, as it would make that 
trackage part and parcel of the industrial installation. (As explained 
above, however, the track itself would have to meet FRA's standards if a 
general system railroad

[[Page 41]]

operated over it. See 49 CFR 213.5 for the rules on how an owner of 
track may assign responsibility for it.) A lease or practice that 
permitted other types of movements by general system railroads on that 
trackage would, of course, bring it back into the general system, as 
would operations by the plant railroad indicating it was moving cars on 
such trackage for other than its own purposes (e.g., moving cars to 
neighboring industries for hire).
    It is important to note that FRA's exercise of its regulatory 
authority on a given matter does not preclude it from subsequently 
amending its regulations on that subject to bring in railroads 
originally excluded. More important, the self-imposed restrictions on 
FRA's exercise of regulatory authority in no way constrain its exercise 
of emergency order authority under section 203 of the Safety Act. That 
authority was designed to deal with imminent hazards not dealt with by 
existing regulations and/or so dangerous as to require immediate, ex 
parte action on the government's part. Thus, a railroad excluded from 
the reach of any of FRA's regulations is fully within the reach of FRA's 
emergency order authority, which is coextensive with FRA's statutory 
jurisdiction over all railroads.

                         Extraordinary Remedies

    While civil penalties are the primary enforcement tool under the 
federal railroad safety laws, more extreme measures are available under 
certain circumstances. FRA has authority to issue orders directing 
compliance with the Federal Railroad Safety Act, the Hazardous Materials 
Transportation Act, the older safety statutes, or regulations issued 
under any of those statutes. See 45 U.S.C. 437(a) and (d), and 49 App. 
U.S.C. 1808(a). Such an order may issue only after notice and 
opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
49 CFR part 209, subpart C. FRA inspectors also have the authority to 
issue a special notice requiring repairs where a locomotive or freight 
car is unsafe for further service or where a segment of track does not 
meet the standards for the class at which the track is being operated. 
Such a special notice may be appealed to the regional director and the 
FRA Administrator. See 49 CFR part 216, subpart B.
    FRA may, through the Attorney General, also seek injunctive relief 
in federal district court to restrain violations or enforce rules issued 
under the railroad safety laws. See 45 U.S.C. 439 and 49 App. U.S.C. 
1810.
    FRA also has the authority to issue, after notice and an opportunity 
for a hearing, an order prohibiting an individual from performing 
safety-sensitive functions in the rail industry for a specified period. 
This disqualification authority is exercised under procedures found at 
49 CFR part 209, subpart D.
    Criminal penalties are available for willful violations of the 
Hazardous Materials Transportation Act or its regulations. See 49 App. 
U.S.C. 1809(b), and 49 CFR 209.131, 133. Criminal penalties are also 
available under 45 U.S.C. 438(e) for knowingly and willfully falsifying, 
destroying, or failing to complete records or reports required to be 
kept under the various railroad safety statutes and regulations. The 
Accident Reports Act, 45 U.S.C. 39, also contains criminal penalties.
    Perhaps FRA's most sweeping enforcement tool is its authority to 
issue emergency safety orders ``where an unsafe condition or practice, 
or a combination of unsafe conditions or practices, or both, create an 
emergency situation involving a hazard of death or injury to persons * * 
*'' 45 U.S.C. 432(a). After its issuance, such an order may be reviewed 
in a trial-type hearing. See 49 CFR 211.47 and 216.21 through 216.27. 
The emergency order authority is unique because it can be used to 
address unsafe conditions and practices whether or not they contravene 
an existing regulatory or statutory requirement. Given its extraordinary 
nature, FRA has used the emergency order authority sparingly.

 Appendix B to Part 209--Federal Railroad Administration Guidelines for 
                 Initial Hazardous Materials Assessments

    These guidelines establish benchmarks to be used in determining 
initial civil penalty assessments for violations of the Hazardous 
Materials Regulations (HMR). The guideline penalty amounts reflect the 
best judgment of the FRA Office of Safety Assurance and Compliance (RRS) 
and of the Safety Law Division of the Office of Chief Counsel (RCC) on 
the relative severity, on a scale of $250 to $25,000, of the various 
violations routinely encountered by FRA inspectors. (49 U.S.C. 5123) 
Unless otherwise specified, the guideline amounts refer to average 
violations, that is, violations involving a hazardous material with a 
medium level of hazard, and a violator with an average compliance 
history. In an ``average violation,'' the respondent has committed the 
acts due to a failure to exercise reasonable care under the 
circumstances (``knowingly''). For some sections, the guidelines contain 
a breakdown according to relative severity of the violation, for 
example, the guidelines for shipping paper violations at 49 CFR 
Secs. 172.200-.203. All penalties in these guidelines are subject to 
change depending upon the circumstances of the particular case. The 
general duty sections, for example Secs. 173.1 and 174.7, are not 
ordinarily cited as separate violations; they are primarily used as 
explanatory citations

[[Page 42]]

to demonstrate applicability of a more specific section where 
applicability is otherwise unclear.
    FRA believes that infractions of the regulations that lead to 
personal injury are especially serious; this is directly in line with 
Department of Transportation policy that hazardous materials are only 
safe for transportation when they are securely sealed in a proper 
package. (Some few containers, such as tank cars of carbon dioxide, are 
designed to vent off excess internal pressure. They are exceptions to 
the ``securely sealed'' rule.) ``Personal injury'' has become somewhat 
of a term of art, especially in the fields of occupational safety and of 
accident reporting. To avoid confusion, these penalty guidelines use the 
notion of ``human contact'' to trigger penalty aggravation. In essence, 
any contact by a hazardous material on a person during transportation is 
a per se injury and proof will not be required regarding the extent of 
the physical contact or its consequences. When a violation of the 
Hazardous Materials Regulations causes a death or serious injury, the 
maximum penalty of $25,000 shall always be assessed initially.
    These guidelines are a preliminary assessment tool for FRA's use. 
They create no rights in any party. FRA is free to vary from them when 
it deems appropriate and may amend them from time to time without prior 
notice. Moreover, FRA is not bound by any amount it initially proposes 
should litigation become necessary. In fact, FRA reserves the express 
authority to amend the NOPV to seek a penalty of up to $25,000 for each 
violation at any time prior to issuance of an order.

<R05>
Sec. 210.21  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes the compliance criteria concerning the 
requirements for inspection and testing of railroad equipment or 
operations covered by the Standards.


<R05>
Sec. 210.23  Authorization.

    (a) An inspector is authorized to perform any noise test prescribed 
in the Standards and in the procedures of this part at any time, at any 
appropriate location, and without prior notice to the railroad, for the 
purpose of determining whether railroad equipment is in compliance with 
the Standards.
    (b)(1) An inspector is authorized to request that railroad equipment 
and appropriate railroad personnel be made available for a passby or 
stationary noise emission test, as prescribed in the Standards and in 
the procedures of this part, and to conduct such test, at a reasonable 
time and location, for the purpose of determining whether the railroad 
equipment is in compliance with the Standards.
    (2) If the railroad has the capability to perform an appropriate 
noise emission test, as prescribed in the Standards and in the 
procedures of this part, an inspector is authorized to request that the 
railroad test railroad equipment. The railroad shall perform the 
appropriate test as soon as practicable.
    (3) The request referred to in this paragraph will be in writing, 
will state the grounds upon which the inspector has reason to believe 
that the railroad equipment does not conform to the Standards, and will 
be presented to an appropriate operating official of the railroad.
    (4) Testing or submission for testing is not required if the cause 
of the noise defect is readily apparent and the inspector verifies that 
it is corrected by the replacement of defective components or by 
instituting a normal maintenance or repair procedure.
    (c)(1) An inspector is authorized to inspect or examine a 
locomotive, rail car, or consist of a locomotive and rail cars operated 
by a railroad, or to request that the railroad inspect or examine the 
locomotive, rail car, or consist of a locomotive and rail cars, whenever 
the inspector has reason to believe that it does not conform to the 
requirements of the Standards.
    (2) An inspector may request that a railroad conduct an inspection 
or examination of a locomotive, rail car, or consist of a locomotive and 
rail cars on the basis of an excessive noise emission level measured by 
a passby test. If, after such inspection or examination, no mechanical 
condition that would result in a noise defect can be found and the 
inspector verifies that no such mechanical condition exists, the 
locomotive, rail car, or consist of a locomotive and rail cars may be 
continued in service.
    (3) The requests referred to in this paragraph will be in writing, 
will state the grounds upon which the inspector has reason to believe

Sec. 210.25  Measurement criteria and procedures.

    The parameters and procedures for the measurement of the noise 
emission levels are prescribed in the Standards.
    (a) Quantities measured are defined in Sec. 201.21 of the Standards.
    (b) Requirements for measurement instrumentation are prescribed in 
Sec. 201.22 of the Standards. In addition, the following calibration 
procedures shall be used:
    (1)(i) The sound level measurement system including the microphone 
shall be calibrated and appropriately adjusted at one or more nominal 
frequencies in the range from 250 through 1000 Hz at the beginning of 
each series of measurements, at intervals not exceeding 1 (one) hour 
during continual use, and immediately following a measurement indicating 
a violation.
    (ii) The sound level measurement system shall be checked not less 
than once each year by its manufacturer, a representative of its 
manufacturer, or a person of equivalent special competence to verify 
that its accuracy meets the manufacturer's design criteria.
    (2) An acoustical calibrator of the microphone coupler type designed 
for the sound level measurement system in use shall be used to calibrate 
the sound level measurement system in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section. The calibration must meet or exceed the 
accuracy requirements specified in section 5.4.1 of the American 
National Standard Institute Standards, ``Method for Measurement of Sound 
Pressure Levels,'' (ANSI S1.13-1971) for field method measurements.
    (c) Acoustical environment, weather conditions, and background noise 
requirements are prescribed in Sec. 201.23 of the Standards. In 
addition, a measurement tolerance of 2 dB(A) for a given measurement 
will be allowed to take into account the effects of the factors listed 
below and the interpretations of these effects by enforcement personnel:
    (1) The common practice of reporting field sound level measurements 
to the nearest whole decibel;
    (2) Variations resulting from commercial instrument tolerances;
    (3) Variations resulting from the topography of the noise 
measurement site;
    (4) Variations resulting from atmospheric conditions such as wind, 
ambient temperature, and atmospheric pressure; and
    (5) Variations resulting from reflected sound from small objects 
allowed within the test site.

Sec. 210.27  New locomotive certification.

    (a) A railroad shall not operate a locomotive built after December 
31, 1979, unless the locomotive has been certified to be in compliance 
with the Standards.
    (b) The certification prescribed in this section shall be determined 
for each locomotive model, by either--
    (1) Load cell testing in accordance with the criteria prescribed in 
the Standards; or
    (2) Passby testing in accordance with the criteria prescribed in the 
Standards.
    (c) If passby testing is used under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, it shall be conducted with the locomotive operating at maximum 
rated horsepower output.
    (d) Each new locomotive certified under this section shall be 
identified by a permanent badge or tag attached in the cab of the 
locomotive near the location of the inspection Form F 6180.49. The badge 
or tag shall state:
    (1) Whether a load cell or passby test was used;
    (2) The date and location of the test; and
    (3) The A-weighted sound level reading in decibels obtained during 
the passby test, or the readings obtained at idle throttle setting and 
maximum throttle setting during a load cell test.

Sec. 210.29  Operation standards (moving locomotives and rail cars).

    The operation standards for the noise emission levels of moving 
locomotives, rail cars, or consists of locomotives and rail cars are 
prescribed in the Standards and duplicated in appendix A of this part.
    (a) Measurements for compliance shall be made in compliance with the 
provisions of subpart C of the Standards and the following:

[[Page 56]]

    (1) Consists of locomotives containing at least one locomotive unit 
manufactured prior to December 31, 1979, shall be evaluated for 
compliance in accordance with Sec. 201.12(a) of the Standards, unless a 
locomotive within the consist is separated by at least 10 rail car 
lengths or 500 feet from other locomotives in the consist, in which case 
such separated locomotives may be evaluated for compliance according to 
their respective built dates.
    (2) Consists of locomotives composed entirely of locomotive units 
manufactured after December 31, 1979, shall be evaluated for compliance 
in accordance with Sec. 201.12(b) of the Standards.
    (3) If the inspector cannot establish the built dates of all 
locomotives in a consist of locomotives measured under moving 
conditions, evaluation for compliance shall be made in accordance with 
Sec. 201.12(a) of the Standards.
    (b) Noise emission standards for rail cars operating under moving 
conditions are contained in Sec. 201.13 of the Standards and are stated 
in appendix A of this part. If speed measurement equipment used by the 
inspector at the time of the measurement is not operating within an 
accuracy of 5 miles per hour, evaluation for compliance shall be made in 
accordance with Sec. 201.13(2) of the Standards.
    (c) Locomotives and rail cars tested pursuant to the procedures 
prescribed in this part and in the Standards shall be considered in 
noncompliance whenever the test measurement, minus the appropriate 
tolerance (Sec. 210.25), exceeds the noise emission levels prescribed in 
appendix A of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 210.31  Operation standards (stationary locomotives at 30 meters).

    (a) For stationary locomotives at load cells:
    (1) Each noise emission test shall begin after the engine of the 
locomotive has attained the normal cooling water operating temperature 
as prescribed by the locomotive manufacturer.
    (2) Noise emission testing in idle or maximum throttle setting shall 
start after a 40 second stabilization period in the throttle setting 
selected for the test.
    (3) After the stabilization period as prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section, the A-weighted sound level reading in decibels shall be 
observed for an additional 30-second period in the throttle setting 
selected for the test.
    (4) The maximum A-weighted sound level reading in decibels that is 
observed during the 30-second period of time prescribed in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section shall be used for test measurement purposes.
    (b) The following data determined by any locomotive noise emission 
test conducted after December 31, 1976, shall be recorded in the 
``Remarks'' section on the reverse side of Form F 6180.49:
    (1) Location of test;
    (2) Type of test;
    (3) Date of test; and
    (4) The A-weighted sound level reading in decibels obtained during

     Appendix B to Part 210--Switcher Locomotive Enforcement Policy

    The EPA standards require that the noise emissions from all switcher 
locomotives in a particular facility be less than prescribed levels 
measured at 30 meters, under all operating modes. This requirement is 
deemed to be met unless ``receiving property'' noise due to switcher 
locomotives exceeds 65 dB(A), when measured in accordance with subpart C 
of 40 CFR part 201. The 65 dB(A) receiving property standard is the 
``trigger'' for requiring the 30-meter test of switcher locomotives.
    The purpose underlying FRA's enforcement of the noise standards is 
to reduce the impact of rail operations noise on receiving properties. 
In some instances, measures other than the 30-meter test approach may 
more effectively reduce the noise levels at receiving properties; 
therefore, FRA enforcement efforts will focus on abatement procedures 
that will achieve a reduction of receiving property noise levels to less 
than 65 dB(A).
    For example, a parked, idling locomotive, even if equipped with 
exhaust silencing that meets the stationary locomotive standard

[[Page 58]]

(30-meter test), may cause the receiving property standard to be 
exceeded if located on trackage adjacent to the receiving property. In 
that case, application of the 30-meter test to other switcher 
locomotives at the facility may not serve to reduce the receiving 
property noise level. On the other hand, operational changes by the 
railroad could significantly reduce receiving property noise levels. In 
such case, FRA would consider retesting after abatement measures have 
been taken. If the receiving property noise level is below the trigger 
and the abatement action is adopted, FRA would not make a 30-meter test 
of the switcher locomotives at the facility.

<R04>
                    Subpart B--Rulemaking Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 211.11  Processing of petitions for rulemaking.

    (a) General. Each petition for rulemaking filed as prescribed in 
Secs. 211.7 and 211.9 is referred to the head of the office responsible 
for the subject matter of the petition to review and recommend 
appropriate action to the Administrator. No public hearing or oral 
argument is held before the Administrator decides whether the petition 
should be granted. However, a notice may be published in the Federal 
Register inviting written comments concerning the petition. Each 
petition shall be granted or denied not later than six months after its 
receipt by the Docket Clerk.
    (b) Grants. If the Administrator determines that a rulemaking 
petition complies with the requirements of Sec. 211.9 and that 
rulemaking is justified, he initiates a rulemaking proceeding by 
publishing an advance notice or notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
Federal Register.
    (c) Denials. If the Administrator determines that a rulemaking 
petition does not comply with the requirements of Sec. 211.9 or that 
rulemaking is not justified, he denies the petition. If the petition 
pertains to railroad safety, the Administrator may also initiate an 
informal safety inquiry under Sec. 211.61.
    (d) Notification; closing of docket. Whenever the Administrator 
grants or denies a rulemaking petition, a notice of the grant or denial 
is mailed to the petitioner. If the petition is denied, the proceeding 
is terminated and the docket for that petition is closed.


<R05>
Sec. 211.13  Initiation and completion of rulemaking proceedings.

    The Administrator initiates all rulemaking proceedings on his own 
motion by publishing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking or a 
notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register. However, he may 
consider the recommendations of interested persons or other agencies of 
the United States. A separate docket is established and maintained for 
each rulemaking proceeding. Each rulemaking proceeding shall be 
completed not later than 12 months after the initial notice in that 
proceeding is published in the Federal Register. However, if it was 
initiated as the result of the granting of a rulemaking petition, the 
rulemaking proceeding shall be completed not later than 12 months after 
the petition was filed as prescribed in Secs. 211.7 and 211.9.


<R05>
Sec. 211.15  Notice and participation.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, or when the 
Administrator finds for good cause that notice is impractical, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest (and incorporates the 
findings and a brief statement of the reasons therefore in the rules 
issued), an advance notice or notice of proposed rulemaking is published 
in the Federal Register and interested persons are invited to 
participate in the rulemaking proceedings with respect to each 
substantive rule.
    (b) Unless the Administrator determines that notice and public 
rulemaking proceedings are necessary or desirable, interpretive rules, 
general statements of policy, and rules relating to organization, 
procedure, or practice, including those relating to agency management or 
personnel, are prescribed as final without notice or other public 
rulemaking proceedings.
    (c) An advance notice or notice of proposed rulemaking is issued and 
interested persons are invited to participate in rulemaking proceedings 
with respect only to those procedural and substantive rules of general 
applicability relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or 
contracts which the Administrator has determined to be of substantial 
public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 211.17  Publication and contents of notices.

    Each advance notice or notice of proposed rulemaking is published in 
the Federal Register and includes--
    (a) A statement of the time, place and nature of the proposed 
rulemaking proceeding;
    (b) A reference to the authority under which it is issued;
    (c) A description of the subjects or issues involved or the 
substance or terms of the proposed rule;

[[Page 61]]

    (d) A statement of the time within which written comments must be 
submitted and the required number of copies; and
    (e) A statement of how and to what extent interested persons may 
participate in the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 211.19  Petitions for extensions of time to comment.

    (a) Any person may petition the Administrator for an extension of 
time to submit comments in response to an advance notice or notice of 
proposed rulemaking. The petition must be received by the Docket Clerk 
not later than 10 days before expiration of the time stated in the 
notice and must contain reference to the FRA docket number for the 
proceeding involved. The filing of the petition does not automatically 
extend the time for petitioner's comments.
    (b) The Administrator grants the petition only if the petitioner 
shows a substantive interest in the proposed rule and good cause for the 
extension, and if time permits and the extension is in the public 
interest. Extensions will not be granted unless time permits and will 
not exceed one month. If an extension is granted, it is granted as to 
all persons and a notice of the extension is published in the Federal 
Register.


<R05>
Sec. 211.21  Consideration of comments received.

    All timely comments are considered before final action is taken on a 
rulemaking proposal. Late-filed comments will be considered so far as 
possible without incurring additional expense or delay.


<R05>
Sec. 211.23  Additional public proceedings.

    The Administrator may conduct other public proceedings that he finds 
necessary or desirable. For example, he may invite interested persons to 
present oral arguments, participate in conferences, or appear at 
informal hearings.


<R05>
Sec. 211.25  Hearings.

    (a) A hearing will be held if required by statute or the 
Administrator finds it necessary or desirable.
    (b) Except for statutory hearings required to be on the record--
    (1) Hearings are fact-finding proceedings, and there are no formal 
pleadings or adverse parties;
    (2) Any rule issued in a proceeding in which a hearing is held is 
not based exclusively on the record of the hearing; and
    (3) Hearings are conducted in accordance with section 553 of title 
5, U.S.C.; section 556 and 557 of title 5 do not apply to hearings held 
under this part.
    (c) The Administrator conducts or designates a representative to 
conduct any hearing held under this part. The Chief Counsel serves or 
designates a member of his staff to serve as legal officer at the 
hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 211.27  Publication of adopted rules and withdrawal of notices.

    Whenever the Administrator adopts a final rule or withdraws an 
advance notice or notice of proposed rulemaking, the final rule or a 
notice of withdrawal is published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 211.29  Petitions for reconsideration of a final rule.

    (a) Any person may petition the Administrator for reconsideration of 
any rule issued under this part. Except for good cause shown, such a 
petition must be submitted not later than 60 days after publication of 
the rule in the Federal Register, or 10 days prior to the effective date 
of the rule, whichever is the earlier. The petition must contain a brief 
statement of the complaint and an explanation as to why compliance with 
the rule is not possible, is not practicable, is unreasonable, or is not 
in the public interest.
    (b) If the petitioner requests consideration of additional facts, he 
must state the reason they were not presented to the Administrator 
within the allotted time.
    (c) The Administrator does not consider repetitious petitions.
    (d) Unless the Administrator specifically provides otherwise, and 
publishes notice thereof in the Federal Register, the filing of a 
petition under this section does not stay the effectiveness of a rule.

    (a) The Administrator may grant or deny, in whole or in part, any 
petition for reconsideration of a final rule without further 
proceedings. Each petition shall be decided not later than 4 months 
after its receipt by the Docket Clerk. In the event he determines to 
reconsider a rule, the Administrator may amend the rule or initiate a 
new rulemaking proceeding. An appropriate notice is published in the 
Federal Register.
    (b) Whenever the Administrator determines that a petition should be 
granted or denied, a notice of the grant or denial of a petition for 
reconsideration is sent to the petitioner. When a petition is granted, a 
notice is published in the Federal Register.

                     Subpart B--State/Federal Roles


<R05>
Sec. 212.101  Program principles.

    (a) The purpose of the national railroad safety program is to 
promote safety in all areas of railroad operations in order to reduce 
deaths, injuries and damage to property resulting from railroad 
accidents.
    (b)(1) The national railroad safety program is carried out in part 
through the issuance of mandatory Federal safety requirements and 
through inspection efforts designed to monitor compliance with those 
requirements. FRA and State inspections determine the extent to which 
the railroads, shippers, and manufacturers have fulfilled their 
obligations with respect to inspection, maintenance, training, and 
supervision. The FRA and participating States do not conduct inspections 
of track, equipment, signal systems, operating practices, and hazardous 
materials handling for the railroads, shippers, and manufacturers.
    (2) The national railroad safety program is also carried out through 
routine inspections, accident investigations, formal and informal 
educational efforts, complaint investigations, safety assessments, 
special inquiries, regulatory development, research and similar 
initiatives.
    (c) It is the policy of the FRA to maintain direct oversight of 
railroad, shipper, and manufacturer conditions and practices relevant to 
safety by conducting inspections and investigations in concert with 
participating State agencies.
    (d) The principal role of the State Safety Participation Program in 
the national railroad safety effort is to provide an enhanced 
investigative and surveillance capability through assumption, by 
participating State agencies, of responsibility for planned routine 
compliance inspections. The FRA encourages further State contributions 
to the national railroad safety program consistent with overall program 
needs, individual State capabilities, and the willingness of the States 
to undertake additional investigative and surveillance activities.
    (e) It is the policy of the FRA to promote the growth and vitality 
of the State Safety Participation Program through liaison with State 
government, coordination of Federal and State investigative and 
surveillance activities, and training of inspection personnel.

exercise of specified authority.

[[Page 67]]

    (b) Subject to requirements of this part, a State agency with 
jurisdiction under State law may participate in investigative and 
surveillance activities with respect to particular rules, regulations, 
orders or standards issued under the regulatory authority of the Federal 
Railroad Safety Act of 1970 by filing an annual certification under 
Sec. 212.107.


<R05>
Sec. 212.105  Agreements.

requirements, the Associate Administrator may enter into an agreement 
under this section prior to the qualification of inspection personnel of 
the State under subpart C of this part. In such a case, the agreement 
shall (1) specify the date at which the State will assume investigative 
and surveillance duties, and (2) refer to any undertaking by the FRA to 
provide training for State inspection personnel, including a schedule 
for the training courses that will be made available.
    (g) Action on request. The Associate Administrator responds to a 
request for agreement by entering into an agreement based on the 
request, by declining the request, or by suggesting modifications.

    (b) If a segment of track does not meet all of the requirements for 
its intended class, it is reclassified to the next lowest class of track 
for which it does meet all of the requirements of this part. However, if 
the segment of

[[Page 79]]

track does not at least meet the requirements for Class 1 track, 
operations may continue at Class 1 speeds for a period of not more than 
30 days without bringing the track into compliance, under the authority 
of a person designated under Sec. 213.7(a), who has at least one year of 
supervisory experience in railroad track maintenance, after that person 
determines that operations may safely continue and subject to any 
limiting conditions specified by such person.
    (c) Maximum operating speed may not exceed 110 m.p.h. without prior 
approval of the Federal Railroad Administrator. Petitions for approval 
must be filed in the manner and contain the information required by 
Sec. 211.11 of this chapter. Each petition must provide sufficient 
information concerning the performance characteristics of the track, 
signaling, grade crossing protection, trespasser control where 
appropriate, and equipment involved and also concerning maintenance and 
inspection practices and procedures to be followed, to establish that 
the proposed speed can be sustained in safety.

Sec. 213.11  Restoration or renewal of track under traffic conditions.

    If during a period of restoration or renewal, track is under traffic 
conditions and does not meet all of the requirements prescribed in this 
part, the work on the track must be under the continuous supervision of 
a person designated under Sec. 213.7(a) who has at least one year of 
supervisory experience in railroad track maintenance. The term 
``continuous supervision'' as used in this section means the physical 
presence of that person at a job site. However, since the work may be 
performed over a large area, it is not necessary that each phase of the 
work be done under the visual supervision of that person.

<R05>
Sec. 213.13   Measuring track not under load.

    When unloaded track is measured to determine compliance with 
requirements of this part, the amount of rail movement, if any, that 
occurs while the track is loaded must be added to the measurement of the 
unloaded track.

Sec. 213.15   Civil penalty.

    Any person (including a railroad, any manager, supervisor, official, 
or other employee or agent of a railroad, any owner of track on which a 
railroad operates, or any person held by the Federal Railroad 
Administrator to be responsible under Sec. 213.5(d)) who violates any 
requirement of this part or causes the violation of any such requirement 
is subject to a civil penalty of at least $250 and not more than $10,000 
per violation, except that: Penalties may be assessed against 
individuals only for willful violations, and, where a grossly negligent 
violation or a pattern of repeated violations has created an imminent 
hazard of death or injury to persons, or has caused death or injury, a 
penalty not to exceed $20,000 per violation may be assessed. Each day a 
violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. See appendix B 
to this part for a statement of agency civil penalty policy.

<R05>
Sec. 213.17   Exemptions.

    (a) Any owner of track to which this part applies may petition the 
Federal Railroad Administrator for exemption from any or all 
requirements prescribed in this part.
    (b) Each petition for exemption under this section must be filed in 
the manner and contain the information required by Secs. 211.7 and 211.9 
of this chapter.
    (c) If the Administrator finds that an exemption is in the public 
interest and is consistent with railroad safety, he may grant the 
exemption subject to any conditions he deems necessary. Notice of each 
exemption granted is published in the Federal Register together with a 
statement of the reasons therefor.

Sec. 213.57   Curves; elevation and speed limitations.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 213.63, the outside rail of a curve 
may not be lower than the inside rail or have more than 6 inches of 
elevation.
    (b) The maximum allowable operating speed for each curve is 
determined by the following formula:

                 V<INF>max=<radical>(E<INF>a+3)/0.0007d

where
V<INF>max=Maximum allowable operating speed (miles per hour).
E<INF>a=Actual elevation of the outside rail (inches).
d=Degree of curvature (degrees).

Appendix A is a table of maximum allowable operating speed computed in 
accordance with this formula for various elevations and degrees of 
curvature.


<R05>
Sec. 213.59   Elevation of curved track; runoff.

    (a) If a curve is elevated, the full elevation must be provided 
throughout the curve, unless physical conditions do not permit. If 
elevation runoff occurs in a curve, the actual minimum elevation must be 
used in computing the maximum allowable operating speed for that curve 
under Sec. 213.57(b).
    (b) Elevation runoff must be at a uniform rate, within the limits of 
track surface deviation prescribed in Sec. 213.63, and it must extend at 
least the full

[[Page 81]]

length of the spirals. If physical conditions do not permit a spiral 
long enough to accommodate the minimum length of runoff, part of the 
runoff may be on tangent track.

Sec. 213.113  Defective rails.

    (a) When an owner of track to which this part applies learns, 
through inspection or otherwise, that a rail in that track contains any 
of the defects listed in the following table, a person designated under 
Sec. 213.7 shall determine whether or not the track may continue in use. 
If he determines that the track may continue in use, operation over the 
defective rail is not permitted until--
    (1) The rail is replaced; or
    (2) The remedial action prescribed in the table is initiated:

 AAAAANotes:                                                                                                    
A. Assigned person designated under Sec.  213.7 to visually supervise each operation over defective rail.       
B. Limit operating speed over defective rail to that as authorized by a person designated under Sec.  213.7(a), 
  who has at least one year of supervisory experience in railroad track maintenance.                            
C. Apply joint bars bolted only through the outermost holes to defect within 20 days after it is determined to  
  continue the track in use. In the case of Classes 3 through 6 track, limit operating speed over defective rail
  to 30 mph until angle bars are applied; thereafter limit speed to 60 mph or the maximum allowable speed under 
  Sec.  213.9 for the class of track concerned, whichever is lower.                                             
D. Apply joint bars bolted only through the outermost holes to defect within 10 days after it is determined to  
  continue the track in use. In the case of Classes 3 through 6 track, limit operating speed over the defective 
  rail to 30 mph or less as authorized by a person designated under Sec.  213.7(a), who has at least one year of
  supervisory experience in railroad track maintenance, until angle bars are applied; thereafter, limit speed to
  60 mph or the maximum allowable speed under Sec.  213.9 for the class of track concerned, whichever is lower. 
E. Apply joint bars to defect and bolt in accordance with Sec.  213.121 (d) and (e).                            
F. Inspect rail 90 days after it is determined to continue the track in use.

    (b) As used in this section--
    (1) Transverse Fissure means a progressive crosswise fracture 
starting from a crystalline center or nucleus inside the head from which 
it spreads outward as a smooth, bright, or dark, round or oval surface 
substantially at a right angle to the length of the rail. The 
distinguishing features of a transverse fissure from other types of 
fractures or defects are the crystalline center or nucleus and the 
nearly smooth surface of the development which surrounds it.
    (2) Compound Fissure means a progressive fracture originating in a 
horizontal split head which turns up or down in the head of the rail as 
a smooth, bright, or dark surface progressing until substantially at a 
right angle to the length of the rail. Compound fissures require 
examination of both faces of the fracture to locate the horizontal split 
head from which they originate.
    (3) Horizontal Split Head means a horizontal progressive defect 
originating inside of the rail head, usually one-quarter inch or more 
below the running surface and progressing horizontally in all 
directions, and generally accompanied by a flat spot on the running 
surface. The defect appears as a crack lengthwise of the rail when it 
reaches the side of the rail head.
    (4) Vertical Split Head means a vertical split through or near the 
middle of the head, and extending into or through it. A crack or rust 
streak may show under the head close to the web or pieces may be split 
off the side of the head.
    (5) Split Web means a lengthwise crack along the side of the web and 
extending into or through it.
    (6) Piped Rail means a vertical split in a rail, usually in the web, 
due to

[[Page 84]]

failure of the shrinkage cavity in the ingot to unite in rolling.
    (7) Broken Base means any break in the base of a rail.
    (8) Detail Fracture means a progressive fracture originating at or 
near the surface of the rail head. These fractures should not be 
confused with transverse fissures, compound fissures, or other defects 
which have internal origins. Detail fractures may arise from shelly 
spots, head checks, or flaking.
    (9) Engine Burn Fracture means a progressive fracture originating in 
spots where driving wheels have slipped on top of the rail head. In 
developing downward they frequently resemble the compound or even 
transverse fissures with which they should not be confused or 
classified.
    (10) Ordinary Break means a partial or complete break in which there 
is no sign of a fissure, and in which none of the other defects 
described in this paragraph are found.
    (11) Damaged Rail means any rail broken or injured by wrecks, 
broken, flat, or unbalanced wheels, slipping, or similar causes.

<R05>
Sec. 213.121   Rail joints.

    (a) Each rail joint, insulated joint, and compromise joint must be 
of the proper design and dimensions for the rail on which it is applied.
    (b) If a joint bar on classes 3 through 6 track is cracked, broken, 
or because of wear allows vertical movement of either rail when all 
bolts are tight, it must be replaced.
    (c) If a joint bar is cracked or broken between the middle two bolt 
holes it must be replaced.
    (d) In the case of conventional jointed track, each rail must be 
bolted with at least two bolts at each joint in classes 2 through 6 
track, and with at least one bolt in class 1 track.
    (e) In the case of continuous welded rail track, each rail must be 
bolted with at least two bolts at each joint.
    (f) Each joint bar must be held in position by track bolts tightened 
to allow the joint bar to firmly support the abutting rail ends and to 
allow longitudinal movement of the rail in the joint to accommodate 
expansion and contraction due to temperature variations. When out-of-
face, no-slip, joint-to-rail contact exists by design, the requirements 
of this paragraph do not apply. Those locations are considered to be 
continuous welded rail track and must meet all the requirements for 
continuous welded rail track prescribed in this part.
    (g) No rail or angle bar having a torch cut or burned bolt hole may 
be used in classes 3 through 6 track.


<R05>
Sec. 213.123   Tie plates.

    (a) In classes 3 through 6 track where timber crossties are in use 
there must be tie plates under the running rails on at least eight of 
any 10 consecutive ties.

<R05>
Sec. 213.127  Rail fastenings.

    Each 39 foot segment of rail shall have a sufficient number of 
fastenings which, in the determination of a qualified Federal or State 
track inspector, effectively maintain gage within the limits prescribed 
in Sec. 213.53(b). The term qualified State track inspector as used in 
this section means a track inspector who meets the qualification 
requirements of 49 CFR 212.203. (Formerly Sec. 212.75).

<R05>
Sec. 213.133   Turnouts and track crossings generally.

    (a) In turnouts and track crossings, the fastenings must be intact 
and

[[Page 85]]

maintained so as to keep the components securely in place. Also, each 
switch, frog, and guard rail must be kept free of obstructions that may 
interfere with the passage of wheels.
    (b) Classes 4 through 6 track must be equipped with rail anchors 
through and on each side of track crossings and turnouts, to restrain 
rail movement affecting the position of switch points and frogs.
    (c) Each flangeway at turnouts and track crossings must be at least 
1\1/2\ inches wide.

[36 FR 20336, Oct. 20, 1971, as amended at 38 FR 876, Jan. 5, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 213.135  Switches.

    (a) Each stock rail must be securely seated in switch plates, but 
care must be used to avoid canting the rail by overtightening the rail 
braces.
    (b) Each switch point must fit its stock rail properly, with the 
switch stand in either of its closed positions to allow wheels to pass 
the switch point. Lateral and vertical movement of a stock rail in the 
switch plates or of a switch plate on a tie must not adversely affect 
the fit of the switch point to the stock rail.
    (c) Each switch must be maintained so that the outer edge of the 
wheel tread cannot contact the gage side of the stock rail.
    (d) The heel of each switch rail must be secure and the bolts in 
each heel must be kept tight.
    (e) Each switch stand and connecting rod must be securely fastened 
and operable without excessive lost motion.
    (f) Each throw lever must be maintained so that it cannot be 
operated with the lock or keeper in place.
    (g) Each switch position indicator must be clearly visible at all 
times.
    (h) Unusually chipped or worn switch points must be repaired or 
replaced. Metal flow must be removed to insure proper closure.


<R05>
Sec. 213.137  Frogs.

    (a) The flangeway depth measured from a plane across the wheel-
bearing area of a frog on class 1 track may not be less than 1\3/8\ 
inches, or less than 1\1/2\ inches on classes 2 through 6 track.
    (b) If a frog point is chipped, broken, or worn more than five-
eighths inch down and 6 inches back, operating speed over the frog may 
not be more than 10 miles per hour.
    (c) If the tread portion of a frog casting is worn down more than 
three-eighths inch below the original contour, operating speed over that 
frog may not be more than 10 miles per hour.


<R05>
Sec. 213.139  Spring rail frogs.

    (a) The outer edge of a wheel tread may not contact the gage side of 
a spring wing rail.
    (b) The toe of each wing rail must be solidly tamped and fully and 
tightly bolted.
    (c) Each frog with a bolt hole defect or head-web separation must be 
replaced.
    (d) Each spring must have a tension sufficient to hold the wing rail 
against the point rail.
    (e) The clearance between the hold-down housing and the horn may not 
be more than one-fourth of an inch.


<R05>
Sec. 213.141  Self-guarded frogs.

    (a) The raised guard on a self-guarded frog may not be worn more 
than three-eighths of an inch.
    (b) If repairs are made to a self-guarded frog without removing it 
from service, the guarding face must be restored before rebuilding the 
point.

<R05>
Sec. 214.7  Definitions.

    (a) Anchorage means a secure point of attachment for lifelines, 
lanyards or deceleration devices that is independent of the means of 
supporting or suspending the employee.
    (b) Body belt means a strap that can be secured around the waist or 
body and attached to a lanyard, lifeline, or deceleration device.
    (c) Body harness means a device with straps that is secured about

existing and predictable hazards in the workplace and who is authorized 
to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate them.
    (e) Deceleration device means any mechanism, including, but not 
limited to, rope grabs, ripstitch lanyards, specially woven lanyards, 
tearing or deforming lanyards, and automatic self-retracting lifelines/
lanyards that serve to dissipate a substantial amount of energy during a 
fall arrest, or otherwise limit the energy on an employee during fall 
arrest.
    (f) Equivalent means alternative designs, materials, or methods that 
the railroad or railroad contractor can demonstrate will provide equal 
or greater safety for employees than the means specified in this part.

with a normally closed keeper, that may be opened to permit the hook to 
receive an object and, when released, automatically closes to retain the 
object.


<R04>
                Subpart B--Bridge Worker Safety Standards


<R05>
Sec. 214.101  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of this subpart is to prevent accidents and 
casualties arising from the performance of work on railroad bridges.
    (b) This subpart prescribes minimum railroad safety rules for 
railroad employees performing work on bridges. Each railroad and 
railroad contractor may prescribe additional or more stringent operating 
rules, safety rules, and other special instructions not inconsistent 
with this subpart.
    (c) These provisions apply to all railroad employees, railroads, and 
railroad contractors performing work on railroad bridges.
    (d) Any working conditions involving the protection of railroad 
employees working on railroad bridges not within the subject matter 
addressed by this chapter, including respiratory protection, hazard 
communication, hearing protection, welding and lead exposure standards, 
shall be governed by the regulations of the U.S. Department of Labor, 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 214.103  Fall protection, generally.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this 
section, when employees work twelve feet or more above the ground or 
water surface, they shall be provided and shall use a personal fall 
arrest system or safety net system. All fall protection systems required 
by this section shall conform to the standards set forth in Sec. 214.105 
of this subpart.
    (b)(1) This section shall not apply if the installation of the fall 
arrest system poses a greater exposure to risk than the work to be 
performed. In any action brought by FRA to enforce the fall protection 
requirements, the railroad or railroad contractor shall have the burden 
of proving that the installation of such device poses greater exposure 
to risk than performance of the work itself.

[[Page 92]]

    (2) This section shall not apply to employees engaged in inspection 
of railroad bridges conducted in full compliance with the following 
conditions:
    (i) The railroad or railroad contractor has a written program in 
place that requires training in, adherence to, and use of safe 
procedures associated with climbing techniques and procedures to be 
used;
    (ii) The employee to whom this exception applies has been trained 
and qualified according to that program to perform bridge inspections, 
has been previously and voluntarily designated to perform inspections 
under the provisions of that program, and has accepted the designation;
    (iii) The employee to whom this exception applies is familiar with 
the appropriate climbing techniques associated with all bridge 
structures the employee is responsible for inspecting;
    (iv) The employee to whom this exception applies is engaged solely 
in moving on or about the bridge or observing, measuring, and recording 
the dimensions and condition of the bridge and its components; and
    (v) The employee to whom this exception applies is provided all 
equipment necessary to meet the needs of safety, including any 
specialized or alternative systems required.
    (c) This section shall not apply where employees are working on a 
railroad bridge equipped with walkways and railings of sufficient 
height, width, and strength to prevent a fall, provided that the 
employee does not work beyond the railings, over the side of the bridge, 
on ladders or other elevation devices, or where gaps or holes exist 
through which a body could fall. Where used in place of fall protection 
as provided for in Sec. 214.105, this paragraph (c) is satisfied by:
    (1) Walkways and railings meeting the standards set forth in the 
American Railway Engineering Association's Manual for Railway 
Engineering; and
    (2) Roadways attached to railroad bridges, provided that employees 
on the roadway deck work or move at a distance of six feet or more from 
the edge of the roadway deck, or from an opening through which a person 
could fall.
    (d) This section shall not apply where employees are performing 
repairs or inspections of a minor nature that are completed by working 
exclusively between the outside rails, including, but not limited to, 
routine welding, spiking, anchoring, spot surfacing, and joint bolt 
replacement.

\1\ A penalty may be assessed against an individual only for a willful  
  violation. Generally, when two or more violations of these regulations
  are discovered with respect to a single freight car that is placed or 
  continued in service by a railroad, the appropriate penalties set     
  forth above are aggregated up to a maximum of $10,000 per day.        
  However, a failure to perform, with respect to a particular freight   
  car, the predeparture inspection required by Sec.  215.13 of this part
  will be treated as a violation separate and distinct from, and in     
  addition to, any substantive violative conditions found on the car.   
  The Administrator reserves the right to assess a penalty of up to     
  $20,000 for any violation where circumstances warrant. See 49 CFR part
  209, appendix A.                                                      
Failure to observe any condition for movement set forth in paragraphs   
  (a) and (c) of Sec.  215.9 will deprive the railroad of the benefit of
  the movement-for-repair provision and make the railroad and any       
  responsible individuals liable for penalty under the particular       
  regulatory section(s) concerning the substantive defect(s) present on 
  the freight car at the time of movement.                              
Maintenance-of-way equipment not stenciled in accordance with Sec.      
  215.305 is subject to all requirements of this part. See Sec.         
  215.3(c)(3).                                                          


[53 FR 52925, Dec. 29, 1988]

      Appendix C to Part 215--FRA Freight Car Standards Defect Code

    The following defect code has been established for use by FRA and 
State inspectors to report defects observed during inspection of freight 
cars. The purpose of the code is to establish a uniform language among 
FRA, States, and the railroad industry that will facilitate 
communication, recordkeeping, and statistical analyses. The code may not 
be substituted for the description of defects on bad order tags affixed 
to cars being moved for repair under Sec. 215.9. However, it may be used 
to supplement that description.

    (4) If the speed within this area is resticted to not more than 5 
miles per hour a derail, capable of restricting access to that portion 
of a track within the area on which the rolling equipment is located, 
will fulfill the requirements of a manually operated switch in 
compliance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section when positioned at 
least 50 feet from the end of the equipment to be protected by the blue 
signal, when locked in a derailing position with an effective locking 
device, and when a blue signal is displayed at the derail;
    (5) A locomotive may be moved onto a locomotive servicing area track 
after the blue signal has been removed from the entrance switch to the 
area. However, the locomotive must be stopped short of coupling to 
another locomotive;
    (6) A locomotive may be moved off of a locomotive servicing area 
track after the blue signal has been removed from the controlling 
locomotive to be moved and from the area departure switch;
    (7) If operated by an authorized employee under the direction of the 
person in charge of the workers, a locomotive protected by blue signals 
may be repositioned within this area after the blue signal has been 
removed from the locomotive to be repositioned and the workers on the 
affected track have been notified of the movement; and
    (8) Blue signal protection removed for the movement of locomotives 
as provided in paragraphs (a) (5) and (6) of this section must be 
restored immediately after the locomotive has cleared the switch.
    (b) When workers are on, under, or between rolling equipment in a 
car shop repair track area:
    (1) A blue signal must be displayed at or near each switch providing 
entrance to or departure from the area; and
    (2) Each switch providing entrance to or departure from the area 
must be lined against movement to the area and locked with an effective 
locking device;
    (3) If the speed within this area is restricted to not more than 5 
miles per hour, a derail capable of restricting access to that portion 
of a track within the area on which the rolling equipment is located 
will fulfill the requirements of a manually operated switch in 
compliance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section when positioned at 
least 50 feet from the end of the equipment to be protected by the blue 
signal, when locked in a derailing position with an effective locking 
device and when a blue signal is displayed at the derail;
    (4) If operated by an authorized employee under the direction of the 
person in charge of the workemen, a car

[[Page 126]]

mover may be used to reposition rolling equipment within this area after 
workers on the affected track have been notified of the movement.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, 
when workers are on, under, or between rolling equipment on any track, 
other than a main track:
    (1) A derail capable of restricting access to that portion of the 
track on which such equipment is located, will fulfill the requirements 
of a manually operated switch when positioned no less than 150 feet from 
the end so such equipment; and
    (2) Each derail must be locked in a derailing position with an 
effective locking device and a blue signal must be displayed at each 
derail.
    (d) When emergency repair work is to be done on, under, or between a 
locomotive or one or more cars coupled to a locomotive, and blue signals 
are not available, the engineman or operator at the controls of that 
locomotive must be notified and effective measures must be taken to 
protect the workers making the repairs.

Sec. 218.30  Remotely controlled switches.

    (a) After the operator of the remotely controlled switches has 
received the notification required by Sec. 218.27(c), he must line each 
remotely controlled switch against movement to that track and apply an 
effective locking device to the lever, button, or other device 
controlling the switch before he may inform the employee in charge of 
the workers that protection has been provided.
    (b) The operator may not remove the locking device unless he has 
been informed by the person in charge of the workers that it is safe to 
do so.
    (c) The operator must maintain for 15 days a written record of each 
notification which contains the following information:

Sec. 218.31  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes minimum operating rule requirements for the 
protection of railroad employees engaged in the operation of trains, 
locomotives and other rolling equipment.

[42 FR 5065, Jan. 27, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 218.35  Yard limits.

    (a) After August 1, 1977, yard limits must be designated by--
     (1) Yard limit signs, and
    (2) Timetable, train orders, or special instructions.
    (b) After August 1, 1977, each railroad must have in effect an 
operating rule which complies with the requirements set forth below:
    (1) The main tracks within yard limits may be used, clearing the 
time an approaching designated class train is due to leave the nearest 
station where time is shown. In case of failure to clear the time of 
designated class trains, protection must be provided as Sec. 218.37. In 
yard limits where main tracks are governed by block signal system rules, 
protection as prescribed by Sec. 218.37 is not required.
    (2) Trains and engines, except designated class trains, within yard 
limits must move prepared to stop within onehalf the range of vision but 
not exceeding 20 m.p.h. unless the main track is known to be clear by 
block signal indications.
    (3) Within yard limits, movements against the current of traffic on 
the main tracks must not be made unless authorized and protected by 
train order, yardmaster, or other designated official and only under the 
operating restrictions prescribed in Sec. 218.35(b)(2).

[[Page 127]]

    (c) Each railroad shall designate in the operating rule prescribed 
under paragraph (b) of this section the class or classes of trains which 
shall have superiority on the main track within yard limits.

<R05>
Sec. 218.37  Flag protection.

    (a) After August 1, 1977, each railroad must have in effect an 
operating rule which complies with the requirements set forth below:
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, flag 
protection shall be provided--
    (i) When a train is moving on the main track at less than one-half 
the maximum authorized speed (including slow order limits) in that 
territory, flag protection against following trains on the same track 
must be provided by a crew member by dropping off single lighted fusees 
at intervals that do not exceed the burning time of the fusee.
    (ii) When a train is moving on the main track at more than one-half 
the maximum authorized speed (including slow order limits) in that 
territory under circumstances in which it may be overtaken, crew members 
responsible for providing protection will take into consideration the 
grade, curvature of track, weather conditions, sight distance and 
relative speed of his train to following trains and will be governed 
accordingly in the use of fusees.
    (iii) When a train stops on main track, flag protection against 
following trains on the same track must be provided as follows: A crew 
member with flagman's signals must immediately go back at least the 
distance prescribed by timetable or other instructions for the 
territory, place at least two torpedoes on the rail at least 100 feet 
apart and display one lighted fusee. He may then return one-half of the 
distance to his train where he must remain until he has stopped the 
approaching train or is recalled. When recalled, he must leave one 
lighted fusee and while returning to his train, he must also place 
single lighted fusees at intervals that do not exceed the burning time 
of the fusee. When the train departs, a crew member must leave one 
lighted fusee and until the train resumes speed not less than one-half 
the maximum authorized speed (including slow order limits) in that 
territory, he must drop off single lighted fusees at intervals that do 
not exceed the burning time of the fusee.
    (iv) When required by the railroad's operating rules, a forward crew 
member with flagman's signals must protect the front of his train 
against opposing movements by immediately going forward at least the 
distance prescribed by timetable or other instructions for the territory 
placing at least two torpedoes on the rail at least 100 feet apart, 
displaying one lighted fusee, and remaining at that location until 
recalled.
    (v) Whenever a crew member is providing flag protection, he must not 
permit other duties to interfere with the protection of his train.
    (2) Flag protection against following trains on the same track is 
not required if--
    (i) The rear of the train is protected by at least two block 
signals;
    (ii) The rear of the train is protected by an absolute block;
    (iii) The rear of the train is within interlocking limits; or
    (iv) A train order specifies that flag protection is not required.
    (v) A railroad operates only one train at any given time.
    (b) Each railroad shall designate by timetable or other instruction 
for each territory the specific distance which a crew member providing 
flag protection must go out in order to provide adequate protection for 
his train.
    (c) Whenever the use of fusees is prohibited by a Federal, State or 
local fire regulation, each railroad operating within that jurisdiction 
shall provide alternate operating procedures to assure full protection 
of trains in lieu of flag protection required by this section.

hose or to adjust a coupling device and that activity will require that 
the employee place himself between pieces of rolling equipment located 
on a bowl track, the operator of any remotely controlled switch that 
provides access from the apex of the hump to the track on which the 
rolling equipment is located shall be notified;
    (b) Upon such notification, the operator of such remotely controlled 
switch shall line it against movement to the affected bowl track and 
shall apply a locking or blocking device to the control for that switch; 
and
    (c) The operator shall then notify the employee that the requested 
protection has been provided and shall remove the locking or blocking 
device only after being notified by the employee that protection is no 
longer required on that track.

    Source: 54 FR 39545, Sept. 27, 1989, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 218.71  Purpose and scope.

    This subpart prescribes minimum requirements governing protection of 
camp cars that house railroad employees. The rule does not apply to such 
cars while they are in a train.


<R05>
Sec. 218.73  Warning signal display.

    (a) Warning signals, i.e., a white disk with the words ``Occupied 
Camp Car'' in black lettering during daylight hours and an illuminated 
white signal at night, displayed in accordance with Sec. 218.75, 
Sec. 218.77, or Sec. 218.79 signify that employees are in, around, or in 
the vicinity of camp cars. Once the signals have been displayed--
    (1) The camp cars may not be moved for coupling to other rolling 
equipment or moved to another location;
    (2) Rolling equipment may not be placed on the same track so as to 
reduce or block the view of a warning signal; and
    (3) Rolling equipment may not pass a warning signal.
    (b) Warning signals indicating the presence of occupied camp cars, 
displayed in accordance with Secs. 218.75 and 218.79, shall be displayed 
by a designated occupant of the camp cars or that person's immediate 
supervisor. The signal(s) shall be displayed as soon as such cars are 
placed on the track, and such signals may only be removed by those same 
individuals prior to the time the cars are moved to another location.


<R05>
Sec. 218.75  Methods of protection for camp cars.

    When camp cars requiring protection are on either main track or 
track other than main track:
    (a) A warning signal shall be displayed at or near each switch 
providing access to that track;
    (b) The person in charge of the camp car occupants shall immediately 
notify the person responsible for directing train movements on that 
portion of the railroad where the camp cars are being parked;
    (c) Once notified of the presence of camp cars and their location on 
main track or other than main track, the person responsible for 
directing train movements on that portion of the railroad where the camp 
cars are being parked shall take appropriate action to alert affected 
personnel to the presence of the cars;
    (d) Each manually operating switch providing access to track on 
which the camp cars are located shall be lined against movement to that 
track and

[[Page 130]]

secured with an effective locking device and spiked; and
    (e) Each remotely controlled switch providing access to the track on 
which the camp cars are located shall be protected in accordance with 
Sec. 218.77.


<R05>
Sec. 218.77  Remotely controlled switches.

    (a) After the operator of the remotely controlled switch is notified 
that a camp car is to be placed on a particular track, he shall line 
such switch against movement to that track and apply an effective 
locking device applied to the lever, button, or other device controlling 
the switch before informing the person in charge of the camp car 
occupants that protection has been provided.
    (b) The operator may not remove the locking device until informed by 
the person in charge of the camp car occupants that protection is no 
longer required.
    (c) The operator shall maintain for 15 days a written record of each 
notification that contains the following information:
    (1) The name and craft of the employee in charge who provided the 
notification;
    (2) The number or other designation of the track involved;
    (3) The date and time the operator notified the employee in charge 
that protection had been provided in accordance with paragraph (a) of 
this section; and
    (4) The date and time the operator was informed that the work had 
been completed, and the name and craft of the employee in charge who 
provided this information.
    (d) When occupied camp cars are parked on main track, a derail, 
capable of restricting access to that portion of the track on which such 
equipment is located, shall be positioned no less than 150 feet from the 
end of such equipment and locked in a derailing position with an 
effective locking device, and a warning signal must be displayed at the 
derail.


<R05>
Sec. 218.79  Alternative methods of protection.

    Instead of providing protection for occupied camp cars in accordance 
with Sec. 218.75 or Sec. 218.77, the following methods of protection may 
be used:
    (a) When occupied camp cars are on track other than main track:
    (1) A warning signal must be displayed at or near each switch 
providing access to or from the track;
    (2) Each switch providing entrance to or departure from the area 
must be lined against movement to the track and locked with an effective 
locking device; and
    (3) If the speed within this area is restricted to not more than 
five miles per hour, a derail, capable of restricting access to that 
portion of track on which the camp cars are located, will fulfill the 
requirements of a manually operated switch in compliance with paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section when positioned at least 50 feet from the end of 
the camp cars to be protected by the warning signal, when locked in a 
derailing position with an effective locking device, and when a warning 
signal is displayed at the derail.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, when 
occupied camp cars are on track other than main track:
    (1) A derail, capable of restricting access to that portion of the 
track on which such equipment is located, will fulfill the requirements 
of a manually operated switch when positioned no less than 150 feet from 
the end of such equipment; and
    (2) Each derail must be locked in a derailing position with an 
effective locking device and a warning signal must be displayed at each 
derail.


<R05>
Sec. 218.80  Movement of occupied camp cars.

    Occupied cars may not be humped or flat switched unless coupled to a 
locomotive.

 Appendix B to Part 218--Statement of Agency Enforcement Policy on Blue 
                 Signal Protection for Utility Employees

    The following examples of the application of the train or yard crew 
exclusion from required blue signal protection for utility employees are 
provided to clarify FRA's enforcement policy. In the first four 
examples, the utility employee is properly attached to and functioning 
as member of a train or yard crew and is excluded from blue signal 
protection, provided all the conditions specified in Sec. 218.22 are 
met:
    Example 1: A utility employee assists a train crew by adding or 
reducing railroad cars to or from the train. The utility employee may 
perform any duties which would normally be conducted by members of the 
train crew, i.e., setting or releasing handbrakes, coupling air hoses 
and other connections, prepare rail cars for coupling, and perform air 
brake tests.
    Example 2: A utility employee is assigned to assist a yard crew for 
the purpose of classifying and assembling railroad cars. The yard crew 
onboard their locomotive arrives at the location in the yard where the 
work is to be performed. At that time, the utility employee may attach 
himself to the yard crew and commence duties as a member of that yard 
crew.
    Example 3: A utility employee is assigned to inspect, test, remove 
and replace if necessary, a combination rear end marking device/end of 
train device on a through freight train. The utility employee attaches 
himself to the train crew after the arrival of the train and its crew at 
the location where this work is to be conducted. He may then perform 
duties as a member of that crew.
    Example 4: A railroad manager who properly attaches himself as a 
utility employee to a train or yard crew, in accordance with 
Sec. 218.22, may then function as a member of

[[Page 132]]

the train or yard crew under the exclusion provided for train and yard 
crews.
    Note: In the last four examples, any railroad employee, including 
regularly assigned crew members, would need blue signal protection to 
perform the described function.
    Example 5: Prior to the arrival of a through freight train, a 
utility employee installs an end-of-train device on one end of a block 
of railroad cars that are scheduled to be picked up by the freight 
train.
    Example 6: A railroad employee attaches himself to a train or yard 
crew while the crew is in the ready room preparing to take charge of 
their train. Prior to the train crew leaving the ready room and taking 
charge of the equipment, the employee couples air hoses and other 
connections between the locomotives.
    Example 7: A railroad employee is attached to a train crew after the 
train crew has taken charge of the train. It is necessary for the 
employee to perform a repair on a rail car, such as replacing a brake 
shoe, in addition to those duties normally performed by train or yard 
crew members.
    Example 8: A train or yard crew, supplemented by three utility 
employees, has an assigned locomotive and train. The regular crew, 
including the engineer, has left the train to eat lunch. The utility 
employees have remained with the train and are coupling air hoses 
between rail cars in the train.

   Appendix C to Part 218--Statement of Agency Enforcement Policy on 
                                Tampering

    The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-342, enacted 
June 22, 1988) (``RSIA'') raised the maximum civil penalties available 
under the railroad safety laws and made individuals liable for willful 
violations of those laws. Section 21 of the RSIA requires that FRA adopt 
regulations addressing three related but distinct aspects of problems 
that can occur when safety devices are tampered with or disabled. It 
requires that FRA make it unlawful for (i) any individual to willfully 
tamper with or disable a device; (ii) any individual to knowingly 
operate or permit to be operated a train with a tampered or disabled 
device; and (iii) any railroad to operate such a train.
    Because the introduction of civil penalties against individuals 
brings FRA's enforcement of the rail safety laws into a new era and 
because the changes being introduced by this regulation are so 
significant, FRA believes that it is advisable to set forth the manner 
in which it will exercise its enforcement authority under this 
regulation.

                   Safety Devices Covered by This Rule

    FRA has employed a functional description of what constitutes a 
safety device under this rule. FRA's wording effectively identifies 
existing equipment and is sufficiently expansive to cover equipment that 
may appear in the future, particularly devices associated with advanced 
train control systems currently undergoing research testing.
    FRA has been advised by portions of the regulated community that its 
functional definition has some potential for confusing people who read 
the rule without the benefit of the preamble discussions concerning the 
meaning of this definition. Since this rule is specifically intended to 
preclude misconduct by individuals, FRA wants this rule to be easily 
comprehended by all who read it. To achieve that clarity, FRA has decide 
to specify which types of equipment it considers to be within the scope 
of this rule and provide some examples of equipment that is not covered. 
In addition, FRA is ready and willing to respond in writing to any 
inquiry about any other devices that a party believes are treated 
ambiguously under this rule. This regulation applies to a variety of 
devices including equipment known as ``event recorders,'' ``alerters,'' 
``deadman controls,'' ``automatic cab signals,'' ``cab signal 
whistles,'' ``automatic train stop equipment,'' and ``automatic train 
control equipment.'' FRA does not consider the following equipment to be 
covered by this rule: Radios; monitors for end-of-train devices; bells 
or whistles that are not connected to alerters, deadman pedals, or 
signal system devices; fans for controlling interior temperature of 
locomotive cabs; and locomotive performance monitoring devices, unless 
they record data such as train speed and air brake operations. Although 
FRA considers such devices beyond the scope of the regulation, this does 
not imply that FRA condones the disabling of such devices. FRA will not 
hesitate to include such devices at a later date should instances of 
tampering with these devices be discovered. FRA does not currently 
perceive a need to directly proscribe tampering with such devices 
because there is no history of these devices being subjected to 
tampering.

          Subsequent Operators of Trains With Disabled Devices

    Section 218.57 addresses instances in which one individual has 
tampered with a safety device and a second individual (a ``subsequent 
operator'') knowingly operates a train or permits it to be operated, 
notwithstanding the presence of the disabled or tampered-with unit. The 
most common occurrence addressed by this provision is the situation in 
which a train crew encounters a locomotive with a safety device that has 
been tampered

[[Page 133]]

with prior to the crew's assuming responsibility for the locomotive. FRA 
has structured this provision and its attendant enforcement policy to 
reflect the fact that instances in which one individual encounters a 
locomotive that someone else has tampered with are relatively infrequent 
occurrences.
    FRA's regulatory prohibition for subsequent operator conduct 
reflects the legal standard for individual culpability set forth in the 
RSIA. Under the relevant statutory standard (``knowingly operates or 
permits to be operated a train on which such devices have been tampered 
with or disabled by another person'')--now incorporated into 
Sec. 218.57--individuals could be held to a simple negligence standard 
of conduct, i.e., a standard of reasonable care under the circumstances. 
FRA's conclusion about the proper interpretation of the word 
``knowingly'' stems from both normal canons of statutory construction 
and analysis of decisional law concerning the use of similar statutory 
constructs in the civil penalty context. It is also consistent with 
other Departmental interpretations of the word as used in similar 
contexts. (See 49 CFR 107.299, defining ``knowingly'' under the 
Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, 49 App. U.S.C. 1801 et seq.)
    Under that statutory language, the responsible members of the crew 
could be culpable if either (1) due to their failure to exercise 
reasonable care, they failed to determine that the safety device was not 
functioning, or (2) having ascertained that the device was not 
functioning, still elected to operate the train. Similarly, railroad 
supervisors who permit or direct that a train with a disabled device be 
operated after having learned that the safety device is not functioning 
or after having failed to use reasonable care in the performance of 
their duties could also be subject to sanction.
    However, as a matter of enforcement policy, application of a 
negligence standard in this particular context presently appears 
unwarranted. We have seen no evidence of an employee's negligent failure 
to detect another employee's tampering having caused a safety problem. 
FRA can effectively attack the known dimensions of the tampering problem 
by employing an enforcement policy that limits its enforcement actions 
to situations where individuals clearly had actual knowledge of the 
disabled device and intentionally operated the train notwithstanding 
that knowledge.
    Therefore, FRA will not take enforcement action against an 
individual under Sec. 218.57 absent a showing of such actual knowledge 
of the facts. Actual, subjective knowledge need not be demonstrated. It 
will suffice to show objectively that the alleged violator must have 
known the facts based on reasonable inferences drawn from the 
circumstances. For example, it is reasonable to infer that a person 
knows about something plainly in sight on the locomotive he is 
operating. Also, unlike the case where willfulness must be shown (see 
FRA's statement of policy at 49 CFR part 209, appendix A), knowledge of 
or reckless disregard for the law need not be shown to make out a 
violation of Sec. 218.57. The knowledge relevant here is knowledge of 
the facts constituting the violation, not knowledge of the law.
    Should FRA receive evidence indicating that a stricter enforcement 
policy is necessary to address the tampering problem, it will revise its 
enforcement policy to permit enforcement actions based only on a showing 
of the subsequent operator's negligent failure to detect the tampering, 
as the relevant provision of the RSIA permits it to do now. Any such 
change in enforcement policy will become effective only after 
publication of a revised version of this appendix.

breath expressed in terms of grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath 
(as indicated by a breath test under this part) or grams of alcohol per 
100 milliliters of whole blood.
    Alcohol use means the consumption of any beverage, mixture or 
preparation, including any medication, containing alcohol.
    Class I, ``Class II,'' and ``Class III'' have the meaning assigned 
by regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission (49 CFR Part 1201; 
General Instructions 1-1), as those regulations may be revised and 
applied by order of the Commission (including modifications in class 
thresholds based revenue deflator adjustments).
    Confirmation test means a second test, following a screening test 
with a result of .02 or greater, that provides quantitative data of 
alcohol concentration.
    Consortium means an entity, including a group or association of 
employers or contractors, that provides alcohol testing as required by 
this part or other DOT alcohol testing regulation and that acts on 
behalf of the employers.
    Controlled substance has the meaning assigned by 21 U.S.C. 802 and 
includes all substances listed on Schedules I through V as they may be 
revised from time to time (21 CFR parts 1301-1316).
    Covered employee means a person who has been assigned to perform 
service subject to the Hours of Service Act (45 U.S.C. 61-64b) during a 
duty tour, whether or not the person has performed or is currently 
performing such service, and any person who performs such service. (An 
employee is not ``covered'' within the meaning of this part exclusively 
by reason of being an employee for purposes of section 2(a)(3) of the 
Hours of Service Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 62(a)(3)).) For the purposes 
of pre-employment testing only, the term covered employee includes a 
person applying to perform covered service.

material by part 172 of this title.
    Impact accident means a train accident (i.e., a rail equipment 
accident involving damage in excess of the current reporting threshold, 
$6,300 in 1991 and thereafter) consisting of a head-on collision, a 
rear-end collision, a side collision (including a collision at a 
railroad crossing at grade), a switching collision, or impact with a 
deliberately-placed obstruction such as a bumping post. The following 
are not impact accidents:
    (1) An accident in which the derailment of equipment causes an 
impact with other rail equipment;
    (2) Impact of rail equipment with obstructions such as fallen trees, 
rock or snow slides, livestock, etc.; and
    (3) Raking collisions caused by derailment of rolling stock or 
operation of equipment in violation of clearance limitations.
    Independent with respect to a medical facility, means not under the 
ownership or control of the railroad and not operated or staffed by a 
salaried officer or employee of the railroad. The fact that the railroad 
pays for services rendered by a medical facility or laboratory, selects 
that entity for performing tests under this part, or has a standing 
contractual relationship with that entity to perform tests under this 
part or perform other medical examinations or tests of railroad 
employees does not, by itself, remove the facility from this definition.
    Medical facility means a hospital, clinic, physician's office, or 
laboratory where toxicological samples can be collected according to 
recognized professional standards.
    Medical practitioner means a physician or dentist licensed or 
otherwise authorized to practice by the state.
    Medical Review Officer or MRO refers to a licensed physician 
designated by the railroad who is responsible for receiving laboratory 
results generated by the railroad's drug testing program (including 
testing mandated or authorized by this part), who has knowledge of 
substance abuse disorders, and who has appropriate medical training to 
interpret and evaluate an individual's positive test result (as reported 
by the laboratory) together with his or her medical history and any 
other relevant biomedical information.
    NTSB means the National Transportation Safety Board.
    Passenger train means a train transporting persons (other than 
employees, contractors or persons riding equipment to observe or monitor 
railroad operations) in intercity passenger service, commuter or other 
short-haul service, or for excursion or recreational purposes.
    Positive rate means the number of positive results for random drug 
tests conducted under this part plus the number of refusals of random 
tests required by this part, divided by the total number of random drug 
tests conducted under this part plus the number of refusals of random 
tests required by this part.
    Possess means to have on one's person or in one's personal effects 
or under one's control. However, the concept of possession as used in 
this part does not include control by virtue of presence in the 
employee's personal residence or other similar location off of railroad 
property.
    Railroad means all forms of non-highway ground transportation that 
run on rails or electro-magnetic guideways, including:
    (1) Commuter or other short-haul rail passenger service in a 
metropolitan or suburban area, as well as any commuter rail service

1979, and
    (2) High speed ground transportation systems that connect 
metropolitan areas, without regard to whether they use new technologies 
not associated with traditional railroads.

Such term does not include rapid transit operations within an urban area 
that are not connected to the general railroad system of transportation.

damage to railroad property, including railroad

[[Page 137]]

on-track equipment, signals, track, track structures (including bridges 
and tunnels), or roadbed, including labor costs and all other costs for 
repair or replacement in kind. Estimated cost for replacement of 
railroad property shall be calculated as described in the FRA Guide for 
Preparing Accident/Incident Reports. (See 49 CFR 225.21.) However, 
replacement of passenger equipment shall be calculated based on the cost 
of acquiring a new unit for comparable service.
    Refuse to submit means that a covered employee fails to provide a 
urine sample as required by 49 CFR part 40, without a genuine inability 
to provide a specimen (as determined by a medical evaluation), after he 
or she has received notice of the requirement to be tested in accordance 
with the provisions of this part, or engages in conduct that clearly 
obstructs the testing process.
    Refuse to submit (to an alcohol test) means that a covered employee 
fails to provide adequate breath for testing without a valid medical 
explanation after he or she has received notice of the requirement to be 
tested in accordance with the provisions of this part, or engages in 
conduct that clearly obstructs the testing process.
    Reportable injury means an inury reportable under part 225 of this 
title.
    Reporting threshold means the amount specified in Sec. 225.19(c) of 
this title, as adjusted from time to time in accordance with appendix A 
to part 225 of this title (i.e., $6,300 in 1991 and thereafter).
    Screening test means an analytical procedure to determine whether a 
covered employee may have a prohibited concentration of alcohol in his 
or her system.
    Supervisory employee means an officer, special agent, or other 
employee of the railroad who is not a co-worker and who is responsible 
for supervising or monitoring the conduct or performance of one or more 
employees.

one locomotive coupled, with or without cars. (A locomotive is a self-
propelled unit of equipment which can be used in train service.)
    Train accident means a passenger, freight, or work train accident 
described in Sec. 225.19(c) of this title (a ``rail equipment accident'' 
involving damage in excess of the current reporting threshold, $6,300 in 
1991 and thereafter), including an accident involving a switching 
movement.
    Train incident means an event involving the movement of railroad on-
track equipment that results in a casualty but in which railroad 
property damage does not exceed the reporting threshold.
    Violation rate means the number of covered employees (as reported 
under Sec. 219.801 of this part) found during random tests given under 
this part to have an alcohol concentration of .04 or greater, plus the 
number of employees who refuse a random test required by this part, 
divided by the total reported number of employees in the industry given 
random alcohol tests under this part plus the total reported number of 
employees in the industry who refuse a random test required by this 
part.

Sec. 219.7  Waivers.

    (a) A person subject to a requirement of this part may petition the 
Federal Railroad Administration for a waiver of compliance with such 
requirement.
    (b) Each petition for waiver under this section must be filed in a 
manner and contain the information required by part 211 of this chapter.
    (c) If the Administrator finds that waiver of compliance is in the 
public interest and is consistent with railroad safety, the 
Administrator may grant the waiver subject to any necessary conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 219.9  Responsibility for compliance.

    (a) Any person (including but not limited to a railroad; any 
manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of a railroad; 
any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, 
or facilities; any independent contractor providing goods or services to 
a railroad; and any employee of such owner, manufacturer, lessor, 
lessee, or independent contractor) who violates any requirement of this 
part or causes the violation of any such requirement is subject to a 
civil

[[Page 138]]

penalty of at least $500 and not more than $10,000 per violation, except 
that: Penalties may be assessed against individuals only for willful 
violations; where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated 
violations has created an imminent hazard of death or injury, or has 
caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $20,000 per violation 
may be assessed; and the standard of liability for a railroad will vary 
depending upon the requirement involved. See, e.g., Sec. 219.105, which 
shall be construed to qualify the responsibility of a railroad for the 
unauthorized conduct of an employee that violates Sec. 219.101 or 
Sec. 219.102 (while imposing a duty of due diligence to prevent such 
conduct). Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate 
offense. See appendix A to this part for a statement of agency civil 
penalty policy.
    (b)(1) In the case of joint operations, primary responsibility for 
compliance with this part with respect to determination of events 
qualifying for breath or body fluid testing under subparts C and D of 
this part shall rest with the host railroad, and all affected employees 
shall be responsive to direction from the host railroad consistent with 
this part. However, nothing in this paragraph shall restrict the ability 
of the railroads to provide for an appropriate assignment of 
responsibility for compliance with this part as among those railroads 
through a joint operating agreement or other binding contract. FRA 
reserves the right to bring an enforcement action for noncompliance with 
applicable portions of this part against the host railroad, the 
employing railroad, or both.
    (2) Where an employee of one railroad is required to participate in 
breath or body fluid testing under subpart C or D and is subsequently 
subject to adverse action alleged to have arisen out of the required 
test (or alleged refusal thereof), necessary witnesses and documents 
available to the other railroad shall be made available to the employee 
on a reasonable basis.
    (c) Any independent contractor or other entity that performs covered 
service for a railroad has the same responsibilities as a railroad under 
this part, with respect to its employees who perform covered service. 
The entity's responsibility for compliance with this part may be 
fulfilled either directly by that entity or by the railroad's treating 
the entity's employees who perform covered service as if they were its 
own employees for purposes of this part. The responsibility for 
compliance must be clearly spelled out in the contract between the 
railroad and the other entity or in another document. In the absence of 
such a clear delineation of responsibility, FRA will hold the railroad 
and the other entity jointly and severally liable for compliance.

<R05>
Sec. 219.11  General conditions for chemical tests.

    (a) Any employee who performs covered service for a railroad shall 
be deemed to have consented to testing as required in subparts B, C, D, 
and G of this part; and consent is implied by performance of such 
service.
    (b)(1) Each such employee shall participate in such testing, as 
required under the conditions set forth in this part by a representative 
of the railroad.
    (2) In any case where an employee has sustained a personal injury 
and is subject to alcohol or drug testing under this part, necessary 
medical treatment shall be accorded priority over provision of the 
breath or body fluid sample(s). No employee who is unable to urinate 
normally (based on the judgment of a medical professional that 
catheterization would be required) as a result of a personal injury, 
resulting medical treatment, or renal failure shall be required to 
provide a urine sample. Nothing in this section shall bar use of a urine 
sample made available as a result of catheterization undertaken for 
medical purposes, provided the circumstances of such collection are 
fully documented and the specimen is otherwise handled in accordance 
with the applicable requirements of this title.
    (3) Failure to remain available following an accident or casualty as 
required by company rules (i.e., being absent without leave) shall be 
considered a refusal to participate in testing, without regard to any 
subsequent provision of samples.

[[Page 139]]

    (4) Tampering with a sample in order to prevent a valid test (e.g., 
through substitution, dilution or adulteration) constitutes a refusal to 
provide a sample.
    (c) A covered employee who is required to be tested under subpart C 
or D and who is taken to a medical facility for observation or treatment 
after an accident or incident shall be deemed to have consented to the 
release to FRA of the following:
    (1) The remaining portion of any body fluid sample taken by the 
treating facility within 12 hours of the accident or incident that is 
not required for medical purposes, together with any normal medical 
facility record(s) pertaining to the taking of such sample;
    (2) The results of any laboratory tests for alcohol or any drug 
conducted by or for the treating facility on such sample; and
    (3) The identity, dosage, and time of administration of any drugs 
administered by the treating facility prior to the time samples were 
taken by the treating facility or prior to the time samples were taken 
in compliance with this part.
    (4) The results of any breath tests for alcohol conducted by or for 
the treating facility.
    (d) An employee required to participate in body fluid testing under 
subpart C (post-accident toxicological testing) or testing subject to 
subpart H shall, if requested by the representative of the railroad or 
the medical facility (including under subpart H of this part, a non-
medical contract collector), evidence consent to taking of samples, 
their release for toxicological analysis under pertinent provisions of 
this part, and release of the test results to the railroad's Medical 
Review Officer by promptly executing a consent form, if required by the 
medical facility. The employee is not required to execute any document 
or clause waiving rights that the employee would otherwise have against 
the employer, and any such waiver is void. The employee may not be 
required to waive liability with respect to negligence on the part of 
any person participating in the collection, handling or analysis of the 
specimen or to indemnify any person for the negligence of others. Any 
consent provided consistent with this section shall be construed to 
extend only to those actions specified herein.
    (e) Nothing in this part shall be construed to authorize the use of 
physical coercion or any other deprivation of liberty in order to compel 
breath or body fluid testing.
    (f) Any railroad employee who performs service for a railroad shall 
be deemed to have consented to removal of body fluid and/or tissue 
samples necessary for toxicological analysis from the remains of such 
employee, if such employee dies within 12 hours of an accident or 
incident described in subpart C as a result of such event. This consent 
is specifically required of employees not in covered service, as well as 
employees in covered service.
    (g) Each supervisor responsible for covered employees (except a 
working supervisor within the definition of co-worker under this part) 
shall be trained in the signs and symptoms of alcohol and drug 
influence, intoxication and misuse consistent with a program of 
instruction to be made available for inspection upon demand by FRA. Such 
a program shall, at a minimum provide information concerning the acute 
behavioral and apparent physiological effects of alcohol and the major 
drug groups on the controlled substances list. The program shall also 
provide training on the qualifying criteria for post-accident testing 
contained in subpart C of this part, and the role of the supervisor in 
post-accident collections described in subpart C and appendix C of this 
part. The duration of such training shall be not less than 3 hours.
    (h) Nothing in this subpart restricts any discretion available to 
the railroad to request or require that an employee cooperate in 
additional body fluid testing. However, no such testing may be performed 
on urine or blood samples provided under this part. For purposes of this 
paragraph, all urine from a void constitutes a single sample.

<R05>
Sec. 219.23  Railroad policies.

    (a) Whenever a breath or body fluid test is required of an employee 
under this part, the railroad shall provide clear and unequivocal 
written notice to the employee that the test is being required under 
Federal Railroad Administration regulations. Use of the mandated DOT 
form for urine drug testing or breath analysis satisfies the 
requirements of this paragraph.
    (b) Whenever a breath or body fluid test is required of an employee 
under this part, the railroad shall provide clear, unequivocal written 
notice of the basis or bases upon which the test is required (e.g., 
reasonable suspicion, violation of a specified operating/safety rule 
enumerated in subpart D of this part, random selection, follow-up, 
etc.). Completion of the alcohol testing form or urine custody and 
control form indicating the basis of the test (prior to providing a copy 
to the employee) satisfies the requirement of this paragraph.

[[Page 141]]

    (c) Use of approved forms for mandatory post-accident toxicological 
testing under subpart C of this part provides the notifications required 
under this section with respect to such tests. Use of those forms for 
any other test is prohibited.
    (d) Each railroad shall provide educational materials that explain 
the requirements of this part, and the railroad's policies and 
procedures with respect to meeting those requirements.
    (1) The railroad shall ensure that a copy of these materials is 
distributed to each covered employee prior to the start of alcohol 
testing under the railroad's alcohol misuse prevention program and to 
each person subsequently hired for or transferred to a covered position.
    (2) Each railroad shall provide written notice to representatives of 
employee organizations of the availability of this information.
    (e) Required content. The materials to be made available to 
employees shall include detailed discussion of at least the following:
    (1) The identity of the person designated by the railroad to answer 
employee questions about the materials.
    (2) The classes or crafts of employees who are subject to the 
provisions of this part.
    (3) Sufficient information about the safety-sensitive functions 
performed by those employees to make clear that the period of the work 
day the covered employee is required to be in compliance with this part 
is that period when the employee is on duty and is required to perform 
or is available to perform covered service.
    (4) Specific information concerning employee conduct that is 
prohibited under subpart B of this part.
    (5) In the case of a railroad utilizing the accident/incident and 
rule violation reasonable cause testing authority provided by this part, 
prior notice (which may be combined with the notice required by 
Secs. 219.601(d)(1) and 219.607(d)(1)), to covered employees of the 
circumstances under which they will be subject to testing.
    (6) The circumstances under which a covered employee will be tested 
under this part.
    (7) The procedures that will be used to test for the presence of 
alcohol and controlled substances, protect the employee and the 
integrity of the testing processes, safeguard the validity of the test 
results, and ensure that those results are attributed to the correct 
employee.
    (8) The requirement that a covered employee submit to alcohol and 
drug tests administered in accordance with this part.
    (9) An explanation of what constitutes a refusal to submit to an 
alcohol or drug test and the attendant consequences.
    (10) The consequences for covered employees found to have violated 
subpart B of this part, including the requirement that the employee be 
removed immediately from covered service, and the procedures under 
Sec. 219.104.
    (11) The consequences for covered employees found to have an alcohol 
concentration of .02 or greater but less than .04.
    (12) Information concerning the effects of alcohol misuse on an 
individual's health, work, and personal life; signs and symptoms of an 
alcohol problem (the employee's or a coworker's); and available methods 
of evaluating and resolving problems associated with the misuse of 
alcohol, including utilization of the procedures set forth in subpart E 
of this part and the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of 
substance abuse professionals and counseling and treatment programs.
    (f) Optional provisions. The materials supplied to employees may 
also include information on additional railroad policies with respect to 
the use or possession of alcohol and drugs, including any consequences 
for an employee found to have a specific alcohol concentration, that are 
based on the railroad's authority independent of this part. Any such 
additional policies or consequences shall be clearly and obviously 
described as being based on independent authority.

<R04>
                         Subpart B--Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 219.101  Alcohol and drug use prohibited.

    (a) Prohibitions. Except as provided in Sec. 219.103--
    (1) No employee may use or possess alcohol or any controlled 
substance while assigned by a railroad to perform covered service;
    (2) No employee may report for covered service, or go or remain on 
duty in covered service while--
    (i) Under the influence of or impaired by alcohol;
    (ii) Having .04 or more alcohol concentration in the breath or 
blood; or
    (iii) Under the influence of or impaired by any controlled 
substance.
    (3) No employee may use alcohol for whichever is the lesser of the 
following periods:
    (i) Within four hours of reporting for covered service; or
    (ii) After receiving notice to report for covered service.
    (4) No employee tested under the provisions of this part whose test 
result indicates an alcohol concentration of .02 or greater but less 
than .04 shall perform or continue to perform covered service functions 
for a railroad, nor shall a railroad permit the employee to perform or 
continue to perform covered service, until the start of the employee's 
next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than eight hours 
following administration of the test.
    (b) Controlled substance. ``Controlled substance'' is defined by 
Sec. 219.5 of this part. Controlled substances are grouped as follows: 
Marijuana, narcotics (such as heroin and codeine), stimulants (such as 
cocaine and amphetamines), depressants (such as barbiturates and minor 
tranquilizers), and hallucinogens (such as the drugs known as PCP and 
LSD). Controlled substances include illicit drugs (Schedule I), drugs 
that are required to be distributed only by a medical practitioner's 
prescription or other authorization (Schedules II through IV, and some 
drugs on Schedule V), and certain preparations for which distribution is 
through documented over the counter sales (Schedule V only).
    (c) Railroad rules. Nothing in this section restricts a railroad 
form imposing an absolute prohibition on the presence of alcohol or any 
drug in the body fluids of persons in its employ, whether in furtherance 
of the purpose of this part or for other purposes.
    (d) Construction. This section shall not be construed to prohibit 
the presence of an unopened container of an alcoholic beverage in a 
private motor vehicle that is not subject to use in the business of the 
railroad; nor shall it be construed to restrict a railroad from 
prohibiting such presence under its own rules.

[54 FR 53259, Dec. 27, 1989, as amended at 59 FR 7459, Feb. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 219.102  Prohibition on abuse of controlled substances.

    On and after October 2, 1989, no employee who performs covered 
service may use a controlled substance at any time, whether on duty or 
off duty, except as permitted by Sec. 219.103 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 219.103  Prescribed and over-the-counter drugs.

    (a) This subpart does not prohibit the use of a controlled substance 
(on Schedule II through V of the controlled substance list) prescribed 
or authorized by a medical practitioner, or possession incident to such 
use, if--
    (1) The treating medical practitioner or a physician designated by 
the railroad has made a good faith judgment, with notice of the 
employee's assigned duties and on the basis of the available medical 
history, that use of the substance by the employee at the prescribed or 
authorized dosage level is consistent with the safe performance of the 
employee's duties;
    (2) The substance is used at the dosage prescribed or authorized; 
and
    (3) In the event the employee is being treated by more than one 
medical practitioner, at least one treating medical practitioner has 
been informed of all medications authorized or prescribed and has 
determined that use of the medications is consistent with the safe 
performance of the employee's duties (and the employee has observed any 
restrictions imposed with respect to use of the medications in 
combination).
    (b) This subpart does not restrict any discretion available to the 
railroad to

[[Page 143]]

require that employees notify the railroad of therapeutic drug use or 
obtain prior approval for such use.


<R05>
Sec. 219.104  Responsive action.

    (a) Removal from covered service. (1) If the railroad determines 
that an employee has violated Sec. 219.101 or Sec. 219.102, or the 
alcohol or controlled substances misuse rule of another DOT agency, the 
railroad shall immediately remove the employee from covered service and 
the procedures described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section 
shall apply.
    (2) If an employee refuses to provide breath or a body fluid sample 
or samples when required to by the railroad under a mandatory provision 
of this part, the railroad shall immediately remove the employee from 
covered service, and the procedures described in paragraphs (b) through 
(e) of this section shall apply.
    (3)(i) This section does not apply to actions based on breath or 
body fluid tests for alcohol or drugs that are conducted exclusively 
under authority other than that provided in this part (e.g., testing 
under a company medical policy, for-cause testing policy wholly 
independent of subpart D of this part, or testing under a labor 
agreement).
    (ii) This section and the information requirements listed in 
Sec. 219.23 do not apply to applicants who refuse to submit to a pre-
employment test or who have a pre-employment test with a result 
indicating either an alcohol concentration equal to or greater than .04, 
or the misuse of controlled substances.
    (b) Notice. Prior to or upon withdrawing the employee from covered 
service under this section, the railroad shall provide notice of the 
reason for this action.
    (c) Hearing procedures. (1) If the employee denies that the test 
result is valid evidence of alcohol or drug use prohibited by this 
subpart, the employee may demand and shall be provided an opportunity 
for a prompt post-suspension hearing before a presiding officer other 
than the charging official. This hearing may be consolidated with any 
disciplinary hearing arising from the same accident or incident (or 
conduct directly related thereto), but the presiding officer shall make 
separate findings as to compliance with Secs. 219.101 and 219.102 of 
this part.
    (2) The hearing shall be convened within the period specified in the 
applicable collective bargaining agreement. In the absence of an 
agreement provision, the employee may demand that the hearing be 
convened within 10 calendar days of the suspension or, in the case of an 
employee who is unavailable due to injury, illness, or other sufficient 
cause, within 10 days of the date the employee becomes available for 
hearing.
    (3) A post-suspension proceeding conforming to the requirements of 
an applicable collective bargaining agreement, together with the 
provisions for adjustment of disputes under section 3 of the Railway 
Labor Act, shall be deemed to satisfy the procedural requirements of 
this paragraph.
    (4) Nothing in this part shall be deemed to abridge any additional 
procedural rights or remedies not inconsistent with this part that are 
available to the employee under a collective bargaining agreement, the 
Railway Labor Act, or (with respect to employment at will) at common law 
with respect to the removal or other adverse action taken as a 
consequence of a positive test result in a test authorized or required 
by this part.
    (5) Nothing in this part shall restrict the discretion of the 
railroad to treat an employee's denial of prohibited alcohol or drug use 
as a waiver of any privilege the employee would otherwise enjoy to have 
such prohibited alcohol or drug use treated as a non-disciplinary matter 
or to have discipline held in abeyance.
    (d) Return to covered service. An employee who has been determined 
to have violated Sec. 219.101 or Sec. 219.102 or who refused to 
cooperate in a breath or body fluid test under this part shall not be 
returned to covered service unless the employee has--
    (1) Been evaluated by a substance abuse professional to determine if 
the employee is affected by a psychological or physical dependence on 
alcohol or one or more controlled substances or by another identifiable 
and treatable mental or physical disorder involving

[[Page 144]]

misuse of alcohol or drugs as a primary manifestation;
    (2) Been evaluated by a substance abuse professional to determine 
that the employee has properly followed the prescribed rehabilitation 
program; and
    (3)(i) Presented a urine sample for testing under subpart H of this 
part that tested negative for controlled substances assayed (in the case 
of an employee who has been determined to have violated a prohibition of 
Sec. 219.101 or Sec. 219.102 regarding possession or misuse of 
controlled substances or who refused to provide a body fluid sample or 
samples when required to by the railroad under a mandatory provision of 
this part); or
    (ii) Presented breath for testing under subpart H of this part that 
indicated an alcohol concentration of less than .02. (in the case of an 
employee who has been determined to have violated a prohibition of 
Sec. 219.101 regarding possession or misuse of alcohol or who refused to 
provide breath when required to by the railroad under a mandatory 
provision of this part).
    (4) An employee shall be required to present both a urine sample and 
breath for testing, as specified in this section and subpart H of this 
part, if the substance abuse professional determines that such testing 
is necessary as a condition for returning the particular employee to 
covered service.
    (e) Follow-up testing. An employee returned to service under the 
above-stated conditions shall continue in any program of counseling or 
treatment deemed necessary by the substance abuse professional and shall 
be subject to unannounced follow-up tests administered by the railroad 
following the employee's return to duty. The number and frequency of 
such follow-up testing shall be determined by a substance abuse 
professional, but shall consist of at least six tests in the first 12 
months following the employee's return to duty. Any such testing shall 
be performed in accordance with the requirements of 49 CFR part 40. 
Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 months from the date of the 
employee's return to duty. The substance abuse professional may 
terminate the requirement for follow-up testing at any time after the 
first six tests have been administered, if the substance abuse 
professional determines that such testing is no longer necessary.
    (1) If the employee has been determined to have violated a 
prohibition of Sec. 219.101 or Sec. 219.102 regarding possession or 
misuse of controlled substances, or if the employee refused to provide a 
body fluid sample or samples when required to by the railroad under a 
mandatory provision of this part, the employee shall be subject to 
follow-up testing as specified in this section. Such testing shall be 
for controlled substances, but may include testing for alcohol as well, 
if the substance abuse professional determines that alcohol testing is 
necessary for the particular employee.
    (2) If the employee has been determined to have violated a 
prohibition of Sec. 219.101 regarding possession or misuse of alcohol, 
or if the employee refused to provide breath when required to by the 
railroad under a mandatory provision of this part, the employee shall be 
subject to follow-up testing as specified in this section. Such testing 
shall be for alcohol, but may include testing for controlled substances 
as well, if the substance abuse professional determines that drug 
testing is necessary for the particular employee.
    (f) The railroad shall ensure that a substance abuse professional 
who determines that a covered employee requires assistance in resolving 
problems with alcohol or controlled substances misuse does not refer the 
employee to the substance abuse professional's private practice or to a 
person or organization from which the substance abuse professional 
receives remuneration or in which the substance abuse professional has a 
financial interest. This paragraph does not prohibit a substance abuse 
professional from referring an employee for assistance provided 
through--
    (1) A public agency, such as a state, county, or municipality;
    (2) The railroad or a person under contract to provide treatment for 
alcohol problems on behalf of the railroad;
    (3) The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment under 
the employee's health insurance program; or

[[Page 145]]

    (4) The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment 
reasonably accessible to the employee.
    (g) Railroad compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (a), (d), 
and (e) of this section is mandatory beginning on January 1, 1995.

<R05>
Sec. 219.105  Railroad's duty to prevent violations.

    (a) A railroad may not, with actual knowledge, permit an employee to 
go or remain on duty in covered service in violation of the prohibitions 
of Sec. 219.101 or Sec. 219.102. As used in this section, the knowledge 
imputed to the railroad shall be limited to that of a railroad 
management employee (such as a supervisor deemed an ``officer,'' whether 
or not such person is a corporate officer) or a supervisory employee in 
the offending employee's chain of command.
    (b) A railroad must exercise due diligence to assure compliance with 
Sec. 219.101 and Sec. 219.102 by each covered employee.


<R05>
Sec. 219.107  Consequences of unlawful refusal.

    (a) An employee who refuses to provide breath or a body fluid sample 
or samples when required to by the railroad under a mandatory provision 
of this part shall be deemed disqualified for a period of nine (9) 
months.
    (b) Prior to or upon withdrawing the employee from covered service 
under this section, the railroad shall provide notice of the reason for 
this action, and the procedures described in Sec. 219.104(c) shall 
apply.
    (c) The disqualification required by this section shall apply with 
respect to employment in covered service by any railroad with notice of 
such disqualification.
    (d) The requirement of disqualification for nine (9) months does not 
limit any discretion on the part of the railroad to impose additional 
sanctions for the same or related conduct.
    (e) Upon the expiration of the 9-month period described in this 
section, a railroad may permit the employee to return to covered service 
only under the same conditions specified in Sec. 219.104(d), and the 
employee shall be subject to follow-up tests, as provided by that 
section.

<R04>
             Subpart C--Post-Accident Toxicological Testing


<R05>
Sec. 219.201  Events for which testing is required.

    (a) List of events. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, post-accident toxicological tests shall be conducted after any 
event that involves one or more of the circumstances described in 
paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section:
    (1) Major train accident. Any train accident (i.e., a rail equipment 
accident involving damage in excess of the current reporting threshold, 
$6,300 in 1991 and thereafter) that involves one or more of the 
following:
    (i) A fatality;
    (ii) Release of hazardous material lading from railroad equipment 
accompanied by--
    (A) An evacuation; or
    (B) A reportable injury resulting from the hazardous material 
release (e.g., from fire, explosion, inhalation, or skin contact with 
the material); or
    (iii) Damage to railroad property of $1,000,000 or more.
    (2) Impact accident. An impact accident (i.e., a rail equipment 
accident defined as an ``impact accident'' in Sec. 219.5 of this part 
that involves damage in excess of the current reporting threshold, 
$6,300 in 1991 and thereafter) resulting in--
    (i) A reportable injury; or
    (ii) Damage to railroad property of $150,000 or more.
    (3) Fatal train incident. Any train incident that involves a 
fatality to any on-duty railroad employee.
    (4) Passenger train accident. Reportable injury to any person in a 
train accident (i.e., a rail equipment accident involving damage in 
excess of the current reporting threshold, $6,300 in 1991 and 
thereafter) involving a passenger train.
    (b) Exceptions. No test shall be required in the case of a collision 
between railroad rolling stock and a

[[Page 146]]

motor vehicle or other highway conveyance at a rail/highway grade 
crossing. No test shall be required in the case of an accident/incident 
the cause and severity of which are wholly attributable to a natural 
cause (e.g., flood, tornado or other natural disaster) or to vandalism, 
as determined on the basis of objective and documented facts by the 
railroad representative responding to the scene.
    (c) Good faith determinations. (1)(i) The railroad representative 
responding to the scene of the accident/incident shall determine whether 
the accident/incident falls within the requirements of paragraph (a) of 
this section or is within the exception described in paragraph (b) of 
this section. It is the duty of the railroad representative to make 
reasonable inquiry into the facts as necessary to make such 
determinations. In making such inquiry, the railroad representative 
shall consider the need to obtain samples as soon as practical in order 
to determine the presence or absence of impairing substances reasonably 
contemporaneous with the accident/incident. The railroad representative 
satisfies the requirement of this section if, after making reasonable 
inquiry, the representative exercises good faith judgement in making the 
required determinations.
    (ii) The railroad representative making the determinations required 
by this section shall not be a person directly involved in the accident/
incident. This section does not prohibit consultation between the 
responding railroad representative and higher level railroad officials; 
however, the responding railroad representative shall make the factual 
determinations required by this section.
    (iii) Upon specific request made to the railroad by the Associate 
Administrator for Safety, FRA (or the Associate Administrator's 
delegate), the railroad shall provide a report describing any decision 
by a person other than the responding railroad representative with 
respect to whether an accident/incident qualifies for testing. This 
report shall be affirmed by the decision maker and shall be provided to 
FRA within 72 hours of the request. The report shall include the facts 
reported by the responding railroad representative, the basis upon which 
the testing decision was made, and the person making the decision.
    (iv) Any estimates of railroad property damage made by persons not 
the scene shall be based on descriptions of specific physicial damage 
provided by the on-scene railroad representative.
    (v) In the case of an accident involving passenger equipment, a host 
railroad may rely upon the the damage estimates provided by the 
passenger railroad (whether present on scene or not) in making the 
decision whether testing is required, subject to the same requirement 
that visible physical damage be specifically described.
    (2) A railroad shall not require an employee to provide blood or 
urine specimens under the authority or procedures of this subject unless 
the railroad has made the determinations required by this section, based 
upon reasonable inquiry and good faith judgment. A railroad does not act 
in excess of its authority under this subpart if its representative has 
made such reasonable inquiry and exercised such good faith judgment, but 
it is later determined, after investigation, that one or more of the 
conditions thought to have required testing were not, in fact, present. 
However, this section does not excuse the railroad for any error arising 
from a mistake of law (e.g., application of testing criteria other than 
those contained in these regulations).
    (3) A railroad is not in violation of this subpart if its 
representative has made such reasonable inquiry and exercised such good 
faith judgment but nevertheless errs in determining that post-accident 
testing is not required.
    (4) An accident/incident with respect to which the railroad has made 
reasonable inquiry and exercised good faith judgment in determining the 
facts necessary to apply the criteria contained in paragraph (a) of this 
section is deemed a qualifying event for purposes of sample analysis, 
reporting, and other purposes.
    (5) In the event samples are collected following an event determined 
by FRA not to be a qualifying event within the meaning of this 
paragraph, FRA directs its designated laboratory to destroy any sample 
material submitted and to refrain from disclosing to any

[[Page 147]]

person the results of any analysis conducted.

<R05>
Sec. 219.203  Responsibilities of railroads and employees.

    (a) Employees tested. (1)(i) Following each accident and incident 
described in Sec. 219.201, the railroad (or railroads) shall take all 
practicable steps to assure that all covered employees of the railroad 
directly involved in the accident or incident provide blood and urine 
samples for toxicological testing by FRA. Such employees shall cooperate 
in the provision of samples as described in this part and appendix C.
    (ii) If the conditions for mandatory toxicological testing exist, 
the railroad may also require employees to provide breath for testing in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in 49 CFR part 40 and this 
part, if such testing does not interfere with timely collection of 
required samples.
    (2) Such employees shall specifically include each and every 
operating employee assigned as a crew member of any train involved in 
the accident or incident. In any case where an operator, dispatcher, 
signal maintainer or other covered employee is directly and 
contemporaneously involved in the circumstances of the accident/
incident, those employees shall also be required to provide samples.
    (3) An employee shall be excluded from testing under the following 
circumstances: In any case of an accident/incident for which testing is 
mandated only under Sec. 219.201(a)(2) of this subpart (an ``impact 
accident''), Sec. 219.201(a)(3) (``fatal train incident''), or 
Sec. 219.201(a)(4) (a ``passenger train accident with injury'') if the 
railroad representative can immediately determine, on the basis of 
specific information, that the employee had no role in the cause(s) or 
severity of the accident/incident. The railroad representative shall 
consider any such information immediately available at the time the 
qualifying event determination is made under Sec. 219.201 of this 
subpart.
    (4) The following provisions govern accidents/incidents involving 
non-covered employees:
    (i) Surviving non-covered employees are not subject to testing under 
this subpart.
    (ii) Testing of the remains of non-covered employees who are fatally 
injured in train accidents and incidents is required.
    (b) Timely sample collection. (1) The railroad shall make every 
reasonable effort to assure that samples are provided as soon as 
possible after the accident or incident.
    (2) This paragraph shall not be construed to inhibit the employees 
required to be tested from performing, in the immediate aftermath of the 
accident or incident, any duties that may be necessary for the 
preservation of life or property. However, where practical, the railroad 
shall utilize other employees to perform such duties.
    (3) In the case of a passenger train which is in proper condition to 
continue to the next station or its destination after an accident or 
incident, the railroad shall consider the safety and convenience of 
passengers in determining whether the crew is immediately available for 
testing. A relief crew shall be called to relieve the train crew as soon 
as possible.
    (4) Covered employees who may be subject to testing under this 
subpart shall be retained in duty status for the period necessary to 
make the determinations required by Sec. 219.201 and this section and 
(as appropriate) to complete the sample collection procedure. An 
employee may not be recalled for testing under this subpart if that 
employee has been released from duty under the normal procedures of the 
railroad, except that an employee shall be immediately recalled for 
testing if--
    (i) The employee could not be retained in duty status because the 
employee went off duty under normal carrier procedures prior to being 
contacted by a railroad supervisor and instructed to remain on duty 
pending completion of the required determinations (e.g., in the case of 
a dispatcher or signal maintainer remote from the scene of an accident 
who was unaware of the occurrence at the time the employee went off 
duty);
    (ii) The railroad's preliminary investigation (contemporaneous with 
the determination required by Sec. 219.201 of this

[[Page 148]]

subpart) indicates a clear probability that the employee played a major 
role in the cause or severity of the accident/incident; and
    (iii) The accident/incident actually occurred during the employee's 
duty tour.

An employee who has been transported to receive medical care is not 
released from duty for purposes of this section. Nothing in this section 
prohibits the subsequent testing of an employee who has failed to remain 
available for testing as required (i.e., who is absent without leave); 
but subsequent testing does not excuse such refusal by the employee 
timely to provide the required specimens.
    (c) Place of sample collection. (1) Employees shall be transported 
to an independent medical facility where the samples shall be obtained. 
The railroad shall pre-designate for such testing one or more such 
facilities in reasonable proximity to any location where the railroad 
conducts operations. Designation shall be made on the basis of the 
willingness of the facility to conduct sample collection and the ability 
of the facility to complete sample collection promptly, professionally, 
and in accordance with pertinent requirements of this part. In all cases 
blood shall be drawn only by a qualified medical professional or by a 
qualified technician subject to the supervision of a qualified medical 
professional
    (2) In the case of an injured employee, the railroad shall request 
the treating medical facility to obtain the samples.
    (d) Obtaining cooperation of facility. (1) In seeking the 
cooperation of a medical facility in obtaining a sample under this 
subpart, the railroad shall, as necessary, make specific reference to 
the requirements of this subpart.
    (2) If an injured employee is unconscious or otherwise unable to 
evidence consent to the procedure and the treating medical facility 
declines to obtain blood samples after having been acquainted with the 
requirements of this subpart, the railroad shall immediately notify FRA 
by toll free telephone (800-424-0201), stating the employee's name, the 
medical facility, its location, the name of the appropriate decisional 
authority at the medical facility, and the telephone number at which 
that person can be reached. FRA will then take appropriate measures to 
assist in obtaining the required sample.
    (e) Discretion of physician. Nothing in this subpart shall be 
construed to limit the discretion of a physician to determine whether 
drawing a blood sample is consistent with the health of an injured 
employee or an employee afflicted by any other condition that may 
preclude drawing the specified quantity of blood.

FR 7460, Feb. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 219.205  Sample collection and handling.

    (a) General. Urine and blood samples shall be obtained, marked, 
preserved, handled, and made available to FRA consistent with the 
requirements of this subpart, and the technical specifications set forth 
in appendix C to this part.
    (b) Information requirements. In order to process samples, analyze 
the significance of laboratory findings, and notify the railroads and 
employees of test results, it is necessary to obtain basic information 
concerning the accident/incident and any treatment administered after 
the accident/incident. Accordingly, the railroad representative shall 
complete the information required by FRA Form 6180.73 (revised) for 
shipping with the samples. Each employee subject to testing shall 
cooperate in completion of the required information on FRA Form 6180.74 
(revised) for inclusion in the shipping kit and processing of the 
samples. The railroad representative shall request an appropriate 
representative of the medical facility to complete the remaining portion 
of the information on each Form 6180.74 (revised). One Form 6180.73 
(revised) shall be forwarded in the shipping kit with each group of 
samples. One Form 6180.74 (revised) shall be forwarded in the shipping 
kit for each employee who provides samples.
    (c) Shipping kit. (1) FRA and the laboratory designated in appendix 
B to this part make available for purchase a limited number of standard 
shipping kits for the purpose of routine handling of toxicological 
samples under this

[[Page 149]]

subpart. Whenever possible, samples shall be placed in the shipping kit 
prepared for shipment according to the instructions provided in the kit 
and appendix C. Specifications for kits are contained in the Field 
Manual.
    (2) Kits may be ordered directly from the laboratory designated in 
appendix B to this part.
    (3) FRA maintains a limited number of kits at its field offices. A 
Class III railroad may utilize kits in FRA possession, rather than 
maintaining such kits on its property.
    (d) Shipment. Samples shall be shipped as soon as possible by pre-
paid air express or air freight (or other means adequate to ensure 
delivery within twenty-four (24) hours from time of shipment) to the 
laboratory designated in appendix B to this part. Where express courier 
pickup is available, the railroad shall request the medical facility to 
transfer the sealed toxicology kit directly to the express courier for 
transportation. If courier pickup is not available at the medical 
facility where the samples are collected or for any other reason prompt 
transfer by the medical facility cannot be assured, the railroad shall 
promptly transport the sealed shipping kit holding the samples to the 
most expeditious point of shipment via air express, air freight or 
equivalent means. The railroad shall maintain and document secure chain 
of custody of the kit from release by the medical facility to delivery 
for transportation, as described in appendix C.

<R05>
Sec. 219.207  Fatality.

    (a) In the case of an employee fatality in an accident or incident 
described in Sec. 219.201, body fluid and/or tissue samples shall be 
obtained from the remains of the employee for toxicological testing. To 
ensure that samples are timely collected, the railroad shall immediately 
notify the appropriate local authority (such as a coroner or medical 
examiner) of the fatality and the requirements of this subpart, making 
available the shipping kit and requesting the local authority to assist 
in obtaining the necessary body fluid or tissue samples. The railroad 
shall also seek the assistance of the custodian of the remains, if a 
person other than the local authority.
    (b) If the local authority or custodian of the remains declines to 
cooperate in obtaining the necessary samples, the railroad shall 
immediately notify FRA by toll free telephone (800-424-0201) providing 
the following information:
    (1) Date and location of the accident or incident;
    (2) Railroad;
    (3) Name of the deceased;
    (4) Name and telephone number of custodian of the remains; and
    (5) Name and telephone number of local authority contacted.
    (c) A coroner, medical examiner, pathologist, Aviation Medical 
Examiner, or other qualified professional is authorized to remove the 
required body fluid and/or tissue samples from the remains on request of 
the railroad or FRA pursuant to this part; and, in so acting, such 
person is the delegate of the Administrator under section 208 of the 
Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 437) (but not the agent 
of the Secretary for purposes of the Federal Tort Claims Act). Such 
qualified professional may rely upon the representations of the railroad 
or FRA representative with respect to the occurrence of the event 
requiring that toxicological tests be conducted and the coverage of the 
deceased employee under these rules.
    (d) Appendix C to this part specifies body fluid and/or tissue 
samples required for toxicological analysis in the case of a fatality.


<R05>
Sec. 219.209  Reports of tests and refusals.

    (a)(1) A railroad that has experienced one or more events for which 
samples were obtained shall provide prompt telephonic notification 
summarizing such events. Notification shall be provided

[[Page 150]]

to the Office of Safety, FRA, at (202) 366-0501; an answering machine 
will record any notification calls made to this number outside of the 
Federal work week (8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST or EDT).
    (2) Each telephonic report shall contain:
    (i) Name of railroad;
    (ii) Name, title and telephone number of person making the report;
    (iii) Time, date and location of the accident/incident;
    (iv) Brief summary of the circumstances of the accident/incident, 
including basis for testing; and
    (v) Number, names and occupations of employees tested.
    (b) If the railroad is unable, as a result of non-cooperation of an 
employee or for any other reason, to obtain a sample and cause it to be 
provided to FRA as required by this subpart, the railroad shall make a 
concise narrative report of the reason for such failure and, if 
appropriate, any action taken in response to the cause of such failure. 
This report shall be appended to the report of the accident/incident 
required to be submitted under part 225 of this subchapter.
    (c) If a test required by this section is not administered within 
four hours following the accident or incident, the railroad shall 
prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the test was 
not promptly administered. Records shall be submitted to the Federal 
Railroad Administration upon request of the Associate Administrator for 
Safety.

[54 FR 53259, Dec. 27, 1989, as amended at 59 FR 7461, Feb. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 219.211  Analysis and follow-up.

    (a) The laboratory designated in appendix B to this part undertakes 
prompt analysis of samples provided under this subpart, consistent with 
the need to develop all relevant information and produce a complete 
report. Samples are analyzed for alcohol and controlled substances 
specified by FRA under protocols specified by FRA, summarized in 
appendix C, which have been submitted to the Department of Health and 
Human Services for acceptance. Samples may be analyzed for other 
impairing substances specified by FRA as necessary to the particular 
accident investigation.
    (b) Results of post-accident toxicological testing under this 
subpart are reported to the railroad's Medical Review Officer and the 
employee. The MRO and the railroad shall treat the test results and any 
information concerning medical use or administration of drugs provided 
under this subpart in the same confidential manner as if subject to 
subpart H of this part, except where publicly disclosed by FRA or the 
National Transportation Safety Board.
    (c) With respect to a surviving employee, a test reported as 
positive for alcohol or a controlled substance by the designated 
laboratory shall be reviewed by the railroad's Medical Review Officer 
with respect to any claim of use or administration of medications 
(consistent with Sec. 219.103 of this part) that could account for the 
laboratory findings. The Medical Review Officer shall promptly report 
the results of each review to the Associate Administrator for Safety, 
FRA, Washington, DC 20590. Such report shall be in writing and shall 
reference the employing railroad, accident/incident date, and location; 
and the envelope shall be marked ``ADMINISTRATIVELY CONFIDENTIAL: 
ATTENTION ALCOHOL/DRUG PROGRAM MANAGER.'' The report shall state whether 
the MRO reported the test result to the employing railroad as positive 
or negative and the basis of any determination that analytes detected by 
the laboratory derived from authorized use (including a statement of the 
compound prescribed, dosage/frequency, and any restrictions imposed by 
the authorized medical practitioner). Unless specifically requested by 
FRA in writing, the Medical Review Officer shall not disclose to FRA the 
underlying physical condition for which any medication was authorized or 
administered. The Federal Railroad Administration shall not be bound by 
the railroad Medical Review Officer's determination, but that 
determination will be considered by FRA in relation to the accident/
incident investigation and with respect to any enforcement action under 
consideration.

[[Page 151]]

    (d) To the extent permitted by law, FRA treats test results 
indicating medical use of controlled substances consistent with 
Sec. 219.103 (and other information concerning medically authorized drug 
use or administration provided incident to such testing) as 
administratively confidential and withholds public disclosure, except 
where it is necessary to consider this information in an accident 
investigation in relation to determination of probable cause. (However, 
as further provided in this section, FRA may provide results of testing 
under this subpart and supporting documentation to the National 
Transportation Safety Board.)
    (e) An employee may respond in writing to the results of the test 
prior to the preparation of any final investigation report concerning 
the accident or incident. An employee wishing to respond shall do so by 
letter addressed to the Alcohol/Drug Program Manager, Office of Safety, 
FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 within 45 days of 
receipt of the test results. Any such submission shall refer to the 
accident date, railroad and location, shall state the position occupied 
by the employee on the date of the accident/incident, and shall identify 
any information contained therein that the employee requests be withheld 
from public disclosure on grounds of personal privacy (but the decision 
whether to honor such request shall be made by the FRA on the basis of 
controlling law).
    (f)(1) The toxicology report may contain a statement of 
pharmacological significance to assist FRA and other parties in 
understanding the data reported. No such statement may be construed as a 
finding of probable cause in the accident or incident.
    (2) The toxicology report is a part of the report of the accident/
incident and therefore subject to the limitation of section 4 of the 
Accident Reports Act (45 U.S.C. 41) (prohibiting use of the report for 
any purpose in any action for damages).
    (g)(1) It is in the public interest to ensure that any railroad 
disciplinary actions that may result from accidents and incidents for 
which testing is required under this subpart are disposed of on the 
basis of the most complete and reliable information available so that 
responsive action will be appropriate. Therefore, during the interval 
between an accident or incident and the date that the railroad receives 
notification of the results of the toxicological analysis, any provision 
of collective bargaining agreements establishing maximum periods for 
charging employees with rule violations, or for holding an 
investigation, shall not be deemed to run as to any offense involving 
the accident or incident (i.e., such periods shall be tolled).
    (2) This provision shall not be construed to excuse the railroad 
from any obligation to timely charge an employee (or provide other 
actual notice) where the railroad obtains sufficient information 
relating to alcohol or drug use, impairment or possession or other rule 
violations prior to the receipt to toxicological analysis.
    (3) This provision does not authorize holding any employee out of 
service pending receipt of toxicological analysis; nor does it restrict 
a railroad from taking such action in an appropriate case.
    (h) Except as provided in Sec. 219.201 (with respect to non-
qualifying events), each sample (including each split sample) provided 
under this subpart is retained for not less than three months following 
the date of the accident or incident (two years from the date of the 
accident or incident in the case of a sample testing positive for 
alcohol or a controlled substance). Post-mortem specimens may be made 
available to the National Transportation Safety Board (on request).
    (i) An employee (donor) may, within 60 days of the date of the 
toxicology report, request that the employee's blood and/or urine sample 
be retested by the designated laboratory or by another laboratory 
certified by the Department of Health and Human Services under that 
Department's Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs that 
has available an appropriate, validated assay for the fluid and compound 
declared positive. Since some analytes may deteriorate during storage, 
detected levels of the compound shall, as technically appropriate, be 
reported and considered corroborative of the original test result. Any 
request for a

[[Page 152]]

retest shall be in writing, specify the railroad, accident date and 
location, be signed by the employee/donor, be addressed to the Associate 
Administrator for Safety, FRA, Washington, DC 20590, and be designated 
``ADMINISTRATIVELY CONFIDENTIAL: ATTENTION ALCOHOL/DRUG PROGRAM 
MANAGER.'' The expense of any employee-requested retest at a laboratory 
other than the laboratory designated under this subpart shall be borne 
by the employee.

Sec. 219.213  Unlawful refusals; consequences.

    (a) Disqualification. An employee who refuses to cooperate in 
providing breath, blood or urine samples following an accident or 
incident specified in this subpart shall be withdrawn from covered 
service and shall be deemed disqualified for covered service for a 
period of nine (9) months in accordance with the conditions specified in 
Sec. 219.107.
    (b) Procedures. Prior to or upon withdrawing the employee from 
covered service under this section, the railroad shall provide notice of 
the reason for this action and an opportunity for hearing before a 
presiding officer other than the charging official. The employee shall 
be entitled to the procedural protection set out in Sec. 219.104(d).
    (c) Subject of hearing. The hearing required by this section shall 
determine whether the employee refused to submit to testing, having been 
requested to submit, under authority of this subpart, by a 
representative of the railroad. In determining whether a 
disqualification is required, the hearing official shall, as 
appropriate, also consider the following:
    (1) Whether the railroad made a good faith determination, based on 
reasonable inquiry, that the accident or incident was within the 
mandatory testing requirements of this subpart; and
    (2) In a case where a blood test was refused on the ground it would 
be inconsistent with the employee's health, whether such refusal was 
made in good faith and based on medical advice.

                      Subpart D--Testing for Cause


<R05>
Sec. 219.300  Mandatory reasonable suspicion testing.

    (a) Requirements. (1) Beginning on January 1, 1995, a railroad shall 
require a covered employee to submit to an alcohol test when the 
railroad has reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has 
violated any prohibition of subpart B of this part concerning use of 
alcohol. The railroad's determination that reasonable suspicion exists 
to require the covered employee to undergo an alcohol test must be based 
on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the 
appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the employee.
    (2) A railroad shall require a covered employee to submit to a urine 
drug test when the railroad has reasonable suspicion to believe that the 
employee has violated the prohibitions of subpart B of this part 
concerning use of controlled substances. The railroad's determination 
that reasonable suspicion exists to require the covered employee to 
undergo a drug test must be based on specific, contemporaneous, 
articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or 
body odors of the employee. Such observations may include indications of 
the chronic and withdrawal effects of drugs.
    (b)(1) With respect to an alcohol test, the required observations 
shall be made by a supervisor trained in accordance with Sec. 219.11(g). 
The supervisor who makes the determination that reasonable suspicion 
exists may not conduct testing on that employee.
    (2) With respect to a urine drug test, the required observations 
shall be made by two supervisors, at least one of whom is trained in 
accordance with Sec. 219.11(g).
    (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the 
conduct of breath alcohol testing or urine drug testing when the 
employee is apparently in need of immediate medical attention.
    (d)(1) If a test required by this section is not administered within 
two hours following the determination under this section, the railroad 
shall prepare and maintain on file a record

[[Page 153]]

stating the reasons the test was not properly administered. If a test 
required by this section is not administered within eight hours of the 
determination under this section, the railroad shall cease attempts to 
administer an alcohol test and shall state in the record the reasons for 
not administering the test. Records shall be submitted to FRA upon 
request of the Administrator.
    (2) For the years stated in this paragraph, employers who submit MIS 
reports shall submit to the FRA each record of a test required by this 
section that is not completed within 8 hours. The employer's records of 
tests that are not completed within 8 hours shall be submitted to the 
FRA by March 15, 1996; March 15, 1997; and March 15, 1998; for calendar 
years 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively. Employers shall append these 
records to their MIS submissions. Each record shall include the 
following information:
    (i) Triggering event (including date, time, and location);
    (ii) Employee category (do not include employee name or other 
identifying information);
    (iii) Reason(s) test could not be completed within 8 hours; and
    (iv) If blood alcohol testing could have been completed within eight 
hours, the name, address, and telephone number of the testing site where 
blood testing could have occurred.

Sec. 219.301  Testing for reasonable cause.

    (a) Authorization. A railroad may, under the conditions specified in 
this subpart, require any covered employee, as a condition of employment 
in covered service, to cooperate in breath or urine testing, or both, to 
determine compliance with Secs. 219.101 and 219.102 of this part or a 
railroad rule implementing the requirements of Secs. 219.101 and 
219.102. This authority is limited to testing after observations or 
events that occur during duty hours (including any period of overtime or 
emergency service). The provisions of this subpart apply only when, and 
to the extent that, the test in question is conducted in reliance upon 
the authority conferred by this section. Section 219.23 prescribes the 
notice to an employee that is required when an employee is required to 
provide a breath or body fluid sample under this part. A railroad may 
not require an employee to be tested under the authority of this subpart 
unless reasonable cause, as defined in this section, exists with respect 
to that employee.
    (b) For cause breath testing. In addition to reasonable suspicion as 
described in Sec. 219.300, the following circumstances constitute cause 
for the administration of breath alcohol tests under this section:
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) Accident/incident. The employee has been involved in an accident 
or incident reportable under part 225 of this title, and a supervisory 
employee of the railroad has a reasonable belief, based on specific, 
articulable facts, that the employee's acts or omissions contributed to 
the occurrence or severity of the accident or incident; or
    (3) Rule violation. The employee has been directly involved in one 
of the following operating rule violations or errors:
    (i) Noncompliance with a train order, track warrant, timetable, 
signal indication, special instruction or other direction with respect 
to movement of a train that involves--
    (A) Occupancy of a block or other segment of track to which entry 
was not authorized;
    (B) Failure to clear a track to permit opposing or following 
movement to pass;
    (C) Moving across a railroad crossing at grade without 
authorization; or
    (D) Passing an absolute restrictive signal or passing a restrictive 
signal without stopping (if required);
    (ii) Failure to protect a train as required by a rule consistent 
with Sec. 218.37 of this title (including failure to protect a train 
that is fouling an adjacent track, where required by the railroad's 
rules);
    (iii) Operation of a train at a speed that exceeds the maximum 
authorized speed by at least ten (10) miles per hour or by fifty percent 
(50%) of such maximum authorized speed, whichever is less;
    (iv) Alignment of a switch in violation of a railroad rule, failure 
to align

[[Page 154]]

a switch as required for movement, operation of a switch under a train, 
or unauthorized running through a switch;
    (v) Failure to apply or stop short of derail as required;
    (vi) Failure to secure a hand brake or failure to secure sufficient 
hand brakes, as required;
    (vii) Entering a crossover before both switches are lined for 
movement; or
    (viii) In the case of a person performing a dispatching function or 
block operator function, issuance of a train order or establishment of a 
route that fails to provide proper protection for a train.
    (c) For cause urine testing. In addition to reasonable suspicion as 
described in Sec. 219.300, each of the conditions set forth in 
paragraphs (b)(2) (``accident/incident'') and (b)(3) (``rule 
violation'') of this section as constituting cause for breath alcohol 
testing also constitutes cause with respect to urine drug testing.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Limitation for subpart C events. The compulsory urine testing 
authority conferred by this section does not apply with respect to any 
event subject to post-accident toxicological testing as required by 
Sec. 219.201 of this part. However, use of compulsory breath test 
authority is authorized in any case where breath test results can be 
obtained in a timely manner at the scene of the accident and conduct of 
such tests does not materially impede the collection of samples under 
subpart C.

[54 FR 53259, Dec. 27, 1989; 55 FR 22793, June 4, 1990, as amended at 59 
FR 7461, Feb. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 219.302  Prompt sample collection; time limitation.

    (a) Testing under this subpart may only be conducted promptly 
following the observations or events upon which the testing decision is 
based, consistent with the need to protect life and property.
    (b) No employee shall be required to participate in breath alcohol 
or urine drug testing under this section after the expiration of an 
eight hour period from--
    (1) The time of the observations or other events described in this 
section; or
    (2) In the case of an accident/incident, the time a responsible 
railroad supervisor receives notice of the event providing reasonable 
cause for conduct of the test.
    (c) An employee may not be tested under this subpart if that 
employee has been released from duty under the normal procedures of the 
railroad. An employee who has been transported to receive medical care 
is not released from duty for purposes of this section. Nothing in this 
section prohibits the subsequent testing of an employee who has failed 
to remain available for testing as required (i.e., who is absent without 
leave).
    (d) As used in this subpart a ``responsible railroad supervisor'' 
means any responsible line supervisor (e.g., a trainmaster or road 
foreman of engines) or superior official in authority over the employee 
to be tested.
    (e) In the case of a urine drug test, the eight-hour requirement is 
satisfied if the employee has been delivered to the collection site 
(where the collector is present) and the request has been made to 
commence collection of the urine specimens within that period.
    (f) [Reserved]
    (g) Section 219.23 prescribes the notice to an employee that is 
required to provide breath or a body fluid sample under this part.

Sec. 219.303  Alcohol test procedures and safeguards.

    (a)(1) Each Class I railroad (including the National Railroad 
Passenger Corporation) and each railroad providing commuter passenger 
service shall implement mandatory reasonable suspicion testing according 
to the procedures listed in paragraph (b) of this section beginning on 
January 1, 1995.
    (2) Each Class II railroad shall implement mandatory reasonable 
suspicion testing according to the procedures listed in paragraph (b) of 
this section beginning on July 1, 1995. Prior to that date, a Class II 
railroad may use the procedures described in paragraphs (c) through (e) 
of this section.

[[Page 155]]

    (3) Each Class III railroad (including a switching and terminal or 
other railroad not otherwise classified) shall implement mandatory 
reasonable suspicion testing according to the procedures listed in 
paragraph (b) of this section beginning on January 1, 1996. Prior to 
that date, a Class III railroad may use the procedures described in 
paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.
    (4) In the case of a railroad commencing operations after January 1, 
1996, the railroad shall implement mandatory reasonable suspicion 
testing not later than the expiration of 60 days from approval by the 
Administrator of the railroad's random testing programs.
    (b) As provided for in subparagraph (a)(1) of this section, the 
conduct of alcohol testing under this subpart is governed by subpart H 
of this part and part 40 of subtitle A of this title.
    (c) As provided for in subparagraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this 
section, and except as provided in paragraph (f), the following 
conditions apply to breath testing authorized by this subpart.
    (1) Testing devices shall be selected from among those listed on the 
Conforming Products List of Evidential Breath Measurement Devices 
amended and published in the Federal Register from time to time by the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of 
Transportation.
    (2) Each device shall be properly maintained and shall be calibrated 
or verified as to correct calibration by use of a breath alcohol 
simulator (calibrating unit) listed on the NHTSA Conforming Products 
List of Calibrating Units for Breath Alcohol Testers (as amended and 
published) with sufficient frequency to ensure the accuracy of the 
device (within plus or minus .01 percent), but not less frequently than 
provided in the manufacturer's instructions.
    (3) Tests shall be conducted by a trained and qualified operator. 
The operator shall have received training on the operational principles 
of the particular instrument employed and practical experience in the 
operation of the device and use of the breath alcohol calibrating unit. 
A copy of the training program shall be filed with FRA in conjunction 
with the filing required by Sec. 217.11 of this title.
    (4) Tests shall be conducted in accordance with procedures specified 
by the manufacturer of the testing device, consistent with sound 
technical judgment, and shall include appropriate restrictions on 
ambient air temperature.
    (5) If an initial test is positive, the employee shall be tested 
again after the expiration of a period of not less than 15 minutes, in 
order to confirm that the test has properly measured the alcohol content 
of deep lung air.
    (d) Because of the inherent limitations of the instrumentation, any 
indicated breath test result of less than .02 percent shall be deemed a 
negative test.
    (e)(1) In any case where a breath test is intended for use in the 
railroad disciplinary process and the result is positive, the employee 
shall be given the prompt opportunity to provide a blood sample at an 
independent medical facility for analysis by a competent independent 
laboratory. The railroad shall provide the required transportation to 
facilitate the blood test.
    (2) A blood test under this section shall conform to the following 
standards:
    (i) The specimen shall be collected in a medically acceptable manner 
by a qualified medical professional or technician using a non-ethanol 
swab and shall be deposited into a single-use sterile vacuum tube 
containing at least one percent sodium fluoride (and an anticoagulant).
    (ii) While the specimen remains in full view of the employee, the 
specimen shall be clearly labeled with the employee's name and/or a 
unique identifying number and shall be sealed with a tamperproof seal.
    (iii) The sample shall be handled in accordance with chain of 
custody procedures from the point of collection through analysis and 
secure storage at the laboratory.
    (iv) The sample shall be screened for alcohol only by a method 
reliable at a detection limit of not higher than .02 percent. Any 
presumptive positive shall be confirmed by gas chromatography with a 
suitable internal

[[Page 156]]

standard. The screening run shall include at least 10% quality control 
samples. The confirmation run shall include ethanol standards (including 
an ethanol standard certified against or traceable to a primary 
standard), at least one blank specimen, other appropriate volatiles 
(e.g., isopropanol), and at least one control purchased commercially or 
provided through an external quality control program. Results declared 
positive on confirmation shall be consistent with pre-established 
criteria for retention time of internal and external standards. Blood 
alcohol concentration shall be reported only at values of .02 percent or 
greater within the linear portion of the standard curve. Unconfirmed 
presumptive positive results and values below .02 percent shall be 
reported as negative. Any quantitations to the third digit shall be 
rounded downward to two digits (i.e., .238% to .23%).
    (v) The remaining portion of any specimen testing positive shall be 
retained in secure frozen storage for at least one year, and the 
employee shall have the right to request a retest of the specimen at a 
competent independent laboratory within 60 days of the date of the 
laboratory report.
    (vi) Test results shall be reported to the Medical Review Officer 
who shall review and act upon the results in the same manner provided 
for drug urine testing in Subpart H of this part, except that fully 
quantitated results shall be made available to the employer 
representative.
    (3) If the blood test under this section is reported as negative, 
the breath test shall be deemed negative for all purposes.
    (f)(1) Under the circumstances set forth in Sec. 219.301, a railroad 
may require an employee to participate in a breath alcohol screening 
test solely for the purpose of determining whether the conduct of a test 
meeting the criteria of paragraph (a) is indicated. If the screening 
test is negative within the meaning of paragraph (b), the employee shall 
not be required to submit to further breath testing under this subpart. 
If the screening test is positive, no consequence shall attach except 
that the employee may be removed from covered service for the period 
necessary to conduct a breath test meeting the criteria of paragraph 
(a).
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, the 
conduct of a screening test under paragraph (d)(1) of this section does 
not excuse full compliance with paragraph (a) of this section with 
respect to any breath test procedure which is then undertaken. If a 
screening test is positive, the following procedures govern:
    (i) An initial breath test shall be conducted meeting the criteria 
of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (ii) If that test is positive, a second breath test shall be 
conducted meeting the criteria of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (iii) The second test meeting the criteria of section (a) of this 
section must be conducted at least 15 minutes after the positive 
screening test conducted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. 
However, since a waiting period of 15 minutes is sufficient to permit 
the dissipation of any alcohol in the mouth, the requirement of 
paragraph (a)(5) of this section that there be a period of at least 15 
minutes between the two tests meeting the criteria of paragraph (a) of 
this section does not apply.

<R04>
             Subpart E--Identification of Troubled Employees


<R05>
Sec. 219.401  Requirement for policies.

    (a) The purpose of this subpart is to prevent the use of alcohol and 
drugs in connection with covered service.
    (b) Each railroad shall adopt, publish and implement--
    (1) A policy designed to encourage and facilitate the identification 
of those covered employees who abuse alcohol or drugs as a part of a 
treatable condition and to ensure that such employees are provided the 
opportunity to obtain counseling or treatment before those problems 
manifest themselves in

[[Page 157]]

detected violations of this part (hereafter ``voluntary referral 
policy''); and
    (2) A policy designed to foster employee participation in preventing 
violations of this subpart and encourage co-worker participation in the 
direct enforcement of this part (hereafter ``co-worker report policy'').
    (c) A railroad may comply with this subpart by adopting, publishing 
and implementing policies meeting the specific requirements of 
Secs. 219.403 and 219.405 of this subpart or by complying with 
Sec. 219.407.
    (d) If a railroad complies with this part by adopting, publishing 
and implementing policies consistent with Secs. 219.403 and 219.405, the 
railroad shall make such policies, and publications announcing such 
policies, available for inspection and copying by FRA.
    (e) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to--
    (1) Require payment of compensation for any period an employee is 
out of service under a voluntary referral or co-worker report policy;
    (2) Require a railroad to adhere to a voluntary referral or co-
worker report policy in a case where the referral or report is made for 
the purpose, or with the effect, of anticipating the imminent and 
probable detection of a rule violation by a supervising employee; or
    (3) Limit the discretion of a railroad to dismiss or otherwise 
discipline an employee for specific rule violations or criminal 
offenses, except as specifically provided by this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 219.403  Voluntary referral policy.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes minimum standards for voluntary 
referral policies. Nothing in this section restricts a railroad from 
adopting, publishing and implementing a voluntary referral policy that 
affords more favorable conditions to employees troubled by alcohol or 
drug abuse problems, consistent with the railroad's responsibility to 
prevent violations of Sec. 219.101 and Sec. 219.102.
    (b) Required provisions. A voluntary referral policy shall include 
the following provisions:
    (1) A covered employee who is affected by an alcohol or drug use 
problem may maintain an employment relationship with the railroad if, 
before the employee is charged with conduct deemed by the railroad 
sufficient to warrant dismissal, the employee seeks assistance through 
the railroad for the employee's alcohol or drug use problem or is 
referred for such assistance by another employee or by a representative 
of the employee's collective bargaining unit. The railroad shall specify 
whether, and under what circumstances, its policy provides for the 
acceptance of referrals from other sources, including (at the option of 
the railroad) supervisory employees.
    (2) Except as may be provided under paragraph (c) of this part, the 
railroad treats the referral and subsequent handling, including 
counseling and treatment, as confidential.
    (3) The railroad will, to the extent necessary for treatment and 
rehabilitation, grant the employee a leave of absence from the railroad 
for the period necessary to complete primary treatment and establish 
control over the employee's alcohol or drug problem. The policy must 
allow a leave of absence of not less than 45 days, if necessary for the 
purpose of meeting initial treatment needs.
    (4) Except as may be provided under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, the employee will be returned to service on the recommendation 
of the substance abuse professional. Approval to return to service may 
not be unreasonably withheld.
    (c) Optional provisions. A voluntary referral policy may include any 
of the following provisions, at the option of the railroad:
    (1) The policy may provide that the rule of confidentiality is 
waived if--
    (i) The employee at any time refuses to cooperate in a recommended 
course of counseling or treatment and/or;
    (ii) The employee is later determined, after investigation, to have 
been involved in an alcohol or drug-related disciplinary offense growing 
out of subsequent conduct.
    (2) The policy may require successful completion of a return-to-
service medical examination as a further condition on reinstatement in 
covered service.
    (3) The policy may provide that it does not apply to an employee who 
has

[[Page 158]]

previously been assisted by the railroad under a policy or program 
substantially consistent with this section or who has previously elected 
to waive investigation under Sec. 219.405 of this section (co-worker 
report policy).
    (4) The policy may provide that, in order to invoke its benefits, 
the employee must report to the contact designated by the railroad 
either:
    (i) During non-duty hours (i.e., at a time when the employee is off 
duty) or
    (ii) While unimpaired and otherwise in compliance with the 
railroad's alcohol and drug rules consistent with this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 219.405  Co-worker report policy.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes minimum standards for co-worker 
report policies. Nothing in this section restricts a railroad from 
adopting, publishing and implementing a policy that affords more 
favorable conditions to employees troubled by alcohol or drug abuse 
problems, consistent with the railroad's responsibility to prevent 
violations of Secs. 219.101 and 219.102.
    (b) Employment relationship. A co-worker report policy shall provide 
that a covered employee may maintain an employment relationship with the 
railroad following an alleged first offense under these rules or the 
railroad's alcohol and drug rules, subject to the conditions and 
procedures contained in this section.
    (c) General conditions and procedures. (1) The alleged violation 
must come to the attention of the railroad as a result of a report by a 
co-worker that the employee was apparently unsafe to work with or was, 
or appeared to be, in violation of this part or the railroad's alcohol 
and drug rules.
    (2) If the railroad representative determines that the employee is 
in violation, the railroad may immediately remove the employee from 
service in accordance with its existing policies and procedures.
    (3) The employee must elect to waive investigation on the rule 
charge and must contact the substance abuse professional within a 
reasonable period specified by the policy.
    (4) The substance abuse professional must schedule necessary 
interviews with the employee and complete an evaluation within 10 
calendar days of the date on which the employee contacts the 
professional with a request for evaluation under the policy, unless it 
becomes necessary to refer the employee for further evaluation. In each 
case, all necessary evaluations must be completed within 20 days of the 
date on which the employee contacts the professional.
    (d) When treatment is required. If the substance abuse professional 
determines that the employee is affected by psychological or chemical 
dependence on alcohol or a drug or by another identifiable and treatable 
mental or physical disorder involving the abuse of alcohol or drugs as a 
primary manifestation, the following conditions and procedures shall 
apply:
    (1) The railroad must, to the extent necessary for treatment and 
rehabilitation, grant the employee a leave of absence from the railroad 
for the period necessary to complete primary treatment and establish 
control over the employee's alcohol or drug problem. The policy must 
allow a leave of absence of not less than 45 days, if necessary for the 
purpose of meeting initial treatment needs.
    (2) The employee must agree to undertake and successfully complete a 
course of treatment deemed acceptable by the substance abuse 
professional.
    (3) The railroad must promptly return the employee to service, on 
recommendation of the substance abuse professional, when the employee 
has established control over the substance abuse problem. Return to 
service may also be conditioned on successful completion of a return-to-
service medical examination. Approval to return to service may not be 
unreasonably withheld.
    (4) Following return to service, the employee, as a further 
condition on withholding of discipline, may, as necessary, be required 
to participate in a reasonable program of follow-up treatment for a 
period not to exceed 60 months from the date the employee was originally 
withdrawn from service.
    (e) When treatment is not required. If the substance abuse 
professional determines that the employee is not affected by an 
identifiable and treatable mental or physical disorder--

[[Page 159]]

    (1) The railroad shall return the employee to service within 5 days 
after completion of the evaluation.
    (2) During or following the out-of-service period, the railroad may 
require the employee to participate in a program of education and 
training concerning the effects of alcohol and drugs on occupational or 
transportation safety.
    (f) Follow-up tests. A railroad may conduct return-to-service and/or 
follow-up tests (as described in Sec. 219.104 of this part) of an 
employee who waives investigation and is determined to be ready to 
return to service under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 219.407  Alternate policies.

    (a) In lieu of a policy under Sec. 219.403 (voluntary referral) or 
Sec. 219.405 (co-worker report), or both, a railroad may adopt, publish 
and implement, with respect to a particular class or craft of covered 
employees, an alternate policy or policies having as their purpose the 
prevention of alcohol or drug use in railroad operations, if such policy 
or policies has the written concurrence of the recognized 
representatives of such employees.
    (b) The concurrence of recognized employee representatives in an 
alternate policy may be evidenced by a collective bargaining agreement 
or any other document describing the class or craft of employees to 
which the alternate policy applies. The agreement or other document must 
make express reference to this part and to the intention of the railroad 
and employee representatives that the alternate policy shall apply in 
lieu of the policy required by Sec. 219.403, Sec. 219.405, or both.
    (c) The railroad shall file the agreement or other document 
described in paragraph (b) with the Associate Administrator for Safety, 
FRA. If the alternate policy is amended or revoked, the railroad shall 
file a notice of such amendment or revocation at least 30 days prior to 
the effective date of such action.
    (d) This section does not excuse a railroad from adopting, 
publishing and implementing the policies required by Secs. 219.403 and 
219.405 with respect to any group of covered employees not within the 
coverage of an appropriate alternate policy.

                     Subpart F--Pre-employment Tests


<R05>
Sec. 219.501  Pre-employment tests.

    (a)(1) Each Class I railroad (including the National Railroad 
Passenger Corporation) and each railroad providing commuter passenger 
service shall implement pre-employment alcohol testing beginning on 
January 1, 1995.
    (2) Each Class II railroad shall implement pre-employment alcohol 
testing beginning on July 1, 1995.
    (3) Each Class III railroad (including a switching and terminal or 
other railroad not otherwise classified) shall implement pre-employment 
alcohol testing beginning on January 1, 1996.
    (4) In the case of a railroad commencing operations after January 1, 
1996, the railroad shall implement pre-employment alcohol testing not 
later than the expiration of 60 days from approval by the Administrator 
of the railroad's random testing programs.
    (b) Prior to the first time a covered employee performs covered 
service for a railroad, the employee shall undergo testing for alcohol 
and drugs. No railroad shall allow a covered employee to perform covered 
service, unless the employee has been administered an alcohol test with 
a result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than .04 and has 
been administered a test for drugs with a result that did not indicate 
the misuse of controlled substances. This requirement shall apply to 
final applicants for employment and to employees seeking to transfer for 
the first time from non-covered service to duties involving covered 
service. If the test result of a final applicant for pre-employment 
indicates an alcohol content of .02 or greater, the provisions of 
paragraph (b) of this section shall apply.
    (c) No final applicant for employment tested under the provisions of 
this part who is found to have an alcohol concentration of .02 or 
greater but less than .04 shall perform safety-sensitive functions for a 
railroad, nor shall a railroad permit the applicant to perform safety-
sensitive functions, until the applicant's alcohol concentration 
measures less than .02.

[[Page 160]]

    (d) Tests shall be accomplished through breath analysis and analysis 
of urine samples. The conduct of breath alcohol testing and urine drug 
testing under this subpart is governed by subpart H of this part and 
part 40 of subtitle A of this title.
    (e) As used in subpart H with respect to a test required under this 
subpart, the term covered employee includes an applicant for pre-
employment testing only. In the case of an applicant who declines to be 
tested and withdraws the application for employment, no record shall be 
maintained of the declination.
    (f) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, all 
provisions and requirements in this section pertaining to preemployment 
testing for alcohol are suspended as of May 10, 1995.

Sec. 219.503  Notification; records.

    The railroad shall provide for medical review of the urine drug test 
results as provided in subpart H of this part. The railroad shall notify 
the applicant of the results of the urine and breath tests in the same 
manner as provided for employees in subpart H. Records shall be 
maintained confidentially and shall be retained in the same manner as 
required under subpart J for employee test records, except that such 
records need not reflect the identity of an applicant whose application 
for employment in covered service was denied.

Sec. 219.505  Refusals.

    An applicant who has refused to submit to pre-employment testing 
under this section shall not be employed in covered service based upon 
the application and examination with respect to which such refusal was 
made. This section does not create any right on the part of the 
applicant to have a subsequent application considered; nor does it 
restrict the discretion of the railroad to entertain a subsequent 
application for employment from the same person.

           Subpart G--Random Alcohol and Drug Testing Programs


<R05>
Sec. 219.601  Railroad random drug testing programs.

    (a) Submission. Each railroad shall submit for FRA approval a random 
testing program meeting the requirements of this subpart. A Class I 
railroad (including the National Railroad Passenger Corporation) or a 
railroad providing commuter passenger service shall submit such a 
program not later than October 2, 1989. A Class II railroad shall submit 
such a program not later than April 2, 1990. A Class III railroad 
(including a switching and terminal or other railroad not otherwise 
classified) shall submit such a program not later than July 2, 1990. A 
railroad commencing operations after the pertinent date specified in 
this paragraph shall submit such a program not later than 30 days prior 
to such commencement. The program shall be submitted to the Associate 
Administrator for Safety, FRA, for review and approval by the 
Administrator. If, after approval, a railroad desires to amend the 
random testing program implemented under this subpart, the railroad 
shall file with FRA a notice of such amendment at least 30 days prior to 
the intended effective date of such action. A program responsive to the 
requirements of this section or any amendment to the program shall not 
be implemented prior to approval.
    (b) Form of programs. Random testing programs submitted by or on 
behalf of each railroad under this subpart shall meet the following 
criteria, and the railroad and its managers, supervisors, officials and 
other employees and agents shall conform to such criteria in 
implementing the program:
    (1) Selection of covered employees for testing shall be made by a 
method employing objective, neutral criteria which ensure that every 
covered employee has a substantially equal statistical chance of being 
selected within a specified time frame. The method may not permit 
subjective factors to play a role in selection, i.e., no employee may be 
selected as the result of the exercise

[[Page 161]]

of discretion by the railroad. The selection method shall be capable of 
verification with respect to the randomness of the selection process, 
and any records necessary to document random selection shall be retained 
for not less than 24 months from the date upon which the particular 
samples were collected.
    (2) The program shall select for testing a sufficient number of 
employees so that, during the first 12 months--
    (i) The random testing program is spread reasonably through the 12-
month period;
    (ii) The last test collection during the year is conducted at an 
annualized rate of 50 percent; and
    (iii) The total number of tests conducted during the 12 months is 
equal to at least 25 percent of the number of covered employees.

During the subsequent 12-month period, the program shall select for 
testing a sufficient number of employees so that the number of tests 
conducted will equal at least 50 percent of the number of covered 
employees. Annualized percentage rates shall be determined by reference 
to the total number of covered employees employed by the railroad at the 
beginning of the particular twelve-month period or by an alternate 
method specified in the plan approved by the Associate Administrator for 
Safety. If the railroad conducts random testing through a consortium, 
the annual rate may be calculated for each individual employer or for 
the total number of covered employees subject to random testing by the 
consortium.
    (3) Railroad random testing programs shall ensure to the maximum 
extent practicable that each employee shall perceive the possibility 
that a random test may be required on any day the employee reports for 
work.
    (4) Notice of an employee's selection shall not be provided until 
the duty tour in which testing is to be conducted, and then only so far 
in advance as is reasonably necessary to ensure the employee's presence 
at the time and place set for testing.
    (5) The program shall include testing procedures and safeguards, and 
procedures for action based on positive test results, consistent with 
this part.
    (6) An employee shall be subject to testing only while on duty. Only 
employees who perform covered service for the railroad shall be subject 
to testing under this part. In the case of employees who during some 
duty tours perform covered service and during others do not, the 
railroad program shall specify the extent to which, and the 
circumstances under which they shall be subject to testing. To the 
extent practical within the limitations of this part and in the context 
of the railroad's operations, the railroad program shall provide that 
employees shall be subject to the possibility of random testing on any 
day they actually perform covered service.
    (7) Each time an employee is notified for random drug testing the 
employee will be informed that selection was made on a random basis.
    (c) Approval. The Associate Administrator for Safety will notify the 
railroad in writing whether the program is approved as consistent with 
the criteria set forth in this part. If the Associate Administrator for 
Safety determines that the program does not conform to those criteria, 
the Associate Administrator for Safety will inform the railroad of any 
matters preventing approval of the program, with specific explanation as 
to necessary revisions. The railroad shall resubmit its program with the 
required revisions within 30 days of such notice. Failure to resubmit 
the program with the necessary revisions will be considered a failure to 
implement a program under this subpart.
    (d) Implementation. (1) No later than 45 days prior to commencement 
of random testing, the railroad shall publish to each of its covered 
employees, individually, a written notice that they will be subject to 
random drug testing under this part. Such notice shall state the date 
for commencement of the program, shall state that the selection of 
employees for testing will be on a strictly random basis, shall describe 
the consequences of a determination that the employee has violated 
Sec. 219.102 or any applicable railroad rule, and shall inform the 
employee of the employee's rights under subpart E of this part. A copy 
of the notice shall be provided to each new covered employee on

[[Page 162]]

or before the employee's initial date of service. Since knowledge of 
Federal law is presumed, nothing in this paragraph creates a defense to 
a violation of Sec. 219.102 of this part.
    (2) Each Class I railroad (including the National Railroad Passenger 
Corporation) and each railroad providing commuter passenger service 
shall implement its approved random testing program not later than 
January 16, 1990. Each Class II railroad shall implement its approved 
random testing program not later than July 2, 1990. Each Class III 
railroad (including a switching and terminal or other railroad not 
otherwise classified) shall implement its approved random testing 
program not later than November 1, 1990. In the case of a railroad 
commencing operations after the pertinent date set forth in paragraph 
(a) of this section for filing of a program, the railroad shall 
implement its approved random testing program not later than the 
expiration of 60 days from approval by the Administrator or by the 
pertinent date set forth in this paragraph, whichever is later.

<R05>
Sec. 219.602  Administrator's determination of random drug testing rate.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this 
section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing 
shall be 50 percent of covered employees.
    (b) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum 
annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the reported 
positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this 
determination is drawn from the drug MIS reports required by this part. 
In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator considers 
the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional 
information or reports from railroads, and may make appropriate 
modifications in calculating the industry positive rate. Each year, the 
Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the minimum annual 
percentage rate for random drug testing of covered employees. The new 
minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing will be 
applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following 
publication.
    (c) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing 
is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of 
all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data 
received under the reporting requirements of Sec. 219.803 for two 
consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is 
less than 1.0 percent.
    (d) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing 
is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of 
Sec. 219.803 for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive 
rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will 
increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 
50 percent of all covered employees.
    (e) Selection of covered employees for testing shall be made by a 
method employing objective, neutral criteria which ensures that every 
covered employee has a substantially equal statistical chance of being 
selected within a specified time frame. The method may not permit 
subjective factors to play a role in selection, i.e., no employee may be 
selected as a result of the exercise of discretion by the railroad. The 
selection method shall be capable of verification with respect to the 
randomness of the selection process.
    (f) The railroad shall randomly select a sufficient number of 
covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an 
annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random 
drug testing determined by the Administrator. If the railroad conducts 
random drug testing through a consortium, the number of employees to be 
tested may be calculated for each individual railroad or may be based on 
the total number of covered employees covered by the consortium who are 
subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage 
rate under this part or any DOT drug testing rule.
    (g) Each railroad shall ensure that random drug tests conducted 
under this part are unannounced and that the dates for administering 
random tests

[[Page 163]]

are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
    (h) If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing 
under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same 
railroad, the employee shall be subject to random drug testing at the 
percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency 
regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function.
    (i) If a railroad is required to conduct random drug testing under 
the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the railroad may--
    (1) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool 
containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same 
required rate; or
    (2) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest 
percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to 
which the railroad is subject.

Sec. 219.603  Participation in drug testing.

    Participation. A railroad shall, under the conditions specified in 
this subpart and subpart H, require a covered employee selected through 
the random testing program to cooperate in urine testing to determine 
compliance with Sec. 210.102, and the employee shall provide the 
required sample and complete the required paperwork and certifications. 
Compliance by the employee shall be excused only in the case of a 
documented medical or family emergency.

Sec. 219.605  Positive drug test results; procedures.

    (a) Medical review. The result of a test required under this subpart 
shall be deemed positive only after it has been properly confirmed as 
required in subpart H of this part and reviewed by a Medical Review 
Officer (MRO) as provided in subpart H to determine if it is evidence of 
prohibited drug use under Sec. 219.102.
    (b) Procedures for administrative handling by the railroad in the 
event a sample provided under this subpart is reported as positive by 
the MRO are set forth in Sec. 219.104 of this part. The responsive 
action required in Sec. 219.104 is not stayed pending the result of a 
retest or split sample test.

Sec. 219.607  Railroad random alcohol testing programs.

    (a) Each railroad shall submit for FRA approval a random alcohol 
testing program meeting the requirements of this subpart. A Class I 
railroad (including the National Railroad Passenger Corporation) or a 
railroad providing commuter passenger service shall submit such a 
program not later than August 15, 1994. A Class II railroad shall submit 
such a program not later than February 15, 1995. A Class III railroad 
(including a switching and terminal or other railroad not otherwise 
classified) shall submit such a program not later than August 15, 1995. 
A railroad commencing operations after the pertinent date specified in 
this paragraph shall submit a random alcohol testing program not later 
than 30 days prior to such commencement. The program shall be submitted 
to the Associate Administrator for Safety, FRA, for review and approval. 
If, after approval, a railroad desires to amend the random alcohol 
testing program implemented under this subpart, the railroad shall file 
with FRA a notice of such amendment at least 30 days prior to the 
intended effective date of such action. A program responsive to the 
requirements of this section or any amendment to the program shall not 
be implemented prior to approval.
    (b) Form of programs. Random alcohol testing programs submitted by 
or on behalf of each railroad under this subpart shall meet the 
following criteria, and the railroad and its managers, supervisors, 
officials and other employees and agents shall conform to such criteria 
in implementing the program:
    (1) Selection of covered employees for testing shall be made by a 
method employing objective, neutral criteria which ensures that every 
covered employee has a substantially equal statistical chance of being 
selected within a specified time frame. The method may not permit 
subjective factors to play a

[[Page 164]]

role in selection, i.e., no employee may be selected as the result of 
the exercise of discretion by the railroad. The selection method shall 
be capable of verification with respect to the randomness of the 
selection process, and any records necessary to document random 
selection shall be retained for not less than 24 months from the date 
upon which the particular samples were collected.
    (2) The program shall include testing procedures and safeguards, 
and, consistent with this part, procedures for action based on tests 
where the employee is found to have violated Sec. 219.101.
    (3) The program shall ensure that random alcohol tests conducted 
under this part are unannounced and that the dates for administering 
random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
    (4) The program shall ensure to the maximum extent practicable that 
each covered employee shall perceive the possibility that a random 
alcohol test may be required at any time the employee reports for work 
and at any time during the duty tour (except any period when the 
employee is expressly relieved of any responsibility for performance of 
covered service).
    (5) An employee shall be subject to testing only while on duty. Only 
employees who perform covered service for the railroad shall be subject 
to testing under this part. In the case of employees who during some 
duty tours perform covered service and during others do not, the 
railroad program shall specify the extent to which, and the 
circumstances under which they shall be subject to testing. To the 
extent practical within the limitations of this part and in the context 
of the railroad's operations, the railroad program shall provide that 
employees shall be subject to the possibility of random testing on any 
day they actually perform covered service.
    (6) Testing shall be conducted promptly, as provided in 
Sec. 219.715(a).
    (7) Each time an employee is notified for random alcohol testing the 
employee will be informed that selection was made on a random basis.
    (8) Each railroad shall ensure that each covered employee who is 
notified of selection for random alcohol testing proceeds to the test 
site immediately; provided, however, that if the employee is performing 
a safety-sensitive function at the time of the notification, the 
railroad shall instead ensure that the employee ceases to perform the 
safety-sensitive function and proceeds to the testing site as soon as 
possible.
    (c) Implementation. (1) No later than 45 days prior to commencement 
of random alcohol testing, the railroad shall publish to each of its 
covered employees, individually, a written notice that they will be 
subject to random alcohol testing under this part. Such notice shall 
state the date for commencement of the program, shall state that the 
selection of employees for testing will be on a strictly random basis, 
shall describe the consequences of a determination that the employee has 
violated Sec. 219.101 or any applicable railroad rule, and shall inform 
the employee of the employee's rights under subpart E of this part. A 
copy of the notice shall be provided to each new covered employee on or 
before the employee's initial date of service. Since knowledge of 
Federal law is presumed, nothing in this paragraph creates a defense to 
a violation of Sec. 219.101. This notice may be combined with the notice 
or policy statement required by Sec. 219.23.
    (2) Each Class I railroad (including the National Railroad Passenger 
Corporation) and each railroad providing commuter passenger service 
shall implement its approved random alcohol testing program beginning on 
January 1, 1995. Each Class II railroad shall implement its approved 
random testing program beginning on July 1, 1995. Each Class III 
railroad (including a switching and terminal or other railroad not 
otherwise classified) shall implement its approved random testing 
program beginning on January 1, 1996. In the case of a railroad 
commencing operations after the pertinent date set forth in paragraph 
(a) of this section for filing of a program, the railroad shall 
implement its approved random testing program not later than the 
expiration of 60 days from approval by the Administrator or by the 
pertinent date set forth in this paragraph, whichever is later.

Sec. 219.608  Administrator's determination of random alcohol testing rate.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this 
section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing 
shall be 25 percent of covered employees.
    (b) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum 
annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is based on the 
violation rate for the entire industry. All information used for the 
determination is drawn from the alcohol MIS reports required by this 
part. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator 
considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain 
additional information or reports from employers, and may make 
appropriate modifications in calculating the industry violation rate. 
Each year, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the 
minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing of covered 
employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year 
following publication.
    (c)(1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 25 percent or more, the Administrator may lower this rate to 
10 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that 
the data received under the reporting requirements of Sec. 219.801 for 
two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less 
than 0.5 percent.
    (2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 
percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that 
the data received under the reporting requirements of Sec. 219.801 for 
two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less 
than 1.0 percent but equal to or greater than 0.5 percent.
    (d)(1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 10 percent, and the data received under the reporting 
requirements of Sec. 219.801 for that calendar year indicate that the 
violation rate is equal to or greater than 0.5 percent, but less than 
1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual 
percentage rate for random alcohol testing to 25 percent of all covered 
employees.
    (2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 25 percent or less, and the data received under the reporting 
requirements of Sec. 219.801 for any calendar year indicate that the 
violation rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the 
Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for 
random alcohol testing to 50 percent of all covered employees.
    (e) The railroad shall randomly select and test a sufficient number 
of covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an 
annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random 
alcohol testing determined by the Administrator. If the railroad 
conducts random alcohol testing through a consortium, the number of 
employees to be tested may be calculated for each individual employer or 
may be based on the total number of covered employees covered by the 
consortium who are subject to random testing at the same minimum annual 
percentage rate under this part or any DOT alcohol testing rule.
    (f) If a railroad is required to conduct random alcohol testing 
under the alcohol testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the 
railroad may--
    (1) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool 
containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same 
required rate; or
    (2) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest 
percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to 
which the railroad is subject.

                             Alcohol Testing


<R05>
Sec. 219.701  Standards for urine drug testing.

    (a) Urine drug testing required or authorized by subparts B, D, F, 
and G of this part shall be conducted in the manner provided by this 
subpart and (to the extent not inconsistent with this part) part 40 of 
subtitle A of this title. Laboratories employed for these purposes must 
be certified by the Department of Health and Human Services under that 
Department's Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing 
Programs.
    (b) Each railroad's contract with a laboratory conducting testing 
subject to this subpart shall provide that the FRA and the railroad 
shall have the right to unannounced inspection during normal business 
hours through qualified personnel or designated contractors. Such 
inspecton rights shall, at minimum, include reasonable accompanied 
access to all records pertinent to testing under this part, quality 
control data incident thereto, samples submitted under this part, and 
equipment and personnel related to analysis of those samples.
    (c) Each such contract shall also require that the laboratory comply 
with all applicable provisions of this part and 49 CFR part 40, 
including requirements for employee access to specified laboratory 
records and any applicable conditions imposed upon approvals issued 
under this subpart or 49 CFR part 40.


<R05>
Sec. 219.703  Drug testing procedures.

    (a) Urine samples shall be collected and handled as required in 49 
CFR part 40 and this section.
    (b) The collection site person (collector) shall meet the 
requirements of 49 CFR part 40.
    (c) A person with management or supervisory responsibility over the 
employee to be tested, or a co-worker of the employee to be tested, may 
not serve as a collector. For purposes of this paragraph, co-worker 
means a person with whom the person to be tested is assigned or could be 
assigned in a crew or other working unit to perform normal 
transportation duties on the railroad.
    (d) If an employee fails to provide a urine specimen within a 
reasonable time and is to be given a subsequent opportunity to provide a 
specimen under the conditions described in 49 CFR 40.25, the subsequent 
collection shall be conducted either--
    (1) Immediately upon the expiration of the employee's required off-
duty period under the Hours of Service Act (45 U.S.C. 62-64b); or
    (2) On an unannounced basis within the next 30 days.

Sec. 219.705  Drugs tested.

    (a) Urine samples shall be analyzed for the presence of controlled 
substances designated in paragraph (b) of this section and may be 
analyzed by procedures reasonably incident to analysis of the specimen 
for controlled substances (e.g., determination of pH or tests for 
specific gravity, creatinine concentration, or presence of adulterants).
    (b) Each sample submitted shall be analyzed for marijuana, cocaine, 
phencylidine (PCP), opiates (morphine and codeine), and amphetamines 
(amphetamine and methamphetamine).
    (c) As part of the reasonable cause testing program established by 
subpart D of this part, a railroad may test for additional controlled 
substances in addition to those specified in this section only with 
approval granted by FRA and for substances for which the Department of 
Health and Human Services

[[Page 167]]

has established an approved testing protocol and positive threshold.


<R05>
Sec. 219.707  Review by MRO of urine drug testing results.

    (a) Urine drug test results reported positive by the laboratory as 
provided in part 40 of this title shall not be deemed positive or 
disseminated to any person (other than to the employee tested in a 
medical interview, if conducted) until they are reviewed by a Medical 
Review Officer (MRO) of the railroad as required by part 40 of this 
title and this section. For purposes of this part, medical use of 
controlled substances by a covered employee is a legitimate medical 
explanation for presence of a controlled substance (i.e., a basis for 
declaring the result ``negative'') only to the extent such use was 
consistent with Sec. 219.103 of this part.
    (b) The MRO shall complete review of test results within not more 
than 10 regular working days of receipt of the laboratory report or they 
shall be declared negative, unless any portion of the delay shall result 
from the unwillingness or inability of the employee to appear for an 
interview or provide documentation of prescription or other authorized 
use of medications. If the employee is responsible for such delay, the 
10-day period may be extended by a period equal to the period attributed 
to the employee's delay. This paragraph shall not be read to bar 
reporting of a positive result if the employee, without a reasonable 
basis, fails to respond to an opportunity to provide supplementary 
information.
    (c) After the MRO has reviewed the pertinent information and the 
laboratory assessment is verified as indicating presence of controlled 
substances without medical authorization consistent with Sec. 219.103 of 
this part (and the review required by paragraph (b) of this section is 
completed), the MRO shall report the results to a designated railroad 
officer for action in keeping with the requirements of this part (or 
take appropriate action under the railroad's medical standards). The 
employee shall be provided a copy of the approved test results, or such 
results shall be dispatched by U.S. mail or other suitable means 
providing prompt delivery, not later than 24 hours following any adverse 
action.
    (d) Test results reported as negative by the laboratory shall also 
be communicated through the MRO. The MRO shall promptly transmit the

Sec. 219.708  Employee requests for testing.

    If the test result of the primary sample is positive, an employee 
may request that his or her split sample(s) be tested in accordance with 
the procedures specified in 49 CFR part 40.

<R05>
Sec. 219.709  Retest.

    (a) Samples that yield positive results on confirmation shall be 
retained by the laboratory in properly secured, long-term, frozen 
storage for at least 365 days, as required by part 40 of this title. 
Within this 365-day period, the employee or his representative, the 
railroad, or the FRA may request that the laboratory retain the sample 
for an additional period. If, within the 365-day period, the laboratory 
has not received a proper written request to retain the sample for a 
further reasonable period specified in the request, the sample may be 
discarded following the end of the 365-day period.
    (b) In the case of a test declared positive by the MRO, the original 
sample shall be retested if the employee makes a written request to the 
Medical Review Officer for retesting within 60 days. The employee may 
specify retesting by the original laboratory or by a second laboratory 
that is certified by the Department of Health and Human Services as 
described in 49 CFR part 40. The railroad may require the employee

[[Page 168]]

to advance the cost of shipment (if any) and reanalysis of the sample, 
but the employee shall be reimbursed for such expense if the retest is 
negative.
    (c) If the employee specifies retesting by a second laboratory, the 
original laboratory shall follow approved chain-of-custody procedures in 
transferring a portion of the sample.
    (d) Any retest of a sample is subject to 49 CFR 40.29(i) 
(quantitation for retest not subject to cutoff requirement due to 
deterioration or loss of analytes).


<R05>
Sec. 219.711  Confidentiality of test results.

    (a) A laboratory reporting results of tests conducted under this 
subpart shall report those results only to the designated Medical Review 
Officer of the railroad. The results shall not be disclosed by the 
laboratory to any other person, except that the laboratory may affirm 
the test result to the employee to whom the sample was identified. This 
paragraph shall not be read to bar normal access to analytical data for 
laboratory accreditation or certification processes.
    (b) The MRO may not disclose medically approved drug use or 
administration information obtained under this part (whether ascertained 
through testing or reported by the employee or the employee's medical 
practitioner at the employee's request) to non-medical railroad 
personnel or any third party; however, nothing in this part bars use of 
such information by the railroad's medical officer in the context of an 
established medical qualifications program. This paragraph shall not be 
construed to permit medical disqualification of an employee based upon a 
laboratory report indicating presence of a controlled substance prior to 
completion of the MRO review, nor to limit the discretion of the 
railroad under Sec. 40.33(c) of this chapter.
    (c) No record of tests conducted subject to this subpart or 
information drawn therefrom shall be used or disseminated by the 
railroad or within the railroad for any purpose other than providing for 
compliance with this part (and railroad rules consistent herewith), 
unless with the voluntary written consent of the employee. Such written 
consent shall specify the person to whom the information may be 
provided. Each railroad shall adopt and implement procedures to guard 
this information against unauthorized disclosure both within and 
external to the railroad company.

Sec. 219.715  Alcohol testing procedures.

    (a) Each covered employee who is notified of selection for alcohol 
testing and who is not performing covered service at the time of 
notification shall proceed to the testing site immediately. The railroad 
shall ensure that an employee who is performing covered service at the 
time of notification shall, as soon as possible without affecting 
safety, cease to perform covered service and proceed to the testing 
site.
    (b) Each railroad shall ensure that all alcohol testing conducted 
under this part complies with the procedures set forth in part 40 of 
this title. The provisions of part 40 of this title that address alcohol 
testing are made applicable to employers by this part.

     Appendix C to Part 219--Post-Accident Testing Sample Collection

                              1.0  General.

    This appendix prescribes procedures for collection of samples for 
mandatory post-accident testing pursuant to subpart C of this part. 
Collection of blood and urine samples is required to be conducted at an 
independent medical facility.

                          (Surviving Employees)

                        2.0  Surviving Employees.

    This unit provides detailed procedures for collecting post-accident 
toxicological samples from surviving employees involved in train 
accidents and train incidents, as required by 49 CFR part 219, subpart 
C. Subpart C specifies qualifying events and employees required to be 
tested.

[[Page 176]]

                  2.1  Collection Procedures; General.

    All forms and supplies necessary for collection and transfer of 
blood and urine samples for three surviving employees can be found in 
the FRA post-accident shipping box, which is made available to the 
collection site by the railroad representative.
    Each shipping box contains supplies for blood/urine collections from 
three individuals, including instructions and necessary forms. The 
railroad is responsible for ensuring that materials are fresh, complete 
and meet FRA requirements.

          2.11  Responsibility of the Railroad Representative.

    In the event of an accident/incident for which testing is required 
under subpart C of this part, the railroad representative shall follow 
the designated set of instructions, and, upon arrival at the independent 
medical facility, promptly present to the collection facility 
representative a post-accident shipping box or boxes with all remaining 
sets of instructions. (Each box contains supplies to collect samples 
from three employees.) The railroad representative shall request the 
collection facility representative to review the instructions provided 
and, through qualified personnel, provide for collection of the samples 
according to the procedures set out.
    The railroad representative shall undertake the following additional 
responsibilities--
    <bullet> Complete FRA Form 6180.73 (revised), Accident Information 
Required for Post-Accident Toxicological Testing, describing the testing 
event and identifying the employees whose samples are to be deposited in 
the shipping box.
    <bullet> As necessary to verify the identity of individual 
employees, affirm the identity of each employee to the medical facility 
personnel.
    <bullet> Consistent with the policy of the collection facility, 
monitor the progress of the collection procedure.
    Warning: Monitor but do not directly observe urination or otherwise 
disturb the privacy of urine or blood collection. Do not handle sample 
containers, bottles or tubes (empty or full). Do not become part of the 
collection process.

                     2.12  Employee Responsibility.

    An employee who is identified for post-accident toxicological 
testing shall cooperate in testing as required by the railroad and 
personnel of the independent medical facility. Such cooperation will 
normally consist of the following, to be performed as requested:
    <bullet> Provide a blood sample, which a qualified medical 
professional or technician will draw using a single-use sterile syringe. 
The employee should be seated for this procedure.
    <bullet> Provide, in the privacy of an enclosure, a urine sample 
into a plastic collection cup. Deliver the cup to the collector.
    <bullet> Do not let the blood and urine samples that you provided 
leave your sight until they have been properly sealed and initialed by 
you.
    <bullet> Certify the statement in Step 4 of the Blood/Urine Custody 
and Control Form (FRA Form 6180.74 (revised)).
    <bullet> If required by the medical facility, complete a separate 
consent form for taking of the samples and their release to FRA for 
analysis under the FRA rule.

    Note: The employee may not be required to complete any form that 
contains any waiver of rights the employee may have in the employment 
relationship or that releases or holds harmless the medical facility 
with respect to negligence in the collection.

                          2.2  The Collection.

    Exhibit C-1 contains instructions for collection of samples for 
post-accident toxicology from surviving employees. These instructions 
shall be observed for each collection. Instructions are also contained 
in each post-accident shipping box and shall be provided to collection 
facility personnel involved in the collection and/or packaging of 
samples for shipment.

                        (Post Mortem Collection)

                             3.0  Fatality.

    This unit provides procedures for collecting post-accident body 
fluid/tissue samples from the remains of employees killed in train 
accidents and train incidents, as required by 49 CFR part 219, subpart 
C. Subpart C specifies qualifying events and employees required to be 
tested.

                            3.1  Collection.

    In the event of a fatality for which testing is required under 
subpart C, the railroad shall promptly make available to the custodian 
of the remains a post-accident shipping box. The railroad representative 
shall request the custodian to review the instructions contained in the 
shipping box and, through qualified medical personnel, to provide the 
samples as indicated.

                  (Surviving Employees and Fatalities)

                             4.0  Shipment.

    The railroad is responsible for arranging overnight transportation 
of the sealed shipping box containing the samples. When possible without 
incurring delay, the box should be delivered directly from the 
collection personnel providing the samples to an overnight express 
service courier. If it becomes necessary for the railroad to transport 
the box

[[Page 177]]

from point of collection to point of shipment, then--
    1. Individual kits and the shipping box shall be sealed by 
collection personnel before the box is turned over to the railroad 
representative;
    2. The railroad shall limit the number of persons handling the 
shipping box to the minimum necessary to provide for transportation;
    3. If the shipping box cannot immediately be delivered to the 
express carrier for transportation, it shall be maintained in secure 
temporary storage; and
    4. The railroad representatives handling the box shall document 
chain of custody of the shipping box and shall make available such 
documentation to FRA on request.

  Exhibit C-1--Instructions for Collection of Blood and Urine Samples: 
              Mandatory Post-Accident Toxicological Testing

                               A. Purpose

    These instructions are for the use of personnel of collection 
facilities conducting collection of blood and urine samples from 
surviving railroad employees following railroad accidents and casualties 
that qualify for mandatory alcohol/drug testing. The Federal Railroad 
Administration appreciates the participation of medical facilities in 
this important public safety program.

                        B. Prepare for Collection

    Railroad employees have consented to provision of samples for 
analysis by the Federal Railroad Administration as a condition of 
employment (49 CFR 219.11). A private, controlled area should be 
designated for collection of samples and completion of paperwork.
    Only one sample should be collected at a time, with each employee's 
blood draw or urine collection having the complete attention of the 
collector until the specific sample has been labeled, sealed and 
documented.
    Please remember two critical rules for the collections:
    All labeling and sealing must be done in the sight of the donor, 
with the sample never having left the donor's presence until the sample 
has been labeled, sealed and initialled by the donor.
    Continuous custody and control of blood and urine samples must be 
maintained and documented on the forms provided. In order to do this it 
is important for the paperwork and the samples to stay together.
    To the extent practical, blood collection should take priority over 
urine collection. To limit steps in the chain of custody, it is best if 
a single collector handles both collections from a given employee.
    You will use a single Post-Accident Testing Blood/Urine Custody and 
Control Form (FRA Form 6108.74 (revised)), consisting of six Steps to 
complete the collection for each employee. We will refer to it as the 
Control Form.

                          C. Identify the Donor

    The employee donor must provide photo identification to each 
collector, or lacking this, be identified by the railroad 
representative.
    The donor should remove all unnecessary outer garments such as coats 
or jackets, but may retain valuables, including wallet. Donors should 
not be asked to disrobe, unless necessary for a separate physical 
examination required by the attending physician.

                              D. Draw Blood

    Assemble the materials for collecting blood from each employee: two 
10 ml grey-stoppered blood tubes and the Control Form.
    Ask the donor to complete STEP 1 on the Control Form.
    With the donor seated, draw two (2) 10 ml tubes of blood using 
standard medical procedures (sterile, single-use syringe into evacuated 
gray-top tubes provided). CAUTION: Do not use alcohol or an alcohol-
based swab to cleanse the venipuncture site.
    Once both tubes are filled and the site of venipuncture is 
protected, immediately--
    <bullet> Seal and label each tube by placing a numbered blood sample 
label from the label set on the Control Form over the top of the tube 
and securing it down the sides.
    <bullet> Ask the donor to initial each label. Please check to see 
that the initials match the employee's name and note any discrepancies 
in the ``Remarks'' block of the Control Form.
    <bullet> As collector, sign and date each blood tube label at the 
place provided.
    <bullet> Skip to STEP 5 and initiate chain of custody for the blood 
tubes by filling out the first line of the block to show receipt of the 
blood samples from the donor.
    <bullet> Complete STEP 2 on the form.
    <bullet> Return the blood tubes into the individual kit. Keep the 
paperwork and samples together. If another collector will be collecting 
the urine sample from this employee, transfer both the form and the 
individual kit with blood tubes to that person, showing the transfer of 
the blood tubes on the second line of STEP 5 (the chain of custody 
block).

                            E. Collect Urine

    The urine collector should assemble at his/her station the materials 
for collecting urine from each employee: one plastic collection cup with 
temperature device affixed enclosed in a heat-seal bag (with protective 
seal intact), two 90 ml urine sample bottles with caps and one biohazard 
bag (with absorbent) also enclosed in a heat-seal bag (with protective 
seal intact), and the Control Form.

[[Page 178]]

Blood samples already collected must remain in the collector's custody 
and control during this procedure.
    After requiring the employee to wash his/her hands, the collector 
should escort the employee directly to the urine collection area. To the 
extent practical, all sources of water in the collection area should be 
secured and a bluing agent (provided in the box) placed in any toilet 
bowl, tank, or other standing water.
    The employee will be provided a private place in which to void. 
Urination will not be directly observed. If the enclosure contains a 
source of running water that cannot be secured or any material (soap, 
etc.) that could be used to adulterate the sample, the collector should 
monitor the provision of the sample from outside the enclosure. Any 
unusual behavior or appearance should be noted in the remarks section of 
the Control Form or on the back of that form.
    The collector should then proceed as follows:
    Unwrap the collection cup in the employee's presence and hand it to 
the employee (or allow the employee to unwrap it).
    Ask the employee to void at least 60 ml into the collection cup (at 
least to the line marked). Leave the private enclosure.

    IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH URINATION OR SAMPLE QUANTITY, SEE THE 
            ``TROUBLE BOX'' AT THE BACK OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS

    Once the void is complete, the employee should exit the private 
enclosure and deliver the sample to the collector. Both the collector 
and the employee must proceed immediately to the labeling/sealing area, 
with the sample never leaving the sight of the employee before being 
sealed and labeled.
    Upon receipt of the sample, proceed as follows:
    <bullet> In the full view of the employee, remove the wrapper from 
the two urine sample bottles. Transfer the urine from the collection cup 
into the sample bottles (at least 30 ml in bottle A and at least 15 ml 
in bottle B).
    <bullet> As you pour the sample into the sample bottles, please 
inspect for any unusual signs indicating possible adulteration or 
dilution. Carefully secure the tops. Note any unusual signs under 
``remarks'' at STEP 3 of the Control Form.
    <bullet> Within 4 minutes after the void, measure the temperature of 
the urine by reading the strip on the bottle. Mark the result at STEP 3 
of the Control Form.

IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE URINE SAMPLE, SEE THE TROUBLE BOX AT THE 
                       BACK OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS

    <bullet> Remove the urine bottle labels from the Control Form. The 
labels are marked A and B. Place each label as marked over the top of 
its corresponding bottle, and secure the label to the sides of the 
bottle.
    <bullet> Ask the donor to initial each label. Please check to see 
that the initials match the employee name and note any discrepancy in 
the ``Remarks'' block of STEP 3.
    <bullet> As collector, sign and date each urine label.
    <bullet> Skip to STEP 5 and initiate chain-of-custody by showing 
receipt of the urine samples from the donor. (If you collected the 
blood, a check under ``urine'' will suffice. If someone else collected 
the blood, first make sure transfer of the blood to you is documented. 
Then, using the next available line, show ``Provide samples'' under 
purpose, ``Donor'' under ``released by,'' check under ``urine'' and 
place your name, signature and date in the space provided.)
    <bullet> Complete the remainder of STEP 3 on the Control Form.
    <bullet> Have the employee complete STEP 4 on the Control Form.
    <bullet> Place the filled urine bottles in the individual employee 
kit. Keep the paperwork and samples together. If another collector will 
be collecting the blood sample from this employee, transfer both the 
form and the kit to that person, showing the transfer of the urine 
samples on the next available line of STEP 5 (the chain of custody 
block).

                   F. Seal the Individual Employee Kit

    The blood and urine samples have now been collected for this 
employee. The blood/urine samples will now be sealed into the individual 
employee kit, while all paperwork will be retained for further 
completion. After rechecking to see that each sample is properly labeled 
and initialled, close the plastic bag to contain any leakage in 
transportation, and apply the kit security seal to the small individual 
kit. As collector, sign and date the kit seal.
    Before collecting samples from the next employee, complete the next 
line on the chain-of-custody block showing release of the blood and 
urine by yourself for the purpose of ``Shipment'' and receipt by the 
courier service or railroad representative that will provide 
transportation of the box, together with the date.

                    G. Complete Treatment Information

    Complete STEP 6 of the Control Form. Mark the box if a breath 
alcohol test was conducted under FRA authority.

                     H. Prepare the Box for Shipment

    Sealed individual employee kits should be retained in secure storage 
if there will be a delay in preparation of the shipping box. The 
shipping box shall be prepared and sealed by a collection facility 
representative as follows:

[[Page 179]]

    <bullet> Inspect STEP 5 of each Control Form to ensure chain-of-
custody is continuous and complete for each fluid (showing samples 
released for shipment). Retain the medical facility copy of each Control 
Form and the Accident Information form for your records.
    <bullet> Place sealed individual employee kits in the shipping box. 
Place all forms in zip-lock bag and seal securely. Place bag with forms 
and unused supplies in shipping box.
    <bullet> Affix the mailing label provided to the outside of the 
shipping box.

                             I. Ship the Box

    The railroad must arrange to have the box shipped overnight air 
express or (if express service is unavailable) by air freight, prepaid, 
to FRA's designated laboratory. Whenever possible without incurring 
delay, the collector should deliver the box directly into the hands of 
the express courier or air freight representative.
    Where courier pickup is not immediately available at the collection 
facility where the samples are taken, the railroad is required to 
transport the shipping box for expeditious shipment by air express, air 
freight or equivalent means.
    If the railroad is given custody of the box to arrange shipment, 
please record the name of the railroad official taking custody on the 
copy of Form 6180.73 retained by the collection site.

                             ``TROUBLE BOX''

    1. Problem: The employee claims an inability to urinate, either 
because he/she has recently voided or because of anxiety concerning the 
collection.
    Action: The employee may be offered moderate quantities of liquid to 
assist urination. If the employee continues to claim inability after 4 
hours, the urine collection should be discontinued, but the blood 
samples should be forwarded and all other procedures followed. Please 
note in area provided for remarks what explanation was provided by the 
employee.
    2. Problem: The employee cannot provide approximately 60 ml. of 
sample.
    Action: The employee should remain at the collection facility until 
as much as possible of the required amount can be given (up to 4 hours). 
The employee should be offered moderate quantities of liquids to aid 
urination. The first bottle, if it contains any quantity of urine, 
should be sealed and securely stored with the blood tubes and Control 
Form pending shipment. A second bottle should then be used for the 
subsequent void (using a second Control Form with the words ``SECOND 
VOID--FIRST SAMPLE INSUFFICIENT'' in the remarks block and labels from 
that form). However, if after 4 hours the donor's second void is also 
insufficient or contains no more than the first insufficient void, 
discard the second void and send the first void to the laboratory.
    3. Problem: The urine temperature is outside the normal range of 
32 deg.-38 deg.C/90 deg.-100 deg.F, and a suitable medical explanation 
cannot be provided by an oral temperature or other means; or
    4. Problem: The collector observes conduct clearly and unequivocally 
indicating an attempt to substitute or adulterate the sample (e.g., 
substitute urine in plain view, blue dye in sample presented, etc.) and 
a collection site supervisor or the railroad representative agrees that 
the circumstances indicate an attempt to tamper with the sample.
    Action (for either Problem No. 3 or Problem No. 4): Document the 
problem on the Control Form. If the collection site supervisor or 
railroad representative concur that the temperature of the sample, or 
other clear and unequivocal evidence, indicates a possible attempt to 
substitute or alter the sample, another void must be taken under direct 
observation by a collector of the same gender.
    If a collector of the same sex is not available, do NOT proceed with 
this step.
    If a collector of the same gender is available, proceed as follows: 
A new Control Form must be initiated for the second void. The original 
suspect sample should be marked ``Void 1'' and the follow-up void should 
be marked ``Void 2,'' with both voids being sent to the laboratory and 
the incident clearly detailed on the Control Form.

    Exhibit C-2--Instructions for Collection of Post Mortem Samples: 
             Employee Killed in a Railroad Accident/Incident

    To the Medical Examiner, Coroner, or Pathologist:
    In compliance with Federal safety regulations (49 CFR part 219), a 
railroad representative has requested that you obtain samples for 
toxicology from the remains of a railroad employee who was killed in a 
railroad accident or incident. The deceased consented to the taking of 
such samples, as a matter of Federal law, by performing service on the 
railroad (49 CFR 219.11(f)).
    Your assistance is requested in carrying out this program of 
testing, which is important to the protection of the public safety and 
the safety of those who work on the railroads.

                               Materials:

    The railroad will provide you a post-accident shipping box that 
contains necessary supplies. If the box is not immediately available, 
please proceed using supplies available to you that are suitable for 
forensic toxicology.

[[Page 180]]

               Samples requested, in order of preference:

    (1) Blood--20 milliliters or more. Preferred sites: intact femoral 
vein or artery or peripheral vessels (up to 10 ml, as available) and 
intact heart (20 ml). Deposit blood in gray-stopper tubes individually 
by site and shake to mix sample and preservative.

    Note: If uncontaminated blood is not available, bloody fluid or 
clots from body cavity may be useful for qualitative purposes; but do 
not label as blood. Please indicate source and identity of sample on 
label of tube.

    (2) Urine--as much as 100 milliliters, if available. Deposit into 
plastic bottles provided.
    (3) Vitreous fluid--all available, deposited into smallest available 
tube (e.g., 3 ml) with 1% sodium fluoride, or gray-stopper tube 
(provided). Shake to mix sample and preservative.
    (4) If available at autopsy, organs--50 to 100 grams each of two or 
more of the following in order preference, as available: liver, bile, 
brain, kidney, spleen, and/or lung. Samples should be individually 
deposited into zip-lock bags or other clean, single use containers 
suitable for forensic samples.
    (5) If vitreous or urine is not available, please provide--
    a. Spinal fluid--all available, in 8 ml container (if available) 
with sodium fluoride or in gray-stopper tube; or, if spinal fluid cannot 
be obtained,
    b. Gastric content--up to 100 milliliters, as available, into 
plastic bottle.

                           Sample collection:

    Sampling at time of autopsy is preferred so that percutaneous needle 
puncturing is not necessary. However, if autopsy will not be conducted 
or is delayed, please proceed with sampling.
    Blood samples should be taken by sterile syringe and deposited 
directly into evacuated tube, if possible, to avoid contamination of 
sample or dissipation of volatiles (ethyl alcohol).

    Note: If only cavity fluid is available, please open cavity to 
collect sample. Note condition of cavity.

    Please use smallest tubes available to accommodate available 
quantity of fluid sample (with 1% sodium fluoride).

                     Sample identification, sealing:

    As each sample is collected, seal each blood tube and each urine 
bottle using the respective blood tube or urine bottle using the 
identifier labels from the set provided with the Post Accident Testing 
Blood/Urine Custody and Control Form (FRA Form 6180.74 (revised)). Make 
sure the unique identification number on the labels match the pre-
printed number on the Control Form. Please label other samples with name 
and sample set identification numbers. You can use labels and seals from 
any of the extra forms, but annotate them accordingly.
    Annotate each label with sample description and source (as 
appropriate) (e.g., blood, femoral vein).
    Please provide copy of any written documentation regarding condition 
of body and/or sampling procedure that is available at the time samples 
are shipped.

                                Handling:

    If samples cannot be shipped immediately as provided below, samples 
other than blood may be immediately frozen. Blood samples should be 
refrigerated, but not frozen.
    All samples and documentation should be secured from unauthorized 
access pending delivery for transportation.

                              Information:

    If the railroad has not already done so, please place the name of 
the subject at the top of the Control Form (STEP 1). You are requested 
to complete STEP 2 of the form, annotating it by writing the word 
``FATALITY,'' listing the samples provided, providing any further 
information under ``Remarks'' or at the bottom of the form. If it is 
necessary to transfer custody of the samples from the person taking the 
samples prior to preparing the box for shipment, please use the blocks 
provided in STEP 5 to document transfer of custody.
    The railroad representative will also provide Accident Information 
Required for Post-Accident Toxicological Testing, FRA Form 6180.73 
(revised). Both forms should be placed in the shipping box when 
completed; but you may retain the designated medical facility copy of 
each form for your records.

                        Packing the shipping box:

    Place urine bottles and blood tubes in the sponge liner in the 
individual kit, close the biohazard bag zipper, close the kit and apply 
the kit custody seal to the kit. You may use additional kits for each 
tissue sample, being careful to identify sample by tissue, name of 
deceased, and specimen set identification number. Apply kit security 
seals to individual kits and initial across all seals.
    Place all forms in the zip-lock bag and seal securely. Place the bag 
in the shipping box. Do not put forms in with the specimens.
    Seal the shipping box with the seal provided and initial and date 
across the seal.
    Affix the mailing label to the outside of the box.

                            Shipping the box:

    The railroad must arrange to have the box shipped overnight air 
express or (if express service is unavailable) by air freight, prepaid, 
to FRA's designated laboratory. When

[[Page 181]]

possible, but without incurring delay, deliver the sealed shipping box 
directly to the express courier or the air freight representative.
    If courier pickup is not immediately available at your facility, the 
railroad is required to transport the sealed shipping box to the nearest 
point of shipment via air express, air freight or equivalent means.
    If the railroad receives the sealed shipping box to arrange 
shipment, please record under ``Supplemental Information'' on the 
Control Form, the name of the railroad official taking custody.

                                 Other:

    FRA requests that the person taking the samples annotate the Control 
Form under ``Supplemental Information'' if additional toxicological 
analysis will be undertaken with respect to the fatality. FRA reports 
are available to the coroner or medical examiner on request.

followed by the word ``out'' to indicate to the receiving employee that 
the exchange of transmissions is complete.


<R05>
Sec. 220.37   Voice test.

    (a) Each radio which is used in connection with a railroad operation 
outside yard limits shall be tested at the point where the train is 
originally made up. At least once during each tour of duty, the engineer 
and conductor shall be responsible for the testing of the radio to 
verify that the radio is operating properly on the engine and caboose. 
The tests shall consist of an exchange of voice transmissions with 
another station. The other station shall advise the station conducting 
the test of the quality and readability of its transmission.
    (b) Any radio found not to be functioning properly shall be removed 
from service until it has been repaired.

operating rules. The use of citizen band radios for railroad operating 
purposes is prohibited.


<R05>
Sec. 220.45   Communication must be complete.

    Any radio communication which is not fully understood or completed 
in accordance with the requirements of part 220 and the operating rules 
of the railroad, shall not be acted upon and shall be treated as though 
not sent.


<R05>
Sec. 220.47   Emergencies.

    (a) An emergency transmission shall be preceded by the word 
``emergency'', repeated three times. An emergency transmission shall 
have priority over all other transmissions and the frequency or channel 
shall be kept clear of non-emergency traffic for the duration of the 
emergency transmission.
    (b) Emergency transmissions shall be used to report derailments, 
collisions, storms, wash-outs, fires, obstructions to tracks, and other 
hazardous conditions which could result in death or injury, damage to 
property or serious disruption of railroad operations. Emergency 
transmissions shall describe as completely as possible the nature, 
degree and location of the hazard.


<R05>
Sec. 220.49   Switching, backing or pushing.

car, the employee directing the movement shall give complete 
instructions or keep in continuous radio contact with the employees 
receiving the instructions. When backing or pushing a train, engine or 
cars, the distance of the movement must be specified, and the movement 
must stop in one-half the remaining distance unless additional 
instructions are received. If the instructions are not understood or 
continuous radio contact is not maintained, the movement shall be 
stopped immediately and may not be resumed until the misunderstanding 
has been resolved, radio contact has been restored, or communication has 
been achieved by hand signals or other procedures in accordance with the 
operating rules of the railroad.


<R05>
Sec. 220.51   Signal indications.

    (a) No information may be given by radio to a train or engine crew 
about the position or aspect displayed by a fixed signal. However, radio 
may be used by a train crew member to communicate information about the 
position or aspect displayed by a fixed signal to other members of the 
same crew.
    (b) Except as provided in the railroad's operating rules, radio 
communication may not be used to convey instructions which would have 
the effect of overriding the indication of a fixed signal in automatic 
block territory.


<R04>
                         Subpart C--Train Orders


<R05>
Sec. 220.61   Transmission of train orders by radio.

    (a) Train orders may be transmitted by radio only when authorized by 
railroad's operating rules and must be transmitted in accordance with 
the railroad's operating rules and the requirements of this part 220.
    (b) The procedures for transmission of train orders by radio are as 
follows:
    (1) The dispatcher or operator shall call the addresses of the train 
order and state his intention to transmit the train order.
    (2) Before the train order is transmitted, the employee to receive 
and copy the train order shall state his name, identification or call 
sign, location, and that he is prepared to receive a train order. Train 
orders may not be received and copied by an employee operating the 
controls on an engine of a moving train. Train orders may not be 
transmitted to the crew of a moving train when, in the judgment of 
either the conductor, the engineer, or the train dispatcher, the train 
order cannot be received and copied without impairing the safe operation 
of their Train.
    (3) Train orders shall be copied in writing by the receiving 
employee in

[[Page 216]]

the format prescribed in the railroad's operating rules.
    (4) After the train order has been received and copied, it shall be 
immediately repeated in its entirety. After verifying the accuracy of 
the repeated train order, the dispatcher shall then state ``complete'', 
the time, and the initials of the employee designated by the railroad. 
Employees copying train orders must then acknowledge by repeating 
``complete'' and the time.
    (5) Before a train order is acted upon, both the conductor and 
engineer must have a written copy of the train order and make certain 
that the train order is read and understood by other members of the 
crew.
    (6) A train order which has not been completed or which does not 
comply with the requirements of the railroad's operating rules, may not 
be acted upon and must be treated as though not sent. Information 
contained in a train order may not be acted upon by persons other than 
those to whom the train order is addressed.

      Appendix B to Part 220--Recommended Pronunciation of Numerals

    To distinguish numbers from similar sounding words, the word 
``figures'' should be used preceding such numbers. Numbers should be 
pronounced as follows:

    (The figure ZERO should be written as ``0'' to distinguish it from 
the letter ``O''. The figure ONE should be underlined to distinguish it 
from the letter ``I''. When railroad rules require that numbers be 
spelled, these principles do not apply.)
    The following examples illustrate the recommended pronunciation of 
numerals:

       Appendix A to Part 223--Certification of Glazing Materials

    As provided in this part, certified glazing materials installed in 
locomotives, passenger cars, or cabooses must be certified by the 
glazing manufacturer in accordance with the following procedures:
    a. General Requirements
    (1) Each manufacturer that provides glazing materials, intended by 
the manufacturer for use in achieving compliance with the requirements 
of this part, shall certify that each type of glazing material being 
supplied for this purpose has been succcessfully tested in accordance 
with this appendix and that test verification data is available to a 
railroad or to FRA upon request.
    (2) The test verification data shall contain all pertinent original 
data logs and documentation that the selection of material samples, test 
set-ups, test measuring devices, and test procedures were performed by 
qualified personnel using recognized and acceptable practices and in 
accordance with this appendix.
    b. Testing Requirements
    (1) The material to be tested (Target Material) shall be a full 
scale sample of the largest dimension intended to be produced and 
installed.
    (2) The Target Material shall be representative of production 
material and shall be selected on a documented random choice basis.
    (3) The Target Material shall be securely and rigidly attached in a 
fixture so that the fixture's own characteristics will not induce test 
errors.
    (4) The Target Material so selected and attached shall constitute a 
Test Specimen.
    (5) The Test Specimen will then be equipped with a Witness Plate 
that shall be mounted parallel to and at a distance of six inches in 
back of the Target Material. The Witness Plate shall have at least an 
area which will cover the full map of the Target Material.

[[Page 226]]

    (6) The Witness Plate shall be an unbacked sheet of maximum 0.006 
inch, alloy 1100 temper O, aluminum stretched within the perimeter of a 
suitable frame to provide a taut surface.
    (7) The Test Specimen will be positioned so that the defined 
projectile impacts it at an angle of 90 degrees to the Test Specimen 
surface.
    (8) The point of impact of the defined projectile will be within a 
radius of 3'' of the centroid of the Target Material.
    (9) Velocity screens or other suitable velocity measuring devices 
will be positioned so as to measure the impact velocity of the defined 
projectile within a 10% accuracy tolerance, with test modifications made 
to guarantee that the stipulated minimum velocity requirements are met.
    (10) The Test Specimen for glazing material that is intended for use 
in end facing glazing locations shall be subjected to a Type I test 
regimen consisting of the following tests:
    (i) Ballistic Impact in which a standard 22 caliber long rifle lead 
bullet of 40 grains in weight impacts at a minimum of 960 feet per 
second velocity.
    (ii) Large Object Impact in which a cinder block of 24 lbs minimum 
weight with dimensions of 8 inches by 8 inches by 16 inches nominally 
impacts at the corner of the block at a minimum of 44 feet per second 
velocity. The cinder block must be of composition referenced in American 
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Specification C33L or ASTM C90.
    (11) The Test Specimen for glazing material that is intended for use 
only in side facing glazing locations shall be subjected to a Type II 
test regimen consisting of the following tests:
    (i) Ballistic Impact in which a standard 22 caliber long rifle lead 
bullet of 40 grains in weight impacts at a minimum of 960 feet per 
second velocity.
    (ii) Large Object Impact in which a cinder block of 24 lbs minimum 
weight with dimensions of 8 inches by 8 inches by 16 inches nominally 
impacts at the corner of the block at a minimum of 12 feet per second 
velocity. The cinder block must be of the composition referenced in ASTM 
C33L or ASTM C90.
    (12) Three different test specimens must be subjected to the 
ballistic impact portion of these tests.
    (13) Two different test specimens must be subjected to the large 
object impact portion of these tests.
    (14) A material so tested must perform so that:
    (i) there shall be no penetration of the back surfaces (side closest 
to Witness Plate) of the Target Material by the projectile. Partial 
penetration of the impact (front) surface of the Target Material does 
not constitute a failure; and
    (ii) there shall be no penetration of particles from the back side 
of the Target Material through the back side of the prescribed Witness 
Plate.
    (15) Test specimens must consecutively pass the required number of 
tests at the required minimum velocities. Individual tests resulting in 
failures at greater than the required minimum velocities may be repeated 
but a failure of an individual test at less than the minimum velocity 
shall result in termination of the total test and failure of the 
material.
    (16) After successful completion of the prescribed set of required 
consecutive tests, a manufacturer may certify in writing that a 
particular glazing material meets the requirements of these standards.
    c. Material Identification
    (1) Each individual unit of glazing material shall be permanently 
marked, prior to installation, to indicate that this type of material 
has been successfully tested as set forth in this appendix and that 
marking shall be done in such a manner that it is clearly visible after 
the material has been installed.
    (2) Each individual unit of a glazing material that has successfully 
passed the Type I testing regimen shall be marked to indicate:
    (i) ``FRA Type I'' material;
    (ii) the manufacturer of the material;
    (iii) the type or brand identification of the material.
    (3) Each individual unit of a glazing material that has successfully 
passed the Type II testing regimen shall be marked to indicate:
    (i) ``FRA Type II'' material;
    (ii) the manufacturer of the material;
    (iii) the type or brand identification of the material.

Sec. 225.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to provide the Federal Railroad 
Administration with accurate information concerning the hazards and 
risks that exist on the Nation's railroads. FRA needs this information 
to effectively carry out its regulatory responsibilities under 49 U.S.C. 
chapters 201-213. FRA also uses this information for determining 
comparative trends of railroad safety and to develop hazard elimination 
and risk reduction programs that focus on preventing railroad injuries 
and accidents. Issuance of these regulations under the federal railroad 
safety laws and regulations preempts States from prescribing accident/
incident reporting requirements. Any State may, however, require 
railroads to submit to it copies of accident/incident and injury/illness 
reports filed with FRA under this part, for accidents/incidents and 
injuries/illnesses which occur in that State.

Sec. 225.1  Purpose.
    The purpose of this part is to provide the Federal Railroad 
Administration (FRA) with information concerning hazardous conditions on 
the Nation's railroads. FRA needs this information to carry out 
effectively its regulatory responsibilities under the Federal Railroad 
Safety Act of 1970 and the Accidents Reports Act. Issuance of these 
regulations under the Federal Railroad Safety Act preempts States from 
prescribing accident/incident reporting requirements. Any State may, 
however, require railroads to submit to it copies of accident/incident 
reports filed with FRA under this part, for accidents/incidents which 
occur in that State. The reporting and recordkeeping requirements 
prescribed in this part have been approved by the Office of Management 
and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

Sec. 225.3  Applicability.

    This part applies to all railroads except--
    (a) A railroad that operates freight trains only on track inside an 
installation which is not part of the general railroad system of 
transportation or that owns no track except for track that is inside an 
installation that is not part of the general railroad system of 
transportation and used for freight operations.
    (b) Rail mass transit operations in an urban area that are not 
connected with the general railroad system of transportation.

[[Page 228]]

    (c) A railroad that exclusively hauls passengers inside an 
installation that is insular or that owns no track except for track used 
exclusively for the hauling of passengers inside an installation that is 
insular. An operation is not considered insular if one or more of the 
following exists on its line:
    (1) A public highway-rail grade crossing that is in use;
    (2) An at-grade rail crossing that is in use;
    (3) A bridge over a public road or waters used for commercial 
navigation; or
    (4) A common corridor with a railroad, i.e., its operations are 
within 30 feet of those of any railroad.

superseded text is set forth as follows:
Sec. 225.3  Applicability.
    This part applies to all railroads except those railroads whose 
entire operations are confined within an industrial installation.


<R05>
Sec. 225.5  Definitions.

    As used in this part--
    Accident/incident means:
    (1) Any impact between railroad on-track equipment and an 
automobile, bus, truck, motorcycle, bicycle, farm vehicle or pedestrian 
at a highway-rail grade crossing;
    (2) Any collision, derailment, fire, explosion, act of God, or other 
event involving operation of railroad on-track equipment (standing or 
moving) that results in reportable damages greater than the current 
reporting threshold to railroad on-track equipment, signals, track, 
track structures, and roadbed;
    (3) Any event arising from the operation of a railroad which results 
in:
    (i) Death to any person;
    (ii) Injury to any person that requires medical treatment;
    (iii) Injury to a railroad employee that results in:
    (A) A day away from work;
    (B) Restricted work activity or job transfer; or
    (C) Loss of consciousness; or
    (4) Occupational illness of a railroad employee.
    Accountable injury or illness means any condition, not otherwise 
reportable, of a railroad worker that is associated with an event, 
exposure, or activity in the work environment that causes or requires 
the worker to be examined or treated by a qualified health care 
professional. Such treatment would usually occur at a location other 
than the work environment; however, it may be provided at any location, 
including the work site.
    Accountable rail equipment accident/incident means any event not 
otherwise reportable, involving the operation of on-track equipment that 
causes physical damage to either the on-track equipment or the track 
upon which such equipment was operated and that requires the removal or 
repair of rail equipment from the track before any rail operations over 
the track can continue. An accountable rail equipment accident/incident, 
if not tended to, thus would disrupt railroad service. Examples of 
``disruption of service'' would include: loss of main track; one or more 
derailed wheels; any train failing to arrive or depart at its scheduled 
time; one or more cars or locomotives taken out of service; or rerouting 
trains due to a damaged car or locomotive.
    Arising from the operation of a railroad includes all activities of 
a railroad that are related to the performance of its rail 
transportation business.
    Day away from work is any day subsequent to the day of the injury or 
diagnosis of occupational illness that a railroad employee does not 
report to work for reasons associated with his or her condition.
    Day of restricted work activity is any day that a employee is 
restricted (as defined below) in his or her job following the day of the 
injury or diagnosis of occupational illness.
    Employee human factor includes any of the accident causes signified 
by the train accident cause codes listed under ``Train Operation--Human 
Factors'' in the current ``FRA Guide for Preparing Accidents/Incidents 
Reports,'' except for those train accident cause codes pertaining to 
non-railroad workers. For purposes of this definition ``employee'' 
includes the classifications of Worker on Duty--Employee, Employee not 
on Duty, Worker on Duty--Contractor, and Worker on Duty--Volunteer.

[[Page 229]]

    Establishment means a single physical location where workers report 
to work, where business is conducted or where services or operations are 
performed, for example, an operating division, general office, and major 
installation, such as a locomotive or car repair or construction 
facility.
    First aid treatment means treatment limited to simple procedures 
used to treat minor conditions, such as abrasions, cuts, bruises, and 
splinters. First aid treatment is typically confined to a single 
treatment and does not require special skills or procedures.
    FRA representative means the Associate Administrator for Safety, 
FRA; the Associate Administrator's delegate (including a qualified State 
inspector acting under part 212 of this chapter); the Chief Counsel, 
FRA; or the Chief Counsel's delegate.
    Highway-rail grade crossing means a location where a public highway, 
road, street, or private roadway, including associated sidewalks and 
pathways, crosses one or more railroad tracks at grade.
    Joint operations means rail operations conducted on a track used 
jointly or in common by two or more railroads subject to this part or 
operation of a train, locomotive, car, or other on-track equipment by 
one railroad over the track of another railroad.
    Medical treatment includes any medical care or treatment beyond 
``first aid'' regardless of who provides such treatment. Medical 
treatment does not include diagnostic procedures, such as X-rays and 
drawing blood samples. Medical treatment also does not include 
preventive emotional trauma counseling provided by the railroad's 
employee counseling and assistance officer unless the participating 
worker has been diagnosed as having a mental disorder that was 
significantly caused or aggravated by an accident/incident and this 
condition requires a regimen of treatment to correct.
    Non-train incident means an event that results in a reportable 
casualty, but does not involve the movement of on-track equipment nor 
cause reportable damage above the threshold established for train 
accidents.
    Occupational illness means any abnormal condition or disorder, of 
any person who falls under the definition for the classifications of 
Worker on Duty--Employee, Worker on Duty--Contractor, or Worker on 
Duty--Volunteer, other than one resulting from injury, caused by 
environmental factors associated with the person's railroad employment, 
including, but not limited to, acute or chronic illnesses or diseases 
that may be caused by inhalation, absorption, ingestion, or direct 
contact.
    Person includes all categories of entities covered under 1 U.S.C. 1, 
including, but not limited to, a railroad; any manager, supervisor, 
official, or other employee or agent of a railroad; any owner, 
manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, or 
facilities; any passenger; any trespasser or nontrespasser; any 
independent contractor providing goods or services to a railroad; any 
volunteer providing goods or services to a railroad; and any employee of 
such owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor.
    Qualified health care professional is a health care professional 
operating within the scope of his or her license, registration, or 
certification. For example, an otolaryngologist is qualified to diagnose 
a case of noise-induced hearing loss and identify potential causal 
factors, but may not be qualified to diagnose a case of repetitive 
motion injuries.
    Railroad means a person providing railroad transportation.
    Railroad transportation means any form of non-highway ground 
transportation that run on rails or electro-magnetic guideways,

Sec. 225.12  Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Reports alleging employee human factor as cause; Employee Human Factor Attachment; notice to employee; employee 
          supplement.

    (a) Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report alleging employee human 
factor as cause; completion of Employee Human Factor Attachment. If, in 
reporting a rail equipment accident/incident to FRA, a railroad cites an 
employee human factor as the primary cause or a contributing cause of 
the accident; then the railroad that cited such employee human factor 
must complete, in accordance with instructions on the form and in the 
current ``FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports,'' an 
Employee Human Factor Attachment form on the accident. For purposes of 
this section, ``employee'' is defined as a Worker on Duty--Employee, 
Employee not on Duty, Worker on Duty--Contractor, or Worker on Duty--
Volunteer.
    (b) Notice to identified implicated employees. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, for each employee whose act, 
omission, or physical condition was alleged by the railroad as the 
employee human factor that was the primary cause or a contributing cause 
of a rail equipment accident/incident and whose name was listed in the 
Employee Human Factor Attachment for the accident and for each such 
railroad employee of whose identity the railroad has actual knowledge, 
the alleging railroad shall--
    (1) Complete part I, ``Notice to Railroad Employee Involved in Rail 
Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Employee Human Factor,'' of 
Form FRA F 6180.78 with information regarding the accident, in 
accordance with instructions on the form and in the current ``FRA Guide 
for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports''; and
    (2) Hand deliver or send by first class mail (postage prepaid) to 
that employee, within 45 days after the end of the month in which the 
rail equipment accident/incident occurred--
    (i) A copy of Form FRA F 6180.78, ``Notice to Railroad Employee 
Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Employee 
Human Factor; Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident 
Report,'' with part I completed as to the applicable employee and 
accident;
    (ii) A copy of the railroad's Rail Equipment Accident/Incident 
Report and Employee Human Factor Attachment on the rail equipment 
accident/incident involved; and
    (iii) If the accident was also reportable as a highway-rail grade 
crossing accident/incident, a copy of the railroad's Highway-Rail Grade 
Crossing Accident/Incident Report on that accident.
    (c) Joint operations. If a reporting railroad makes allegations 
under paragraph (a) of this section concerning the employee of another 
railroad, the employing railroad must promptly provide the name, job 
title, address, and medical status of any employee reasonably identified 
by the alleging railroad, if requested by the alleging railroad.
    (d) Late identification. Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and 
(f) of this section, if a railroad is initially unable to identify a 
particular railroad employee whose act, omission, or physical condition 
was cited by the railroad as a primary or contributing cause of the

[[Page 233]]

accident, but subsequently makes such identification, the railroad shall 
submit a revised Employee Human Factor Attachment to FRA immediately, 
and shall submit the Notice described in paragraph (b) of this section 
to that employee within 15 days of when the revised report is to be 
submitted.
    (e) Deferred notification on medical grounds. The reporting railroad 
has reasonable discretion to defer notification of implicated employees 
on medical grounds.
    (f) Implicated employees who have died by the time that the Notice 
is ready to be sent. (1) If an implicated employee has died as a result 
of the accident, a Notice under paragraph (b) addressed to that employee 
must not be sent to any person.
    (2) If an implicated employee has died of whatever causes by the 
time that the Notice is ready to be sent, no Notice addressed to that 
employee is required.
    (g) Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report 
(Supplements or Employee Supplements). (1) Employee Statements 
Supplementing Railroad Accident Reports are voluntary, not mandatory; 
nonsubmission of a Supplement does not imply that the employee admits or 
endorses the railroad's conclusions as to cause or any other 
allegations.
    (2) Although a Supplement is completely optional and not required, 
if an employee wishes to submit a Supplement and assure that, after 
receipt, it will be properly placed by FRA in a file with the railroad's 
Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report and that it will be required to 
be reviewed by the railroad that issued the Notice, the Supplement must 
be made on part II of Form FRA F 6180.78 (entitled ``Notice to Railroad 
Employee Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to 
Employee Human Factor; Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad 
Accident Report''), following the instructions printed on the form. 
These instructions require that, within 35 days of the date that the 
Notice was hand delivered or sent by first class mail (postage prepaid) 
to the employee (except for good cause shown), the original of the 
Supplement be filed with FRA and a copy be hand delivered or sent by 
first class mail (postage prepaid) to the railroad that issued the 
Notice so that the railroad will have an opportunity to reassess its 
reports to FRA concerning the accident.
    (3) Information that the employee wishes to withhold from the 
railroad must not be included in this Supplement. If an employee wishes 
to provide confidential information to FRA, the employee should not use 
the Supplement form (part II of Form FRA F 6180.78), but rather provide 
such confidential information by other means, such as a letter to the 
employee's collective bargaining representative, or to the Federal 
Railroad Administration, Office of Safety Assurance and Compliance, RRS-
11, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. The letter should 
include the name of the railroad making the allegations, the date and 
place of the accident, and the rail equipment accident/incident number.
    (h) Willful false statements; penalties. If an employee chooses to 
submit a Supplement to FRA, all of the employee's assertions in the 
Supplement must be true and correct to the best of the employee's 
knowledge and belief.
    (1) Under 49 U.S.C. 21301, 21302, and 21304, any person who 
willfully files a false Supplement with FRA is subject to a civil 
penalty. See appendix A to this part.
    (2) Any person who knowingly and willfully files a false Supplement 
is subject to a $5,000 fine, or up to two years'' imprisonment, or both, 
under 49 U.S.C. 21311.

Sec. 225.13   Late reports.

    Whenever a railroad discovers that a report of an accident/incident, 
through mistake or otherwise, has been improperly omitted from or 
improperly reported on its regular monthly accident/incident report, a 
report covering this accident/incident together with a letter of 
explanation must be submitted immediately. Whenever a railroad receives 
a partially or fully completed Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad 
Accident Report (part II of Form FRA F 6180.78), in response to a Notice 
to Railroad Employee (part I of Form FRA F 6180.78) issued by the 
railroad and mailed or hand delivered to the employee, the railroad must 
promptly review that Supplement; based on that review, reassess the 
accuracy and validity of the railroad's Rail Equipment Accident/Incident 
Report and of any other reports and records required by this part 
concerning the same accident, including the Employee Human Factor 
Attachment; make all justified revisions to each of those reports and 
records; submit any amended reports to FRA; and submit a copy of any 
amended Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report, Employee Human Factor 
Attachment, and Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report on 
the accident to the employee. A second notice under Sec. 225.12 is not 
required for the employee. If an employee who was never sent a notice 
under Sec. 225.12 for that accident is implicated in the revised 
Employee Human Factor Attachment, the railroad must follow the 
procedures of Sec. 225.12(d).

<R05>
Sec. 225.15   Accidents/incidents not to be reported.

    A railroad need not report:
    (a) Casualties which occur at highway-rail grade crossings that do 
not involve the presence or operation of on-track equipment, or the 
presence of railroad employees then engaged in the operation of a 
railroad;
    (b) Casualties in or about living quarters not arising from the 
operation of a railroad;
    (c) Suicides as determined by a coroner or other public authority; 
or
    (d) Attempted suicides.

<R05>
Sec. 225.17   Doubtful cases; alcohol or drug involvement.

    (a) The reporting officer of a railroad will ordinarily determine 
the reportability or nonreportability of an accident/incident after 
examining all evidence available. The FRA, however, cannot delegate 
authority to decide matters of judgment when facts are in dispute. In 
all such cases the decision shall be that of the FRA.
    (b) Even though there may be no witness to an accident/incident, if 
there is evidence indicating that a reportable accident/incident may 
have occurred, a

[[Page 235]]

report of that accident/incident must be made.
    (c) All accidents/incidents reported as ``claimed but not admitted 
by the railroad'' are given special examination by the FRA, and further 
inquiry may be ordered. Accidents/incidents accepted as reportable are 
tabulated and included in the various statistical statements issued by 
the FRA. The denial of any knowledge or refusal to admit responsibility 
by the railroad does not exclude those accidents/incidents from monthly 
and annual figures. Facts stated by a railroad that tend to refute the 
claim of an injured person are given consideration, and when the facts 
seem sufficient to support the railroad's position, the case is not 
allocated to the reporting railroad.
    (d)(1) In preparing a Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report under 
this part, the railroad shall make such specific inquiry as may be 
reasonable under the circumstances into the possible involvement of 
alcohol or drug use or impairment in such accident or incident. If the 
railroad comes into possession of any information whatsoever, whether or 
not confirmed, concerning alleged alcohol or drug use or impairment by 
an employee who was involved in, or arguably could be said to have been 
involved in, the accident/incident, the railroad shall report such 
alleged use or impairment as provided in the current FRA Guide for 
Preparing Accident/Incident Reports. If the railroad is in possession of 
such information but does not believe that alcohol or drug impairment 
was the primary or contributing cause of the accident/incident, then the 
railroad shall include in the narrative statement of such report a brief 
explanation of the basis of such determination.
    (2) For any train accident within the requirement for post-accident 
testing under Sec. 219.201 of this title, the railroad shall append to 
the Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report any report required by 
Sec. 219.209(b) (pertaining to failure to obtain samples for post-
accident toxicological testing).
    (3) For any train or non-train incident, the railroad shall provide 
any available information concerning the possible involvement of alcohol 
or drug use or impairment in such accident or incident.
    (4) In providing information required by this paragraph, a railroad 
shall not disclose any information concerning use of controlled 
substances determined by the railroad's Medical Review Officer to have 
been consistent with 49 CFR 219.103.

<R05>
Sec. 225.19   Primary groups of accidents/incidents.

    (a) For reporting purposes reportable railroad accidents/incidents 
are divided into three groups:

    Group I--Highway-Rail Grade Crossing;
    Group II--Rail Equipment;
    Group III--Death, Injury and Occupational Illness.

    (b) Group I--Rail-highway grade crossing. Each highway-rail grade 
crossing accident/incident must be reported to the FRA on Form FRA F 
6180.57, regardless of the extent of damages or whether a casualty 
occurred. In addition, whenever a highway-rail grade crossing accident/
incident results in damages greater than the current reporting threshold 
to railroad on-track equipment, signals, track, track structures, or 
roadbed, that accident/incident shall be reported to the FRA on Form FRA 
F 6180.54. For reporting purposes, damages include labor costs and all 
other costs to repair or replace in kind damaged on-track equipment, 
signals, track, track structures, or roadbed, but do not include the 
cost of clearing a wreck.
    (c) Group II--Rail Equipment. Rail equipment accidents/incidents are 
collisions, derailments, fires, explosions, acts of God, or other events 
involving the operation of railroad on-track equipment, signals, track, 
track equipment (standing or moving) that result in damages greater than 
the current reporting threshold to railroad on-track equipment, signals, 
tracks, track structures, or roadbed, including labor costs and the 
costs for acquiring new equipment and material. Each rail equipment 
accident/incident must be reported to the FRA on Form FRA F 6180.54. If 
the property of more than

[[Page 236]]

one railroad is involved in an accident/incident, the reporting 
threshold is calculated by including the damages suffered by all of the 
railroads involved. See Sec. 225.23, Joint Operations. The reporting 
threshold will be reviewed periodically and will be adjusted every year.
    (d) Group III--Death, injury, or occupational illness. Each event 
arising from the operation of a railroad shall be reported on Form FRA F 
6180.55a if it results in:

Sec. 225.31  Investigations.

    (a) It is the policy of the FRA to investigate rail transportation 
accidents/incidents which result in the death of a railroad employee or 
the injury of five or more persons. Other accidents/incidents are 
investigated when it appears that an investigation would substantially 
serve to promote railroad safety.
    (b) FRA representatives are authorized to investigate accidents/
incidents and have been issued credentials authorizing them to inspect 
railroad records and properties. They are authorized to obtain all 
relevant information concerning accidents/incidents under investigation, 
to make inquiries of persons having knowledge of the facts, conduct 
interviews and inquiries, and attend as an observer, hearings conducted 
by railroads. When necessary to carry out an investigation, the FRA may 
authorize the issuance of subpoenas to require the production of records 
and the giving of testimony.
    (c) Whenever necessary, the FRA will schedule a public hearing 
before an authorized hearing officer, in which event testimony will be 
taken under oath, a record made, and opportunity provided to question 
witnesses.
    (d) When necessary in the conduct of an investigation, the Federal 
Railroad Administrator may require autopsies and other tests of the 
remains of railroad employees who die as a result of an accident/
incident.
    (e) Information obtained through FRA accident investigations may be 
published in public reports or used for other purposes FRA deems to be 
appropriate.
    (f) Section 20903 of title 49 of the United States Code provides 
that no part of a report of an accident investigation under section 
20902 of title 49 of the United States Code may be admitted as evidence 
or used for any purpose in any suit or action for damages growing out of 
any matter mentioned in the accident investigation report.

and shall include, at a minimum, each of the following ten components:
    (1) A policy statement declaring the railroad's commitment to 
complete and accurate reporting of all accidents, incidents, injuries, 
and occupational illnesses arising from the operation of the railroad, 
to full compliance with the letter and spirit of FRA's accident 
reporting regulations, and to the principle, in absolute terms, that 
harassment or intimidation of any person that is calculated to 
discourage or prevent such person from receiving proper medical 
treatment or from reporting such accident, incident, injury or illness 
will not be permitted or tolerated and will result in some stated 
disciplinary action against any employee, supervisor, manager, or 
officer of the railroad committing such harassment or intimidation.
    (2) The dissemination of the policy statement; complaint procedures. 
Each

[[Page 244]]

railroad shall provide to all employees, supervisory personnel, and

about the policy stated in paragraph (a)(1) being violated, and to 
impose the appropriate prescribed disciplinary actions on each employee, 
supervisor, manager, or officer of the railroad found to have violated 
the policy. These procedures shall be disclosed to railroad employees, 
supervisors, managers, and officers. The railroad shall provide 
``whistle blower'' protection to any person subject to this policy, and 
such policy shall be disclosed to all railroad employees, supervisors 
and management.
    (3) Copies of internal forms and/or a description of the internal 
computer reporting system used for the collection and internal recording 
of accident and incident information.
    (4) A description of the internal procedures used by the railroad 
for the processing of forms and/or computerized data regarding accident 
and incident information.

accident and incident information collected, and reports prepared by, 
the railroad's safety, claims, medical and/or other departments engaged 
in collecting and reporting accident and incident information.
    (6) A description of the internal procedures used for collecting 
cost data and compiling costs with respect to accident and incident 
information.
    (7) A description of applicable internal procedures for ensuring 
adequate communication between the railroad department responsible for 
submitting accident and incident reports to FRA and any other department 
within the railroad responsible for collecting, receiving, processing 
and reporting accidents and incidents.
    (8) A statement of applicable procedures providing for the updating 
of accident and incident information prior to reporting to FRA and a 
statement of applicable procedures providing for the amendment of 
accident and incident information as specified in the ``FRA Guide for 
Preparing Accidents/Incidents Reports.''
    (9) A statement that specifies the name and title of the railroad 
officer responsible for auditing the performance of the reporting 
function; a statement of the frequency (not less than once per calendar 
year) with which audits are conducted; and identification of the site 
where the most recent audit report may be found for inspection and 
photocopying.
    (10)(i) A brief description of the railroad organization, including 
identification of:
    (A) All components that regularly come into possession of 
information pertinent to the preparation of reports under this part 
(e.g., medical, claims, and legal departments; operating, mechanical, 
and track and structures departments; payroll, accounting, and personnel 
departments);
    (B) The title of each railroad reporting officer;
    (C) The title of each manager of such components, by component; and
    (D) All officers to whom managers of such components are

Sec. 225.35  Access to records and reports.

    Each railroad subject to this part shall have at least one location, 
and shall identify each location, where any representative of the 
Federal Railroad Administration or of a State agency participating in 
investigative and surveillance activities under Part 212 of this chapter 
or any other authorized representative, has centralized access to a copy 
of any record and report (including relevant claims and medical records) 
required under this part, for examination and photocopying in a 
reasonable manner during normal business hours. Such representatives 
shall display proper credentials when requested. Each railroad shall 
identify the locations where a copy of any record and report required 
under this part is accessible for inspection and photocopying by 
maintaining a list of

[[Page 245]]

such establishment locations at the office where the railroad's 
reporting officer conducts his or her official business. A copy of any 
record and report required under this part shall be accessible within 
four business hours after the request. FRA will not assess a monetary 
penalty against the railroad for its failure to provide the requested 
documentation when circumstances outside the railroad's control preclude 
it from fulfilling the four-business-hour time limit and the railroad 
has made a reasonable effort to correct the problem.

part 225 was removed; appendix B to part 225 was redesignated as 
appendix A; the new appendix A was revised, effective Jan. 1, 1997. For 
the convenience of the user, the superseded text is set forth as 
follows:

  Appendix A to Part 225--Procedure for Determining Reporting Threshold

    1. Wage figures used for track direct labor rates will be based on 
the ``[a]verage straight time rate'' shown in the ``Recapitulation by 
Group of Employees,'' for Group 300 Maintenance of Way Structures 
Employees. This information appears in the most recent annual edition 
(Year 1989) of ``Statement A-300 of the Interstate Commerce Commission, 
Bureau of Accounts, Wage Statistics of Class I Railroads in the United 
States.''
    2. Wage figures used for mechanical direct labor rates will be based 
on the ``[a]verage straight time rate'' shown in the ``Recapitulation by 
Group of Employees,'' for Group 400 Maintenance of Equipment and Stores 
Employees. This information appears in the most recent annual edition 
(Year 1989) of ``Statement A-300 of the Interstate Commerce Commission, 
Bureau of Accounts, Wage Statistics of Class I Railroads in the United 
States.''
    3. Fringe benefit surcharges will be added to the average straight 
time rates for mechanical and track employees based on the Railroad Cost 
Index data developed for the Interstate Commerce Commission under the 
provisions of 49 CFR part 1102. This information was published in 
summarized form in the September 24, 1984 edition of the Federal 
Register  (49 FR 37481).
    4. To calculate the index number for mechanical labor, divide the 
present (1990) mechanical wage rate of $23.56 by the previous (1988) 
mechanical wage rate of $21.82. The result is a mechanical labor index 
number of 1.08 for 1990.
    5. The track labor index number is calculated by dividing the 
present (1990) track wage rate of $22.74 by the previous (1988) track 
wage rate of $21.12. The result is a track labor index number of 1.08 
for 1990.
    6. Calculation of the labor index number is as follows: [(track 
labor index number) 1.08  x  .20] + [(mechanical labor index number) 
1.08  x  .80] = labor index number of 1.08.
    7. The mechanical material index number is calculated by first 
totaling the present (1990) cost of the following mechanical materials:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The mechanical material index number is determined by dividing the 
present (1990) total cost for these mechanical materials ($67,669) by 
the previous (1988) total cost for mechanical materials ($59,773). The 
result is 1.13.
    8. The track material index number is calculated by first totaling 
the present (1990) cost of the following track materials:

    Total track material....  ....................    353,708    385,508
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The track material index number is determined by dividing the 
present (1990) total cost for these track materials ($385,508) by the 
previous (1988) total cost for track materials ($353,708). The result is 
1.09.
    9. Calculation of the material index number is as follows: [(track 
material index number) 1.09  x  .20] + [(mechanical material index 
number) 1.13  x  .80] = material index number of 1.12.
    10. Calculation of the threshold index number is as follows: [(labor 
index number) 1.08  x  .40] + [(material index number) 1.12  x  .60] = 
threshold index number of 1.10.
    11. In order to calculate the new reporting threshold, multiply the 
existing reporting threshold $5,700 by the threshold index number of 
1.10. The result is $6,270. This result, when rounded to the nearest 
$100.00 is the new accident/incident reporting threshold figure of 
$6,300.

          Subpart C--Construction of Employee Sleeping Quarters

    Source: 43 FR 31012, July 19, 1978, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 228.101  Distance requirement; definitions.

    (a) The Hours of Service Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 61-64b), makes 
it unlawful for any common carrier engaged in interstate or foreign 
commerce by railroad to begin, on or after July 8, 1976, the 
construction or reconstruction of sleeping quarters for employees who 
perform duties covered by the act ``within or in the immediate vicinity 
(as determined in accordance with rules prescribed by the Secretary of 
Transportation) of any area where railroad switching or humping 
operations are performed.'' 45 U.S.C. 62(a)(4). This subpart sets forth 
(1) a general definition of ``immediate vicinity'' (Sec. 228.101(b)), 
(2) procedures under which a carrier may request a determination by the 
Federal Railroad Administration that a particular proposed site is not 
within the ``immediate vicinity'' of railroad switching or humping 
operations (Secs. 228.103 and 228.105), and (3) the basic criteria 
utilized in evaluating proposed sites (Sec. 228.107).
    (b) Except as determined in accordance with the provisions of this 
subpart. ``The immediate vicinity'' shall mean the area within one-half 
mile (2,640 feet) (804 meters) of switching or humping operations as 
measured from the nearest rail of the nearest trackage where switching 
or humping operations are performed to the point on the site where the 
carrier proposes to construct or reconstruct the exterior wall of the 
structure, or portion of such wall, which is closest to such operations.
    (c) As used in this subpart--
    (1) Construction shall refer to the--
     (i) Creation of a new facility;
    (ii) Expansion of an existing facility;
    (iii) Placement of a mobile or modular facility; or
    (iv) Acquisition and use of an existing building.
    (2) Reconstruction shall refer to the--
    (i) Replacement of an existing facility with a new facility on the 
same site; or

[[Page 252]]

    (ii) Rehabilitation or improvement of an existing facility (normal 
periodic maintenance excepted) involving the expenditure of an amount 
representing more than 50 percent of the cost of replacing such facility 
on the same site at the time the work of rehabilitation or improvement 
began, the replacement cost to be estimated on the basis of contemporary 
construction methods and materials.
    (3) Switching or humping operations includes the classification of 
placarded railroad cars according to commodity or destination, 
assembling of placarded cars for train movements, changing the position 
of placarded cars for purposes of loading, unloading, or weighing, and 
the placing of placarded cars for repair. However, the term does not 
include the moving of rail equipment in connection with work service, 
the moving of a train or part of a train within yard limits by a road 
locomotive or placing locomotives or cars in a train or removing them 
from a train by a road locomotive while en route to the train's 
destination. The term does include operations within this definition 
which are conducted by any railroad; it is not limited to the operations 
of the carrier contemplating construction or reconstruction of railroad 
employee sleeping quarters.
    (4) Placarded car shall mean a railroad car required to be placarded 
by the Department of Transportation hazardous materials regulations (49 
CFR 172.504).
    (5) The term L<INF>eq (8) shall mean the equivalent steady state 
sound level which in 8 hours would contain the same acoustic energy as 
the time-varying sound level during the same time period.


<R05>
Sec. 228.103  Approval procedure: construction within one-half mile (2,640 feet) (804 meters).

    (a) A common carrier that has developed plans for the construction 
or reconstruction of sleeping quarters subject to this subpart and which 
is considering a site less than one-half mile (2,640 feet) (804 meters) 
from any area where switching or humping operations are performed, 
measured from the nearest rail of the nearest trackage utilized on a 
regular or intermittent basis for switching or humping operations to the 
point on the site where the carrier proposes to construct or reconstruct 
the exterior wall of the structure, or portion of such wall, which is 
closest to such operations, must obtain the approval of the Federal 
Railroad Administration before commencing construction or reconstruction 
on that site. Approval may be requested by filing a petition conforming 
to the requirements of this subpart.
    (b) A carrier is deemed to have conducted switching or humping 
operations on particular trackage within the meaning of this subpart if 
placarded cars are subjected to the operations described in 
Sec. 228.101(c)(3) within the 365-day period immediately preceding the 
date construction or reconstruction is commenced or if such operations 
are to be permitted on such trackage after such date. If the carrier 
does not have reliable records concerning the traffic handled on the 
trackage within the specified period, it shall be presumed that 
switching of placarded cars is conducted at the location and 
construction or reconstruction of sleeping quarters within one-half mile 
shall be subject to the approval procedures of this subpart.
    (c) A petition shall be filed in triplicate with the Secretary, 
Railroad Safety Board, Federal Railroad Administration, Washington, DC 
20590 and shall contain the following:
    (1) A brief description of the type of construction planned, 
including materials to be employed, means of egress from the quarters, 
and actual and projected exterior noise levels and projected interior 
noise levels;
    (2) The number of employees expected to utilize the quarters at full 
capacity;
    (3) A brief description of the site, including:
    (i) Distance from trackage where switching or humping operations are 
performed, specifying distances from particular functions such as 
classification, repair, assembling of trains from large groups of cars, 
etc. cetera;
    (ii) Topography within a general area consisting of the site and all 
of the rail facilities close to the site;

[[Page 253]]

    (iii) Location of other physical improvements situated between the 
site and areas where railroad operations are conducted;
    (4) A blueprint or other drawing showing the relationship of the 
site to trackage and other planned and existing facilities;
    (5) The proposed or estimated date for commencement of construction;
    (6) A description of the average number and variety of rail 
operations in the areas within one-half mile (2,640 feet) (804 meters) 
of the site (e.g., number of cars classified in 24-hour period; number 
of train movements);
    (7) An estimate of the average daily number of placarded rail cars 
transporting hazardous materials through the railroad facility (where 
practicable, based on a 365-day period sample, that period not having 
ended more than 120 days prior to the date of filing the petition), 
specifying the--
    (i) Number of such cars transporting class A explosives and poison 
gases; and
    (ii) Number of DOT Specification 112A and 114A tank cars 
transporting flammable gas subject to FRA emergency order No. 5;
    (8) A statement certified by a corporate officer of the carrier 
possessing authority over the subject matter explaining any plans of 
that carrier for utilization of existing trackage, or for the 
construction of new trackage, which may impact on the location of 
switching or humping operations within one-half mile of the proposed 
site (if there are no plans, the carrier official must so certify); and
    (9) Any further information which is necessary for evaluation of the 
site.
    (d) A petition filed under this section must contain a statement 
that the petition has been served on the recognized representatives of 
the railroad employees who will be utilizing the proposed sleeping 
quarters, together with a list of the employee representatives served.


<R05>
Sec. 228.105  Additional requirements; construction within one-third mile (1,760 feet) (536 meters) of certain switching.

    (a) In addition to providing the information specified by 
Sec. 228.103, a carrier seeking approval of a site located within one-
third mile (1,760 feet) (536 meters) of any area where railroad 
switching or humping operations are performed involving any cars 
required to be placarded ``EXPLOSIVES A'' or ``POISON GAS'' or any DOT 
Specification 112A or 114A tank cars transporting flammable gas subject 
to FRA emergency order No. 5 shall establish by a supplementary 
statement certified by a corporate officer possessing authority over the 
subject matter that--
    (1) No feasible alternate site located at or beyond one-third mile 
from switching or humping operations is either presently available to 
the railroad or is obtainable within 3 miles (15,840 feet) (4,827 
meters) of the reporting point for the employees who are to be housed in 
the sleeping quarters;
    (2) Natural or other barriers exist or will be created prior to 
occupancy of the proposed facility between the proposed site and any 
areas in which switching or humping operations are performed which will 
be adequate to shield the facility from the direct and severe effects of 
a hazardous materials accident/incident arising in an area of switching 
or humping operations;
    (3) The topography of the property is such as most likely to cause 
any hazardous materials unintentionally released during switching or 
humping to flow away from the proposed site; and
    (4) Precautions for ensuring employee safety from toxic gases or 
explosions such as employee training and evacuation plans, availability 
of appropriate respiratory protection, and measures for fire protection, 
have been considered.
    (b) In the absence of reliable records concerning traffic handled on 
trackage within the one-third mile area, it shall be presumed that the 
types of cars enumerated in paragraph (a) of this section are switched 
on that trackage; and the additional requirements of this section shall 
be met by the petitioning carrier, unless the carrier establishes that 
the switching of the enumerated cars will be effectively barred from the 
trackage if the petition is approved.

[[Page 254]]


<R05>
Sec. 228.107  Action on petition.

    (a) Each petition for approval filed under Sec. 228.103 is referred 
to the Railroad Safety Board for action in accordance with the 
provisions of part 211, title 49, CFR, concerning the processing of 
requests for special approvals.
    (b) In considering a petition for approval filed under this subpart, 
the Railroad Safety Board evaluates the material factors bearing on--
    (1) The safety of employees utilizing the proposed facility in the 
event of a hazardous materials accident/incident and in light of other 
relevant safety factors; and
    (2) Interior noise levels in the facility.
    (c) The Railroad Safety Board will not approve an application 
submitted under this subpart if it appears from the available 
information that the proposed sleeping quarters will be so situated and 
constructed as to permit interior noise levels due to noise under the 
control of the railroad to exceed an L<INF>eq(8) value of 55dB(A). If 
individual air conditioning and heating systems are to be utilized, 
projections may relate to noise levels with such units turned off.
    (d) Approval of a petition filed under this subpart may be withdrawn 
or modified at any time if it is ascertained, after opportunity for a 
hearing, that any representation of fact or intent made by a carrier in 
materials submitted in support of a petition was not accurate or 
truthful at the time such representation was made.

   Appendix A to Part 228--Requirements of the Hours of Service Act: 
              Statement of Agency Policy and Interpretation

    First enacted in 1907, the Hours of Service Act was substantially 
revised in 1969 by Public Law 91-169. Further amendments were enacted as 
part of the Federal Railroad Safety Authorization Act of 1976, Public 
Law 94-348 and by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988, Public Law 
100-342. The purpose of the law is ``to promote the safety of employees 
and travelers upon railroads by limiting the hours of service of 
employees * * *.'' This appendix is designed to explain the effect of 
the law in commonly-encountered situations.
    The Act governs the maximum work hours of employees engaged in one 
or more of the basic categories of covered service treated below. If an 
individual performs more than one kind of covered service during a tour 
of duty, then the most restrictive of the applicable limitations 
control.
    The act applies to any railroad, as that term is defined in 45 
U.S.C. 431(e). It governs the carrier's operations over its own railroad 
and all lines of road which it uses.

                        train and engine service

    Covered Service. Train or engine service refers to the actual 
assembling or operation of trains. Employees who perform this type of 
service commonly include locomotive engineers, firemen, conductors, 
trainmen, switchmen, switchtenders (unless their duties come under the 
provisions of section 3) and hostlers. With the passage of the 1976 
amendments, both inside and outside hostlers are considered to be 
connected with the movement of trains. Previously, only outside hostlers 
were covered. Any other employee who is actually engaged in or connected 
with the movement of any train is also covered, regardless of his job 
title.
    Limitations on Hours. The Act establishes two limitations on hours 
of service. First, no employee engaged in train or engine service may be 
required or permitted to work in excess of twelve consecutive hours. 
After working a full twelve consecutive hours, an employee must be given 
at least ten consecutive hours off duty before being permitted to return 
to work.
    Second, no employee engaged in train or engine service may be 
required or permitted to continue on duty or go on duty unless he has 
had at least eight consecutive hours off duty within the preceding 
twenty-four hours. This latter limitation, when read in conjunction with 
the requirements with respect to computation of duty time (discussed 
below) results in several conclusions:
    (1) When an employee's work tour is broken or interrupted by a valid 
period of interim release (4 hours or more at a designated terminal), he 
may return to duty for the balance of the total 12-hour work tour during 
a 24-hour period.
    (2) After completing the 12 hours of broken duty, or at the end of 
the 24-hour period, whichever occurs first, the employee may not be 
required or permitted to continue on duty or to go on duty until he has 
had at least 8 consecutive hours off duty.
    (3) The 24-hour period referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 above shall 
begin upon the commencement of a work tour by the employee immediately 
after his having received a statutory off-duty period of 8 or 10 hours 
as appropriate.
    Duty time and effective periods of release. On-duty time commences 
when an employee reports at the time and place specified by the railroad 
and terminates when the employee is finally released of all 
responsibilities.

[[Page 255]]

(Time spent in deadhead transportation to a duty assignment is also 
counted as time on duty. See discussion below.) Any period available for 
rest that is of four or more hours and is at a designated terminal is 
off-duty time. All other periods available for rest must be counted as 
time on duty under the law, regardless of their duration.
    The term ``designated terminal'' means a terminal (1) which is 
designated in or under a collective bargaining agreement as the ``home'' 
or ``away-from-home'' terminal for a particular crew assignment and (2) 
which has suitable facilities for food and lodging. Carrier and union 
representatives may agree to establish additional designated terminals 
having such facilities as points of effective release under the Act. 
Agreements to designate additional terminals for purposes of release 
under the Act should be reduced to writing and should make reference to 
the particular assignments affected and to the Hours of Service Act. The 
following are common situations illustrating the designated terminal 
concept:
    (1) A freight or passenger road crew operates a train from home 
terminal ``A'' to away-from-home terminal ``B'' (or the reverse). 
Terminals ``A'' and ``B'' would normally be the designated terminals for 
this specific crew assignment. However, carrier and employee 
representatives may agree to designate additional terminals having 
suitable facilities for food and lodging as appropriate points of 
release under the Hours of Service Act.
    (2) A road crew operates a train in turn-around service from home 
terminal ``A'' to turn-around point ``B'' and back to ``A''. Terminal 
``A'' is the only designated terminal for this specific crew assignment, 
unless carrier and employee representatives have agreed to designate 
additional terminals having suitable facilities for food and lodging.
    (3) A crew is assigned to operate a maintenance-of-way work train 
from home terminal ``A'', work on line of road and tie up for rest along 
the line of road at point ``B''. Home terminal ``A'' and tie-up point 
``B'' both qualify as designated terminals for this specific work train 
crew assignment. Of course, suitable facilities for food and lodging 
must be available at tie-up point ``B''.
    Deadheading. Under the Act time spent in deadhead transportation 
receives special treatment. Time spent in deadhead transportation to a 
duty assignment by a train or engine service employee is considered on-
duty time. Time spent in deadhead transportation from the final duty 
assignment of the work tour to the point of final release is not 
computed as either time on duty or time off duty. Thus, the period of 
deadhead transportation to point of final release may not be included in 
the required 8- or 10-hour off-duty period. Time spent in deadhead 
transportation to a duty assignment is calculated from the time the 
employee reports for deadhead until he reaches his duty assignment.
    All time spent awaiting the arrival of a deadhead vehicle for 
transportation from the final duty assignment of the work tour to the 
point of final release is considered limbo time, i.e., neither time on 
duty nor time off duty, provided that the employee is given no specific 
responsibilities to perform during this time. However, if an employee is 
required to perform service of any kind during that period (e.g., 
protecting the train against vandalism, observing passing trains for any 
defects or unsafe conditions, flagging, shutting down locomotives, 
checking fluid levels, or communicating train consist information via 
radio), he or she will be considered as on duty until all such service 
is completed. Of course, where a railroad carrier's operating rules 
clearly relieve the employee of all duties during the waiting period and 
no duties are specifically assigned, the waiting time is not computed as 
either time on duty or time off duty.
    Transit time from the employee's residence to his regular reporting 
point is not considered deadhead time.
    If an employee utilizes personal automobile transportation to a 
point of duty assignment other than the regular reporting point in lieu 
of deadhead transportation provided by the carrier, such actual travel 
time is considered as deadheading time. However, if the actual travel 
time from his home to the point of duty assignment exceeds a reasonable 
travel time from the regular reporting point to the point of duty 
assignment, then only the latter period is counted. Of course, actual 
travel time must be reasonable and must not include diversions for 
personal reasons.
    Example: Employee A receives an assignment from an ``extra board'' 
located at his home terminal to protect a job one hour's drive from the 
home terminal. In lieu of transporting the employee by carrier 
conveyance, the railroad pays the employee a fixed amount to provide his 
own transportation to and from the outlying point. The employee is 
permitted to go directly from his home to the outlying point, a drive 
which takes 40 minutes. The normal driving time between his regular 
reporting point at his home terminal and the outlying point is 60 
minutes. The actual driving time, 40 minutes is considered deadhead time 
and is counted as time on duty under the Act.
    Employee A performs local switching service at the outlying point. 
When the employee returns from the outlying point that evening, and 
receives an ``arbitrary'' payment for his making the return trip by 
private automobile, 40 minutes of his time in transportation home is 
considered deadheading to point of final release and is

[[Page 256]]

not counted as either time on duty or time off duty.
    Wreck and relief trains. Prior to the 1976 amendments, crews of 
wreck and relief trains were exempted entirely from the limitations on 
hours of service. Under present law that is no longer the case. The crew 
of a wreck or relief train may be permitted to be on duty for not to 
exceed 4 additional hours in any period of 24 consecutive hours whenever 
an actual emergency exists and the work of the crew is related to that 
emergency. Thus, a crew could work up to 16 hours, rather than 12. The 
Act specifies that an emergency ceases to exist for purposes of this 
provision when the track is cleared and the line is open for traffic. An 
``emergency'' for purposes of wreck or relief service may be a less 
extraordinary or catastrophic event than an ``unavoidable accident or 
Act of God'' under section 5(d) of the Act.
    Example: The crew of a wreck train is dispatched to clear the site 
of a derailment which has just occurred on a main line. The wreck crew 
re-rails or clears the last car and the maintenance of way department 
releases the track to the operating department 14 hours and 30 minutes 
into the duty tour. Since the line is not clear until the wreck train is 
itself out of the way, the crew may operate the wreck train to its 
terminal, provided this can be accomplished within the total of 16 hours 
on duty.
    Emergencies. The Act contains no general exception using the term 
``emergency'' with respect to train or engine service or related work. 
See ``casualties,'' etc., under ``General Provisions''.

                      communication of train orders

    Covered Service. The handling of orders governing the movement of 
trains is the second type of covered service. This provision of the Act 
applies to any operator, train dispatcher or other employee who by the 
use of the telegraph, telephone, radio, or any other electical or 
mechanical device dispatches, reports, transmits, receives, or delivers 
orders pertaining to or affecting train movements.
    The approach of the law is functional. Thus, though a yardmaster 
normally is not covered by this provision, a yardmaster or other 
employee who performs any of the specified service during a duty tour is 
subject to the limitations on service for that entire tour.
    Limitations on hours. No employee who performs covered service 
involving communication of train orders may be required or permitted to 
remain on duty for more than nine hours, whether consecutive or in the 
aggregate, in any 24-hour period in any office, tower, station or place 
where two or more shifts are employed. Where only one shift is employed, 
the employee is restricted to 12 hours consecutively or in the aggregate 
during any 24-hour period.
    The provision on emergencies, discussed below, may extend the 
permissible hours of employees performing this type of service.
    Shifts. The term ``shift'' is not defined by the Act, but the 
legislative history of the 1969 amendments indicates that it means a 
tour of duty constituting a day's work for one or more employee 
performing the same class of work at the same station who are scheduled 
to begin and end work at the same time. The following are examples of 
this principle:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Scheduled Hours                      Classification       
------------------------------------------------------------------------
7 a.m. to 3 p.m...........................  1 shift.                    
7 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. 1:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.        Do.                     
 (Schedule for one employee including one                               
 hour lunch period).                                                    
7 a.m. to 3 p.m. 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. (Two          Do.                     
 employees scheduled).                                                  
7 a.m. to 3 p.m. 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Two      2 shifts.                   
 employees scheduled).                                                  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Duty time and effective periods of release. If, after reporting to 
his place of duty, an employee is required to perform duties at other 
places during this same tour of duty, the time spent traveling between 
such places is considered as time on duty. Under the traditional 
administrative interpretation of section 3, other periods of 
transportation are viewed as personal commuting and, thus, off-duty 
time.
    A release period is considered off-duty time if it provides a 
meaningful period of relaxation and if the employee is free of all 
responsibilities to the carrier. One hour is the minimum acceptable 
release period for this type of covered service.
    Emergencies. The section of the Act dealing with dispatchers, 
operators, and others who transmit or receive train orders contains its 
own emergency provision. In case of emergency, an employee subject to 
the 9 or 12-hour limitation is permitted to work an additional four 
hours in any 24-hour period, but only for a maximum of three days in any 
period of seven consecutive days. However, even in an emergency 
situation the carrier must make reasonable efforts to relieve the 
employee.

                           General Provisions

                   (applicable to all covered service)

    Commingled Service. All duty time for a railroad even though not 
otherwise subject to the Act must be included when computing total on-
duty time of an individual who performs one or more of the type of 
service covered by the Act. This is known as the principle of 
``commingled service''.
    For example, if an employee performs duty for 8 hours as a trainman 
and then is used as a trackman (not covered by the law) in the

[[Page 257]]

same 24-hour period, total on-duty time is determined by adding the duty 
time as trackman to that as trainman. The law does not distinguish 
treatment of situations in which non-covered service follows, rather 
than precedes, covered service. The limitations on total hours apply on 
both cases. It should be remembered that attendance at required rules 
classes is duty time subject to the provisions on ``commingling''. 
Similarly, where a carrier compels attendance at a disciplinary 
proceeding, time spent in attendance is subject to the provisions on 
commingling.
    When an employee performs service covered by more than one 
restrictive provision, the most restrictive provision determines the 
total lawful on-duty time. Thus, when an employee performs duty in train 
or engine service and also as an operator, the provisions of the law 
applicable to operators apply to all on-duty and off-duty periods during 
such aggregate time. However, an employee subject to the 12 hour 
provision of section 2 of the law does not become subject to the 9 or 
12-hour provisions of section 3 merely because he receives, transmits or 
delivers orders pertaining to or affecting the movement of his train in 
the course of his duties as a trainman.
    Casualties, Unavoidable Accidents, Acts of God. Section 5(d) of the 
Act states the following: ``The provisions of this Act shall not apply 
in any case of casualty or unavoidable accident or the Act of God; nor 
where the delay was the result of a cause not known to the carrier or 
its officer or agent in charge of the employee at the time said employee 
left a terminal, and which could not have been foreseen.'' This passage 
is commonly referred to as the ``emergency provision''. Judicial 
construction of this sentence has limited the relief which it grants to 
situations which are truly unusual and exceptional. The courts have 
recognized that delays and operational difficulties are common in the 
industry and must be regarded as entirely foreseeable; otherwise, the 
Act will provide no protection whatsoever. Common operational 
difficulties which do not provide relief from the Act include, but are 
not limited to, broken draw bars, locomotive malfunctions, equipment 
failures, brake system failures, hot boxes, unexpected switching, 
doubling hills and meeting trains. Nor does the need to clear a main 
line or cut a crossing justify disregard of the limitations of the Act. 
Such contingencies must normally be anticipated and met within the 12 
hours. Even where an extraordinary event or combination of events occurs 
which, by itself, would be sufficient to permit excess service, the 
carrier must still employ due diligence to avoid or limit such excess 
service. The burden of proof rests with the carrier to establish that 
excess service could not have been avoided.
    Sleeping Quarters. Under the 1976 amendments to the Act it is 
unlawful for any common carrier to provide sleeping quarters for persons 
covered by the Hours of Service Act which do not afford such persons an 
opportunity for rest, free from interruptions caused by noise under the 
control of the railroad, in clean, safe, and sanitary quarters. Such 
sleeping quarters include crew quarters, camp or bunk cars, and 
trailers.
    Sleeping quarters are not considered to be ``free from interruptions 
caused by noise under the control of the railroad'' if noise levels 
attributable to noise sources under the control of the railroad exceed 
an L<INF>eq(8) value of 55dB(A).
    FRA recognizes that camp cars, either because of express limitations 
of local codes or by virtue of their physical mobility, cannot, for 
practical purposes, be subject to state or local housing, sanitation, 
health, electrical, or fire codes. Therefore, FRA is unable to rely upon 
state or local authorities to ensure that persons covered by the Act who 
reside in railroad-provided camp cars are afforded an opportunity for 
rest in ``clean, safe, and sanitary'' conditions. Accordingly, the 
guidelines in appendix C to this part 228 will be considered by FRA as 
factors to be used in applying the concepts of ``clean,'' ``safe,'' and 
``sanitary'' to camp cars provided by railroads for the use of employees 
covered by section 2(a)(3) of the Act. Failure to adhere to these 
guidelines might interfere with the ordinary person's ability to rest.
    Collective Bargaining. The Hours of Service Act prescribes the 
maximum permissible hours of service consistent with safety. However, 
the Act does not prohibit collective bargaining for shorter hours of 
service and time on duty.
    Penalty. As amended by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988 and 
the Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act of 1992, the penalty 
provisions of the law apply to any ``person (including but not limited 
to a railroad; any manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or 
agent of a railroad; any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of 
railroad equipment, track, or facilities; any independent contractor 
providing goods or services to a railroad; and any employee of such 
owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor), except 
that a penalty may be assessed against an individual only for a willful 
violation. See appendix A to 49 CFR part 209. For violations that 
occurred on or after September 3, 1992, a person who violates the Act is 
liable for a civil penalty, as the Secretary of Transportation deems 
reasonable, in an amount not less than $500 nor more than $10,000, 
except that where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated 
violations has created an imminent hazard of death or injury to persons, 
or has caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $20,000 may be 
assessed.

[[Page 258]]

    Each employee who is required or permitted to be on duty for a 
longer period than prescribed by law or who does not receive a required 
period of rest represents a separate and distinct violation and subjects 
the railroad to a separate civil penalty. In the case of a violation of 
section 2 (a)(3) or (a)(4) of the Act, each day a facility is in 
noncompliance constitutes a separate offense and subjects the railroad 
to a separate civil penalty.
    In compromising a civil penalty assessed under the Act, FRA takes 
into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the 
violation committed, and, with respect to the person found to have 
committed such violation, the degree of culpability, any history of 
prior or subsequent offenses, ability to pay, effect on ability to 
continue to do business, and such other matters as justice may require.
    Statute of limitations. No suit may be brought after the expiration 
of two years from the date of violation unless administrative 
notification of the violation has been provided to the person to be 
charged within that two year period. In no event may a suit be brought 
after expiration of the period specified in 28 U.S.C. 2462.
    Exemptions. A railroad which employs not more than 15 persons 
covered by the Hours of Service Act (including signalmen and hostlers) 
may be exempted from the law's requirements by the FRA after hearing and 
for good cause shown. The exemption must be supported by a finding that 
it is in the public interest and will not adversely affect safety. The 
exemption need not relate to all carrier employees. In no event may any 
employee of an exempt railroad be required or permitted to work beyond 
16 hours continuously or in the aggregate within any 24-hour period. Any 
exemption is subject to review at least annually.

of the work allows.
    (b) To facilitate cleaning, every floor, working place, and 
passageway should be kept free from protruding nails, splinters, loose 
boards, and unnecessary holes and openings.
    3. Waste Disposal.

[[Page 259]]

    (a) Any exterior receptacle used for putrescible solid or liquid 
waste or refuse should be so constructed that it does not leak and may 
be thoroughly cleaned and maintained in a sanitary condition. Such a 
receptacle should be equipped with a solid tight-fitting cover, unless 
it can be maintained in a sanitary condition without a cover. This 
requirement does not prohibit the use of receptacles designed to permit 
the maintenance of a sanitary condition without regard to the 
aforementioned requirements.
    (b) All sweepings, solid or liquid wastes, refuse, and garbage 
should be removed in such a manner as to avoid creating a menace to 
health and as often as necessary or appropriate to maintain a sanitary 
condition.
    4. Vermin Control.
    (a) Camp cars should be so constructed, equipped, and maintained, so 
far as reasonably practicable, as to prevent the entrance or harborage 
of rodents, insects, or other vermin. A continuing and effective 
extermination program should be instituted where their presence is 
detected.
    5. Water Supply.
    (a) Potable water. (1) Potable water should be adequately and 
conveniently provided to all employees in camp cars for drinking, 
washing of the person, cooking, washing of foods, washing of cooking or 
eating utensils, washing of food preparation or processing premises, and 
personal service rooms where such facilities are provided.
    (2) Potable drinking water dispensers should be designed, 
constructed, and serviced so that sanitary conditions are maintained, 
should be capable of being closed, and should be equipped with a tap.
    (3) Open containers such as barrels, pails, or tanks for drinking 
water from which the water must be dipped or poured, whether or not they 
are fitted with a cover, should not be used.
    (4) A common drinking cup and other common utensils should not be 
used.
    (b) The distribution lines should be capable of supplying water at 
sufficient operating pressures to all taps for normal simultaneous 
operation.
    6. Toilet facilities.
    (a) Toilet facilities. (1) Toilet facilities adequate for the number 
of employees housed in the camp car should be provided in convenient and 
safe location(s), and separate toilet rooms for each sex should be 
provided in accordance with table l of this paragraph. The number of 
facilities to be provided for each sex should be based on the number of 
employees of that sex for whom the facilities are furnished. Where 
toilet rooms will be occupied by no more than one person at a time, can 
be locked from the inside, and contain at least one water closet or 
nonwater carriage toilet facility, separate toilet rooms for each sex 
need not be provided. Where such single-occupancy rooms have more than 
one toilet facility, only one such facility in each toilet room should 
be counted for the purpose of table 1.

                                 Table 1

water closet, or nonwater carriage toilet facility, unless provided to 
the employees individually.
    (5) Toilet facilities should be kept in a clean and sanitary 
condition. They should be cleaned regularly when occupied. In the case 
of nonwater carriage toilet facilities, they should be cleaned and 
changed regularly.
    7. Lavatories.
    (a) Lavatories should be made available to all rail employees housed 
in camp cars.
    (b) Each lavatory should be provided with either hot and cold 
running water or tepid running water.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided by agreement, hand soap or similar 
cleansing agents should be provided.

[[Page 260]]

    (d) Unless otherwise provided by agreement, individual hand towels 
or sections thereof, of cloth or paper, warm air blowers or clean 
individual sections of continuous cloth toweling, convenient to the 
lavatories, should be provided.
    (e) One lavatory basin per six employees should be provided in 
shared facilities.
    8. Showering facilities.
    (a) Showering facilities should be provided in the following ratio: 
one shower should be provided for each 10 employees of each sex, or 
numerical fraction thereof, who are required to shower during the same 
shift.
    (b) Shower floors should be constructed of non-slippery materials. 
Floor drains should be provided in all shower baths and shower rooms to 
remove waste water and facilitate cleaning. All junctions of the curbing 
and the floor should be sealed. The walls and partitions of shower rooms 
should be smooth and impervious to the height of splash.
    (c) An adequate supply of hot and cold running water should be 
provided for showering purposes. Facilities for heating water should be 
provided.
    (d) Showers. 1. Unless otherwise provided by agreement, body soap or 
other appropriate cleansing agent convenient to the showers should be 
provided.
    2. Showers should be provided with hot and cold water feeding a 
common discharge line.
    3. Unless otherwise provided by agreement, employees who use showers 
should be provided with individual clean towels.
    9. Kitchens, dining hall and feeding facilities.
    (a) In all camp cars where central dining operations are provided, 
the food handling facilities should be clean and sanitary.
    (b) When separate kitchen and dining hall cars are provided, there 
should be a closable door between the living or sleeping quarters into a 
kitchen or dining hall car.
    10. Consumption of food and beverages on the premises.
    (a) Application. This paragraph should apply only where employees 
are permitted to consume food or beverages, or both, on the premises.
    (b) Eating and drinking areas. No employee should be allowed to 
consume food or beverages in a toilet room or in any area exposed to a

    (d) Waste disposal containers provided for the interior of camp 
cars. An adequate number of receptacles constructed of smooth, corrosion 
resistant, easily cleanable, or disposable materials, should be provided 
and used for the disposal of waste food. Receptacles should be provided 
with a solid tightfitting cover unless sanitary conditions can be 
maintained without use of a cover. The number, size and location of such 
receptacles should encourage their use and not result in overfilling. 
They should be emptied regularly and maintained in a clean and sanitary 
condition.
    (e) Sanitary storage. No food or beverages should be stored in 
toilet rooms or in an area exposed to a toxic material.
    (f) Food handling. (1) All employee food service facilities and 
operations should be carried out in accordance with sound hygienic 
principles. In all places of employment where all or part of the food 
service is provided, the food dispensed should be wholesome, free from 
spoilage, and should be processed, prepared, handled, and stored in such 
a manner as to be protected against contamination.
    (2) No person with any disease communicable through contact with 
food or food preparation items should be employed or permitted to work 
in the preparation, cooking, serving, or other handling of food, 
foodstuffs, or materials used therein, in a kitchen or dining facility 
operated in or in connection with camp cars.
    11. Lighting. Each habitable room in a camp car should be provided 
with adequate lighting.
    12. First Aid. Adequate first aid kits should be maintained and made 
available for railway employees housed in camp cars for the emergency 
treatment of injured persons.
    13. Shelter.
    (a) Every camp car should be constructed in a manner that will 
provide protection against the elements.
    (b) All steps, entry ways, passageways and corridors providing 
normal entry to or between camp cars should be constructed of durable 
weather resistant material and properly maintained. Any broken or unsafe 
fixtures or components in need of repair should be repaired or replaced 
promptly.
    (c) Each camp car used for sleeping purposes should contain at least 
48 square feet of floor space for each occupant. At least a 7-foot 
ceiling measured at the entrance to the car should be provided.
    (d) Beds, cots, or bunks and suitable storage facilities such as 
wall lockers or space for foot lockers for clothing and personal 
articles should be provided in every room used for sleeping purposes. 
Except where partitions are provided, such beds or similar facilities 
should be spaced not closer than 36 inches laterally (except in modular 
units which cannot be spaced closer than 30 inches) and 30 inches end to 
end, and should be elevated at least 12 inches from the floor. If 
double-deck bunks are used, they should be spaced not less than 48 
inches both laterally and end to end. The minimum clear space between 
the lower and upper bunk should be not less than 27 inches. Triple-deck 
bunks should not be used.

[[Page 261]]

    (e) Floors should be of smooth and tight construction and should be 
kept in good repair.
    (f) All living quarters should be provided with windows the total of 
which should be not less than 10 percent of the floor area. At least 
one-half of each window designed to be opened should be so constructed 
that it can be opened for purposes of ventilation. Durable opaque window 
coverings should be provided to reduce the entrance of light during 
sleeping hours.
    (g) All exterior openings should be effectively screened with 16-
mesh material. All screen doors should be equipped with self-closing 
devices.
    (h) In a facility where workers cook, live, and sleep, a minimum of 
90 square feet per person should be provided. Sanitary facilities should 
be provided for storing and preparing food.
    (i) In camp cars where meals are provided, adequate facilities to 
feed employees within a 60-minute period should be provided.
    (j) All heating, cooking, ventilation, air conditioning and water 
heating equipment should be installed in accordance with applicable 
local regulations governing such installations.
    (k) Every camp car should be provided with equipment capable of 
maintaining a temperature of at least 68 degrees F. during normal cold 
weather and no greater than 78 degrees F., or 20 degrees below ambient, 
whichever is warmer, during normal hot weather.
    (l) Existing camp cars may be grandfathered so as to only be subject 
to subparagraphs (c), (d), (f), (h), and (k), in accordance with the 
following as recommended maximums:

13 (c), (d), and (h)--by January 1, 1994.
13(f)--Indefinitely insofar as the ten percent (10%) requirement for 
window spacing is concerned.
13(k)--by January 1, 1992.

    14. Location. Camp cars occupied exclusively by individuals employed 
for the purpose of maintaining the right-of-way of a railroad should be 
located as far as practical from where ``switching or humping 
operations'' of ``placarded cars'' occur, as defined in 49 CFR 228.101 
(c)(3) and (c)(4), respectively. Every reasonable effort should be made 
to locate these camp cars at least one-half mile (2,640 feet) from where 
such switching or humping occurs. In the event employees housed in camp 
cars located closer than one-half mile (2,640 feet) from where such 
switching or humping of cars takes place are exposed to an unusual 
hazard at such location, the employees involved should be housed in 
other suitable accommodations. An unusual hazard means an unsafe 
condition created by an occurrence other than normal switching or 
humping.
    15. General provisions. (a) Sleeping quarters are not considered to 
be ``free of interruptions caused by noise under the control of the 
railroad'' if noise levels attributable to noise sources under the 
control of the railroad exceed an Leq (8) value of 55 dB(A), with 
windows closed and exclusive of cooling, heating, and ventilating 
equipment.
    (b) A railroad should, within 48 hours after notice of noncompliance 
with these recommendations, fix the deficient condition(s). Where 
holidays or weekends intervene, the railroad should fix the condition 
within 8 hours after the employees return to work. In the event such 
condition(s) affects the safety or health of the employees, such as 
water, cooling, heating or eating facilities, the railroad should 
provide alternative arrangements for housing and eating until the 
noncomplying condition is fixed.

Sec. 229.23  Periodic inspection: General.

    (a) Each locomotive and steam generator shall be inspected at each 
periodic inspection to determine whether it complies with this part. 
Except as provided in Sec. 229.9, all non-complying conditions shall be 
repaired before the locomotive or the steam generator is used. Except as 
provided in Sec. 229.33, the interval between any two periodic 
inspections may not exceed 92 days. Periodic inspections shall only be 
made where adequate facilities are available. At each periodic 
inspection, a locomotive shall be positioned so that a person may safely 
inspect the entire underneath portion of the locomotive.
    (b) The periodic inspection of the steam generator may be postponed 
indefinitely if the water suction pipe to the water pump and the leads 
to the main switch (steam generator switch) are disconnected, and the 
train line shut-off-valve is wired closed or a blind gasket applied. 
However, the steam generator shall be so inspected before it is returned 
to use.
    (c) After April 30, 1980, each new locomotive shall receive an 
initial periodic inspection before it is used. Except as provided in 
Sec. 229.33, each locomotive in use on or before April 30, 1980, shall 
receive an initial periodic inspection within 92 days of the last 30-day 
inspection performed under the prior rules (49 CFR 230.331 and 230.451). 
At the initial periodic inspection, the date and place of the last tests 
performed that are the equivalent of the tests required by Secs. 229.27, 
229.29, and 229.31 shall be entered on Form FRA F 6180-49A. These dates 
shall determine when the tests first become due under Secs. 229.27, 
229.29, and 229.31. Out of use credit may be carried over from Form FRA 
F 6180-49 and entered on Form FRA F 6180-49A.
    (d) Each periodic inspection shall be recorded on Form FRA F 6180-
49A. The form shall be signed by the person conducting the inspection 
and certified by that person's supervisor that the work was done. The 
form shall be displayed under a transparent cover in a conspicuous place 
in the cab of each locomotive.
    (e) At the first periodic inspection in each calendar year the 
carrier shall remove from each locomotive Form FRA F 6180-49A covering 
the previous calendar year. If a locomotive does not receive its first 
periodic inspection in a calendar year before April 2 because it is out 
of use, the form shall be promptly replaced. The Form FRA F 6180-49A 
covering the preceding year for each locomotive, in or out of use, shall 
be signed by the railroad official responsible for the locomotive and 
filed as required in Sec. 229.23(f). The date and place of the last 
periodic inspection and the date and place of the last test performed 
under Secs. 229.27, 229.29, and 229.31 shall be transferred to the 
replacement Form FRA F 6180-49A.
    (f) The mechanical officer of each railroad who is in charge of a 
locomotive shall maintain in his office a secondary record of the 
information reported on Form FRA F 6180-49A under this part. The 
secondary record shall be retained until Form FRA F 6180-49A has been 
removed from the locomotive and filed in the railroad office of the 
mechanical officer in charge of the locomotive. If the Form FRA F 6180-
49A removed from the locomotive is not clearly legible, the secondary 
record shall be retained until the Form FRA F 6180-49A for the 
succeeding year is filed. The Form F 6180-49A removed from a locomotive 
shall be retained

[[Page 267]]

until the Form FRA F 6180-49A for the succeeding year is filed.

following criteria:
    (1) A written copy of the instructions in use shall be kept at the 
point where the work is performed.
    (2) The event recorder shall be tested prior to performing any 
maintenance work on it. At a minimum, the event recorder test shall 
include cycling all required recording parameters and determining the 
full range of each parameter by reading out recorded data. A micro-
processor based event recorder, equipped to perform self-tests, has 
passed the pre-maintenance inspection requirement if it has not 
indicated a failure.
    (3) If this test does not reveal that the device is recording all 
the specified data and that all recordings are within the designed 
recording parameters, this fact shall be noted on the data verification 
result required to be maintained by this section and maintenance and 
testing shall be performed as necessary until a subsequent test is 
successful.
    (4) When a successful test is accomplished, a copy of those data 
verification results shall be maintained with the locomotive's 
maintenance records until the next one is filed.
    (5) A railroad's event recorder periodic maintenance shall be 
considered effective if ninety percent (90%) of the recorders inbound in 
any given month for periodic inspection are still fully functional; 
maintenance practices and test intervals shall be adjusted as necessary 
to yield effective periodic maintenance.

its entire surface while the reservoir is empty at intervals that do not 
exceed 736 calendar days. The test date and place shall be recorded on 
Form FRA F 6180-49A, and the person performing the test and that 
person's supervisor shall sign the form.
    (c) Each welded main reservoir originally constructed to withstand 
at least five times the maximum working pressure fixed by the chief 
mechanical officer may be drilled over its entire surface with telltale 
holes that are three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter. The holes shall 
be spaced not more than 12 inches apart, measured both longitudinally 
and circumferentially, and drilled from the outer surface to an extreme 
depth determined by the formula--

D=(.6PR/(S-0.6P))

where:
 D=extreme depth of telltale holes in inches but in no case less than 
          one-sixteenth inch;
P=certified working pressure in pounds per square inch;
S=one-fifth of the minimum specified tensile strength of the material in 
          pounds per square inch; and
R=inside radius of the reservoir in inches.


[[Page 269]]


One row of holes shall be drilled lengthwise of the reservoir on a line 
intersecting the drain opening. A reservoir so drilled does not have to 
meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, except 
the requirement for a hydrostatic test before it is placed in use. 
Whenever any such telltale hole shall have penetrated the interior of 
any reservoir, the reservoir shall be permanently withdrawn from 
service. A reservoir now in use may be drilled in lieu of the tests 
provided for by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, but it shall 
receive a hydrostatic test before it is returned to use.
    (d) Each aluminum main reservoir before being placed in use and at 
intervals that do not exceed 736 calendar days thereafter, shall be--
    (1) Cleaned and given a thorough visual inspection of all internal 
and external surfaces for evidence of defects or deterioration; and
    (2) Subjected to a hydrostatic pressure at least twice the maximum 
working pressure fixed by the chief mechanical officer, but not less 
than 250 p.s.i. The test date, place, and pressure shall be recorded on 
Form FRA F 6180-49A, and the person conducting the test and that 
person's supervisor shall sign the form.

engineer.
    (f) Auxiliary lights required by paragraph (d) of this section shall 
be continuously illuminated immediately prior to and during movement of 
the locomotive, except as provided by railroad operating rules, 
timetable or special instructions, unless such exception is disapproved 
by FRA. A railroad may except use of auxiliary lights at a specific 
public highway-rail grade crossing by designating that exception in the 
railroad's operating rules, timetable, or a special order. Any exception 
from use of auxiliary lights at a specific public grade crossing can be 
disapproved for a stated cause by FRA's Associate Administrator for 
Safety or any one of FRA's Regional Administrators, after investigation 
by FRA and opportunity for response from the railroad.
    (g) Movement of locomotives with defective auxiliary lights.
    (1) A lead locomotive with only one failed auxiliary light must be 
repaired or switched to a trailing position before departure from the 
place where an initial terminal inspection is required for that train.

[[Page 278]]

    (2) A locomotive with only one auxiliary light that has failed after 
departure from an initial terminal, must be repaired not later than the 
next calendar inspection required by Sec. 229.21.
    (3) A lead locomotive with two failed auxiliary lights may only 
proceed to the next place where repairs can be made. This movement must 
be consistent with Sec. 229.9.
    (h) Any locomotive subject to Part 229, that was built before 
December 31, 1948, and that is not used regularly in commuter or 
intercity passenger service, shall be considered historic equipment and 
excepted from the requirements of paragraphs (d) through (h) of this 
section.

Sec. 229.127  Cab lights.

    (a) Each locomotive shall have cab lights which will provide 
sufficient illumination for the control instruments, meters, and gauges 
to enable the engine crew to make accurate readings from their normal 
positions in the cab. These lights shall be located, constructed, and 
maintained so that light shines only on those parts requiring 
illumination and does not interfere with the crew's vision of the track 
and signals. Each controlling locomotive shall also have a conveniently 
located light that can be readily turned on and off by the persons 
operating the locomotive and that provides sufficient illumination for 
them to read train orders and timetables.
    (b) Cab passageways and compartments shall have adequate 
illumination.


<R05>
Sec. 229.129  Audible warning device.

    (a) After August 31, 1980, each lead locomotive shall be provided 
with an audible warning device that produces a minimum sound level of 
96db(A) at 100 feet forward of the locomotive in its direction of 
travel. The device shall be arranged so that it can be conveniently 
operated from the engineer's normal position in the cab.
    (b) Measurement of the sound level shall be made using a sound level 
meter conforming, at a minimum, to the requirements of ANSI S1.4-1971, 
Type 2, and set to an A-weighted slow response. While the locomotive is

<R05>
Sec. 229.135  Event recorders.

    (a) Duty to equip. Effective May 5, 1995, and except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, any train operated faster than 30 miles 
per hour shall have an in-service event recorder in the lead locomotive. 
The presence of the event recorder shall be noted on Form FRA F6180-49A, 
under the REMARKS section, except that an event recorder designed to 
allow the locomotive to assume the lead position only if the recorder is 
properly functioning is not required to have its presence noted on Form 
FRA F6180-49A. For the purpose of this section, ``train'' includes a 
locomotive or group of locomotives with or without cars, and ``lead 
locomotive'' means the locomotive from whose cab the crew is operating 
the train and, when cab control

[[Page 280]]

locomotives and/or MU locomotives are coupled together, is the first 
locomotive proceeding in the direction of movement. The duty to equip 
the lead locomotive may be met with an event recorder located elsewhere 
than the lead locomotive provided that such event recorder monitors and 
records the required data as though it were located in the lead 
locomotive.
    (b) Response to defective equipment. A locomotive on which the event 
recorder has been taken out of service as provided in paragraph (c) of 
this section may remain as the lead locomotive only until the next 
calendar-day inspection. A locomotive with an inoperative event recorder 
is not deemed to be in improper condition, unsafe to operate, or a non-
complying locomotive under Secs. 229.7 and 229.9, and notwithstanding 
any other requirements in this chapter, inspection, maintenance, and 
testing of event recorders is limited to the requirements set forth in 
Sec. 229.25(e).
    (c) Removal from service. A railroad may remove an event recorder 
from service and, if a railroad knows that an event recorder is not 
monitoring or recording the data specified in Sec. 229.5(g), shall 
remove the event recorder from service. When a railroad removes an event 
recorder from service, a qualified person shall cause to be recorded the 
date the device was removed from service on Form FRA F6180-49A, under 
the REMARKS section. An event recorder designed to allow the locomotive 
to assume the lead position only if the recorder is properly functioning 
is not required to have its removal from service noted on Form FRA 
F6180-49A.
    (d) Preserving accident data. For the purposes of this section, the 
term ``event recorder'' includes all locomotive-mounted recording 
devices designed to record information concerning the functioning of a 
locomotive or train regardless of whether the device meets the 
definition of ``event recorder'' in Sec. 229.5.
    (1) Accidents required to be reported to the Federal Railroad 
Administration. If any locomotive equipped with an event recorder is 
involved in an accident that is required to be reported to FRA, the 
railroad using the locomotive shall, to the extent possible, and to the 
extent consistent with the safety of life and property, preserve the 
data recorded by the device for analysis by FRA. This preservation 
requirement permits the railroad to extract and analyze such data; 
provided the original or a first-order accurate copy of the data shall 
be retained in secure custody and shall not be utilized for analysis or 
any other purpose except by direction of FRA or the National 
Transportation Safety Board. This preservation requirement shall expire 
30 days after the date of the accident unless FRA or the Board notifies 
the railroad in writing that the data are desired for analysis.
    (2) Relationship to other laws. Nothing in this section is intended 
to alter the legal authority of law enforcement officials investigating 
potential violation(s) of State criminal law(s) and nothing in this 
chapter is intended to alter in any way the priority of National 
Transportation Safety Board investigations under 49 U.S.C. 1131 and 
1134, nor the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to 
investigate railroad accidents under 49 U.S.C. 5121, 5122, 20107, 20111, 
20112, 20505, 20702, 20703, and 20902.
    (e) Disabling event recorders. Except as provided in paragraph (c) 
of this section, any individual who willfully disables an event recorder 
is subject to civil penalty and to disqualification from performing 
safety-sensitive functions on a railroad as provided in Sec. 218.55 of 
this chapter and any individual who tampers with or alters the data 
recorded by such a device is subject to a civil penalty as provided in 
appendix B of this part and to disqualification from performing safety-
sensitive functions on a railroad if found unfit for such duties under 
the procedures in 49 CFR part 209.

type of coupler carrier is used, an auxiliary arrangement shall be 
provided that complies with these requirements.
    (4) The outside end of each locomotive shall be provided with two 
main vertical members, one at each side of the diaphragm opening; each 
main member shall have an ultimate shear value of not less than 300,000 
pounds at a point even with the top of the underframe member to which it 
is attached. The attachment of these members at bottom shall be 
sufficient to develop their full shear value. If reinforcement is used 
to provide the shear value, the reinforcement shall have full value for 
a distance of 18 inches up from the underframe connection and then taper 
to a point approximately 30 inches above the underframe connection.
    (5) The strength of the means of locking the truck to the body shall 
be at least the equivalent of an ultimate shear value of 250,000 pounds.
    (b) MU locomotives built new after April 1, 1956 that are operated 
in trains having a total empty weight of less than 600,000 pounds shall 
have a body structure designed to meet or exceed the following minimum 
specifications:

400,000 pounds at the rear draft stops ahead of the bolster on the 
center line of draft, without developing any permanent deformation in 
any member of the body structure.
    (2) An anti-climbing arrangement shall be applied at each end that 
is designed so that coupled locomotives under full compression shall 
mate in a manner that will resist one locomotive from climbing the 
other. This arrangement shall resist a vertical load of 75,000 pounds 
without exceeding the yield point of its various parts or its 
attachments to the body structure.
    (3) The coupler carrier and its connections to the body structure 
shall be designed to resist a vertical downward thrust from the coupled 
shank of 75,000 pounds for any horizontal position of the coupler, 
without exceeding the yield points of the materials used. When a 
yielding type of coupler carrier is used, an auxiliary arrangement shall 
be provided that complies with these requirements.
    (4) The outside end of each MU locomotive shall be provided with two 
main vertical members, one at each side of the diaphragm opening; each 
main member shall have an ultimate shear value of not less than 200,000 
pounds at a point even with the top of the underframe member to which it 
is attached. The attachment of these members at bottom shall be 
sufficient to develop their full shear value, the reinforcement shall 
have full value for a distance of 18 inches up from the underframe 
connection and then taper to a point approximately 30 inches above the 
underframe connection.
    (5) The strength of the means of locking the truck to the body shall 
be at least the equivalent of an ultimate shear value of 250,000 pounds.

\1\ A penalty may be assessed against an individual only for a willful  
  violation. Generally, when two or more violations of these regulations
  are discovered with respect to a single locomotive that is used by a  
  railroad, the appropriate penalties set forth above are aggregated up 
  to a maximum of $10,000 per day. However, a failure to perform, with  
  respect to a particular locomotive, any of the inspections and tests  
  required under subpart B of this part will be treated as a violation  
  separate and distinct from, and in addition to, any substantive       
  violative conditions found on that locomotive. Moreover, the          
  Administrator reserves the right to assess a penalty of up to $20,000 
  for any violation where circumstances warrant. See 49 CFR part 209,   
  appendix A.                                                           
Failure to observe any condition for movement set forth in Sec.  229.9  
  will deprive the railroad of the benefit of the movement-for-repair   
  provision and make the railroad and any responsible individuals liable
  for penalty under the particular regulatory section(s) concerning the 
  substantive defect(s) present on the locomotive at the time of        
  movement. Failure to comply with Sec.  229.19 will result in the lapse
  of any affected waiver.

    (a) Any person (including a railroad subject to this part and any 
manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of such a 
railroad) who violates any requirement of 49 CFR part 230, subpart A 
(Secs. 230.1 to 230.55) or subpart B (Secs. 230.101 to 230.162) as in 
effect on October 1, 1978, or of the Locomotive Inspection Act, or 
causes the violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil 
penalty of at least $250 and not more than $10,000 per violation, except 
that: Penalties may be assessed against individuals only for willful 
violations, and, where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of 
repeated violations has created an imminent hazard of death or injury to 
persons, or has caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $20,000 
per violation may be assessed. Each day a violation continues shall 
constitute a separate offense.

perform any switching service after September 30, 1979 except passenger 
car switching service at passenger stations.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Locomotive used in switching service means a 
locomotive regularly assigned to perform yard switching service.
    (2) Switching service means the classification of cars according to 
commodity or destination; assembling of cars for train movements; 
changing the position of cars for purposes of loading, unloading, or 
weighing, placing of locomotives and cars for repair or storage; or 
moving of rail equipment in connection with work service that does not 
constitute a road movement. However, this term does not include movement 
of a train or part of a train within yard limits by the road locomotive 
and the placement of locomotives or cars in a train or their removal 
from a train by the road locomotive while en route to the train's 
destination.

[[Page 320]]

    (3) Safety tread surface means that portion of anti-skid surface of 
a switching step that actually is contacted by a shoe or boot.
    (4) Uncoupling mechanism means the arrangement for operating the 
coupler lock lift, including the uncoupling lever and all other 
appurtenances that facilitate operation of the coupler.
    (c) Switching step--(1) Number. Each locomotive used in switching 
service must have four (4) switching steps. (See Plate A)
    (2) Dimensions. Each such switching step must have--
    (i) On locomotives built after March 31, 1977, a minimum width of 
twenty-four (24) inches and a minimum depth of twelve (12) inches, 
except when necessary to accommodate the turning arc of a six-wheel 
truck and its appurtenances, the inside edge of the switching step shall 
have a minimum width of seventeen (17) inches (See Plate B);
    (ii) On locomotives built prior to April 1, 1977, a minimum width of

fifteen (15) inches, measured from top of rail to the safety tread 
surface.
    (3) Location. Switching steps must be located on each side near each 
end of a locomotive used in switching service. The bottom step of the 
stairway at these locations may also serve as a switching step if it 
meets all of the requirements of this section.
    (4) Manner of application. (i) Switching steps must be supported by 
a bracket at each end and fastened to the bracket by two bolts or rivets 
of at least one-half (\1/2\) inch diameter or by a weldment of at least 
twice the strength of a bolted attachment.
    (ii) Vertical clearance must be unobstructed, except for minor 
intrusions created by mechanical fasteners or a small triangular gusset 
plate at the platform level walkway, and free for use for at least a 
distance of eighty-four (84) inches over a portion of the switching step 
that is not less than seven (7) inches deep by eighteen (18) inches wide

must have means for operating the uncoupling mechanism safely from the 
switching step as well as from ground level. No part of the uncoupling 
mechanism may extend into the switching step or stairway opening or end 
platform area when the mechanism is in its normal position or when it is 
operated. (See Plate A)
    (g) Horizontal end handholds. Each locomotive used in switching 
service must have four (4) horizontal end handholds.
    (1) Each horizontal end handhold must--
    (i) Be constructed of wrought iron, steel or other material of 
equivalent strength and durability that is at least five-eighths (\5/8\) 
inch in diameter and be securely fastened to the locomotive with one-
half (\1/2\) inch or larger bolts or rivets;
    (ii) Be located not less than thirty (30) inches nor more than fifty 
(50) inches above the top of rail with its outer end not more than 16 
inches from the side of the locomotive; on units with a high snowplow 
that makes normal end handhold location inaccessible, end handhold shall 
be located on top of plow blade, with the center of the handhold not 
more than fifty-three (53) inches above the top of rail, and be in line

Sec. 232.11   Train air brake system tests.

    (a) Supervisors are jointly responsible with inspectors, enginemen 
and trainmen for condition of air brake and air signal equipment on 
motive power and cars to the extent that it is possible to detect 
defective equipment by required air tests.
    (b) Communicating signal system on passenger equipment trains must 
be tested and known to be in a suitable condition for service before 
leaving terminal.
    (c) Each train must have the air brakes in effective operating 
condition, and at no time shall the number and location of operative air 
brakes be less than permitted by Federal requirements. When piston 
travel is in excess of 10\1/2\ inches, the air brake cannot be 
considered in effective operating condition.
    (d) Condensation must be blown from the pipe from which air is taken 
before connecting yard line or motive power to train.

<R05>
Sec. 232.12   Initial terminal road train airbrake tests.

    (a)(1) Each train must be inspected and tested as specified in this 
section by a qualified person at points--
    (i) Where the train is originally made up (initial terminal);
    (ii) Where train consist is changed, other than by adding or 
removing a solid block of cars, and the train brake system remains 
charged; and
    (iii) Where the train is received in interchange if the train 
consist is changed other than by--
    (A) Removing a solid block of cars from the head end or rear end of 
the train;
    (B) Changing motive power;
    (C) Removing or changing the caboose; or
    (D) Any combination of the changes listed in (A), (B), and (C) of 
this subparagraph.

Where a carman is to perform the inspection and test under existing or 
future collective bargaining agreement, in those circumstances a carman 
alone will be considered a qualified person.
    (2) A qualified person participating in the test and inspection or 
who has knowledge that it was made shall notify the engineer that the 
initial terminal road train air brake test has been satisfactorily 
performed. The qualified person shall provide the notification in 
writing if the road crew will report for duty after the qualified person 
goes off duty. The qualified person also shall provide the notification 
in writing if the train that has been inspected is to be moved in excess 
of 500 miles without being subjected to another test pursuant to either 
this section or Sec. 232.13 of this part.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control 
number 2130-0008)

    (b) Each carrier shall designate additional inspection points not 
more than 1,000 miles apart where intermediate inspection will be made 
to determine that--
    (1) Brake pipe pressure leakage does not exceed five pounds per 
minute;
    (2) Brakes apply on each car in response to a 20-pound service brake 
pipe pressure reduction; and
    (3) Brake rigging is properly secured and does not bind or foul.
    (c) Train airbrake system must be charged to required air pressure, 
angle cocks and cutout cocks must be properly positioned, air hose must 
be properly coupled and must be in condition for service. An examination 
must be made for leaks and necessary repairs made to reduce leakage to a 
minimum. Retaining valves and retaining valve pipes must be inspected 
and known to be in condition for service. If train is to be operated in 
electropneumatic brake operation, brake circuit cables must be properly 
connected.
    (d)(1) After the airbrake system on a freight train is charged to 
within 15 pounds of the setting of the feed valve on the locomotive, but 
to not less than 60 pounds, as indicated by an accurate gauge at rear 
end of train, and on a passenger train when charged to not less than 70 
pounds, and upon receiving the signal to apply brakes for test, a 15-
pound brake pipe service reduction must be made in automatic brake 
operations, the brake valve lapped, and the

[[Page 329]]

number of pounds of brake pipe leakage per minute noted as indicated by 
brake pipe guage, after which brake pipe reduction must be increased to 
full service. Inspection of the train brakes must be made to determine 
that angle cocks are properly positioned, that the brakes are applied on 
each car, that piston travel is correct, that brake rigging does not 
bind or foul, and that all parts of the brake equipment are properly 
secured. When this inspection has been completed, the release signal 
must be given and brakes released and each brake inspected to see that 
all have released.
    (2) When a passenger train is to be operated in electropneumatic 
brake operation and after completion of test of brakes as prescribed by 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section the brake system must be recharged to 
not less than 90 pounds air pressure, and upon receiving the signal to 
apply brakes for test, a minimum 20 pounds electropneumatic brake 
application must be made as indicated by the brake cylinder gage. 
Inspection of the train brakes must then be made to determine if brakes 
are applied on each car. When this inspection has been completed, the 
release signal must be given and brakes released and each brake 
inspected to see that all have released.
    (3) When the locomotive used to haul the train is provided with 
means for maintaining brake pipe pressure at a constant level during 
service application of the train brakes, this feature must be cut out 
during train airbrake tests.
    (e) Brake pipe leakage must not exceed 5 pounds per minute.
    (f)(1) At initial terminal piston travel of body-mounted brake 
cylinders which is less than 7 inches or more than 9 inches must be 
adjusted to nominally 7 inches.
    (2) Minimum brake cylinder piston travel of truck-mounted brake 
cylinders must be sufficient to provide proper brake shoe clearance when 
brakes are released. Maximum piston travel must not exceed 6 inches.
    (3) Piston travel of brake cylinders on freight cars equipped with 
other than standard single capacity brake, must be adjusted as indicated 
on badge plate or stenciling on car located in a conspicuous place near 
brake cylinder.
    (g) When test of airbrakes has been completed the engineman and 
conductor must be advised that train is in proper condition to proceed.
    (h) During standing test, brakes must not be applied or released 
until proper signal is given.
    (i)(1) When train airbrake system is tested from a yard test plant, 
an engineer's brake valve or a suitable test device must be used to 
provide increase and reduction of brake pipe air pressure or 
electropneumatic brake application and release at the same or a slower 
rate as with engineer's brake valve and yard test plant must be 
connected to the end which will be nearest to the hauling road 
locomotive.
    (2) When yard test plant is used, the train airbrakes system must be 
charged and tested as prescribed by paragraphs (c) to (g) of this 
section inclusive, and when practicable should be kept charged until 
road motive power is coupled to train, after which, an automatic brake 
application and release test of airbrakes on rear car must be made. If 
train is to be operated in electropneumatic brake operation, this test 
must also be made in electropneumatic brake operation before proceeding.
    (3) If after testing the brakes as prescribed in paragraph (i)(2) of 
this section the train is not kept charged until road motive power is 
attached, the brakes must be tested as prescribed by paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section and if train is to be operated in electropneumatic brake 
operation as prescribed by paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (j) Before adjusting piston travel or working on brake rigging, 
cutout cock in brake pipe branch must be closed and air reservoirs must 
be drained. When cutout cocks are provided in brake cylinder pipes, 
these cutout cocks only may be closed and air reservoirs need not be 
drained.

<R05>
Sec. 232.13   Road train and intermediate terminal train air brake tests.

    (a)  Passenger trains.  Before motive power is detached or angle 
cocks are closed on a passenger train operated in either automatic or 
electro-pneumatic brake operation, except when closing angle cocks for 
cutting off one or more cars from the rear end of train, automatic air 
brake must be applied. After recouping, brake system must be recharged 
to required air pressure and before proceeding and upon receipt of 
proper request or signal, application and release tests of brakes on 
rear car must be made from locomotive in automatic brake operation. If 
train is to be operated in electro-pneumatic brake operation, this test 
must also be made in electro-pneumatic brake operation before 
proceeding. Inspector or trainman must determine if brakes on rear car 
of train properly apply and release.
    (b) Freight trains. Before motive power is detached or angle cocks 
are closed on a freight train, brakes must be applied with not less than 
a 20-pound brake pipe reduction. After recoupling, and after angle cocks 
are opened, it must be known that brake pipe air pressure is being 
restored as indicated by a rear car gauge or device. In the absence of a 
rear car gauge or device, an air brake test must be made to determine 
that the brakes on the rear car apply and release.
    (c)(1) At a point other than an initial terminal where a locomotive 
or caboose is changed, or where one or more consecutive cars are cut off 
from the rear end or head end of a train with the consist otherwise 
remaining intact, after the train brake system is charged to within 15 
pounds of the feed valve setting on the locomotive, but not less than 60 
pounds as indicated at the rear of a freight train and 70 pounds on a 
passenger train, a 20-pound brake pipe reduction must be made and it 
must be determined that the brakes on the rear car apply and release. As 
an alternative to the rear car brake application and release test, it 
shall be determined that brake pipe pressure of the train is being 
reduced as indicated by a rear car gauge or device and then that brake 
pipe pressure of the train is being restored as indicated by a rear car 
gauge or device.
    (2) Before proceeding it must be known that brake pipe pressure as 
indicated at rear of freight train is being restored.
    (3) On trains operating with electro-pneumatic brakes, with brake 
system charged to not less than 70 pounds, test must be made to 
determine that rear brakes apply and release properly from a minimum 20 
pounds electro-pneumatic brake application as indicated by brake 
cylinder gauge.
    (d)(1) At a point other than a terminal where one or more cars are 
added to a train, after the train brake system is charged to not less 
than 60 pounds as indicated by a gauge or device at the rear of a 
freight train and 70 pounds on a passenger train, a brake test must be 
made to determine that brake pipe leakage does not exceed five (5) 
pounds per minute as indicated by the brake pipe gauge after a 20-pound 
brake pipe reduction. After this test is completed, it must be 
determined that the brakes on each of these cars and on the rear car of 
the train apply and release. As an alternative to the rear car brake 
application and release portion of the test, it shall be determined that 
brake pipe pressure of the train is being reduced as indicated by a rear 
car gauge or device and then that brake pipe pressure of the train is 
being restored as indicated by a rear car gauge or device. Cars added to 
a train that have not been inspected in accordance with Sec. 232.12 (c) 
through (j) must be so inspected and tested at the next terminal where 
facilities are available for such attention.
    (2)(i) At a terminal where a solid block of cars, which has been 
previously charged and tested as prescribed by Sec. 232.13 (c) through 
(j), is added to a train, it must be determined that the brakes on the 
rear car of the train apply and release. As an alternative to the rear 
car application and release test, it shall be determined that brake pipe 
pressure of the train is being reduced as indicated by a rear car gauge 
or device and then that brake pipe pressure of the train is being 
restored as indicated by a rear car gauge or device.
    (ii) When cars which have not been previously charged and tested as 
prescribed by Sec. 232.12 (c) through (j) are

[[Page 331]]

added to a train, such cars may either be given inspection and tests in 
accordance with Sec. 232.12 (c) through (j), or tested as prescribed by 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section prior to departure in which case these 
cars must be inspected and tested in accordance with Sec. 232.12 (c) 
through (j) at next terminal.
    (3) Before proceeding it must be known that the brake pipe pressure 
at the rear of freight train is being restored.
    (e)(1) Transfer train and yard train movements not exceeding 20 
miles, must have the air brake hose coupled between all cars, and after 
the brake system is charged to not less than 60 pounds, a 15 pound 
service brake pipe reduction must be made to determine that the brakes 
are applied on each car before releasing and proceeding.
    (2) Transfer train and yard train movements exceeding 20 miles must 
have brake inspection in accordance with Sec. 232.12 (c)-(j).
    (f) The automatic air brake must not be depended upon to hold a 
locomotive, cars or train, when standing on a grade, whether locomotive 
is attached or detached from cars or train. When required, a sufficient 
number of hand brakes must be applied to hold train, before air brakes 
are released. When ready to start, hand brakes must not be released 
until it is known that the air brake system is properly charged.
    (g) As used in this section, device means a system of components 
designed and inspected in accordance with Sec. 232.19.
    (h) When a device is used to comply with any test requirement in 
this section, the phrase brake pipe pressure of the train is being 
reduced means a pressure reduction of at least five pounds and the 
phrase brake pipe pressure of the train is being restored means a 
pressure increase of at least five pounds.

<R05>
Sec. 232.14   Inbound brake equipment inspection.

    (a) At points where inspectors are employed to make a general 
inspection of trains upon arrival at terminals, visual inspection must 
be made of retaining valves and retaining valve pipes, release valves 
and rods, brake rigging, safety supports, hand brakes, hose and position 
of angle cocks and make necessary repairs or mark for repair tracks any 
cars to which yard repairs cannot be promptly made.
    (b) Freight trains arriving at terminals where facilities are 
available and at which special instructions provide for immediate brake 
inspection and repairs, shall be left with air brakes applied by a 
service brake pipe reduction of 20 pounds so that inspectors can obtain 
a proper check of the piston travel. Trainmen will not close any angle 
cock or cut the locomotive off until the 20 pound service reduction has 
been made. Inspection of the brakes and needed repairs should be made as 
soon thereafter as practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 232.15   Double heading and helper service.

    (a) When more than one locomotive is attached to a train, the 
engineman of the leading locomotive shall operate the brakes. On all 
other motive power units in the train the brake pipe cutout cock to the 
brake valve must be closed, the maximum main reservoir pressure 
maintained and brake valve handles kept in the prescribed position. In 
case it becomes necessary for the leading locomotive to give up control 
of the train short of the destination of the train, a test of the brakes 
must be made to see that the brakes are operative from the automatic 
brake valve of the locomotive taking control of the train.
    (b) The electro-pneumatic brake valve on all motive power units 
other than that which is handling the train must be cut out, handle of 
brake valve kept in the prescribed position, and air compressors kept 
running if practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 232.16   Running tests.

    When motive power, engine crew or train crew has been changed, angle 
cocks have been closed except for cutting off one or more cars from the 
rear end of train or electro-pneumatic brake circuit cables between 
power units and/or cars have been disconnected, running test of train 
air brakes on passenger train must be made, as soon as speed of train 
permits, by use

[[Page 332]]

of automatic brake if operating in automatic brake operation or by use 
of electro-pneumatic brake if operating in electro-pneumatic brake 
operation. Steam or power must not be shut off unless required and 
running test must be made by applying train air brakes with sufficient 
force to ascertain whether or not brakes are operating properly. If air 
brakes do not properly operate, train must be stopped, cause of failure 
ascertained and corrected and running test repeated.


<R05>
Sec. 232.17   Freight and passenger train car brakes.

    (a) Testing and repairing brakes on cars while on shop or repair 
tracks. (1) When a freight car having brake equipment due for periodic 
attention is on shop or repair tracks where facilities are available for 
making air brake repairs, brake equipment must be given attention in 
accordance with the requirements of the currently effective AAR Code of 
Rules for cars in interchange. Brake equipment shall then be tested by 
use of a single car testing device as prescribed by the currently 
effective AAR Code of Tests.
    (2)(i) When a freight car having an air brake defect is on a shop or 
repair track, brake equipment must be tested by use of a single car 
testing device as prescribed by currently effective AAR Code of Tests.
    (ii) All freight cars on shop or repair tracks shall be tested to 
determine that the air brakes apply and release. Piston travel on a 
standard body mounted brake cylinder which is less than 7 inches or more 
than 9 inches must be adjusted to nominally 7 inches. Piston travel of 
brake cylinders on all freight cars equipped with other than standard 
single capacity brake, must be adjusted as indicated on badge plate or 
stenciling on car located in a conspicuous place near brake cylinder. 
After piston travel has been adjusted and with brakes released, 
sufficient brake shoe clearance must be provided.
    (iii) When a car is equipped for use in passenger train service not 
due for periodical air brake repairs, as indicated by stenciled or 
recorded cleaning dates, is on shop or repair tracks, brake equipment 
must be tested by use of single car testing device as prescribed by 
currently effective AAR Code of Tests. Piston travel of brake cylinders 
must be adjusted if required, to the standard travel for that type of 
brake cylinder. After piston travel has been adjusted and with brakes 
released, sufficient brake shoe clearance must be provided.
    (iv) Before a car is released from a shop or repair track, it must 
be known that brake pipe is securely clamped, angle cocks in proper 
position with suitable clearance, valves, reservoirs and cylinders tight 
on supports and supports securely attached to car.
    (b)(1) Brake equipment on cars other than passenger cars must be 
cleaned, repaired, lubricated and tested as often as required to 
maintain it in a safe and suitable condition for service but not less 
frequently than as required by currently effective AAR Code of Rules for 
cars in interchange.
    (2) Brake equipment on passenger cars must be clean, repaired, 
lubricated and tested as often as necessary to maintain it in a safe and 
suitable condition for service but not less frequently than as required 
in Standard S-045 in the Manual of Standards and Recommended Practices 
of the AAR.
    (3) Copies of the materials referred to in this section can be 
obtained from the Association of American Railroads, 1920 L Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20036.

[53 FR 52934, Dec. 29, 1988]

Appendix B to Part 232--Specifications and Requirements for Power Brakes 
  and Appliances for Operating Power-Brake Systems for Freight Service

                                 purpose

    The purpose of this specification is to define and prescribe 
requirements for power brakes and appliances for operating powerbrake 
systems.

                               definitions

    For purposes of this specification, terms used herein are defined as 
follows:
    1. Power brake. A combination of parts operated by compressed air 
and controlled manually, pneumatically or electrically, by means of 
which the motion of a car or locomotive is retarded or arrested.
    2. Power-brake system. The power brakes on locomotives and cars of a 
train so interconnected that they can be operated together and by means 
of which the motion of the train is retarded or arrested.
    3. Brake valve. The value of the locomotive equipment by means of 
which operation of the power-brake system is controlled.
    4. Equalizing reservoir. The small reservoir connected to the brake 
valve only, the pressure of which is reduced by the engineer for making 
service applications.
    5. Brake pipe. The line of pipe and hose extending throughout the 
length of the train by means of which compressed air is supplied to the 
brake devices on the several cars and the pressures so controlled as to 
effect the application and release of the brakes.
    6. Operating valve. Device on each car, the operation of which 
result in (a) admission of air to brake cylinder, (b) release of air 
from brake cylinder, and (c) charging of one or more reservoirs.
    7. Service reduction. A decrease in brake-pipe pressure, usually of 
from 5 to 25 pounds, at a rate sufficiently rapid to move the operating 
valve to service position, but at a rate not rapid enough to operate the 
valve to emergency position. Quick service is that feature of the 
operating valve which provides for local reduction of brake-pipe 
pressure.
    8. Service application. A brake application which results from one 
or more service reductions.
    9. Full service reduction. A service reduction sufficient in amount 
to cause equalization of pressure in brake cylinder with pressure in the 
reservoir from which compressed air is supplied to brake cylinder.
    10. Full service application. A brake application which results from 
one or more brake-pipe reductions sufficient in amount to cause a full 
service reduction.
    11. Emergency reduction. A depletion of brake-pipe pressure at a 
rate sufficiently rapid to move the operating valve to emergency 
position.
    12. Emergency application. A brake application which results from an 
emergency reduction.
    13. Emergency brake-cylinder pressure. The force per square inch 
exerted upon piston in brake cylinder by compressed air which is 
admitted to brake cylinder as a result of an emergency reduction. 
Effective emergency brake-cylinder pressure is a pressure not less than 
15 percent nor more than 20 percent greater than the brake-cylinder 
pressure obtained from a full service reduction on the game car and from 
the same initial pressures.

                             specifications

                          General Requirements

    14. The design of the operating valve shall be such as will insure 
efficient and reliable operation, both in its application and release 
functions and when intermingled with other types of power brakes. It 
shall be so constructed that the rate of brake-cylinder pressure 
development may be adjusted to meet such changes in train operating 
conditions as may develop in the future.
    15. The design of the service and emergency valves shall be such as 
to permit their removal for cleaning and repair without disturbing pipe 
joints.
    16. The portions of the car brake which control the brake 
application and release, and also the brake cylinder, shall be 
adequately protected against the entrance of foreign matter.
    17. The apparatus conforming to the requirements of these 
specifications shall be so constructed, installed and maintained as to 
be safe and suitable for service.

                          Service Requirements

    The apparatus shall be so designed and constructed that: (based upon 
70 pounds brake-pipe pressure and train length of 150 cars)
    18. With a service reduction of 5 pounds in the equalizing reservoir 
at the brake valve all brakes will apply.
    19. An initial 5-pound equalizing-reservoir reduction at the brake 
valve will produce substantially 10 pounds brake-cylinder pressure 
throughout the train, including brakes having piston travel in excess of 
8 inches.
    20. With an equalizing-reservoir reduction of 10 pounds, the 
difference in time of obtaining substantially 10 pounds pressure in the 
brake cylinder of the first and one hundred and fiftieth brakes will be 
nominally 20 seconds or less.
    21. A brake-pipe reduction of 10 pounds will result in pressure in 
each brake cylinder of not less than 15 pounds nor more than 25 pounds.
    22. A total brake-pipe reduction of 25 pounds will result in 
equalization of brakecylinder pressure with pressure in the reservoir 
from which compressed air is supplied to the brake cylinder, and brake-
cylinder pressure of not less than 48 pounds nor more than 52 pounds 
will be obtained.
    23. Quick service activity of the train brakes will cease when the 
initial quick service action has been completed.
    24. The quick service feature of the brake will produce 
substantially uniform time of quick service transmission regardless of 
the unavoidable variations in frictional resistance of the parts.
    25. The brake will so function as to prevent a degree of wave action 
in brake-pipe pressure sufficient to cause undesired release of any 
brake while the brakes are being applied.
    26. The degree of stability will be sufficient to prevent undesired 
service application occurring as a result of unavoidable minor 
fluctuations of brake-pipe pressure.
    27. The brake-cylinder pressure increase resulting from quick 
service operation will be less when the brake is reapplied with pressure 
retained in the brake cylinder than with applications made when the 
brake-cylinder pressure is zero.
    28. Undesired quick action will not result with any rate of change 
in brake-pipe pressure which may occur during service application or 
release of the brake.
    29. In the normal release of train brakes, individual car brake will 
not start recharging from the brake pipe until brake-pipe pressure has 
increased sufficiently to have accomplished the release of adjacent 
valves.
    30. The recharge of auxiliary reservoirs in the forward portion of 
the train will be automatically retarded while full release position of 
the brake valve is being used to initiate the release of train brakes.
    31. After a 15-pound service reduction has been made and brake-valve 
exhaust has closed, in a release operation in which brake valve is moved 
to release position and after 15 seconds is moved to running position, 
air operating valves will move to release position within 40 seconds 
after brake valve is placed in release position.
    32. After a 15-pound service reduction has been made and brake-value 
exhaust has closed, in a release operation in which brake valve is moved 
to release position and after 15 seconds is moved to running position, 
brake-pipe pressure at car 150 will be increased 5 pounds within 1\1/2\ 
minutes after brake valve is placed in release position.
    33. The rate of release of pressure from the brake cylinder will be 
nominally 23 seconds from 50 pounds to 5 pounds.

                         Emergency Requirements

    The apparatus shall be so designed and constructed that: (based on 
70 pounds brake-pipe pressure and train length of 150 cars).
    34. Emergency application operation will always be available 
irrespective of the existing state or stage or brake application or 
release.
    35. Emergency application initiated during a release of previous 
brake application will produce a material increase in brake-cylinder 
pressure over that which would result from a full service application 
made under the same conditions.
    36. When operating valve acts in emergency it will so function as to 
develop nominally 15 pounds brake-cylinder pressure in not more than 
1\1/2\ seconds and maximum pressure in nominally 10 seconds.

[[Page 337]]

    37. With an emergency reduction of brake-pipe pressure all brakes, 
including the one hundred and fiftieth, will start to apply within 8.2 
seconds and develop not less than 15 percent nor more than 20 percent in 
excess of 50 pounds brake-cylinder pressure within 18.2 seconds from the 
movement of the brake valve to emergency position.
    38. The operating valve will so function that, when an emergency 
application is made subsequent to a service application which has 
produced not less than 30 pounds brake-cylinder pressure, the maximum 
brake-cylinder pressure will be attained in nominally 4 seconds from the 
beginning of the emergency action of the valve.
    39. Emergency application will produce from a charged system between 
15 and 20 percent increase in brake-cylinder pressure over that which 
results from a full service application and irrespective of any degree 
of prior service application.
    40. With any group of three consecutive brakes cut out, an emergency 
reduction made with the brake valve will cause the remainder of the 
brakes to operate in emergency and produce normal emergency pressures in 
the same time as when all brakes are cut in.
    41. The brake will so function as to accomplish the release of an 
emergency application with the same degree of certainty secured in the 
release of service applications.
    42. When releasing brakes following an emergency application, each 
brake will so function as to decrease the auxiliary-reservoir pressure 
prior to the actual release.
    43. Both service and emergency brake applications will be released 
when the brake-pipe pressure is increased to not more than 1\3/4\ pounds 
above that of the auxiliary reservoir and irrespective of the increased 
frictional resistance to release movement of the piston and slide valves 
after a period of operation in train service.

follows: That the order heretofore entered on September 21, 1945, as 
amended, requiring respondents to install power brakes and appliances on 
their cars used in interchange freight service on or before December 31, 
1952, be, and it is hereby, further amended so as--
    To require that all such interchange cars be so equipped on or 
before June 30, 1953, except as indicated hereinafter:
    To prohibit the movement by any respondent after June 30, 1953, of 
any car interchange service, other than tank cars (including the cars of 
private carline companies), not so equipped except that such cars may be 
so moved prior to October 1, 1953, if routed to owner; and
    To prohibit the movement by respondents after October 1, 1953, of 
any tank car in interchange service (including the tank cars of private 
car-line companies) not so equipped except that such tank cars may be so 
moved prior to January 1, 1954, if routed to owner.
    That the term interchange service means the movement of any car that 
is engaged in freight service, irrespective of ownership, that is 
interchanged between or among two or more respondent railroads.
    Order 13528 was further amended, 18 FR 6942, Nov. 3, 1953, as

<R04>
                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 234.1  Scope.

    This part imposes minimum maintenance, inspection, and testing 
standards for highway-rail grade crossing warning systems. This part 
also prescribes standards for the reporting of failures of such systems 
and prescribes minimum actions railroads must take when such warning 
systems malfunction. This part does not restrict a railroad from 
adopting and enforcing additional or more stringent requirements not 
inconsistent with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 234.3  Application.

    This part applies to all railroads except:
    (a) A railroad that exclusively operates freight trains only on 
track which is not part of the general railroad system of 
transportation;
    (b) Rapid transit operations within an urban area that are not 
connected to the general railroad system of transportation; and
    (c) A railroad that operates passenger trains only on track inside 
an installation that is insular; i.e., its operations are limited to a 
separate enclave in such a way that there is no reasonable expectation 
that the safety of the public--except a business guest, a licensee of 
the railroad or an affiliated entity, or a trespasser--would be affected 
by the operation. An operation will not be considered insular if one or 
more of the following exists on its line:
    (1) A public highway-rail crossing that is in use;
    (2) An at-grade rail crossing that is in use;
    (3) A bridge over a public road or waters used for commercial 
navigation; or
    (4) A common corridor with a railroad, i.e., its operations are 
within 30 feet of those of any railroad.


<R05>
Sec. 234.4  Preemptive effect.

    Under 49 U.S.C. 20106 (formerly Sec. 205 of the Federal Railroad 
Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 434)), issuance of these regulations 
preempts any State law, rule, regulation, order, or standard covering 
the same subject matter, except a provision directed at an essentially 
local safety hazard that is consistent with this part and that does not 
impose an undue burden on interstate commerce.


<R05>
Sec. 234.5  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    ``Activation failure'' means the failure of an active highway-rail 
grade crossing warning system to indicate the approach of a train at 
least 20 seconds prior to the train's arrival at the crossing, or to 
indicate the presence of a train occupying the crossing, unless the 
crossing is provided with an alternative means of active warning to 
highway users of approaching trains. (This failure indicates to the 
motorist that it is safe to proceed across the railroad tracks when, in 
fact, it is not safe to do so.) A grade crossing signal system does not 
indicate the approach of a train within the meaning of this paragraph 
if--more than 50% of the flashing lights (not gate arm lights) on any 
approach lane to the crossing are not functioning as intended, or in the 
case of an approach lane for which two or more pairs of flashing lights 
are provided, there is not at least one flashing light pair operating as 
intended. Back lights on the far side of the crossing are not considered 
in making these determinations.
    ``Appropriately equipped flagger'' means a person other than a train 
crewmember who is equipped with a vest, shirt, or jacket of a color 
appropriate for daytime flagging such as orange, yellow, strong yellow 
green or fluorescent versions of these colors or other generally 
accepted high visibility colors. For nighttime flagging, similar outside 
garments shall be retro reflective. Acceptable hand signal devices for 
daytime flagging include `` STOP/SLOW'' paddles or red flags. For 
nighttime flagging, a flashlight, lantern, or other lighted signal shall 
be used. Inasmuch as Part VI of the Federal Highway Administration's 
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices addresses standards and guides 
for flaggers and flagging equipment for highway traffic control, FRA 
recommends that railroads be aware of the standards and

[[Page 341]]

follow them to the greatest extent possible. Copies of the latest MUTCD 
provisions regarding flagging will be available from FRA, as well as 
FHWA, as changes are made in this area.
    ``Credible report of system malfunction'' means specific information 
regarding a malfunction at an identified highway-rail crossing, supplied 
by a railroad employee, law enforcement officer, highway traffic 
official, or other employee of a public agency acting in an official 
capacity.
    ``False activation'' means the activation of a highway-rail grade 
crossing warning system caused by a condition that requires correction 
or repair of the grade crossing warning system. (This failure indicates 
to the motorist that it is not safe to cross the railroad tracks when, 
in fact, it is safe to do so.)
    ``Highway-rail grade crossing'' means a location where a public 
highway, road, street, or private roadway, including associated 
sidewalks and pathways, crosses one or more railroad tracks at grade.
    ``Partial activation'' means activation of a highway-rail grade 
crossing warning system indicating the approach of a train, however, the 
full intended warning is not provided due to one of the following 
conditions:
    (1) at non-gated crossings equipped with one pair of lights designed 
to flash alternately, one of the two lights does not operate properly 
(and approaching motorists can not clearly see flashing back lights from 
the warning lights on the other side of the crossing);
    (2) at gated crossings, the gate arm is not in a horizontal 
position; or
    (3) at gated crossings, any portion of a gate arm is missing if that 
portion normally had a gate arm flashing light attached.
    ``Train'' means one or more locomotives, with or without cars.
    ``Warning system malfunction'' means an activation failure, a 
partial activation, or a false activation of a highway-rail grade 
crossing warning system.


<R05>
Sec. 234.6  Penalties.

    (a) Civil penalty. Any person (including but not limited to a 
railroad; any manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent 
of a railroad; any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad 
equipment, track, or facilities; any employee of such owner, 
manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor) who violates 
any requirement of this part or causes the violation of any such 
requirement is subject to a civil penalty of at least $500, but not more 
than $10,000 per violation, except that: penalties may be assessed 
against individuals only for willful violations, and where a grossly 
negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violations has created an 
imminent hazard of death or injury to persons, or has caused death or 
injury, a penalty not to exceed $20,000 per violation may be assessed. 
Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. 
Appendix A to this part contains a schedule of civil penalty amounts 
used in connection with this rule. The railroad is not responsible for 
compliance with respect to any condition inconsistent with the technical 
standards set forth in this part where such variance arises as a result 
of actions beyond the control of the railroad and the railroad could not 
have prevented the variance through the exercise of due diligence. The 
foregoing sentence does not excuse any instance of noncompliance 
resulting from the actions of the railroad's employees, agents, or 
contractors.
    (b) Criminal penalty. Whoever knowingly and willfully makes, causes 
to be made, or participates in the making of a false entry in reports 
required to be filed by this part, or files a false report or other 
document required to be filed by this part is subject to a $5,000 fine 
and 2 years imprisonment as prescribed by 49 U.S.C. 522(a) and section 
209(e) of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970, as amended (45 U.S.C. 
438(e)).


<R04>
                           Subpart B--Reports


<R05>
Sec. 234.7  Accidents involving grade crossing signal failure.

    (a) Each railroad shall report to FRA every impact between on-track 
railroad equipment and an automobile, bus, truck, motorcycle, bicycle, 
farm vehicle, or pedestrian at a highway-rail grade crossing involving 
an activation failure. Notification shall be provided to the National 
Response Center within

[[Page 342]]

24 hours of occurrence at (800) 424-0201. Complete reports shall 
thereafter be filed with FRA pursuant to Sec. 234.9 of this part 
(activation failure report) and 49 CFR 225.11 (accident/ incident 
report).
    (b) Each telephone report must state the:
    (1) Name of the railroad;
    (2) Name, title, and telephone number of the individual making the 
report;
    (3) Time, date, and location of accident;
    (4) U. S. DOT-AAR Grade Crossing Identification Number;
    (5) Circumstances of the accident, including operating details of 
the grade crossing warning device;
    (6) Number of persons killed or injured, if any;
    (7) Maximum authorized train speed; and
    (8) Posted highway speed limit, if known.


<R05>
Sec. 234.9  Grade crossing signal system failure reports.

    Each railroad shall report to FRA within 15 days each activation 
failure of a highway-rail grade crossing warning system. FRA Form No. 
6180-83, ``Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Warning System Failure Report,'' 
shall be used for this purpose and completed in accordance with 
instructions printed on the form.


<R04>
      Subpart C--Response to Reports of Warning System Malfunction


<R05>
Sec. 234.101  Employee notification rules.

    Each railroad shall issue rules requiring its employees to report to 
persons designated by that railroad, by the quickest means available, 
any warning system malfunction.


<R05>
Sec. 234.103  Timely response to report of malfunction.

    (a) Upon receipt of a credible report of a warning system 
malfunction, a railroad having maintenance responsibility for the 
warning system shall promptly investigate the report and determine the 
nature of the malfunction. The railroad shall take appropriate action as 
required by Sec. 234.207.
    (b) Until repair or correction of the warning system is completed, 
the railroad shall provide alternative means of warning highway traffic 
and railroad employees in accordance with Secs. 234.105, 234.106 or 
234.107 of this part.
    (c) Nothing in this subpart requires repair of a warning system, if, 
acting in accordance with applicable State law, the railroad proceeds to 
discontinue or dismantle the warning system. However, until repair, 
correction, discontinuance, or dismantling of the warning system is 
completed, the railroad shall comply with this subpart to ensure the 
safety of the traveling public and railroad employees.


<R05>
Sec. 234.105  Activation failure.

    Upon receipt of a credible report of warning system malfunction 
involving an activation failure, a railroad having maintenance 
responsibility for the warning system shall promptly initiate efforts to 
warn highway users and railroad employees at the subject crossing by 
taking the following actions:
    (a) Prior to any train's arrival at the crossing, notify the train 
crew of the report of activation failure and notify any other railroads 
operating over the crossing;
    (b) Notify the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the 
crossing, or railroad police capable of responding and controlling 
vehicular traffic; and
    (c) Provide for alternative means of actively warning highway users 
of approaching trains, consistent with the following requirements (see 
appendix B for a summary chart of alternative means of warning):
    (1)(i) If an appropriately equipped flagger provides warning for 
each direction of highway traffic, trains may proceed through the 
crossing at normal speed.
    (ii) If at least one uniformed law enforcement officer (including a 
railroad police officer) provides warning to highway traffic at the 
crossing, trains may proceed through the crossing at normal speed.
    (2) If an appropriately equipped flagger provides warning for 
highway traffic, but there is not at least one flagger providing warning 
for each direction of highway traffic, trains may

[[Page 343]]

proceed with caution through the crossing at a speed not exceeding 15 
miles per hour. Normal speed may be resumed after the locomotive has 
passed through the crossing.
    (3) If there is not an appropriately equipped flagger or uniformed 
law enforcement officer providing warning to highway traffic at the 
crossing, each train must stop before entering the crossing and permit a 
crewmember to dismount to flag highway traffic to a stop. The locomotive 
may then proceed through the crossing, and the flagging crewmember may 
reboard the locomotive before the remainder of the train proceeds 
through the crossing.
    (d) A locomotive's audible warning device shall be activated in 
accordance with railroad rules regarding the approach to a grade 
crossing.


<R05>
Sec. 234.106  Partial activation.

    Upon receipt of a credible report of a partial activation, a 
railroad having maintenance responsibility for the warning system shall 
promptly initiate efforts to warn highway users and railroad employees 
at the subject crossing in the same manner as required for false 
activations (Sec. 234.107).


<R05>
Sec. 234.107  False activation.

    Upon receipt of a credible report of a false activation, a railroad 
having maintenance responsibility for the highway-rail grade crossing 
warning system shall promptly initiate efforts to warn highway users and 
railroad employees at the crossing by taking the following actions:
    (a) Prior to a train's arrival at the crossing, notify the train 
crew of the report of false activation and notify any other railroads 
operating over the crossing;
    (b) Notify the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the 
crossing, or railroad police capable of responding and controlling 
vehicular traffic; and
    (c) Provide for alternative means of actively warning highway users

[[Page 391]]

    (c) The qualifications for locomotive engineers prescribed in this 
part are pertinent to any person who operates a locomotive, unless that 
person is specifically excluded by a provision of this part, regardless 
of the fact that a person may have a job classification title other than 
that of locomotive engineer.

    (a) By issuance of these regulations, FRA intends to preempt any 
State law, rule, regulation, order, or standard covering the same 
subject matter in accordance with the provisions of section 205 of the 
Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 434).
    (b) FRA does not intend by issuance of these regulations to preempt 
any provisions of State criminal law that impose sanctions for reckless 
conduct that leads to actual loss of life, injury, or damage to 
property, whether such provisions apply specifically to railroad 
employees or generally to the public at large.
    (c) FRA does not intend, by use of the term ``locomotive engineer'' 
in this part, to preempt or otherwise alter the terms, conditions, or 
interpretation of existing collective bargaining agreements that employ 
other job classification titles when identifying persons authorized by a 
railroad to operate a locomotive.
    (d) FRA does not intend by issuance of these regulations to preempt 
or otherwise alter the authority of a railroad to initiate disciplinary 
sanctions against its employees, including managers and supervisors, in 
the normal and customary manner, including those contained in its 
collective bargaining agreements.
    (e) Nothing in this part shall be construed to create an eligibility 
or entitlement to employment in other service for the railroad as a 
result of denial, suspension, or revocation of certification under this 
part.

person's prior safety conduct as a railroad employee and the person's 
prior safety conduct as an operator of a motor vehicle, provided that 
there is relevant prior conduct. The information to be evaluated shall 
include:
    (1) The relevant data furnished from the evaluating railroad's own 
records, if the person was previously an employee of that railroad;
    (2) The relevant data furnished by any other railroad formerly 
employing the person; and
    (3) The relevant data furnished by any governmental agency with 
pertinent motor vehicle driving records.
    (d) The railroad's process for evaluating information concerning 
prior safety conduct shall be designed to conform wherever necessary 
with the procedural requirements of Sec. 240.111, Sec. 240.113, 
Sec. 240.115, Sec. 240.117, Sec. 240.119, and Sec. 240.217.
    (e) When eva1uating a person's motor vehicle driving record or a 
person's railroad employment record, a railroad shall not consider 
information concerning motor vehicle driving incidents or prior railroad 
safety conduct that
    (1) Occurred prior to the effective date of this rule; or
    (2) Occurred at a time other than that specifically provided for in 
Sec. 240.115, Sec. 240.117 or Sec. 240.119 of this subpart.
    (f) A railroad's program shall provide a candidate for certification 
or recertification a reasonable opportunity to review and comment in 
writing on any record which contains information concerning the person's 
prior safety conduct, including information pertinent to determinations 
required under Sec. 240.119 of this subpart, if the railroad believes 
the record contains information that could be sufficient to render the 
person ineligible for certification under this subpart.
    (g) The opportunity for comment shall be afforded to the person 
prior to the railroad's rendering its eligibility decision based on that 
information. Any responsive comment furnished shall be retained by the 
railroad in accordance with Sec. 240.215 of this part.
    (h) The program shall include a method for a person to advise the 
railroad that he or she has never been a railroad employee or obtained a 
license to drive a motor vehicle. Nothing in this section shall be 
construed as imposing a duty or requirement that a person have prior 
railroad employment experience or obtain a motor vehicle driver's 
license in order to become a certified locomotive engineer.
    (i) Nothing in this section, Sec. 240.111, or Sec. 240.113 shall be 
construed to prevent persons subject to this part from entering into an 
agreement that results in a railroad's obtaining the information needed 
for compliance with this subpart in a different manner than that 
prescribed in Sec. 240.111 or Sec. 240.113.

consistent with those specified for reasonable cause breath testing 
under subpart C of part 219 of this chapter; or
    (ii) Analysis of a blood specimen for alcohol in the same manner as 
prescribed in Sec. 219.303 of this chapter. Alcohol tests shall be 
conducted while the employee is in duty status. However, this paragraph 
shall not be construed to require compensation of an employee or 
applicant for any period devoted exclusively to such tests.
    (5) Satisfaction of the more stringent return-to-service 
requirements of this paragraph shall also be deemed to satisfy the 
requirements of Sec. 219.104(d) of this chapter.
    (6) This paragraph does not create an entitlement to utilize the 
services of a railroad EAP Counselor, to be afforded leave from 
employment for counseling or treatment, or to employment as a locomotive 
engineer. Nor does it restrict any discretion available to the railroad 
to take disciplinary action based on conduct described herein.
    (e) Confidentiality protected. Nothing in this part shall affect the 
responsibility of the railroad under Sec. 219.403 of this chapter 
(``Voluntary Referral Policy'') to treat voluntary referrals for 
substance abuse counseling and treatment as confidential; and the 
certification status of an engineer who is successfully assisted under 
the procedures of that section shall not be adversely affected. However, 
the railroad shall include in its voluntary referral policy required to 
be issued pursuant to Sec. 219.403 of this chapter a provision that, at 
least with respect to a certified locomotive engineer or a candidate for 
certification, the policy of confidentiality is waived (to the extent 
that the railroad shall receive from the EAP Counselor official notice 
of the substance abuse disorder and shall suspend or revoke the 
certification, as appropriate) if the person at any time refuses to 
cooperate in a recommended course of counseling or treatment.

Sec. 240.227  Reliance on qualification requirements of other countries.

    (a) A railroad that conducts joint operations with a Canadian 
railroad may certify, for the purposes of compliance with this part, 
that a person is qualified to be a locomotive or train service engineer 
provided it determines that:
    (1) The person is employed by the Canadian railroad; and
    (2) The person meets or exceeds the qualifications standards issued 
by Transport Canada for such service.
    (b) Any Canadian railroad that is required to comply with this 
regulation may certify that a person is qualified

[[Page 411]]

to be a locomotive or train service engineer provided it determines 
that:
    (1) The person is employed by the Canadian railroad; and
    (2) The person meets or exceeds the qualifications standards issued 
by Transport Canada for such service.


<R05>
Sec. 240.229  Requirements for joint operations territory.

    (a) Except for minimal joint operations provided for in paragraph 
(f) of this section, no railroad that is responsible for controlling the 
conduct of joint operations with another railroad shall permit or 
require any person to operate a locomotive in any class of train or 
engine service unless that person has been certified as a qualified 
locomotive engineer for the purposes of joint operations and issued a 
certificate that complies with Sec. 240.223.
    (b) Each railroad that is responsible for controlling the conduct of 
joint operations with another railroad shall certify a person as a 
qualified locomotive engineer for the purposes of joint operations 
either by making the determinations required under subpart C of this 
part or by relying on the certification issued by another railroad under 
this part.
    (c) If the controlling railroad relies on the certification issued 
by another railroad, the controlling railroad shall determine:
    (1) That the person has been certified as a qualified engineer under 
the provisions of this part by the railroad which employs that 
individual;
    (2) That the person certified as a locomotive engineer by the other 
railroad has demonstrated the necessary knowledge concerning the 
controlling railroad's operating rules, if the rules are different;
    (3) That the person certified as a locomotive engineer by the other 
railroad has the necessary operating skills concerning the joint 
operations territory; and
    (4) That the person certified as a locomotive engineer by the other 
railroad has the necessary familiarity with the physical characteristics 
for the joint operations territory.
    (d) A railroad that controls joint operations and certifies 
locomotive engineers from a different railroad may comply with the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by noting its supplemental 
certification decision on the original certificate as provided for in 
Sec. 240.223(c).
    (e) A railroad responsible for controlling the conduct of joint 
operations with another railroad shall be deemed to be in compliance 
with paragraph (a) of this section when it provides a qualified person 
to accompany a locomotive engineer who lacks joint operations 
certification during that engineer's operations in joint operations 
territory. As used in this section qualified person means either a 
designated supervisor of locomotive engineers or a certified train 
service engineer determined by the controlling railroad to have the 
necessary knowledge concerning the controlling railroad's operating 
rules and to have the necessary operating skills including familiarity 
with its physical characteristics concerning the joint operations 
territory.
    (f) A railroad that is responsible for controlling the conduct of 
joint operations with another railroad may permit a certified locomotive 
engineer to operate a locomotive in any class of train or engine service 
without determining that the person has been certified as a qualified 
locomotive engineer for the purposes of joint operations when a minimal 
joint operation is involved. For the purposes of this section a minimal 
joint operation exists when a locomotive or train belonging to one 
railroad is being operated on the same track on which operations are 
conducted by the railroad controlling operations, under the following 
conditions:
    (1) The maximum authorized speed for operations on the track does 
not exceed 20 miles per hour;
    (2) The track is other than a main track;
    (3) Operations are conducted under operating rules that require 
every locomotive and train to proceed at a speed that permits stopping 
within one half the range of vision of the locomotive engineer; and
    (4) The maximum distance for joint operations on the track does not 
exceed one mile.

    (a) After December 31, 1991, each railroad to which this part 
applies shall, prior to FRA approval of its program in accordance with 
Sec. 240.201, have a program to monitor the conduct of its certified 
locomotive engineers by performing both operational monitoring 
observations and by conducting unannounced operating rules compliance 
tests.
    (b) The program shall be conducted so that each locomotive engineer 
shall be given at least one operational monitoring observation by a 
qualified supervisor of locomotive engineers in each calendar year.
    (c) The program shall be conducted so that each locomotive engineer 
shall be given at least one unannounced compliance test each calendar 
year.
    (d) The unannounced test program shall:
    (1) Test engineer compliance with one or more provisions of the 
railroad's operating rules that require response to signals that display 
less than a ``clear'' aspect, if the railroad operates with a signal 
system that must comply with part 236 of this chapter;
    (2) Test engineer compliance with one or more provisions of the 
railroad's operating rules, timetable or other mandatory directives that 
require affirmative response by the locomotive engineer to less 
favorable conditions than that which existed prior to initiation of the 
test;
    (3) Test engineer compliance with provisions of the railroad's 
operating rules, timetable or other mandatory directives the violations 
of which by engineers were cited by the railroad as the cause of train 
accidents or train incidents in accident reports filed in compliance 
with part 225 of this chapter for the preceding year;
    (4) Be conducted that so that the administration of these tests is 
effectively distributed throughout whatever portion of a 24-hour day 
that the railroad conducts its operations;
    (5) Be conducted so that individual tests are administered without 
prior notice to the locomotive engineer being tested; and
    (6) Be conducted so that the results of the test are recorded on the 
certificate and entered on the record established under Sec. 240.215 
within 30 days of the day the test is administered.

an engineer; and
    (2) Display that certificate upon the receipt of a request to do so 
from
    (i) A representative of the Federal Railroad Administration,
    (ii) An officer of the issuing railroad, or
    (iii) An officer of another railroad when operating a locomotive or 
train in joint operations territory.
    (c) Any locomotive engineer who is notified or called to operate a 
locomotive or train and such operation would cause the locomotive 
engineer to exceed certificate limitations, set forth in accordance with 
subpart B of this part, shall immediately notify the railroad that he or 
she is not qualified to perform that anticipated service and it shall be 
unlawful for the railroad to require such service.

[[Page 413]]

    (d) During the duration of any certification interval, a locomotive 
engineer who has a current certificate from more than one railroad shall 
immediately notify the other certifying railroad(s) if he or she is 
denied recertification by a railroad or has his or her certification 
revoked by a railroad.
    (e) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to alter a certified 
locomotive engineer's duty to comply with other provisions of this 
chapter concerning railroad safety.

    (6) Retain the record of the hearing for 3 years after the date the 
decision is rendered.
    (c) Except as provided for in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this 
section, a hearing required by this section shall be conducted in 
accordance with the following procedures:
    (1) The hearing shall be convened within 10 days of the date the 
certificate is suspended unless the locomotive engineer requests or 
consents to delay in the start of the hearing.
    (2) The hearing shall be conducted by a presiding officer, who can 
be any qualified person authorized by the railroad other than the 
charging officer.
    (3) The presiding officer will exercise the powers necessary to 
regulate the conduct of the hearing for the purpose of achieving a 
prompt and fair determination of all material issues in controversy.
    (4) The presiding officer shall convene and preside over the 
hearing.
    (5) Testimony by witnesses at the hearing shall be recorded 
verbatim.
    (6) All relevant and probative evidence shall be received unless the 
presiding officer determines the evidence to be unduly repetitive or so 
extensive and lacking in relevancy that its admission would impair the 
prompt, orderly, and fair resolution of the proceeding.
    (7) The presiding officer may:
    (i) Adopt any needed procedures for the submission of evidence in 
written form;
    (ii) Examine witnesses at the hearing;
    (iii) Convene, recess, adjourn or otherwise regulate the course of

including testimony and may conduct such examination of witnesses as may 
be required for a full disclosure of the relevant facts.
    (9) The record in the proceeding shall be closed at conclusion of 
the hearing unless the presiding officer allows additional time for the 
submission of information. In such instances the record

[[Page 414]]

shall be left open for such time as the presiding officer grants for 
that purpose.
    (10) At the close of the record, the presiding officer shall prepare 
a written decision in the proceeding.
    (11) The decision shall:
    (i) Contain the findings of fact as well as the basis therefor, 
concerning all material issues of fact presented on the record; and
    (ii) Be served on the employee.
    (12) The railroad shall have the burden of proving that the 
locomotive engineer's conduct was not in compliance with the applicable 
railroad operating rule or practice or part 219 of this chapter.
    (d) A hearing required by this section which is conducted in a 
manner that conforms procedurally to the applicable collective 
bargaining agreement shall be deemed to satisfy the procedural 
requirements of this section.
    (e) A hearing required under this section may be consolidated with 
any disciplinary or other hearing arising from the same facts, but in 
all instances the presiding officer for the hearing shall make separate 
findings as to the revocation required under this section.
    (f) A person may waive the right to the hearing provided under this 
section. That waiver shall:
    (1) Be made in writing;
    (2) Reflect the fact that the person has knowledge and understanding 
of these rights and voluntarily surrenders them; and
    (3) Be signed by the person making the waiver.
    (g) A railroad that has relied on the certification by another 
railroad under the provisions of Sec. 240.227 or Sec. 240.229, shall 
revoke its certification if, during the period that certification is 
valid, the railroad acquires information which convinces it that another 
railroad has revoked its certification after determining, in accordance 
with the provisions of this section, that the person no longer meets the 
qualification requirements of this part. The requirement to provide a 
hearing under this section is satisfied when any single railroad holds a 
hearing and no additional hearing is required prior to a revocation by 
more than one railroad arising from the same facts.
    (h) The period of certificate suspension prior to the commencement 
of a hearing required under this section shall be credited towards 
satisfying any applicable revocation period imposed in accordance with 
the provisions of Sec. 240.117.

Administrator to regulate the conduct of the hearing for the purpose of 
achieving a prompt and fair determination of all material issues in 
controversy.
    (c) The presiding officer shall convene and preside over the 
hearing. The hearing shall be a de novo hearing to find the relevant 
facts and determine the correct application of this part to those facts. 
The presiding officer may determine that there is no genuine issue 
covering some or all material facts and limit evidentiary proceedings to 
any issues of material fact as to which there is a genuine dispute.
    (d) The presiding officer may authorize discovery of the types and 
quantities which in the presiding officer's discretion will contribute 
to a fair hearing without unduly burdening the parties. The presiding 
officer may impose appropriate non-monetary sanctions, including 
limitations as to the presentation of evidence and issues, for any 
party's willful failure or refusal to comply with approved discovery 
requests.
    (e) Every petition, motion, response, or other authorized or 
required document shall be signed by the party filing the same, or by a 
duly authorized officer or representative of record, or by any other 
person. If signed by such other person, the reason therefor must be 
stated and the power of attorney or other authority authorizing such 
other person to subscribe the document must be filed with the document. 
The signature of the person subscribing any document constitutes a 
certification that he or she has read the document; that to the best of 
his or her knowledge, information and belief every statement contained 
in the document is true and no such statements are misleading; and that 
it is not interposed for delay or to be vexatious.
    (f) After the request for a hearing is filed, all documents filed or 
served upon one party must be served upon all parties. Each party may 
designate a person upon whom service is to be made when not specified by 
law, regulation, or directive of the presiding officer. If a party does 
not designate a person upon whom service is to be made, then service may 
be made upon any person having subscribed to a submission of the party 
being served, unless otherwise specified by law, regulation, or 
directive of the presiding officer. Proof of service shall accompany all 
documents when they are tendered for filing.

[[Page 418]]

    (g) If any document initiating, filed, or served in, a proceeding is 
not in substantial compliance with the applicable law, regulation, or 
directive of the presiding officer, the presiding officer may strike or 
dismiss all or part of such document, or require its amendment.
    (h) Any party to a proceeding may appear and be heard in person or 
by an authorized representative.
    (i) Any person testifying at a hearing or deposition may be 
accompanied, represented, and advised by an attorney or other 
representative, and may be examined by that person.
    (j) Any party may request to consolidate or separate the hearing of 
two or more petitions by motion to the presiding officer, when they 
arise from the same or similar facts or when the matters are for any 
reason deemed more efficiently heard together.
    (k) Except as provided in Sec. 240.407(c) of this part and paragraph 
(u)(4) of this section, whenever a party has the right or is required to 
take action within a period prescribed by this part, or by law, 
regulation, or directive of the presiding officer, the presiding officer 
may extend such period, with or without notice, for good cause, provided 
another party is not substantially prejudiced by such extension. A 
request to extend a period which has already expired may be denied as 
untimely.
    (l) An application to the presiding officer for an order or ruling 
not otherwise specifically provided for in this part shall be by motion. 
The motion shall be filed with the presiding officer and, if written, 
served upon all parties. All motions, unless made during the hearing, 
shall be written. Motions made during hearings may be made orally on the 
record, except that the presiding officer may direct that any oral 
motion be reduced to writing. Any motion shall state with particularity 
the grounds therefor and the relief or order sought, and shall be 
accompanied by any affidavits or other evidence desired to be relied 
upon which is not already part of the record. Any matter submitted in 
response to a written motion must be filed and served within fourteen 
(14) days of the motion, or within such other period as directed by the 
presiding officer.
    (m) Testimony by witnesses at the hearing shall be given under oath 
and the hearing shall be recorded verbatim. The presiding officer shall 
give the parties to the proceeding adequate opportunity during the 
course of the hearing for the presentation of arguments in support of or 
in opposition to motions, and objections and exceptions to rulings of 
the presiding officer. The presiding officer may permit oral argument on 
any issues for which the presiding officer deems it appropriate and 
beneficial. Any evidence or argument received or proffered orally shall 
be transcribed and made a part of the record. Any physical evidence or 
written argument received or proffered shall be made a part of the 
record, except that the presiding officer may authorize the substitution 
of copies, photographs, or descriptions, when deemed to be appropriate.
    (n) The presiding officer shall employ the Federal Rules of Evidence 
for United States Courts and Magistrates as general guidelines for the 
introduction of evidence. Notwithstanding paragraph (m) of this section, 
all relevant and probative evidence shall be received unless the 
presiding officer determines the evidence to be unduly repetitive or so 
extensive and lacking in relevancy that its admission would impair the 
prompt, orderly, and fair resolution of the proceeding.
    (o) The presiding officer may:
    (1) Administer oaths and affirmations;
    (2) Issue subpoenas as provided for in Sec. 209.7 of part 209 in 
this chapter;
    (3) Adopt any needed procedures for the submission of evidence in 
written form;
    (4) Examine witnesses at the hearing;
    (5) Convene, recess, adjourn or otherwise regulate the course of the 
hearing; and
    (6) Take any other action authorized by or consistent with the 
provisions of this part and permitted by law that may expedite the 
hearing or aid in the disposition of the proceeding.
    (p) The petitioner before the Locomotive Engineer Review Board, the 
railroad involved in taking the certification action, and FRA shall be 
parties at the hearing. All parties may participate in the hearing and 
may appear

[[Page 419]]

and be heard on their own behalf or through designated representatives. 
All parties may offer relevant evidence, including testimony, and may 
conduct such cross-examination of witnesses as may be required to make a 
record of the relevant facts.
    (q) The party requesting the administrative hearing shall be the 
``hearing petitioner.'' The hearing petitioner shall have the burden of 
proving its case by a preponderance of the evidence. Hence, if the 
hearing petitioner is the railroad involved in taking the certification 
action, that railroad will have the burden of proving that its decision 
to deny certification, deny recertification, or revoke certification was 
correct. Conversely, if the petitioner before the Locomotive Engineer 
Review Board is the hearing petitioner, that person will have the burden 
of proving that the railroad's decision to deny certification, deny 
recertification, or revoke certification was incorrect. Between the 
petitioner before the Locomotive Engineer Review Board and the railroad 
involved in taking the certification action, the party who is not the 
hearing petitioner will be a respondent.
    (r) FRA will be a mandatory party to the administrative hearing. At 
the start of each proceeding, FRA will be a respondent.
    (s) The record in the proceeding shall be closed at the conclusion 
of the evidentiary hearing unless the presiding officer allows 
additional time for the submission of additional evidence. In such 
instances the record shall be left open for such time as the presiding 
officer grants for that purpose.
    (t) At the close of the record, the presiding officer shall prepare 
a written decision in the proceeding.
    (u) The decision:
    (1) Shall contain the findings of fact and conclusions of law, as 
well as the basis for each concerning all material issues of fact or law 
presented on the record;
    (2) Shall be served on the hearing petitioner and all other parties 
to the proceeding;
    (3) Shall not become final for 35 days after issuance;
    (4) Constitutes final agency action unless an aggrieved party files 
an appeal within 35 days after issuance; and
    (5) Is not precedential.

<R05>
Sec. 240.411  Appeals.

    (a) Any party aggrieved by the presiding officer's decision may file 
an appeal. The appeal must be filed within 35 days of issuance of the 
decision with the Federal Railroad Administrator, 400 Seventh Street 
SW., Washington, DC 20590. A copy of the appeal shall be served on each 
party. The appeal shall set forth objections to the presiding officer's 
decision, supported by reference to applicable laws and regulations and 
with specific reference to the record. If no appeal is timely filed, the 
presiding officer's decision constitutes final agency action.
    (b) A party may file a reply to the appeal within 25 days of service 
of the appeal. The reply shall be supported by reference to applicable 
laws and regulations and with specific reference to the record, if the 
party relies on evidence contained in the record.
    (c) The Administrator may extend the period for filing an appeal or 
a response for good cause shown, provided that the written request for 
extension is served before expiration of the applicable period provided 
in this section.
    (d) The Administrator has sole discretion to permit oral argument on 
the appeal. On the Administrator's own initiative or written motion by 
any party, the Administrator may grant the parties an opportunity for 
oral argument.
    (e) The Administrator may affirm, reverse, alter or modify the 
decision of the presiding officer and the Administrator's decision 
constitutes final agency action.

   Appendix B to Part 240--Procedures for Submission and Approval of 
               Locomotive Engineer Qualification Programs

    This appendix establishes procedures for the submission and approval 
of a railroad's program concerning the training, testing, and evaluating 
of persons seeking certification or recertification as a locomotive 
engineer in accordance with the requirements of this part (see 
Secs. 240.101, 240.103, 240.105, 240.107, 240.123, 240.125, 240.127 and 
240.129). lt also contains guidance on how FRA will exercise its review 
and approval responsibilities.

                        Submission by a Railroad

    As provided for in Sec. 240.101, each railroad must have a program 
for determining the qualifications of each person it permits or requires 
to operate a locomotive. In designing its program a railroad must take 
into account the trackage and terrain over which it operates, the 
system(s) for train control that are employed, the operational design 
characteristics of the track and equipment being operated including 
train length, train makeup, and train speeds. Each railroad must submit 
its individual program to FRA for approval as provided for in 
Sec. 240.103. Each program must be accompanied by a request for approval 
organized in accordance with this appendix. Requests for approval must 
contain appropriate references to the relevant portion of the program 
being discussed. Requests should be submitted in writing on standard 
sized paper (8-1/2 x 11) and can be in letter or narrative format. The 
railroad's submission shall be sent to the Associate Administrator for 
Safety, FRA. The mailing address for FRA is 400 Seventh Street, SW., 
Washington, DC 20590.

                     Organization of the Submission

    Each request should be organized to present the required information 
in the following standardized manner. Each section must begin by giving 
the name, title, telephone number, and mailing address of the person to 
be contacted concerning the matters addressed by that section. If a 
person is identified in a prior section, it is sufficient to merely 
repeat the person's name in a subsequent section.

     Section 1 of the Submission: General Information and Elections

    The first section of the request must contain the name of the 
railroad, the person to be contacted concerning the request (including 
the person's name, title, telephone number, and mailing address) and a 
statement electing either to accept responsibility for educating 
previously untrained persons to be qualified locomotive engineers or 
recertify only engineers previously certified by other railroads (see 
Sec. 240.103(b)).
    If a railroad elects not to conduct the training of persons not 
previously trained to be a locomotive engineer, the railroad is not 
obligated to submit information on how the previously untrained will be 
trained. A railroad that makes this election will be limited to 
recertifying persons initially certified by another railroad. A railroad 
that initially elects not to accept responsibility for training its own 
locomotive engineers can rescind its initial election by obtaining FRA 
approval of a modification of its program (see Sec. 240.103(e)).
    If a railroad elects to accept responsibility for conducting the 
education of persons not previously trained to be locomotive engineers, 
the railroad is obligated to submit information on how such persons will 
be trained but has no duty to actually conduct such training. A railroad 
that elects to accept the responsibility for the training of such 
persons may authorize another railroad or a non-railroad entity to 
perform the actual training effort. The electing railroad remains 
responsible for assuring that such

[[Page 423]]

other training providers adhere to the training program the railroad 
submits.
    This section must also state which class or classes of service the 
railroad will employ. (See Sec. 240.107).

  Section 2 of the Submission: Selection of Supervisors of Locomotive 
                                Engineers

    The second section of the request must contain information 
concerning the railroad's procedure for selecting the person or persons 
it will rely on to evaluate the knowledge, skill, and ability of persons 
seeking certification or recertification. As provided for in 
Sec. 240.105 each railroad must have a procedure for selecting 
supervisors of locomotive engineers which assures that persons so 
designated can appropriately test and evaluate the knowledge, skill, and 
ability of individuals seeking certification or recertification.
    Section 240.105 provides a railroad latitude to select the criteria 
and evaluation methodology it will rely on to determine which person or 
persons have the required capacity to perform as a supervisor of 
locomotive engineers. The railroad must describe in this section how it 
will use that latitude and evaluate those it designates as supervisors 
of locomotive engineers so as to comply with the performance standard 
set forth in Sec. 240.105(b). The railroad must identify, in sufficient 
detail to permit effective review by FRA, the criteria for evaluation it 
has selected. For example, if a railroad intends to rely on one or more 
of the following, a minimum level of prior experience as an engineer, 
successful completion of a course of study, or successful passage of a 
standardized testing program, the submission must state which criteria 
it will employ.

   Section 3 of the Submission: Training Persons Previously Certified

    The third section of the request must contain information concerning 
the railroad's program for training previously certified locomotive 
engineers. As provided for in Sec. 240.123(b) each railroad must have a 
program for the ongoing education of its locomotive engineers to assure 
that they maintain the necessary knowledge concerning personal safety, 
operating rules and practices, mechanical condition of equipment, 
methods of safe train handling (including familiarity with physical 
characteristics), and relevant Federal safety rules.
    Section 240.123(b) provides a railroad latitude to select the 
specific subject matter to be covered, duration of the training, method 
of presenting the information, and the frequency with which the training 
will be provided. The railroad must describe in this section how it will 
use that latitude to assure that its engineers remain knowledgeable 
concerning the safe discharge of their train operation responsibilities 
so as to comply with the performance standard set forth in 
Sec. 240.123(b). This section must contain sufficient detail to permit 
effective evaluation of the railroad's training program in terms of the 
subject matter covered, the frequency and duration of the training 
sessions, the training environment employed (for example, and use of 
classroom, use of computer based training, use of simulators, use of 
film or slide presentations, use of on-job-training) and which aspects 
of the program are voluntary or mandatory.
    Safe train handling involves both abstract knowledge about the 
appropriate use of engine controls and the application of that knowledge 
to trains of differing composition traversing varying terrain. Time and 
circumstances have the capacity to diminish both abstract knowledge and 
the proper application of that knowledge to discrete events. Time and 
circumstances also have the capacity to alter the value of previously 
obtained knowledge and the application of that knowledge. In formulating 
how it will use the discretion being afforded, each railroad must design 
its program to address both loss of retention of knowledge and changed 
circumstances, and this section of the submission to FRA must address 
these matters.
    For example, locomotive engineers need to have their fundamental 
knowledge of train operations refreshed periodically. Each railroad 
needs to advise FRA how that need is satisfied in terms of the interval 
between attendance at such training, the nature of the training being 
provided, and methods for conducting the training. A matter of 
particular concern to FRA is how each railroad acts to assure that 
engineers remain knowledgeable about safe train handling procedures if 
the territory over which a locomotive engineer is authorized to operate 
is territory from which the engineer has been absent. The railroad must 
have a plan for the familiarization training that addresses the question 
of how long a person can be absent before needing more education and, 
once that threshold is reached, how the person will acquire the needed 
education. Similarly, the program must address how the railroad responds 
to changes such as the introduction of new technology, new operating 
rule books, or significant changes in operations including alteration in 
the territory engineers are authorized to operate over.

 Section 4 of the Submission: Testing and Evaluating Persons Previously 
                                Certified

    The fourth section of the request must contain information 
concerning the railroad's program for testing and evaluating previously 
certified locomotive engineers. As provided for in Sec. 240.125 and 
Sec. 240.127, each railroad must have a program for the ongoing testing 
and evaluating of its locomotive

[[Page 424]]

engineers to assure that they have the necessary knowledge and skills 
concerning personal safety, operating rules and practices, mechanical 
condition of equipment, methods of safe train handling (including 
familiarity with physical characteristics), and relevant Federal safety 
rules. Similarly, each railroad must have a program for ongoing testing 
and evaluating to assure that its locomotive engineers have the 
necessary vision and hearing acuity as provided for in Sec. 240.121.
    Sections 240.125 and 240.127 require that a railroad rely on written 
procedures for determining that each person can demonstrate his or her 
knowledge of the railroad's rules and practices and skill at applying 
those rules and practices for the safe operation of a locomotive or 
train. Section 240.125 directs that, when seeking a demonstration of the 
person's knowledge, a railroad must employ a written test that contains 
objective questions and answers and covers the following subject 
matters: (i) Personal safety practices; (ii) operating practices; (iii) 
equipment inspection practices; (iv) train handling practices (including 
familiarity with the physical characteristics of the territory); and (v) 
compliance with relevant Federal safety rules. The test must accurately 
measure the person's knowledge of all of these areas.
    Section 240.125 provides a railroad latitude in selecting the design 
of its own testing policies (including the number of questions each test 
will contain, how each required subject matter will be covered, 
weighting (if any) to be given to particular subject matter responses, 
selection of passing scores, and the manner of presenting the test 
information). The railroad must describe in this section how it will use 
that latitude to assure that its engineers will demonstrate their 
knowledge concerning the safe discharge of their train operation 
responsibilities so as to comply with the performance standard set forth 
in Sec. 240.125.
    Section 240.127 directs that, when seeking a demonstration of the 
person's skill, a railroad must employ a test and evaluation procedure 
conducted by a designated supervisor of locomotive engineers that 
contains an objective evaluation of the person's skills at applying the 
railroad's rules and practices for the safe operation of trains. The 
test and evaluation procedure must examine the person's skills in terms 
of all of the following subject matters: (i) Operating practices; (ii) 
equipment inspection practices; (iii) train handling practices 
(including familiarity with the physical characteristics of the 
territory); and (iv) compliance with relevant Federal safety rules. The 
test must be sufficient to effectively examine the person's skills while 
operating a train in the most demanding type of service which the person 
is likely to encounter in the normal course of events once he or she is 
deemed qualified.
    Section 240.127 provides a railroad latitude in selecting the design 
of its own testing and evaluation procedures (including the duration of 
the evaluation process, how each required subject matter will be 
covered, weighing (if any) to be given to particular subject matter 
response, selection of passing scores, and the manner of presenting the 
test information). The section should provide information concerning the 
procedures which the railroad will follow that achieve the objectives 
described in FRA's recommended practices (see appendix E) for conducting 
skill performance testing. The section also gives a railroad the 
latitude to employ either a Type 1 or a Type 2 simulator (properly 
programmed) to conduct the test and evaluation procedure. A railroad 
must describe in this section how it will use that latitude to assure 
that its engineers will demonstrate their skills concerning the safe 
discharge of their train operation responsibilities so as to comply with 
the performance standard set forth in Sec. 240.127.
    Section 240.121 provides a railroad latitude to rely on the 
professional medical opinion of the railroad's medical examiner 
concerning the ability of a person with substandard acuity to safely 
operate a locomotive. The railroad must describe in this section how it 
will assure that its medical examiner has sufficient information 
concerning the railroad's operations to effectively form appropriate 
conclusions about the ability of a particular individual to safely 
operate a train.

 Section 5 of the Submission: Training, Testing, and Evaluating Persons 
                        Not Previously Certified

    Unless a railroad has made an election not to accept responsibility 
for conducting the initial training of persons to be locomotive 
engineers, the fifth section of the request must contain information 
concerning the railroad's program for educating, testing, and evaluating 
persons not previously trained as locomotive engineers. As provided for 
in Sec. 240.123(c), a railroad that is issuing an initial certification 
to a person to be a locomotive engineer must have a program for the 
training, testing, and evaluating of its locomotive engineers to assure 
that they acquire the necessary knowledge and skills concerning personal 
safety, operating rules and practices, mechanical condition of 
equipment, methods of safe train handling (including familiarity with 
physical characteristics), and relevant Federal safety rules.
    Section 240.123 establishes a performance standard and gives a 
railroad latitude in selecting how it will meet that standard. A 
railroad must describe in this section how it will use that latitude to 
assure that its engineers will acquire sufficient knowledge and skill 
and demonstrate their knowledge and skills concerning the safe discharge 
of their

[[Page 425]]

train operation responsibilities. This section must contain the same 
level of detail concerning initial training programs as that described 
for each of the components of the overall program contained in sections 
2 through 4 of this appendix. A railroad that plans to accept 
responsibility for the initial training of locomotive engineers may 
authorize another railroad or a non-railroad entity to perform the 
actual training effort. The authorizing railroad may submit a training 
program developed by that authorized trainer but the authorizing 
railroad remains responsible for assuring that such other training 
providers adhere to the training program submitted. Railroads that elect 
to rely on other entities, to conduct training away from the railroad's 
own trackage, must indicate how the student will be provided with the 
required familiarization with the physical characteristics for its 
trackage.

   Section 6 of the Submission: Monitoring Operational Performance by 
                           Certified Engineers

    The final section of the request must contain information concerning 
the railroad's program for monitoring the operation of its certified 
locomotive engineers. As provided for in Sec. 240.129, each railroad 
must have a program for the ongoing monitoring of its locomotive 
engineers to assure that they operate their locomotives in conformity 
with the railroad's operating rules and practices including methods of 
safe train handling and relevant Federal safety rules.
    Section 240.129 requires that a railroad annually observe each 
locomotive engineer demonstrating his or her knowledge of the railroad's 
rules and practices and skill at applying those rules and practices for 
the safe operation of a locomotive or train. Section 240.129 directs 
that the observation be conducted by a designated supervisor of 
locomotive engineers but provides a railroad latitude in selecting the 
design of its own observation procedures (including the duration of the 
observation process, reliance on tapes that record the specifics of 
train operation, and the specific aspects of the engineer's performance 
to be covered). The section also gives a railroad the latitude to employ 
either a Type 1 or a Type 2 simulator (properly programmed) to conduct 
monitoring observations. A railroad must describe in this section how it 
will use that latitude to assure that the railroad is monitoring that 
its engineers demonstrate their skills concerning the safe discharge of 
their train operation responsibilities. A railroad that intends to 
employ train operation event recorder tapes to comply with this 
monitoring requirement shall indicate in this section how it anticipates 
determining what person was at the controls and what signal indications 
or other operational constraints, if any, were applicable to the train's 
movement.

 Section 7 of the Submission: Procedures for Routine Administration of 
                   the Engineer Certification Program

    The final section of the request must contain a summary of how the 
railroad's program and procedures will implement the various specific 
aspects of the regulatory provisions that relate to routine 
administration of its certification program for locomotive engineers. At 
a minimum this section needs to address the procedural aspects of the 
rule's provisions identified in the following paragraph.
    Section 240.109 provides that each railroad must have procedures for 
review and comment on adverse prior safety conduct, but allows the 
railroad to devise its own system within generalized parameters. 
Sections 240.115, 240.117 and 240.119 require a railroad to have 
procedures for evaluating data concerning prior safety conduct as a 
motor vehicle operator and as railroad workers, yet leave selection of 
many details to the railroad. Sections 240.203, 240.217, and 240.219 
place a duty on the railroad to make a series of determinations but 
allow the railroad to select what procedures it will employ to assure 
that all of the necessary determinations have been made in a timely 
fashion; who will be authorized to conclude that person is or is not 
qualified; and how it will communicate adverse decisions. Documentation 
of the factual basis the railroad relied on in making determinations 
under Secs. 240.205, 240.207, 240.209, 240.211, and 240.213 is required, 
but these sections permit the railroad to select the procedures it will 
employ to accomplish compliance with these provisions. Sections 240.225 
and 240.227 permit reliance on qualification determinations made by 
other entities and permit a railroad latitude in selecting the 
procedures it will employ to assure compliance with these provisions. 
Similarly, Sec. 240.229 permits use of railroad selected procedures to 
meet the requirements for certification of engineers performing service 
in joint operations territory. Sections 240.301 and 240.307 allow a 
railroad a certain degree of discretion in complying with the 
requirements for replacing lost certificates or the conduct of 
certification revocation proceedings.
    This section of the request should outline in summary fashion the 
manner in which the railroad will implement its program so as to comply 
with the specific aspects of each of the rule's provisions described in 
preceding paragraph.

                               FRA Review

    The submissions made in conformity with this appendix will be deemed 
approved within 30 days after the required filing date or the actual 
filing date whichever is later. No formal approval document will be 
issued by FRA. The brief interval for review reflects

[[Page 426]]

FRA's judgment that railroads generally already have existing programs 
that will meet the requirements of this part. FRA has taken the 
responsibility for notifying a railroad when it detects problems with 
the railroad's program. FRA retains the right to disapprove a program 
that has obtained approval due to the passage of time as provided for in 
section Sec. 240.103.
    FRA initially proposed specifying the details for most aspects of 
the programs being submitted under this appendix. The proposed rule 
contained a distillation of the essential elements of pre-existing 
training, testing, evaluating, and monitoring programs that appear to 
result in railroads having locomotive engineers who operate locomotives 
and trains safely. The proposal contained very specific details for each 
aspect of the program that appeared to contribute to that result. Those 
details included such things as the duration of classes intended to 
teach operating rules as well as the interval and methodology for 
acquiring familiarization with physical characteristics of an engineer's 
operational territory. Railroads commenting on the proposed rule did not 
question the validity of the FRA's views concerning the essential 
elements of an effective program but did convince FRA that they should 
be given more discretion to formulate the design of their individual 
programs.
    Rather than establish rigid requirements for each element of the 
program as initially proposed, FRA has given railroads discretion to 
select the design of their individual programs within a specified 
context for each element. The proposed rule, however, provides a good 
guide to the considerations that should be addressed in designing a 
program that will meet the performance standards of this final rule. In 
reviewing program submissions, FRA will focus on the degree to which a 
particular program deviates from the norms identified in its proposed 
rule. To the degree that a particular program submission materially 
deviates from the norms set out in its proposed rule which was published 
in the Federal Register on December 11, 1989 (54 FR 50890), FRA's review 
and approval process will be focused on determining the validity of the 
reasoning relied on by a railroad for selecting its alternative approach 
and the degree to which the alternative approach is likely to be 
effective in producing locomotive engineers who have the knowledge, 
skill, and ability to safely operate trains.

 Appendix C to Part 240--Procedures for Obtaining and Evaluating Motor 
                       Vehicle Driving Record Data

    The purpose of this appendix is to outline the procedures available 
to individuals and railroads for complying with the requirements of 
section 4(a) of the Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 1988 and 
Secs. 240.109, 240.111 and 240.205 of this part. Those provisions 
require that railroads consider the motor vehicle driving record of each 
person prior to issuing him or her certification or recertification as a 
qualified locomotive engineer.
    To fulfill that obligation, a railroad must review a certification 
candidate's recent motor vehicle driving record. Generally, that will be 
a single record on file with the state agency that issued the 
candidate's current license. However, it can include multiple records if 
the candidate has been issued a motor vehicle driving license by more 
than one state agency. In addition, the railroad must determine whether 
the certification candidate is listed in the National Driver Register 
and, if so listed, to review the data that caused the candidate to be so 
listed.

            Access to State Motor Vehicle Driving Record Data

    The right of railroad workers, their employers, or prospective 
employers to have access to a state motor vehicle licensing agency's 
data concerning an individual's driving record is controlled by state 
law. Although many states have mechanisms through which employers and 
prospective employers such as railroads can obtain such data, there are 
some states in which privacy concerns make such access very difficult or 
impossible. Since individuals generally are entitled to obtain access to 
driving record data that will be relied on by a state motor vehicle 
licensing agency when that agency is taking action concerning their 
driving privileges, FRA places responsibility on individuals, who want 
to serve as locomotive engineers to request that their current state 
drivers licensing agency or agencies furnish such data directly to the 
railroad considering certifying them as a locomotive operator. Depending 
on the procedures adopted by a particular state agency, this will 
involve the candidate's either sending the state agency a brief letter 
requesting such action or executing a state agency form that 
accomplishes the same effect. It will normally involve payment of a 
nominal fee established by the state agency for such a records check. In 
rare instances, when a certification candidate has been issued multiple 
licenses, it may require more than a single request.

                      The National Driver Register

    In addition to seeking an individual state's data, each engineer 
candidate is required to request that a search and retrieval be 
performed of any relevant information concerning his or her driving 
record contained in the National Driver Register. The National Driver 
Register (NDR) is a system of information created by Congress in 1960. 
In essence it is a nationwide repository of information on

[[Page 427]]

problem drivers that was created in an effort to protect motorists. It 
is a voluntary State/Federal cooperative program that assists motor 
vehicle driver licensing agencies in gaining access to data about 
actions taken by other state agencies concerning an individual's motor 
vehicle driving record. The NDR is designed to address the problem that 
occurs when chronic traffic law violators, after losing their license in 
one State travel to and receive licenses in another State. Currently the 
NDR is maintained by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA) of the Department of Transportation under the provisions of the 
National Driver Register Act (23 U.S.C. 401 note). Under that statute, 
state motor vehicle licensing authorities voluntarily notify NHTSA when 
they take action to deny, suspend, revoke or cancel a person's motor 
vehicle driver's license and, under the provisions of a 1982 change to 
the statute, states are also authorized to notify NHTSA concerning 
convictions for operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence 
of, or impaired by, alcohol or a controlled substance, and for traffic 
violations arising in connection with a fatal traffic accident, reckless 
driving or racing on the highway even if these convictions do not result 
in an immediate loss of driving privileges.
    The information submitted to NHTSA contains, at a minimum, three 
specific pieces of data: the identification of the state authority 
providing the information, the name of the person whose license is being 
affected, and the date of birth of that person. It may be supplemented 
by data concerning the person's height, weight, color of eyes, and 
social security account number, if a State collects such data.

                           Access to NDR Data

    Essentially only individuals and state licensing agencies can obtain 
access to the NDR data. Since railroads have no direct access to the NDR 
data, FRA requires that individuals seeking certification as a 
locomotive engineer request that an NDR search be performed and direct 
that the results be furnished to the railroad. FRA requires that each 
person request the NDR information directly from NHTSA unless the 
prospective operator has a motor vehicle driver license issued by a 
state motor vehicle licensing agency that is ``participating'' under the 
provisions of the National Driver Register Act of 1982. Participating 
states can directly access the NDR data on behalf of the prospective 
engineer. The state agencies that currently are authorized to access NDR 
data in that manner are identified in appendix D of this regulation.

                Requesting NHTSA to Perform the NDR Check

    The procedures for requesting NHTSA performance of an NDR check are 
as follows:
    1. Each person shall submit a written request to National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration at the following address: Chief, National 
Driver Register, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 
Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.
    2. The request must contain:
    (a) The full legal name;
    (b) Any other names used by the person (e.g., nickname or 
professional name);
    (c) The date of birth;
    (d) Sex;
    (e) Height;
    (f) Weight;
    (g) Color of eyes;
    (h) Driver's license number (unless that is not available).
    3. The request must authorize NHTSA to perform the NDR check and to 
furnish the results of the search directly to the railroad.
    4. The request must identify the railroad to which the results are 
to be furnished, including the proper name of the railroad, and the 
proper mailing address of the railroad.
    5. The person seeking to become a certified locomotive engineer 
shall sign the request, and that signature must be notarized.
    FRA requires that the request be in writing and contain as much 
detail as is available to improve the reliability of the data search. 
Any person may supply additional information to that being mandated by 
FRA. Furnishing additional information, such as the person's Social 
Security account number, will help to more positively identify any 
records that may exist concerning the requester. Although no fee is 
charged for such NDR checks, a minimal cost may be incurred in having 
the request notarized. The requirement for notarization is designed to 
ensure that each person's right to privacy is being respected and that 
records are only being disclosed to legally authorized parties.

           Requesting a State Agency to Perform the NDR Check

    As discussed earlier in connection with obtaining data compiled by 
the state agency itself, a person can either write a letter to that 
agency asking for the NDR check or can use the agency's forms for making 
such a request. If a request is made by letter the individual must 
follow the same procedures required when directly seeking the data from 
NHTSA. At present there are only a limited number of state licensing 
agencies that have the capacity to make a direct NDR inquiry of this 
nature. It is anticipated that the number of states with such capability 
will increase in the near future; therefore, FRA will continue to update 
the identification of such states by revising appendix D to this 
regulation to identify such state agencies.

[[Page 428]]

Since it would be more efficient for a prospective locomotive engineer 
to make a single request for both aspects of the information required 
under this rule, FRA anticipates that state agency inquiry will 
eventually become the predominant method for making these NDR checks. 
Requests to state agencies may involve payment of a nominal fee 
established by the state agency for such a records check.
    State agencies normally will respond in approximately 30 days or 
less and advise whether there is or is not a listing for a person with 
that name and date of birth. If there is a potential match and the 
inquiry state was not responsible for causing that entry, the agency 
normally will indicate in writing the existence of a probable match and 
will identify the state licensing agency that suspended, revoked or 
canceled the relevant license or convicted the person of one of the 
violations referenced earlier in this appendix.

                Actions When a Probable NDR Match Occurs

    The response provided after performance of an NDR check is limited 
to either a notification that no potential record match was identified 
or a notification that a potential record match was identified. If the 
latter event occurs, the notification will include the identification of 
the state motor vehicle licensing authority which possesses the relevant 
record. If the NDR check results indicate a potential match and that the 
state with the relevant data is the same state which furnished detailed 
data (because it had issued the person a driving license), no further 
action is required to obtain additional data. If the NDR check results 
indicate a potential match and the state with the relevant data is 
different from the state which furnished detailed data, it then is 
necessary to contact the individual state motor vehicle licensing 
authority that furnished the NDR information to obtain the relevant 
record. FRA places responsibility on the railroad to notify the engineer 
candidate and on the candidate to contact the state with the relevant 
information. FRA requires the certification candidate to write to the 
state licensing agency and request that the agency inform the railroad 
concerning the person's driving record. If required by the state agency, 
the person may have to pay a nominal fee for providing such data and may 
have to furnish written evidence that the prospective operator consents 
to the release of the data to the railroad. FRA does not require that a 
railroad or a certification candidate go beyond these efforts to obtain 
the information in the control of such a state agency, and a railroad 
may act upon the pending certification without the data if an individual 
state aqency fails or refuses to supply the records.
    If the non-issuing state licensing agency does provide the railroad 
with the available records, the railroad must verify that the record 
pertains to the person being considered for certification. It is 
necessary to perform this verification because in some instances only 
limited identification information is furnished for use in the NDR and 
this might result in data about a different person being supplied to the 
railroad. Among the available means for verifying that the additional 
state record pertains to the certification candidate are physical 
description, photographs and handwriting comparisons.
    Once the railroad has obtained the motor vehicle driving record 
which, depending on the circumstance, may consist of more than two 
documents, the railroad must afford the prospective engineer an 
opportunity to review that record and respond in writing to its contents 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 240.219. The review 
opportunity must occur before the railroad evaluates that record. The 
railroad's required evaluation and subsequent decision making must be 
done in compliance with the provisions of this part.

 Appendix D to Part 240--Identification of State Agencies That Perform 
                     National Driver Register Checks

    Under the provisions of Sec. 240.111 of this part, each person 
seeking certification or recertification as a locomotive operator must 
request that a check of the National Driver Register (NDR) be conducted 
and that the resulting information be furnished to his or her employer 
or prospective employer. Under the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e) 
of Sec. 240.111, each person seeking certification or recertification as 
a locomotive engineer must request that National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration conduct the NDR check, unless he or she was issued a 
motor vehicle driver license by one of the state agencies identified in 
this appendix. If the certification candidate received a license from 
one of the designated state agencies, he or she must request the state 
agency to perform the NDR check. The state motor vehicle licensing 
agencies listed in this appendix participate in a program that 
authorizes these state agencies, in accordance with the National Driver 
Register Act of 1982, to obtain information from the NDR on behalf of 
individuals seeking data about themselves. Since these state agencies 
can more efficiently supply the desired data and, in some instances, can 
provide a higher quality of information, FRA requires that certification 
candidates make use of this method in preference to directly contacting 
NHTSA.
    Although the number of state agencies that participate in this 
manner is limited, FRA anticipates that an increasing number

[[Page 429]]

of states will do so in the future. This appendix will be revised 
periodically to reflect current participation in the program. As of 
December 31, 1989, the motor vehicle licensing agencies of the following 
states participate under the provisions of the 1982 changes to the NDR 
Act: North Dakota, Ohio, Virginia, and Washington.

  Appendix E to Part 240--Recommended Procedures for Conducting Skill 
                            Performance Tests

    FRA requires (see Sec. 240.127 and Sec. 240.211) that locomotive 
engineers be given a skill performance test prior to certification or 
recertification and establishes certain criteria for the conduct of that 
test. Railroads are given discretion concerning the manner in which to 
administer the required testing. FRA has afforded railroads this 
discretion to allow individual railroad companies latitude to tailor 
their testing procedures to the specific operational realities. This 
appendix contains FRA's recommendations for the administration of skill 
performance testing that occurs during operation of an actual train. It 
can be modified to serve in instances where a locomotive simulator is 
employed for testing purposes. These recommended practices, if followed, 
will ensure a more thorough and systematic assessment of locomotive 
engineer performance.

                   The Need for a Systematic Approach

    There are numerous criteria that should be monitored when a 
designated supervisor of locomotive engineers is observing a person to 
determine whether that individual should be certified or recertified as 
a qualified locomotive engineer. The details of those criteria will vary 
for the different classes of service, types of railroads, and terrain 
over which trains are being operated. At a minimum, the attention of a 
designated supervisor of locomotive engineers should concentrate on 
several general areas during any appraisal. Compliance with the 
railroad's operating rules, including its safety directives and train 
handling rules, and compliance with Federal regulations should be 
carefully monitored. But, in order to effectively evaluate employees, it 
is necessary to have something against which to compare their 
performance. In order to hold a locomotive engineer accountable for 
compliance, a railroad must have adequate operating, safety and train 
handling rules. Any railroad that fails to have adequate operating, 
safety, or train handling rules will experience difficulty in 
establishing a objective method of measuring an individual's skill 
level. Any railroad that requires the evaluation of an individual's 
performance relative to its train handling rules needs to have 
established preferred operating ranges for throttle use, brake 
application, and train speed. The absence of such criteria results in 
the lack of a meaningful yardstick for the designated supervisor of 
locomotive engineers to use in measuring the performance of locomotive 
engineers. It also is essential to have a definite standard so that the 
engineer and any reviewing body can know what the certification 
candidate is being measured against.
    Evaluating the performance of certain train operation skills will 
tend to occur in all situations. For example, it would be rare for a 
designated supervisor of locomotive engineers to observe any operator 
for a reasonable period of time and not have some opportunity to review 
that engineer's compliance with some basic safety rules, compliance with 
basic operating rules, and performance of a brake test. As the 
complexity of the operation increases, so does the number of items that 
the operator must comply with. Higher speeds, mountainous terrain, and 
various signal systems place increased emphasis on the need for operator 
compliance with more safety, operating, and train handling rules. 
Accounting for such variables in any universal monitoring scheme 
immediately results in a fairly complex system.
    FRA therefore recommends that designated supervisors of locomotive 
engineers employ a written aid to help record events and procedures that 
as a minimum should be observed for when conducting a skills performance 
test. FRA is providing the following information to assist railroads in 
developing such a written aid so as to ensure meaningful testing. When 
conducting a skills performance test, a designated supervisor of 
locomotive engineers should be alert to the following:

    --Does the employee have the necessary books (Operating Rules, 
Safety Rules, Timetable, etc.)?
    --Are predeparture inspections properly conducted (Radio, Air Brake 
Tests, Locomotive, etc.)?
    --Does the employee comply with applicable safety rules?
    --Does the employee read the bulletins, general orders, etc.?
    --Enroute, does the employee:
    --Comply with applicable Federal Rules?
    --Monitor gauges?
    --Properly use the horn, whistle, headlight?
    --Couple to cars at a safe speed?
    --Properly control in train slack and buff forces?
    --Properly use the train braking systems?
    --Comply with speed restrictions?
    --Display familiarity with the physical characteristics?
    --Comply with signal indications?
    --Respond properly to unusual conditions?
    --At the conclusion of the trip, does the employee:
    --Apply a hand brake to the locomotives?

[[Page 430]]

    --Properly report locomotive defects?

    Obviously, the less sophisticated the railroad's operations are, the 
fewer the number of identified practices that would be relevant. Hence, 
this list should modified accordingly.

            The Need for Objectivity, Use of Observation Form

    It is essential that railroads conduct the performance skills 
testing in the most objective manner possible, whether this testing is 
the locomotive engineer's initial qualification testing or periodic 
retesting. There will always be some potential for the subjective views, 
held by the designated supervisor of locomotive engineers conducting the 
testing, to enter into evaluations concerning the competency of a 
particular individual to handle the position of locomotive engineer. 
Steps can be taken, and need to be taken, to minimize the risk that 
personality factors adversely influence the testing procedure.
    One way to reduce the entry of subjective matters into the 
qualification procedures is through the use of a document that specifies 
those criteria that the designated supervisor of locomotive engineers is 
to place emphasis on. The use of an observation form will reduce but not 
eliminate subjectivity. Any skill performance test will contain some 
amount of subjectivity. While compliance with the operating rules or the 
safety rules is clear in most cases, with few opportunities for 
deviation, train handling offers many options with few absolute right 
answers. The fact that an engineer applies the train air brakes at one 
location rather than a few yards away does not necessarily indicate a 
failure but a question of judgment. The use of dynamic braking versus 
air brakes at a particular location may be a question of judgment unless 
the carrier has previously specified the use of a preferred braking 
method. In any case the engineer's judgment, to apply or not apply a 
braking system at a given location, is subject to the opinion of the 
designated supervisor of locomotive engineers.
    A railroad should attempt to reduce or eliminate such subjectivity 
through use of some type of observation or evaluation. For railroads 
developing any evaluation form, the areas of concern identified earlier 
will not be relevant in all instances. Railroads that do not have 
sophisticated operations would only need a short list of subjects. For 
example, most smaller railroads would not require line items pertaining 
to compliance with signal rule compliance or the use of dynamic brakes. 
Conversely, in all instances the observation forms should include the 
time and location that the observer started and ended the observation. 
FRA believes that there should be a minimum duration for all performance 
skills examinations. FRA allows railroads to select a duration 
appropriate for their individual circumstances, requiring only that the 
period be ``of sufficient length to effectively evaluate the person.'' 
In exercising its discretion FRA suggests that the minimums selected by 
a railroad be stated in terms of a distance since the examination has to 
be of a sufficient duration to adequately monitor the operator's skills 
in a variety of situations. FRA also suggests that the format for the 
observation form include a space for recording the observer's comments. 
Provision for comments ideally would allow for the inclusion of 
``constructive criticism'' without altering the import of the evaluation 
and would permit subjective comments where merited.

time actually engaged in yard switching service.

[[Page 432]]

    (o) Yard track means a system of tracks within defined limits used 
for the making up or breaking up of trains, for the storing of cars, and 
for other related purposes, over which movements not authorized by 
timetable, or by train order may be made subject to prescribed signals, 
rules or other special instructions. Sidings used exclusively as passing 
track and main line track within yard limits are not included in the 
term yard track.


<R05>
Sec. 245.7  Penalties.

    Any person (including a railroad and any manager, supervisor, 
official, or other employee or agent of a railroad) who violates any 
requirement of this part or causes the violation of any such requirement 
is subject to a civil penalty of at least $250 and not more than $10,000 
per violation. Civil penalties may be assessed against individuals only 
for willful violations. Each day a violation continues shall constitute 
a separate offense. A person may also be subject to the criminal 
penalties provided for in 45 U.S.C. 438(e) for knowingly and willfully 
falsifying records or reports required by this part.


<R04>
                 Subpart B--Reporting and Recordkeeping


<R05>
Sec. 245.101  Reporting requirements.

    (a) Each railroad subject to this part shall submit to FRA, not 
later than March 1st of each year (August 1st, for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 1992) a report identifying the railroad's total 
train miles for the prior calendar year, the total road miles owned, 
operated under lease, or controlled (but not including trackage rights) 
by the railroad as of December 31 of the previous calendar year, and the 
railroad's total number of employee hours for the prior calendar year. 
An entity shall be considered a railroad subject to this part if it 
conforms to the definitions found in Sec. 245.5(g) and (h) above. Each 
railroad shall report all of the data for the entire relevant calendar 
year whether or not its present operations generated all of the 
reportable data. This report shall be made on FRA Form 6180.91--Annual 
Report of Railroads Subject to User Fees and shall be filed by the 
Responsible Entity (see Sec. 245.5(h)). The report shall include an 
explanation for an entry of zero for train miles, road miles, or 
employee hours. Each railroad shall also identify all subsidiary 
railroads for which it is reporting and provide a breakdown of train 
miles, road miles, and employee hours for each subsidiary. Finally, each 
railroad shall enter its corporate billing address for the user fees, 
and the name, title, telephone number, date, and a signature of the 
person submitting the form to FRA.
    (b) FRA anticipates mailing blank copies of FRA Form 6180.91--Annual 
Report of Railroads Subject to User Fees to each railroad during the 
month of January (the month of July for the fiscal year ending September 
30, 1992) for the railroad's use in preparing the report. This action by 
FRA is for the convenience of the railroads only and in no way affects 
the obligation of railroads subject to this part to obtain and submit 
FRA Form 6180.91 to FRA in a timely fashion in the event a blank form is 
not received from FRA. Blank copies of FRA Form 6180.91 may be obtained 
from the Office of Safety, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 
20590.
    (c) Train miles, as defined in Sec. 245.5(n), shall be calculated by 
the railroad in accordance with the following considerations:
    (1) Each railroad subject to this part is to report the train miles 
for the freight and passenger service it operates without regard to 
track or facility ownership.
    (2) Train miles are to be reported by both freight and passenger 
railroads and shall include miles run between terminals or stations, or 
both, miles run by trains consisting of empty freight cars or without 
cars, locomotive train miles run, miles run by trains consisting of 
deadhead passenger equipment, motor train miles run, yard-switching 
miles run, work train miles, and train switching miles.
    (d) Road miles, as defined in Sec. 245.5(i), shall be calculated by 
the railroad in accordance with the following considerations:
    (1) Road miles to be reported shall include all track owned, 
operated under lease, or controlled by the railroad but shall not 
include track used under

[[Page 433]]

trackage rights agreements. (Note: road miles consisting of leased track 
are to be reported by the lessee railroad). Road miles consisting of 
jointly-owned track or track jointly operated under lease shall be 
reported by the railroad controlling operations over the track. Road 
miles for a given section of railroad should be reported by only one 
railroad.
    (2) Road miles to be reported shall not include industrial track, 
yard tracks, sidings, and other tracks not regularly used by road trains 
operated in such specific service. The determination that a particular 
track segment qualifies as industrial track or yard track must be made 
on a reasonable and supportable basis. Road miles do not include track 
which was out of service for the entire calendar year that is the 
subject of the user fee report.
    (e) Employee hours, as defined in Sec. 245.5(a), shall be calculated 
by the railroad in accordance with the following considerations: 
Employees hours to be reported include the number of hours worked by all 
railroad employees, regardless of occupation, during the previous 
calendar year. Include all employees in the occupational categories 
shown in appendix D of the FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident 
Reports. Employee hours do not include time paid but not actually 
worked, such as holidays, vacations, etc. Employee hours do not include 
hours worked by volunteers. Employee hours do not include hours worked 
by individuals not employed directly by the reporting railroad (i.e. 
contractor employees).
    (f) In computing both train miles and road miles, fractions 
representing less than one-half mile shall be disregarded and other 
fractions considered as one mile.
    (g) Each railroad subject to this part has a continuing obligation 
to assure that the information provided to FRA on Form 6180.91--Annual 
Report of Railroads Subject to User Fees is accurate. Should a railroad 
learn at a later date that the information provided was not correct, it 
shall submit a revised Form 6180.91 along with a letter explaining in 
detail the discrepancy.
    (h) Each railroad subject to this part has an obligation to assure 
that the information provided to FRA under this part is consistent with 
information provided to FRA under other reporting requirements, in 
particular reports submitted under 49 CFR part 225--Railroad Accidents/
Incidents: Reports Classification, and Investigations. The railroad 
shall fully explain and resolve any discrepancies.
    (i) The FRA has prepared a questionnaire entitled ``Written 
Questionnaire on Whether Your Company Is A `Railroad' Subject To FRA 
User Fee Regulations'' (FRA Form 6180.90) in order to assist in 
determining whether certain entities meet the definition of ``railroad'' 
included in Sec. 245.5 or constitute railroads whose entire operations 
are confined within an industrial installation (``plant railroads'') 
excluded from this part under Sec. 245.3. Copies of FRA Form 6180.90 are 
available from the Office of Safety, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., 
Washington, DC 20590.


<R05>
Sec. 245.103  Recordkeeping.

    Each railroad subject to this part shall maintain adequate records 
supporting its calculation of the railroad's total train miles for the 
prior calendar year, total road miles as of December 31 of the previous 
calendar year, and the total employee hours for the previous calendar 
year. Such records shall be sufficient to enable the FRA to verify the 
information provided by the railroad on FRA Form 6180.91--Annual Report 
of Railroads Subject to User Fees. Such records shall also be available 
for inspection and copying by the Administrator or the Administrator's 
designee during normal business hours.


<R05>
Sec. 245.105  Retention of records.

    Each railroad subject to this part shall retain records required by 
Sec. 245.103 for at least three years after the end of the calendar year 
to which they relate.


<R04>
                     Subpart C--User Fee Calculation


<R05>
Sec. 245.201  User fee calculation.

    (a) The fee to be paid by each railroad shall be determined as 
follows:
    (1) After March 15th of each year (August 1st for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 1992), FRA will tabulate the

[[Page 434]]

total train miles, total employee hours, and total road miles for 
railroads subject to this part for the preceding calendar year. FRA's 
calculations will be based on the information supplied by railroads 
under Sec. 245.101 hereof, and other reports and submissions which 
railroads are required to make to FRA under applicable regulations (i.e. 
49 CFR parts 225 and 228). At the same time, FRA will calculate the 
total cost of administering the Safety Act for the current fiscal year 
(other than activities described in section 202(a)(2) thereof) which 
will represent the total amount of user fees to be collected.
    (2) Using tabulations of total train miles, total employee hours, 
total road miles, and the total cost of administering the Safety Act, 
FRA will calculate a railroad's user fee assessment as follows:
    (i) The assessment rate per train mile will be calculated by 
multiplying the total costs of administering the Safety Act by 0.55 and 
then dividing this amount (i.e., fifty-five percent of the total amount 
to be collected) by the total number of train miles reported to the FRA 
for the previous calendar year. The result will be the railroad user fee 
assessment rate per train mile for the current fiscal year.
    (ii) The assessment rate per employee hour will be calculated by 
multiplying the total costs of administering the Safety Act by 0.1 and 
then dividing this amount (i.e., 10 percent of the total amount to be 
collected) by the total number of employee hours reported to the FRA for 
the previous calendar year. The result will be the railroad user fee 
rate per employee hour for the fiscal year.
    (iii) The assessment rate per road mile will be calculated in three 
steps. First, FRA will determine a preliminary assessment rate per road 
mile by multiplying the total costs of administering the Safety Act by 
0.35 and dividing this amount (i.e., thirty-five percent of the total 
amount to be collected) by the total road miles reported to FRA for the 
previous calendar year. Second, FRA will adjust this preliminary rate 
per road mile for each light density railroad by multiplying the 
preliminary rate by the appropriate scaling factor identified in 
Sec. 245.5(h). The result will be a reduced assessment rate per road 
mile for light density railroads. Third, FRA will adjust the preliminary 
assessment rate per road mile for all railroads except light density 
railroads by adding to their preliminary rate an incremental amount 
reflecting the reallocation of the relief provided to light density 
railroads under step 2 using the sliding scale. The incremental amount 
is calculated by subtracting (A) the total amount to be collected from 
light density railroads after application of the sliding scale from (B) 
the total amount that would have been collected from light density 
railroads using the preliminary assessment rate and developed under step 
1 and (C) dividing the resulting amount by the total road miles reported 
to FRA by all railroads except light density railroads. The incremental 
amount is then added to the preliminary assessment rate for all 
railroads except light density railroads to derive the assessment rate 
per road mile for all railroads except light density railroads. The 
results will be a modified assessment rate per road mile for light 
density railroads qualifying under step 2 and a general assessment rate 
applicable to all other railroads. In those cases where the computed fee 
is less than the defined minimum, the net increase attributable to the 
application of the minimum standard is not included in the reallocation 
process under step 3 and is instead added to total collections.
    (b) The user fee to be paid by each covered railroad is the greater 
of $500.00 or the sum of the railroad's train miles times the assessment 
rate per train mile, the railroad's employee hours times the assessment 
rate per employee hour, and the railroad's road miles times the 
applicable assessment rate per road mile.


<R04>
            Subpart D--Collection Procedures and Duty to Pay


<R05>
Sec. 245.301  Collection procedures.

    (a) After March 15th of each year (August 15th for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 1992), FRA will publish in the Federal Register a 
notice containing FRA's preliminary estimates of

[[Page 435]]

the total user fee to be collected, the assessment rate per train mile, 
the assessment rate per employee hour, and the assessment rate per road 
mile (as adjusted by the sliding scale). The information published by 
FRA will be sufficient to enable each railroad to calculate its 
estimated user fee bill for the fiscal year on the basis of the train 
mile, employee hour, and road mile information provided by the railroad 
to FRA.
    (b) After June 1st of each year, (August 15th for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 1992), FRA will provide to each covered railroad a 
notice (the ``Assessment Notice'') containing FRA's final calculations 
of the total user fee to be collected, the assessment rate per train 
mile, the assessment rate per employee hour, the assessment rate per 
road mile (as adjusted by the sliding scale), the train miles, employee 
hours, and road miles for the railroad for the prior calendar year, the 
user fee to be paid by the railroad, and a statement and payment record 
form. FRA will mail the Assessment Notice sufficiently in advance of the 
end of the fiscal year in order to allow all collections to be completed 
prior to the end of the fiscal year. FRA will mail the Assessment Notice 
to the billing address designated by the railroad on FRA Form 6180.91--
Annual Report of Railroads Subject to User Fees.


<R05>
Sec. 245.303  Duty to pay.

    (a) Beginning in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1991, each 
railroad subject to this part shall pay an annual railroad user fee to 
the FRA. Payment in full shall be received by FRA no later than thirty 
days after the Assessment Notice is mailed. Payment is made only when 
received by FRA. Payments in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) 
shall be made by wire transfer through the Federal Reserve 
communications, commonly known as Fedwire, to the account of the U.S. 
Treasury in accordance with the instructions provided in the Assessment 
Notice. Payments of ten thousand dollars or less shall be by check or 
money order payable to the Federal Railroad Administration. The payment 
shall be identified as the railroad's user fee by noting it with the 
User Fee Bill Number as assigned by FRA and by returning the payment 
record received with the Assessment Notice. Payment shall be sent to the 
address stated in the assessment notice. Any railroad making an 
aggregate payment for one or more subsidiaries or affiliates should 
return the payment records for each and list all applicable Bill Numbers 
with the payment.
    (b) The responsibility for paying the user fee rests with the 
responsible entity (see Sec. 245.5(h)). Parties involved in purchase and 
sale transactions of railroad(s) or portions of a railroad shall be 
responsible for allocating the user fee amongst the interested entities 
in an appropriate fashion. FRA will not prorate user fee bills.
    (c) No user fee will be collected from railroads that properly 
report zero train miles and zero road miles on FRA Form 6180.91--Annual 
Report of Railroads Subject to User Fees.
    (d) Payments not received by the due date will be subject to 
allowable interest charges, penalties, and administrative charges (31 
U.S.C. 3717). Follow-up demands for payment and other actions intended 
to assure timely collection, including referral to local collection 
agencies or court action, will be conducted in accordance with Federal 
Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR chapter II) and Departmental 
procedures (49 CFR 89).

            Appendix to Subpart A--Environmental Assessments

    Part I. Description of the environment in the area of the project 
before commencement of such project, together with statement of other 
Federal activities in the area which are known, or should be known, to 
the applicant. This description shall include, without limitation, the 
following information:
    (A) Demographic data. Statement of population and growth 
characteristics of area and of any population and growth assumptions 
made by applicant in planning the project. Such statement should use the 
rates of growth in the projection compiled for the Water Resources 
Council by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce 
and the Economic Research Service of the Department of Agriculture, 
commonly referred to as the OBERS projection of regional economic 
activity in the United States. Applicants should refer to 1972 OBERS 
projections for economic areas, and provide 1969 data and 1980 
projections for the following: Population; manufacturing earnings; 
transportation, communications and public utilities earnings; 
agriculture, forestry and fisheries earnings; and mining earnings. 
Information should be provided for economic areas which the applicant's 
proposal would affect.
    (B) Current land use patterns. Statement of the project's 
relationship to proposed land use plans, policies, and controls of 
affected communities, including, where appropriate, maps or diagrams.

reasons for such inconsistency.
    (C) Characteristics of current operations. The Applicant should 
indicate the maximum allowable speed and frequency of current rail 
traffic on any affected line, the number and location of grade 
crossings, and the length of time such grade crossings are blocked 
during a typical day. The Applicant should indicate derailments and 
fatalities or injuries resulting from accidents involving trains and 
motor vehicles or pedestrians on such lines. The Applicant should also 
indicate the hours of operation on such lines and noise levels of rail 
operations at 100' from the right of way. Applicants should refer to the 
United States Environmental Protection Agency document titled 
``Information on Levels of Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and 
Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety'', which provides a system of 
measuring day and night noises on a weighted average.
    (D) Air quality. The Applicant should indicate the air quality in 
the region, as found in the state Air Quality Implementation Plans to 
meet ambient air quality standards. Each state is required to prepare 
such a plan under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 1857). Some states are 
required to have Transportation Control Plans to meet ambient air 
quality standards where transportation sources pose major air quality 
problems. Applicants should refer to state air quality agencies or to 
the Regional Offices of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for 
guidance.
    (E) Wetland or coastal zones. Location, types, and extent of wetland 
areas or coastal zones that might be affected by the project.
    (F) Properties and sites of historical or cultural significance. 
Identification of districts, sites, buildings and other structures, and 
objects or historical, architectural, archeological, or cultural 
significance that may be affected by the project. This should be 
accomplished by consulting the National Register and applying the 
National Register Criteria (36 CFR part 800) to determine which 
properties that may be affected by the project are included in or 
eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. The 
National Register is published in its entirety each February in the 
Federal Register. Monthly additions and listings of eligible properties 
are published in the Federal Register the first Tuesday of each month. 
The Secretary of the Interior will advise, upon request, whether 
properties are eligible

[[Page 461]]

for the National Register. Officials designated by their Governors to 
act as State Historic Preservation Officers responsible for state 
activities under the National Historic Preservation Act may also be 
consulted. A listing of these state officials may be found at 36 CFR 
60.5(d), or may be obtained from the Director, National Parks Service, 
U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240.
    (G) Publicly-owned parklands, recreational areas, and waterfowl 
refuges, and historic sites (45 U.S.C. 1653(f)). (i) Protected land 
proposed to be used. Describe any publicly-owned land from a public 
park, recreation area or wildlife and waterfowl refuge or any land from 
an historic site or wildlife and waterfowl refuge or any land from an 
historic site which would be affected or taken by the proposed program 
or project, including the size of the land proposed to be affected or 
taken, available activites on the land, use, patronage, unique or 
irreplaceable qualities, relationship to other similarly used land in 
the vicinity of the proposed project, and maps, plans, slides, 
photographs, and drawings in sufficient scale and detail to clearly show 
proposed project. Include a description of impacts of the proposed 
project on the land and changes in vehicular or pedestrian access.
    (ii) Significant area. Include a statement of the national, State, 
or local significance of the entire park, recreation area, wildlife or 
waterfowl refuge, or historic site as determined by the Federal, State 
or local officials having jurisdiction thereof. In the absence of such a 
statement, protected land is presumed to be located in an area of 
national, State or local significance.
    Part II. The probable impact of the project on the environment and 
measures which can be taken to mitigate adverse impacts. The applicant 
shall (1) assess the positive and negative environmental effects, 
including primary, secondary, and other foreseeable effects, on each of 
the areas specified in Part I of this appendix, including long-term 
impacts associated with the increased intensity, if any, of rail 
operations, and (2) list measures which can be taken to mitigate adverse 
impacts. Mitigation measures include control of hours of operation, 
coordination of street blockages with adjacent communities, dust and 
erosion control measures, and proposed methods of tie disposal. In 
addition, the applicant shall provide the following.
    (A) Statement of the extent to which any of the impacts of the 
project represent irreversible or irretrievable commitments of 
resources. This requires identification of the extent to which 
implementation of the project irreversibly curtails the range of 
potential uses of the environment. ``Resources'' include the natural 
cultural resources lost or destroyed as a result of the project.
    (B) Statement of the relationship between local short-term uses of 
man's environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term 
productivity. This shall include a brief discussion of the extent to 
which the proposed action involves trade-off between short-term 
environmental gains at the expense of long-term losses, or vice versa, 
and a discussion of the extent to which the proposed action forecloses 
future options.
    (C) Statement of any probable adverse environmental effect which 
cannot be avoided, such as changes in exposure to noise and changes in 
level of noise or vibration; water or air pollution; undesirable land 
use patterns; impacts on public parks and recreation areas, wildlife and 
waterfowl refuges, or historic sites; damage to life systems; congestion 
of street traffic in adjacent communities; delays in the provision of 
essential services (police, fire, ambulance), anticipated changes in 
accident patterns and other threats to health; and other consequences 
adverse to the environmental goals set out in section 101(b) of the 
National Environmental Protection Act, 42 U.S.C. 4331(b). In considering 
noise levels, applicants should note any conflicts between projected 
noise levels from rail operations and HUD standards for noise at 
sensitive sites, such as schools, hospitals, parks and residential 
locations. (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, ``Noise 
Abatement and Control: Department Policy Implementing Responsibilities 
and Standards,'' Departmental Circular 1390.2, Chart; External Noise 
Exposure Standards for New Construction, April 4, 1971)
    (D) Statement of construction impacts, identifying any special 
problem areas and including:
    (i) Noise impacts from construction and any specifications setting 
maximum noise levels.
    (ii) Disposal of spoil and effect on borrow areas and disposal sites 
(include any specifications).
    (iii) Measures to minimize effects on traffic and pedestrians.
    (iv) Consideration of non-point source pollution such as might 
result from water runoff.
    (E) Statement of any positive or negative impacts on energy supply 
and natural resource development, including, where applicable, any 
effect on either the production or consumption of energy or other 
natural resources. Discuss such effects if they are significant.
    (F) Discussion of problems and objections raised by other Federal, 
State or local agencies, and citizens with respect to impact of the 
project on the environment.
    Part III. Discussion of any alternatives to the project that have 
been considered with respect to impact on the environment. If cost-
benefit analyses have been performed, the extent to which environmental 
costs have been reflected in the analysis should be

  Subpart B--Standards for Maintenance of Facilities by Recipients of 
                          Obligation Guarantees


<R05>
Sec. 260.17  Applicability.

    This subpart prescribes standards governing the maintenance of 
facilities, as defined in subpart A of this part, that are being 
acquired, rehabilitated, improved, or constructed with the proceeds of a 
guaranteed obligation, by the recipient of such guarantee for the period 
during which any portion of the principal or interest of such obligation 
remains unpaid.


<R05>
Sec. 260.19  Definitions.

    The terms defined in subpart A of this part shall have the same 
meaning for the purposes of this subpart that such terms are given in 
Sec. 260.3 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 260.21  Standards.

    (a) When the proceeds of an obligation guaranteed by the 
Administrator are used to acquire, rehabilitate, improve or construct 
track, roadbed, and related structures, the guarantee recipient shall, 
as long as any portion of the principal or interest of such obligation 
remains unpaid, maintain such facilities in at least the highest track 
Class, as defined by FRA Track Safety Standards in part 213 of this 
chapter, as that Class in which the rehabilitated, improved, acquired, 
or constructed track is to be operated upon completion of the project 
for which the obligation was guaranteed unless a waiver is granted in 
accordance with Sec. 260.25.
    (b) When the proceeds of an obligation guaranteed by the 
Administrator are used in facilities, including those mentioned in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the recipient shall, during the period in 
which any portion of the principal or interest in such obligation 
remains unpaid, maintain such facilities in a manner consistent with 
sound engineering and maintenance practices and in a condition that will 
permit the level of use that existed upon completion of the acquisition, 
rehabilitation, improvement or construction of such facilities unless a 
waiver is granted in accordance with Sec. 260.25.


<R05>
Sec. 260.23  Inspection and reporting.

    (a) The facilities subject to the provisions of this subpart shall 
be inspected at such regular intervals as the Administrator deems 
necessary to assure compliance with the standards set forth in 
Sec. 260.21. Each recipient shall permit representatives of the FRA to 
enter upon its property to inspect and examine such facilities at 
reasonable times and in a reasonable manner. Such representatives shall 
be permitted to use such testing devices as the Administrator deems 
necessary to insure that the maintenance standards imposed by this 
subpart are being followed.
    (b) Each recipient shall submit to the Administrator annually 
financial records and other documents detailing the maintenance 
performed and the inspections conducted which demonstrate that the 
recipient has complied with the standards in Sec. 260.21.


<R05>
Sec. 260.25  Waiver.

    Any recipient of a guarantee may petition the Administrator in 
writing for relief from any or all requirements imposed by this subpart. 
The Administrator may, for good cause shown, waive or modify any 
requirements of this part. Good cause may include, but is not limited 
to, insufficient capital resources of the recipient to comply with these 
maintenance standards or changes in the level of service required for 
any facility subject to this subpart.

[[Page 463]]


<R05>
Sec. 260.27  Impact on other laws.

    Standards issued under this subpart shall not be construed to 
relieve the recipient of any obligation to comply with any other 
Federal, State, or local law or regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 260.29  Penalties.

    If the Administrator finds that a guarantee recipient has violated 
the requirements of this subpart, such recipient will be subject to 
civil action for injunction to cease activities which violate this 
subpart and for any other appropriate civil or criminal relief, 
including termination, suspension, and punitive damages.

   Subpart C--Procedures for Computing the Internal Rate of Return on 
                                Projects


<R05>
Sec. 260.31  Applicability.

    This subpart prescribes the procedures to be followed and the format 
to be utilized in computing the IRR under paragraph (a)(7)(i) of 
Sec. 260.7 of subpart A of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 260.33  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    (a) Investment means any substantial non-recurring expenditure even 
if expensed for accounting purposes.
    (b) IRR means the estimated internal rate of return on a project for 
which an application for financial assistance is filed pursuant to this 
part.
    (c) IRS means the Internal Revenue Service.


<R05>
Sec. 260.35  Procedures to be followed and format to be utilized.

    (a) A narrative discussion of the IRR computation for the project 
consisting of the following five parts shall be prepared and provided:
    (1) A detailed description of the project. This description must 
present the following: The objectives of the project; what assets will 
be improved, rehabilitated, acquired or constructed; where they will be 
located; and how they will be used. It must also describe any other work 
to be done as a part of the project, and any operating changes, 
including retirement of assets, which will accompany the investment. For 
these purposes, the project shall be deemed to include all expenditures 
(including those for which no Federal assistance is requested) necessary 
to carry out its objectives.
    (2) A detailed description of the base case. The base case is the 
most favorable alternative action the applicant could take with little 
or no investment. The description must be comparable in scope to the 
description of the project. In some cases, the most favorable 
alternative action may be to do nothing, i.e., making no change in the 
current situation. In other cases, the applicant may have other 
alternative actions such as rerouting traffic, changing operating 
practices (perhaps with an increase in operating costs), or relying more 
heavily on facilities or equipment belonging to others. If the applicant 
has considered more than one alternative action (requiring little or no 
investment) to the project, the applicant must describe each of the 
actions considered and give the rationale for the selection of the base 
case from among those other actions.
    (3) A discussion of key assumptions. All general assumptions and 
those relating only to a particulary cash flow impact which 
substantially affect the IRR should be explained. Assumptions regarding 
traffic volumes deserve particular attention. The applicant must specify 
how much traffic is expected if the project and base case are 
undertaken, and where the difference, if any, between the project and 
base case is expected to come from (e.g., diverted from truck, diverted 
from other railroads, generated by the project, etc.). Other key 
assumptions may relate to actions by third parties, such as regulatory 
agencies and other railroads.
    (4) A discussion of each cash flow impact resulting from the project 
or base case. The applicant must identify all the cash receipts and 
disbursements resulting from the project but not the base case, and 
vice-versa. Cash flows which would be the same in either event should 
not be considered. For each cost and benefit used in the IRR 
computations, the applicant must explain why the particular cash flow 
will result from the project or base case, and how the size of the cash 
flow and the corresponding measure in physical

[[Page 464]]

units were estimated. In addition, the applicant must identify and 
discuss important costs and benefits which it has not been able to 
quantify. The applicant must note which of the benefit and cost items 
could be measured to confirm the predictions in the IRR computation, and 
must suggest how such measurements could be made. Appendix A of this 
subpart lists the most common cash flow impacts of railroad investment 
projects and base case alternatives, indicates the kinds of actions 
likely to involve each type of cash flow, suggests how each might be 
measured (both in physical and monetary units), and discusses special 
problems associated with each. Appendix A is not exhaustive; other cash 
flow items should be included in the analysis as appropriate.
    (5) A discussion of the principal areas of uncertainty. This 
discussion must indicate why particular values might be different from 
those used in the computation, and the range into which each uncertain 
value could be expected to fall. It must also indicate the applicant's 
subjective level of confidence that the computed IRR is a reasonably 
close prediction of the project's and base case's financial performance. 
In some circumstances, the applicant must point out where the IRR fails 
to incorporate certain important features of the project or the base 
case, or both. Applicant may enhance its discussion by presenting 
examples of its own prior experiences with IRR, stating, perhaps, that 
an audit of past computations has shown marked deviations from actual 
results regardless of the detail of those computations.
    (b) For the project (as it relates to its base case alternative), a 
thorough presentation of all the computations underlying the IRR using 
the Forms I-V of appendix B to this subpart shall be prepared and 
provided. State and local tax impacts need not be included in the 
computations, unless the applicant has determined that their inclusion 
substantially affects the IRR. The computation of the IRR must follow 
the four steps described below. (This procedure cannot be used if the 
project consists of replacing an asset, usually equipment, which would 
otherwise remain in service (at high cost) for only a few more years. In 
that situation, the lifetime of the project (the new asset) is 
substantially longer than the lifetime of the base case (the old asset), 
so that it is not possible to get a differential cash flow in every year 
of the project's life. A possible approach for handling such cases is to 
determine the discount rate which gives the same average annual cost per 
unit of output for both the project and the base case. Because it is 
expected that very few of the applications will involve such 
replacements, the procedure for handling them will not be detailed here 
but will be provided upon request.) The foregoing does not apply to the 
rehabilitation of track or similar replacement of components of an asset 
which could reasonably be kept in service at high cost for at least 15 
years (or the life of the replaced material, if shorter). The IRR on 
such projects must be computed in accordance with the procedures 
mandated by this subpart.).
    (1) Step 1: Determination of before-tax case flows. The applicant 
must determine, for each year of the project's expected useful life, up 
to a maximum of 15 years (unless the cash flow impacts of later years 
would substantially affect the IRR), both the project's and base case's 
before-tax cash flow impacts (receipts and disbursements). The cash flow 
estimates must not include the effects of inflation, but rather must be 
done in constant dollars. The effects of financing must also be 
excluded; that is the cash flows must be estimated as if the required 
cash were immediately available at no cost.

The various cash flow impacts for this step 1 must be shown on Forms I 
through V of appendix B as explained below. On Forms I through V cash 
flow impacts occurring in the first year of the project and base case 
are assigned to and recorded in the time period year 1. Cash flows in 
subsequent years are all assigned to and recorded in the year in which 
they occur regardless of whether they occur at the beginning or end of 
the year. For purposes of assigning and recording cash flow impacts of 
the project and base case, it will be assumed that the project's 
starting date and thus the commencement of year 1 begins as of the first 
of the January

[[Page 465]]

following the year in which an application for financial assistance is 
filed.
    (i) Capitalized investments which would occur as a part of the 
project but not in the base case must be entered in Column 1 of Form I. 
The capitalized investment includes capitalized engineering work, 
installation expenditures and other startup costs allowable in reporting 
to the IRS. The total investment for the project must be divided into 
portions which are homogeneous with respect to depreciation method (if 
depreciable), depreciation period (if depreciable), year in which the 
assets enter service, and whether the assets qualify for investment tax 
credit. (If applicant has a considerable tax credit carryforward, the 
tax credit must be shown only in the year or years it will result in a 
reduction of tax payments.) A separate form should be completed for each 
such portion. Similarly, a set of Forms I must be completed for a 
capitalized investments which would be made as part of the base case but 
not the project.
    (ii) Sales of released assets (as useful assets or as scrap), which 
would occur as a part of the project or the base case, must be entered 
in Column 1 of Form II. As was the case for capitalized investments, 
there must be a separate Form II for each portion of the assets sold, 
such that each portion is homogeneous with respect to tax treatment and 
year of sale. Form II must also be completed for retirements of assets, 
even though the sale price is zero, if the retirement will affect the 
applicant's income taxes and thereby the applicant's cash flow. The sale 
or retirement of an asset at the end of the project's life, if the cash 
flow impact is substantial enough to merit inclusion in the computation, 
must also appear on one or more Forms II. (If a project would continue 
an asset already owned in its prior use but the base case would put the 
asset to an alternative use, and if the cash flow from that alternative 
use is difficult to determine, the applicant may do the analysis as if 
the asset were to be sold in the base case at its fair market value when 
put to the alternative use. Similarly, if the base case would continue 
an asset in its present use but the project would result in the asset 
being employed in an alternative use, the anticipated cash flow of which 
would be difficult to determine, the asset in the project may be treated 
as a sale at fair market value in the IRR computations. In either event, 
the market value of the asset otherwise put to an alternative use would 
be entered in Column 1 of a Form II and the asset in its current use (in 
either the project or base case, as the case may be) would be recorded, 
as to continuing depreciation and income tax credit, if any, on Form I 
and, as to expenses and contribution to profit, on Form III. However, 
whenever possible, the anticipated cash flow of the alternative use, 
whether in the project or base case, should be entered on Form III 
rather than treated as a theoretical sale at fair market value.)
    (iii) Expense items or contributions to profit which arise by reason 
of the project or the base case must be documented on Form III for the 
respective case, with a separate form being used for each item.

Columns 1 and 2 of Form III must be completed unless the difference of 
column 3 can be ascertained only through a direct computation (as, e.g., 
car-day savings resulting from faster movement over rehabilitated 
track). When practical, expenses and traffic are to be expressed first 
in physical units (Columns 1, 2 and 3) and then converted to dollars 
(Column 4). In instances where this is not practical, the applicant may 
estimate expenses and contribution directly in dollars using only 
Columns 1, 2, and 4. In Columns 1 and 2, expense items should always be 
enclosed in parentheses because they represent cash outflows. Thus, 
positive numbers in Columns 3 and 4 will indicate that the project 
produces a larger cash inflow (or smaller cash outflow) than the base 
case.
    (2) Step 2: Determination of after-tax cash flows relating to 
capital assets. The applicant must compute the annual cash flows after 
Federal income tax corresponding to each of the before-tax flows 
recorded on each Form I and Form II in the previous step. If the 
applicant expects to pay taxes in some years but not others, the 
applicant will undoubtedly carry forward (or back) the tax losses and 
credits from years in which no tax was paid, so as to take

[[Page 466]]

full advantage of them. In that case, the applicant must estimate when 
such tax benefits will actually be received, and include them in the 
cash flow stream at the appropriate time. The appropriate tax rate for 
such computations is the applicant's marginal tax rate. This is the rate 
which would apply to one additional dollar of income earned by the 
applicant. Normally, the marginal rate will be 48% for Federal taxes 
except in years in which the applicant does not expect to pay taxes. The 
average or effective tax rate (found by dividing a firm's actual tax 
payments by its net income before taxes) is not appropriate for this 
purpose. If the tax rate assumed is different from 48% or if the 
computations assume the applicant will not pay taxes in certain years, 
then those assumptions must be explained in the discussion of key 
assumptions. The tax-related computations must be shown on the same 
forms as were used to record the pre-tax cash flows. Additional working 
papers should be submitted as necessary to clarify the computations. The 
computations to be done on the two forms are as follows:
    (i) On each Form I, the applicant must indicate in Column 2 the 
depreciation schedule which it expects to use in reporting to the IRS. 
In Column 3, the applicant must indicate how much its tax bill will be 
reduced as a result of the depreciation shown in Column 2. (If the 
applicant expects to pay taxes every year, Column 3 is simply 48% of 
Column 2.) In Column 4, the applicant must indicate the tax reduction, 
if any, it expects from investment tax credit. (The effect of the tax 
credit must be computed using the flow through method, in which 
investment credits are generally treated as reductions in income tax 
expense of the year in which the credits are actually realized, rather 
than being deferred and amortized over the productive life of the 
acquired property). Column 5 is the net after-tax cash flow associated 
with the investment.
    (ii) On each Form II, the applicant must indicate in Column 2 the 
increase (or decrease) in its Federal income tax payments resulting from 
the difference between the sale price and the book value of assets to be 
sold by reason of the project or base case. If an asset is released 
without a sale or a corresponding write down of book value, Form II is 
not used, but Form I is used to reflect continuing depreciation as 
before the release. In Column 3, the applicant must record any recapture 
of investment tax credit by the IRS. (Such recapture can only occur when 
an asset is disposed of before it has been in service for seven years.) 
Finally, Column 4 records the net cash flow in or out.
    (3) Step 3: Determination of aggregate after-tax cash flow. The 
applicant must determine the project's aggregate after-tax cash flow 
using Form IV. This shall be done as follows:
    (i) For each year, the corresponding after-tax cash flow (Column 5) 
on the various Forms I on which the ``project'' box was checked are 
summed, and the total entered into Column 1 of Form IV. Then the net 
after-tax cash flows on the base case Forms I are summed and entered 
into Column 2 of Form IV.
    (ii) Similarly, the project and base case Forms II (Column 4) are 
consolidated and entered into Columns 3 and 4, respectively, of Form IV.
    (iii) The Forms III (Column 4) are consolidated into Column 5 of 
Form IV. The corresponding cash flow after Federal income tax is 
recorded in Column 6. If the applicant expects to pay taxes every year, 
Column 6 is simply 52% of Column 5. If applicant expects to pay no 
taxes, the two columns are identical. If applicant expects to pay taxes 
in some years but not others, the applicant must incorporate the effects 
of carrying losses forward (or back) into the estimated after-tax cash 
flow.
    (iv) The aggregate net cash flow for the project relative to the 
base case is then found and entered in Column 7 of Form IV.
    (4) Step 4: Computation of the IRR. The applicant must determine the 
discount rate for which the present value of the differential cash flow 
stream is zero. That is, the applicant must find the value of r which 
makes the expression

                                   <INF>r                                    
                c <INF>i                                                     
                                 <3-ln  t   --------                    
                                   -                                    
                                  <INF>i=1                                   
              (1+r) <SUP>i                                                   
                                                                        


[[Page 467]]

equal to zero. In the above expression, r is the discount rate applied 
to future cash flows; i is an index denoting a particular year of a 
project's life; n is the number of years in the project's life; and 
c<INF>i!is the differential cash flow in year i. Computer programs for 
calculating the rate of return are widely available. If a program is 
utilized, copies of the printout showing input and output data, and a 
brief explanation of the program function must be included in the 
application. If the applicant chooses not to use such a computer program 
to find the IRR, the applicant may use Form V. If the IRR lies off the 
graph, it is sufficient to report that the IRR is negative or above 50%. 
If the nature of the cash flow stream is such that a unique IRR cannot 
be found, the work done to develop the cash flow stream must be 
submitted with a note that no IRR could be computed.
    (c) Copies of all financial analyses which the applicant did on 
rejected alternatives to the project, including changes in scale or 
scope. The applicant need not do any such analyses beyond those already 
done, nor need the format, assumptions, or procedures used in those 
analyses be changed to conform to the requirements of these regulations.
    (d) A reconcilation between the cash flows used in the IRR 
computations and all forecasted data presented in the application, both 
before (for the base case) and after (for the project) giving effect to 
Federal assistance. This reconciliation must indicate what inflation 
factor or factors were used in developing the forecasted financial 
statements as compared to the constant dollar figures used in the IRR 
computations. The reconciliation must also show how each of the 
individual parts and subparts of the project relates to the applicant's 
forecasted financial statements.

           Appendix A to Part 260--Selected Cash Flow Impacts

    Railroad investments usually affect the investor's cash flow by 
changing some of the following things:
    Use of assets.
    Contribution from traffic.
    Labor requirements.
    Locomotive requirements.
    Requirements for cars, trailers, and containers.
    Maintenance material consumption.
    Energy consumption.
    Accident rates and severity.
    Expenditures needed to meet legal requirements.
    Salvage value.
    Installation and start up expenses.

While this list is not exhaustive it does identify the most common cash 
flow impacts.
    Some of the items listed, such as start up expenses, are almost 
always costs of projects or base cases, rather than benefits. Others, 
such as salvage value, are usually benefits. Most of the items, however, 
may be either project or base case benefits or costs, depending on the 
particular situation.
    This appendix briefly discusses each of the eleven factors listed 
above. The discussions include four parts: a list of the kinds of 
actions which often involve the particular cash flow impact in question; 
the physical units in which the impact is generally measured; 
suggestions for converting the physical units to their monetary 
equivalent; and notes on special characteristics or problems associated 
with the particular cash flow impact.

                              use of assets

    Characteristic Actions: Assets are often released for sale or 
altenative uses when they are replaced or made unnecessary by new 
assets. Examples are pole line materials released when microwave is 
installed; shop equipment released when similar new equipment is 
acquired; rail replaced by rail in better condition; and land and track 
materials released when yards, shops, and terminals are made unnecessary 
by new facilities elsewhere. Some other types of actions, such as line 
changes and the installation of centralized traffic control, often 
permit some track segments to be abandoned, thereby releasing track 
material for sale or other uses.
    On the other hand, some actions involve the use of assets already 
owned, thereby prohibiting their sale or use for other purposes. 
Examples are car modifications and projects involving land and buildings 
already owned.
    Physical Units: Feet (or miles) of rail, number of ties, acres of 
land, etc.
    Monetary Value: The value of an asset released by an action depends 
on what will be done with it. The value of an asset occupied by an 
action, on the other hand, depends on what would have been done with it 
in the absence of the action. Regardless of whether it is the action or 
its alternative which makes the material available, one must first 
carefully specify what is assumed to happen to the asset both with and 
without the action, and identify the factors which change the cash flow 
stream. Depending on the particular circumstances, any of the following 
might be involved: Payment received from

[[Page 468]]

selling the asset; a multi-year stream of income produced by the asset 
in some use; tax paid on the sale of the asset; expenditure for 
dismantling and/or moving the asset; recapture by the IRS of investment 
tax credit taken when the asset was purchased (if it had been in use for 
less than seven years). Also, if the owner of the asset sells or retires 
it, he would lose the tax reductions he is receiving from depreciating 
the asset. It is the use of the released asset which values it. Thus, a 
released asset such as rail which, by cascading, results in the 
subsequent release of less valuable rail, must be valued in its use and 
not as the value of subsequently released assets.
    In cases in which the asset is transferred to another use which 
produces income over several years, the effect of releasing the asset 
extends over several years, and must be expressed as a series of annual 
cash flows, rather than a lump sum.
    Special Features: A common error in project evaluations is to value 
a used asset at its book value (i.e., purchase price less accumulated 
depreciation). The book value may be far from the value of the asset on 
the open market, especially in the case of rail released by track 
abandonments and land released by the abandonment of facilities in urban 
areas. The only way the book value of retired assets enters into the 
cash flow stream is in determining the tax paid on the sale of the asset 
(or the tax saving if the asset is discarded or sold for less than its 
book value).
    In calculating the tax paid on the sale of a released asset, the 
ordinary tax rate (48%) should be used, except when the capital gains 
rate applies.
    It is sometimes difficult or impossible to estimate the contribution 
to profit which a particular asset, such as second hand rail, will 
produce in an alternative use. In such cases, it is better to do the 
financial analysis on the assumption that the asset in question would be 
sold at its fair market value (even though it would in fact be put to an 
alternative use), rather than leaving the asset out of the computations 
entirely.

                        contribution from traffic

    Characteristic Actions: Actions which affect the availability and 
attractiveness of the railroad to shippers. The action may involve 
giving the shipper better access to the railroad (track extensions and 
terminal improvements) or better service. Line consolidations, on the 
other hand, may involve abandonments which deprive some shippers of 
service, or may result in such degradations in service quality that some 
shippers switch to other carriers. Faster service can result from more 
power or improvements in track, yards, terminals, signals, and 
communication. Another component of service quality, reduced loss and 
damage to lading can be occasionally improved by eliminating accidents 
(wayside warning devices), using specialized cars, and making 
improvements to yard and terminal facilities. Service quality can also 
be enhanced by purchases of additional freight cars and trailers, so as 
to reduce the likelihood of car shortages. Another aspect of service 
quality is reliability, which may be affected by improvements in yards, 
terminals, and communications, as well as the elimination of accidents. 
Still another component of service quality is the cost to the shipper of 
packing and loading, which may be affected by investments in specialized 
cars and terminal facilities.
    Physical Units: Car-loads.
    Monetary Value: The contribution to profit is found by subtracting 
the variable cost of moving the traffic from the associated revenue. The 
variable cost is best estimated by a careful study of the operations and 
costs of the particular movements involved.
    Such a study is not practical for certain traffic. In these cases 
the best alternative may be to estimate the variable cost using system 
averges, as is done in the Interstate Commerce Commission's Rail Form A, 
Carload Cost Scales, and Rail Revenue Contribution studies. Where 
appropriate, such system average costs should be adjusted to exclude 
costs not involved in the particular movement, and to reflect the 
current, not the historical, costs of assets to be purchased in the 
future.
    Special Features: The contribution from new traffic resulting from 
an improvement is extremely important, but it is also one of the most 
difficult of all project benefits to estimate. One major problem is 
estimating the volume of traffic likely to result from a particular 
improvement, especially if the improvement affects service quality. A 
second serious problem is estimating the variable cost of particular 
movements. (These estimates may be facilitated by a six-part FRA cost 
study currently in progress.)

                           labor requirements

    Characteristic Actions: Labor requirements are often reduced by 
automation, facility consolidation, faster train running times, 
reductions in switch engine requirements, better communications for 
operations, and reductions in maintenance needs. On the other hand, 
actions involving new or expanded yards, terminals, or shop facilities 
may increase manpower requirements.
    Physical Units: Man-hours, number of employees.
    Monetary Value: The value of labor depends on the particular 
situation. If the action results in a change in the number of employees 
or in overtime hours, the wages and fringe benefits associated with that 
change directly affect the railroad's cash flow. If an action changes or 
eliminates work for employees without changing jobs or overtime, the

[[Page 469]]

change will affect the railroad's cash flow if either:
    The man-hours released or occupied by the change can be used on 
other profitable tasks which would otherwise not be done, or which would 
be accomplished by paying overtime or hiring more people; or
    The action can be combined with one or more other actions, each of 
which saves or requires a fraction of an employee, so that the set of 
actions results in a change in the size of the work force.
    In either case, the value of the man-hours released or consumed is 
the cost of the associated wages and fringe benefits. On the other hand, 
if the result of the action is simply to give existing employees more 
(or less) free time on the job, no cash impacts can be attributed to the 
change in the amount of work.
    Special Features: There are several different kinds of labor which a 
project might affect: road crews, yard crews, maintenance-of-way, shop, 
inspection, clerical, and other.
    Determining the wages and fringe benefits associated with a 
particular man-hour is often not straightforward because of rules 
governing employee compensation. The payment of some train crews on a 
mileage rather than a time basis is an example.
    Wage and fringe benefit savings resulting from the elimination of 
jobs may be at least partially offset by costs incurred as a result of 
labor protection agreements. Depending on the situation, these costs may 
be lump-sum or recurring. Determination of employee protection costs is 
complicated by the fact that the individual who holds a position which 
is to be eliminated may not be the person who is actually laid off as a 
result of the elimination. Rather, the person whose job is actually 
eliminated may displace a person with less seniority holding a similar 
job. That person may, in turn, displace another employee and so on.

                         locomotive requirements

    Characteristic Actions: Actions reducing train running time (track 
upgrading, line changes, signal system improvements, etc.), or which 
permit moving the same traffic with fewer trains (yard consolidations) 
or with fewer terminal delays (yard and terminal improvements) can all 
reduce the number of road engines needed. The number of switch engines 
needed can be reduced by some types of yard and terminal improvements, 
such as yard consolidations, track changes, and the installation of 
weigh-in-motion scales. Actions which lead to increased traffic, such as 
track extensions, may increase the need for both types of locomotives.
    Physical Units: Locomotive-years (or locomotive-hours or locomotive-
days). Note that one does not have to save 365 locomotive-days to save a 
locomotive-year, since locomotives are not available for service 365 
days per year because of maintenance work. If a railroad's locomotives 
were available for service 78% of the time, applicant would only have to 
save 285 locomotive-days to save a locomotive-year.
    Monetary Value: One way to estimate the value of a locomotive-year 
is the following four-step process:
    1. Estimate the after-tax cash flow stream resulting from owning a 
locomotive. The components of this stream would be: The investment 
expenditure; investment tax credit; tax savings from depreciation; 
normal maintenance; overhauls; and salvage value. The cash flow stream 
must be in constant dollars of the same base year as would be used in 
the rest of the IRR computation.
    2. Calculate the net present value of the cash flow stream, using 
the yield on 180-day United States treasury bills as the discount rate.
    3. Find a stream of equal annual outlays which produces the same net 
present value as was found in Step 2. The anual outlay may be found by 
multiplying the net present value by

                                 r(1+r)<SUP>a                                
                     -------------------------------                    
                                (1+r)<SUP>a-1                                
                                                                        

where r is the yield in Step 2, and n is the number of equal annual 
outlays.
    4. Find the pre-tax equivalent of the after-tax annual payment found 
in Step 3, by dividing the after-tax figure by one minus the railroad's 
marginal tax rate. This is the pre-tax value of a locomotive year, 
expressed in dollars of the base year chosen in Step 1.
    The procedures set forth above for valuing estimated savings or 
costs from locomotive requirements on a locomotive-year basis may be 
used only where it is not practical to associate particular future 
locomotive purchases with the project. Where practical, changes in 
locomotive requirements (except for locomotives belonging to other 
railroads) must be treated as capital investments that would have to be 
made in the base case but not in the project or vice versa, with due 
recognition given to those fixed charges associated with ownership of 
locomotives that would be incurred if such locomotives were purchased. 
This also applies to Requirements for Cars, Trailers, and Containers, 
which follows.
    Increased locomotive productivity is somewhat analogous to increased 
labor productivity (see Labor Requirements) in that it may not always 
lead to significant cash savings. This is especially true with switch 
engines, since a decrease in car movements may not reduce the number of 
engines required if the number of locations which the switch fleet must 
serve does not also change. On the other hand, reducing the number of 
locations

[[Page 470]]

covered (by consolidating yards, for example) may decrease switch engine 
requirements. As in the case of increased labor productivity, increased 
locomotive productivity affects a railroad's cash flow only if a 
locomotive can be sold (or a purchase avoided) or if the locomotive is 
able to do other profitable work which would not be done otherwise.
    Special Features: The locomotive values computed using the procedure 
above include maintenance and overhaul expense, but not fuel or other 
labor expense. Therefore any concomitant change in fuel or labor (except 
maintenance) should be estimated separately. Care should be taken to 
exclude changes in locomotive maintenance costs from any other estimates 
of charges in maintenance costs resulting from the investment project.

             requirements for cars, trailers, and containers

    Characteristic Actions: Actions which change train running time 
(such as track upgrading, purchase of additional power, line changes and 
signal improvements); actions which change the time cars spend in yards, 
or permit bypassing yards altogether (yard improvements and improved 
communication systems); actions which change the time cars are out of 
service for maintenance (shop facilities, car modifications, track 
upgrading); and actions which affect the turn-around time for cars in 
terminals.
    Physical Units: Car-days.
    Monetary Value: The procedure for finding the value of a locomotive-
year or day is equally applicable to cars. (See Locomotive 
Requirements).
    Another acceptable approach is to use per diem costs (including 
incentive per diem) since those charges approximate the cost of 
ownership. Although incentive per diem is in addition to car ownership 
costs, its inclusion in the car-day value is justified because it 
reflects, to some degree, the fact that a railroad sometimes loses 
business during short peaks in demand, because it is not immediately 
able to buy or hire the cars necessary to take advantage of a particular 
business opportunity.
    Over the long run, however, a railroad need not continually lose 
traffic, so long as it is willing to incur the cost of owning a 
sufficient number of cars. Therefore, it is not appropriate to use the 
investing railroad's average contribution per car-day to value improved 
car utilization in IRR calculations. Given that per diem is a 
satisfactory approximation to the cost of car ownership, there is no 
need to distinguish between foreign car-days saved and investor car-days 
saved by an action.
    Special features: The valuation of improved car utilization is 
complicated by the fact that some projects, such as improvements in 
classification yards, may affect the entire car fleet, while other 
projects may affect only certain kinds of cars. For example, it may be 
that all the cars affected by a particular terminal improvement are 
refrigerator cars. The car-day value to be used is therefore not 
necessarily the same in all projects. Rather, it depends on the type of 
cars involved.

                    maintenance material consumption

    Characteristic Actions: Since nearly all assets require maintenance, 
almost any action involving the acquisition of new assets will lead to 
expenditures for maintenance materials. On the other hand, actions which 
involve taking assets out of service, such as replacements, eliminate 
the need to maintain the retired assets. Improving track conditions may 
decrease equipment maintenance, while decreasing traffic volumes may 
decrease track maintenance needs.
    Primary Units: List of materials involved (and quantities).
    Monetary Value: The value of maintenance materials is the price of 
those materials (plus freight in and labor added, if any). Where a 
direct relationship exists between maintenance labor and materials, it 
may be more convenient to first estimate man-hours and then compute 
material costs in proportion to the man hours.
    Special Features: The material costs (or savings) associated with 
changes in maintenance may include work equipment, as well as the 
materials consumed during maintenance.
    Usually the best basis for predicting maintenance costs is the 
maintenance history of similar assests in similar service. Manufacturers 
can also sometimes provide projections of maintenance expense. To the 
extent practical, care should be taken to specifically reflect cyclical 
maintenance (overhauls) by assigning the maintenance cost (or savings) 
to the years in which they will actually occur, rather than normalizing, 
or smoothing out, the cash flow stream.
    Assets which permit maintenance savings often involve maintenance 
costs which partially offset those savings.

                           energy consumption

    Characteristic Actions: Actions changing locomotive activity or 
locomotive efficiency. Line changes and locomotive replacements may 
reduce fuel consumption by road engines. Improvements in yards and 
terminals, as well as locomotive replacements, may reduce the fuel 
consumed by switch engines. Improvements in buildings and structures can 
cut heating costs.
    Physical Units: Gallons, kilowatt-hours, etc.

[[Page 471]]

    Monetary Value: Found by multiplying the fuel or electricity by the 
current price per unit.
    Special Features: Road engine energy consumption generally varies 
with gross tonmiles and speed. Yard engines are frequently idling, 
consuming energy, even when not in use. Thus, energy consumption may 
vary with the number of switch engine crew shifts rather than the amount 
of work done. Care should be taken not to count changes in locomotive 
energy consumption twice, once as a change in locomotive requirements 
and once as a change in energy consumption.

                       accident rates and severity

    Characteristic Actions: Accidents may be reduced by wayside warning 
detectors (hot box detectors, grade crossing protection, dragging 
equipment detectors, etc.), lading protection devices, some specially 
equipped cars, some yard and terminal improvements, and track upgrading.
    Physical Units: Accidents (of several different types) per year.
    Monetary Value: Only the monetary cost likely to be borne by the 
railroad would be relevant to the IRR computation. This would include 
damage to equipment, roadway and lading, and the cost of wreckage 
removal as well as injury to people. The expected cost of an accident 
varies drastically, depending on the particular situation.
    Special Features: Accidents delay trains and yard and terminal 
operations. Thus, actions which reduce accidents may also improve car 
and locomotive productivity. Care should be exercised that such benefits 
are counted only once.

             expenditures needed to meet legal requirements

    Characteristic Actions: Actions permitting abandonment of old 
facilities or equipment may reduce the need for such expenditures. New 
facilities may make some such expenditures necessary.
    Physical Units: List of actions, such as grade crossing protection, 
water treatment facilities, or the installation of retention toilets, 
which would be required to bring the facilities or equipment in question 
up to legal standards.
    Monetary Value:  The total cost of the improvements including 
engineering (except engineering work already done), capital expenditure, 
maintenance, and operation. These expenditures should be offset by the 
appropriate tax reductions (resulting from depreciation and investment 
tax credit) which would result from those improvements.

                              salvage value

    Characteristic Actions: Acquisition of new assets or disposal of 
existing assets.
    Physical Units: List of the particular assets involved (such as 
tamping machine, 500' of 112 rail, etc.)
    Monetary Value: The cash flow resulting from disposing of the assets 
or using them elsewhere. (See Use of Assets).
    Special Features: The salvage value of most assets declines as the 
asset ages. The value of land often remains roughly constant, as does 
the value of materials in well maintained track. The salvage value of 
assets which cannot be used for other purposes, such as a culvert, is 
zero.
    When salvage values are small relative to other benefits and costs, 
and when they are heavily discounted (because they occur far in the 
future), their impact on the IRR is likely to be negligible. In such 
cases, the salvage value can be safely ignored.

                   installation and start-up expenses

    Characteristic Actions: Most fixed facilities.
    Physical Units: Man-hours, list of materials required.
    Monetary Value: As noted in the discussion of labor requirements the 
value of the labor depends on the particular situation. The value of the 
materials would normally be their market price.
    Special Features: Often all or part of the expenditures needed to 
get a new asset in place and operating is capitalized. In such a case, 
the capitalized portion of the expenditure should be included as part of 
the investment cost, but not counted again as a start-up expense.

Office of the Secretary of Transportation, 49 CFR 1.49(u).

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 265.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to effectuate the provisions of section 
905 of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 
(hereinafter referred to as the ``Act'') to ensure that no person in the 
United States shall on the grounds of race, color, national origin, or 
sex be excluded from participation in, or denied the benefits of, or be 
subjected to discrimination under, any project, program or activity 
funded in whole or in part through financial assistance under the Act, 
or any provision of law amended by the Act. Nothing contained in these 
regulations is intended to diminish or supersede the obligations made 
applicable by either title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, (42 
U.S.C. 2000d), or Executive Order No. 11246, (42 U.S.C. 2000e (note)). 
Subsection (d) of section 905 of the Act authorizes the Secretary to 
prescribe such regulations and take such actions as are necessary to 
monitor, enforce, and affirmatively carry out the purposes of that 
section. This authority coupled with the provisions of section 906 of 
the Act, which requires the establishment of a Minority Resource Center 
which is authorized to encourage, promote and assist in the 
participation by MBE enterprises in the restructuring, improvement, 
revitalization and maintenance of our Nation's railroads, provides the 
basis for requirements for the development of affirmative action 
programs by recipients of Federal financial assistance and certain of 
their contractors to insure that minorities and MBEs are afforded ample 
consideration with respect to employment and contractual opportunities 
produced as a result of the implementation of the Act and other 
provisions of law amended by the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 265.3  Applicability.

    This part applies to any project, program, or activity funded in 
whole or in part through financial assistance provided under the Act, 
and to any activity funded under any provision of the Regional Rail 
Reorganization Act of 1973, as amended (45 U.S.C. 701 et seq.) or the 
Rail Passenger Service Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 501 et seq.) amended 
by the Act including the financial assistance programs listed in 
appendix A. It applies to contracts awarded to implement the Northeast 
Corridor Project and to financial assistance programs administered by 
the United States Railway Association.

                         Subpart B--Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 265.7  Nondiscrimination clauses.

    (a) Each agreement for financial assistance made under any provision 
of the Rail Acts shall include, or in the case of agreements made prior 
to the effective date of this part, shall be amended to include, the 
following clauses:
    (1) As a condition to receiving Federal financial assistance under 
the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (``Act''), 
or the provisions of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, as 
amended (45 U.S.C. 701 et seq.), or the Rail Passenger Service Act of 
1970, as amended (45 U.S.C. 501 et seq.) amended by the Act 
(collectively called, together with the Act, the ``Rail Acts''), the 
recipient hereby agrees to observe and comply with the following:
    (i) No person in the United States shall on the ground of race, 
color, national origin or sex be excluded from participation in, or 
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any 
project, program, or activity funded in whole or in part through such 
assistance.
    (2) The following specific discriminatory actions are prohibited:
    (i) A recipient under any project, program or activity to which 
these clauses apply shall not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, on the ground of race, color, national origin, or sex:
    (A) Deny a person any service, financial aid, or other benefit 
provided under such project, program or activity;
    (B) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to a person 
which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that 
provided to others under such project, program or activity;
    (C) Subject a person to segregation or separate treatment in any 
matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid or other 
benefit under such project, program or activity;
    (D) Restrict a person in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage 
or privilege enjoyed by others receiving

[[Page 478]]

any service, financial aid or other benefit under such project, program 
or activity; or
    (E) Deny a person an opportunity to participate in such project, 
program or activity through the provision of services or otherwise or 
afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded 
others under such project, program or activity.
    (ii) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial 
aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any 
such project, program or activity or the class of persons to whom, or 
the situations in which such services, financial aid, other benefits, or 
facilities will be provided under any such project, program or activity, 
or the class of persons to be afforded an opportunity to participate in 
any such project, program or activity shall not, directly or through 
contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of 
administration which have the effect of subjecting persons to 
discrimination because of their race, color, national origin, or sex, or 
have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment 
of the objectives of the project, program or activity, with respect to 
individuals of a particular race, color, national origin or sex.
    (iii) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient 
shall not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding 
persons from, de- nying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to 
discrimination under any project, program or activity to which these 
clauses apply on the grounds of race, color, national origin or sex, or 
with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the 
accomplishment of the objectives of these clauses.
    (iv) The recipient shall not discriminate against any employee or 
applicant for employment because of race, color, national origin or sex. 
Except as otherwise required by the regulations or orders of the 
Administrator, the recipient shall take affirmative action to insure 
that applicants for employment are employed, and that employees are 
treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, national 
origin or sex. Such action shall include but not be limited to the 
following: Employment, promotion, demotion, transfer, recruitment or 
recruitment advertising, layoff or termination, rates of pay or other 
forms of compensation, and selection for training, including 
apprenticeship. The recipient agrees to post in conspicuous places, 
available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be 
provided by the agency's representative setting forth the provisions of 
these nondiscrimination clauses. The recipient understands and agrees 
that it shall not be an excuse for the recipient's failure to provide 
affirmative action that the labor organizations with which the recipient 
has a collective bargaining agreement failed or refused to admit or 
qualify minorities for admission to the union, or that the provisions of 
such agreements otherwise prevent recipient from implementing its 
affirmative action program.
    (v) The recipient shall not discriminate against any business 
organization in the award of any contract because of race, color, 
national origin or sex of its employees, managers or owners. Except as 
otherwise required by the regulations or orders of the Administrator, 
the recipient shall take affirmative action to insure that business 
organizations are permitted to compete and are considered for awards of 
contracts without regard to race, color, national origin or sex.
    (3) As used in these clauses, the services, financial aid, or other 
benefits provided under a project, program, or activity receiving 
financial assistance under the Rail Acts include any service, financial 
aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility funded through 
financial assistance provided under the Rail Acts.
    (4) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination 
does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a)(1)(i) 
of this section.
    (5) These clauses do not prohibit the consideration of race, color, 
national origin or sex if the purpose and effect are to remove or 
overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have 
restricted the availability of, or participation in, recipient's 
operations or activities on the grounds of race, color, national origin 
or sex.

[[Page 479]]

Where prior discriminatory or other practice or usage tends, on the 
grounds of race, color, national origin or sex, to exclude individuals 
or businesses from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to 
subject them to discrimination under any project, program or activity to 
which these clauses apply, the recipient must take affirmative action to 
remove or overcome the effects of the prior discriminatory practice or 
usage. Even in the absence of prior discriminatory practice or usage to 
which this part applies, the recipient is expected to take affirmative 
action to insure that no person is excluded from participation in or 
denied the benefits of the project, program or activity on the grounds 
of race, color, national origin or sex, and that minorities and MBEs are 
afforded a reasonable opportunity to participate in employment and 
procurement opportunities that will result from financial assistance 
provided under the Rail Acts.
    (6) The recipient agrees to take such actions as are necessary to 
monitor its activities and those of its contractors who will be paid in 
whole or in part with funds provided by the Rail Acts, or from 
obligations guaranteed by the Administrator pursuant to the Rail Acts, 
except obligations guaranteed under section 602 of the Rail Passenger 
Service Act, in order to carry out affirmatively the purposes of 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and to implement the affirmative 
action program developed and implemented pursuant to 49 CFR part 265.
    (7) The recipient shall, in all advertisements for employees, or 
solicitations for services or materials from business organizations 
placed by or on behalf of the recipient, in connection with any project, 
program or activity funded in whole or in part with financial assistance 
under the Rail Acts, state that all applicants for employment will 
receive consideration for employment, and all business organizations 
will receive consideration for an award of a contract, without regard to 
race, color, national origin or sex.
    (8) The recipient shall send to each labor organization or 
representative of workers with which it has a collective bargaining 
agreement or other contract or understanding a notice to be provided by 
the agency's representative, advising the labor organization or workers' 
representative of the recipient's commitments under section 905 of the 
Act, and shall post copies of the notice in conspicuous places available 
to employees and applicants for employment.
    (9) The recipient shall comply with all provisions of section 905 of 
the Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, any other Federal civil rights 
act, and with the rules, regulations, and orders issued under such acts.
    (10) The recipient shall furnish all information and reports 
required by the rules, regulations, and orders of the Administrator, and 
will permit access to its books, records, and accounts by the 
Administrator for purposes of investigation to ascertain compliance with 
rules, regulations, and orders referred to in paragraph (a)(9) of this 
section.
    (11) Recipient shall furnish such relevant procurement information, 
not included in its affirmative action program as may be requested by 
the MBE Resource Center. Upon the request of the recipient, the Center 
shall keep such information confidential to the extent necessary to 
protect commercial or financial information or trade secrets to the 
extent permitted by law.
    (12) In the event of the recipient's noncompliance with the 
nondiscrimination clauses of this agreement, or with the provisions of 
section 905 of the Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or with any other 
Federal civil rights act, or with any rules, regulations, or orders 
issued under such acts, this contract will, after notice of such 
noncompliance, and after affording a reasonable opportunity for 
compliance, be canceled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part 
and the recipient may be declared ineligible for further Federal 
financial assistance in accordance with procedures authorized in section 
905 of the Act, or as otherwise provided by law.
    (13) The recipient shall not enter into any contract or contract 
modification whether for the furnishing of supplies or services or for 
the use of real or personal property, including lease arrangements, or 
for construction, in connection with a project, program or

[[Page 480]]

activity which receives financial assistance under the Rail Acts with a 
contractor debarred from or who has not demonstrated eligibility for 
Federal or federally assisted contracts, and will carry out such 
sanctions and penalties for violation of this part as may be imposed 
upon contractors and subcontractors by the Administrator or any other 
authorized Federal official. The recipient shall insure that the clauses 
required by 41 CFR 60-1.46 implementing Executive Order 11246 will be 
placed in each non-exempt federally assisted construction contract.
    (14) The recipient agrees to comply with and implement the written 
affirmative action program as approved by the Administrator pursuant to 
Sec. 265.17 of title 49 CFR.
    (15) The recipient agrees to notify the Administrator promptly of 
any law suit or complaint filed against the recipient alleging 
discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin or sex.
    (16) The recipient shall include the preceding provisions of 
paragraphs (a) (1) through (15) of this section in every contract or 
purchase order, whether for the furnishing of supplies or services or 
for the use of real or personal property, including lease arrangements, 
or for construction relating to projects, programs or activities 
financed in whole or in part under the Rail Acts. The recipient shall 
cause each such contractor or vendor to include the provisions of 
paragraphs (a) (1) through (15) of this section in every subcontract. 
The recipient will take such action with respect to any such contract or 
purchase order as the Administrator may direct as a means of enforcing 
such provisions including sanctions for noncompliance; provided, 
however, that in the event the recipient becomes involved in, or is 
threatened with, litigation with a contractor or vendor as a result of 
such direction by the Administrator, the recipient may request the 
United States to enter into such litigation.


<R05>
Sec. 265.9  Affirmative action program--General.

    Recipients of financial assistance under the Rail Acts and their 
contractors, as specified herein, shall develop and maintain an 
affirmative action program to insure that persons and businesses are not 
discriminated against because of race, color, national origin or sex in 
programs, projects and activities financed in whole or in part through 
financial assistance provided under the Rail Acts, and that minorities 
and MBEs receive a fair proportion of employment and contractual 
opportunities which will result from such programs, projects and 
activities.


<R05>
Sec. 265.11  Submission of affirmative action program.

    (a) Each application for financial assistance under any of the Rail 
Acts shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any 
financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be 
accompanied by two copies of a written affirmative action program for 
review by and approval of the Administrator. Recipients that have 
already entered into an agreement or other arrangement providing for 
such assistance shall, within 60 days after the effective date of this 
part, develop and submit to the Administrator two copies of a written 
affirmative action program for review by and approval of the 
Administrator and thereafter maintain such program.
    (b)(1) Beginning 30 days after the effective date of this part, and 
until 120 days after such date, each recipient shall require any 
contractor, as a condition to an award of a contract, for $50,000 or 
more for services or products on a project receiving federal financial 
assistance under a program covered by section 905 of the Act:
    (i) To furnish to the recipient a written assurance that it will, 
within 90 days after the date of the award, develop and maintain a 
written affirmative action program meeting the requirements of this part 
for the project, program or activity covered by the contract,
    (ii) To require each of its subcontractors receiving an award of a 
subcontract for $50,000 or more within 120 days after the effective date 
of this part, to furnish to the contractor as a condition to such an 
award the written assurance described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section.
    (2) Beginning 120 days after the effective date of this part, each 
recipient

[[Page 481]]

shall require as a condition to the award of a contract or subcontract 
of $50,000 or more that the contractor or subcontractor furnish a 
certificate to the recipient or contractor as appropriate that a written 
affirmative action program meeting the requirements of this part has 
been developed and is being maintained.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, each 
contractor or subcontractor having a contract or $50,000 or more but 
less than 50 employees shall be required to develop and maintain a 
written affirmative action program only for contracts in accordance with 
Sec. 265.13(c) of this part.
    (4) A recipient or contractor shall not procure supplies or services 
in less than usual quantities or in a manner which is intended to have

Sec. 265.13  Contents of affirmative action program.

    (a) General. A prerequisite to the development of a satisfactory 
affirmative action program is the identification and analysis of problem 
areas inherent in minority employment and utilization of MBEs, and an 
evaluation of opportunities for utilization of minority group personnel 
and MBEs. Therefore, an affirmative action program to guarantee 
employment and contractual opportunities shall provide for specific 
actions keyed to the problems and needs of minority persons and MBEs 
including, where there are deficiencies based on past practices, and 
with respect to future plans for hiring and promoting employees or 
awarding contracts, the development of specific goals and timetables for 
the prompt achievement and maintenance of full opportunities for 
minority persons and MBEs with respect to programs, projects and 
activities subject to this part.
    (b) Employment practices. (1) The affirmative action program for 
employment showing the level of utilization of minority employees, and 
establishing a plan to insure representative opportunities for 
employment for minority persons shall be developed in accordance with 
the regulations of the Department of Labor at 41 CFR 60-2.
    (2) Railroad applicants or recipients shall develop their program 
for each establishment in their organization and by job categories in 
accordance with the requirements of the Joint Reporting Committee of the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Labor. 
Other applicants, recipients or contractors may use any program format 
or organization which has been approved for use by other Federal 
agencies enforcing equal opportunity laws.
    (3) The affirmative action program shall show the source of 
statistical data used.
    (4) The affirmative action program shall include a listing by job 
category of all jobs which may be established or filled by the 
applicant, recipient or contractor as a result of the project, program 
or activity funded by federal financial assistance under the Rail Acts 
for the first five years of such project, program or activity or the 
period during which such project, program or activity will be 
undertaken, whichever is the lesser (``program period'').
    (5) The affirmative action program shall set forth in detail a plan 
to insure that with respect to the project, program or activity financed 
in whole or in part through financial assistance under the Rail Acts, 
minority persons have an opportunity to participate in employment in 
proportion to the percentage of the minority work force in the area 
where the applicant's, recipient's or contractor's operations are 
located as compared to the total work force, and that such minority 
persons have an equal opportunity for promotion or upgrading. Where 
appropriate because of prior underutilization of minority employees, the 
program shall establish specific goals and timetables to utilize 
minority employees in such projects, programs or activities in the 
above-mentioned proportion.
    (c) Contracts. (1) The affirmative action program shall include 
details of proposed contracts in excess of $10,000 to be awarded in 
connection with projects, programs and activities funded in whole or in 
part through financial

[[Page 482]]

assistance under the Rail Acts, including contracts for professional and 
financial services, for the program period. The details shall include a 
description of the services or products which will be sought including 
estimated quantities, the location where the services are to be 
provided, the manner in which proposals will be solicited (e.g., cost 
plus fixed fee, fixed price), the manner in which contracts will be 
awarded (e.g., competitive or sole source). The plan shall also give 
details as to bidding procedures, and information as to other 
qualifications for doing business with the applicant, recipient or 
contractor. Upon request by the applicant, recipient or contractor, any 
information submitted to the Administrator shall be kept confidential to 
the extent permitted by law.
    (2) The affirmative action program shall review the procurement 
practices of the applicant, recipient or contractor for the full year 
preceding the date of the submission of the affirmative action program 
and evaluate the utilization of MBE in its procurement activities. Such 
evaluation of utilization of MBEs shall include the following:
    (i) An analysis of awards of contracts to MBEs during such year 
describing the nature of goods and services purchased and the dollar 
amount involved; and
    (ii) A comparison of the percentage of awards of contracts to MBEs 
(by number of contracts and by total dollar amount involved) to the 
total procurement activity of the applicant, recipient or contractor for 
said year.
    (3) The affirmative action program shall set forth in detail 
applicant's, recipient's or contractor's plan to insure that MBEs are 
afforded a fair and representative opportunity to do business with 
applicant, recipient or contractor (both in terms of number of contracts 
and dollar amount involved) for the program period. Such plan shall 
identify specific actions to be taken to:
    (i) Designate a liaison officer who will administer the MBE program;
    (ii) Provide for adequate and timely consideration of the 
availability and potential of MBEs in all procurement decisions;
    (iii) Assure that MBEs will have an equitable opportunity to compete 
for contracts, by arranging solicitation time for the preparation of 
bids, quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules so as to 
facilitate the participation of MBEs and by assisting MBEs who are 
potential contractors in preparing bid materials and in obtaining and 
maintaining suitable bonding coverage in those instances where bonds are 
required;
    (iv) Maintain records showing that the policies set forth in this 
part are being complied with;
    (v) Submit quarterly reports of the records referred to in paragraph 
(c)(3)(iv) of this section in such form and manner as the Administrator 
may prescribe; and
    (vi) Where appropriate because of prior underutilization of MBEs, 
establish specific goals and timetables to utilize MBEs in the 
performance of contracts awarded.
    (d) Successor organizations. Where applicant, recipient or 
contractor is a successor organization, its affirmative action program 
shall review the hiring and procurement practices of its predecessor 
organization or organizations.

Sec. 265.14  Determining the MBE status of a business.

    FRA or a recipient may, on the basis of available information, 
determine that a business is not an MBE within the meaning of this part. 
This determination shall be final, except as provided in Sec. 265.14-1, 
for that contract and other contracts being let by that contracting 
agency at the time of the determination. Businesses may correct 
deficiencies in their ownership and control and apply as MBEs only for 
future contracts.

Sec. 265.14-1  Appeals of determination of MBE status.

    (a) Filing. Any firm who believes that it has been wrongly 
determined not to be an MBE under Sec. 265.14 by the FRA or a recipient 
may file an appeal in writing with the Administrator. The appeal shall 
be filed no later than 30 days after the date of the determination. The 
Administrator may extend the time for filing or waive the time limit in 
the interest of justice, specifying in writing the reasons for so doing. 
Third

[[Page 483]]

parties who have reason to believe that a business has been wrongly 
denied or granted status as an MBE may advise the Administrator. This 
information is not considered an appeal pursuant to this section.
    (b) Decision to investigate. The Administrator ensures that a prompt 
investigation is made of those cases with investigative merit (except 
those being reviewed on the merits by the Comptroller General), pursuant 
to prescribed DOT Title VI (49 CFR part 21) investigation procedures.
    (c) Status during the investigation. The Administrator may deny the 
business in question eligibility to participate as an MBE in direct or 
FRA-assisted contracts let during the pendancy of the investigation, 
after providing the business in question an opportunity to show cause by 
written statement to the Administrator why this should not occur.
    (d) Cooperation in investigation. All parties shall cooperate fully 
with the investigation. Failure or refusal to furnish relevant 
information or other failure to cooperate is a violation of this part.
    (e) Determinations. The Administrator will make one of the following 
determinations and so inform the business in writing of the reasons for 
the determination:
    (1) The business is considered to be an MBE within the meaning of 
this part; or
    (2) The business is not considered to be an MBE within the meaning 
of this part and is denied eligibility to participate as an MBE in any 
direct or FRA-assisted contract until a further determination is made by 
FRA that the business is an MBE within the meaning of this part.

Sec. 265.15  Implementation and maintenance of affirmative action program.

    The affirmative action program with respect to employment and 
procurement practices shall set forth in detail applicant's recipient's 
or contractor's program to implement and maintain its recommended action 
program to insure that persons and businesses are not discriminated 
against because of race, color, national origin or sex, and that 
minorities and MBEs have equal employment and contractual opportunities 
with applicant, recipient or contractor. In developing its maintenance 
program for employment, applicants, recipients and contractors shall 
follow the applicable regulations of the Department of Labor 
implementing Executive Order 11246 at 41 CFR 60-2, subpart C, which 
provisions may also be helpful in implementing and maintaining 
applicant's recipient's or contractor's procurement program.


<R05>
Sec. 265.17  Review of affirmative action program.

    (a) Except as provided for contractors and subcontractors in 
Sec. 265.11(b), each affirmative action program to be acceptable must 
have the written approval of the Administrator.
    (b) The Administrator recognizes that there may be some exceptional 
situations where the requirements of Sec. 265.13 through Sec. 265.15 may 
not fulfill the affirmative action objectives sought or that those 
objectives may be better achieved through modified or different 
requirements. Accordingly, the applicant, recipient or contractor may 
request approval for modified or different requirements that embody the 
objectives of Secs. 265.13 through 265.15. Such a request must include 
detailed showings that the particular situation is exceptional and that 
the modified or different proposals substantially comply with the 
objectives of this part. If the Administrator determines that the 
requirements for a detailed justification have been met, he may waive or 
modify these requirements or impose different requirements as he deems 
necessary to further the objectives sought herein.

records, accounts and other sources of information and its facilities as 
may in the opinion of the Administrator be necessary to ascertain 
compliance with this part.
    (c) Each recipient and contractor shall make available to 
participants, beneficiaries and other interested persons, such 
information regarding the provisions of this part and the applicability 
to the program, project or activity under which the recipient received 
financial assistance from the Rail Acts or under which the contractor is 
awarded a contract and make such information available to them in such 
manner as the Administrator finds necessary to apprise such persons of 
the protections against discrimination assured them by the Act and this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 265.21  Conduct of investigations.

    (a) The Administrator shall from time to time review the practices 
of recipients and contractors to determine whether they are complying 
with this part. The Administrator shall to the fullest extent 
practicable seek the cooperation of recipients and contractors in 
obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and 
guidance to recipients and contractors to help them comply voluntarily 
with this part. As required by Sec. 265.7(a)(6) of this part recipients 
and contractors shall from time to time review the practices of their 
contractors and subcontractors to determine whether they are complying 
with this part.
    (b) Any person who believes himself or herself or any other person 
to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part, may file with 
the Administrator a written complaint. A complaint must be filed not 
later than sixty (60) days after the date complainant discovers the 
alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the 
Administrator.
    (c) The Administrator will make a prompt investigation in cases 
where a compliance review, report, complaint or other information 
indicates a possible failure to comply with this part.
    (d)(1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section 
indicates a failure to comply with this part, the Administrator shall 
within ten (10) days after such determination so inform the recipient or 
contractor in writing of the specific grounds for alleging noncompliance 
and the matter shall be resolved by informal means whenever possible. 
The notice shall provide that, if it has been determined that the matter 
is not resolved by informal means within thirty (30) days after the 
delivery of the notice, action will be taken as provided for in 
Sec. 265.23.
    (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Administrator shall within ten 
(10) days after such determination so inform the recipient, or 
contractor and the complainant, if any, in writing.
    (e) No recipient, contractor or other person shall intimidate, 
threaten, coerce or discriminate against any individual for the purpose 
of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 905 of the 
Act or this part, or because he or she made a complaint, testified, 
assisted or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding 
or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall be kept 
confidential at their election during the conduct of any investigation, 
proceeding or hearing under this part. But when such confidentiality is 
likely to hinder the investigation the complainant will be advised for 
the purpose of waiving the privilege.


<R05>
Sec. 265.23  Procedures for effecting compliance.

    (a) Whenever the Administrator determines that any recipient, or 
contractor has failed to comply with the provisions of this part, or 
with any

[[Page 485]]

Federal civil rights statute, or with any order or regulation issued 
under such a statute, and such failure has not been resolved by informal 
means pursuant to Sec. 265.21 of this part, the Administrator shall 
within ten (10) days after such determination notify such recipient or 
contractor, and the appropriate labor organization if the matter may 
appear to affect a person who is covered by a collective bargaining 
agreement, in writing of the specific grounds for alleging 
noncompliance, and the right of such persons to respond to such 
determination in writing or to request an informal hearing. Where the 
Administrator determines that substantial noncompliance exists and it is 
unlikely that compliance will be obtained, or that lack of good faith 
exists, or that other good cause exists, he may order that further 
financial assistance be suspended in whole or in part pending a final 
decision in the matter. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b) 
through (e) of this section, the recipient or contractor shall have 
sixty (60) days from the date of delivery of the notice within which to 
comply. The recipient or contractor may be entitled to additional time 
if it is demonstrated that compliance is not possible within the sixty 
day period and that the necessary initial curative actions were 
undertaken promptly and have been diligently prosecuted toward 
completion. The Administrator shall specify the last day upon which 
curative action must be completed to his satisfaction. Unless the 
Administrator determines that compliance cannot be reasonably attained, 
failure to take curative action shall be grounds for the Administrator 
to:
    (1) Direct that no further Federal financial assistance be provided 
to the recipient;
    (2) Refer the matter to the Attorney General with a recommendation 
that an appropriate civil action be instituted;
    (3) Exercise the powers and functions provided by title VI of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.); or
    (4) Take such other actions as may be provided by law or this part.
    (b) Persons receiving notification and a directive pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section may within thirty (30) days after receipt 
respond to the notice in writing in lieu of requesting an informal 
hearing as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The Administrator 
will make a determination as to compliance within thirty (30) days after 
receipt of such written response, and advise the person in writing of 
his determination. If the Administrator determines that compliance is 
reasonably attainable and that such person has failed to comply with the 
provisions of this part or with his determination within 30 days after 
receipt of his determination, the Administrator shall pursue the 
remedies set forth in the last sentence of paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) Persons receiving notification and a directive pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section may within ten (10) days after receipt 
request an informal hearing in lieu of filing a written response as 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The Administrator may, in 
his discretion, grant a request for an informal hearing for the purpose 
of inquiring into the status of compliance of such person. The 
Administrator will advise persons subject to his directive in writing as 
to the time and place of the informal hearings and may direct such 
persons to bring specific documents and records, or furnish other 
relevant information concerning their compliance status. When so 
requested, such person shall attend and bring the requested information. 
The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to 
change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time 
and place of the hearing. The failure of such person to request a 
hearing or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be 
deemed to be a consent to the applicability of the procedures set forth 
in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer appointed by 
the Administrator. Such hearings shall commence within twenty (20) days 
from the date the hearing is granted and shall be concluded no later 
than thirty (30) days from the commencement date. Parties to informal 
hearings may be represented by counsel or other authorized

[[Page 486]]

representative and shall have a fair opportunity to present any relevant 
material. Formal rules of evidence will not apply to such proceedings.
    (e) Decisions and notices. (1) Within ten (10) days after the 
conclusion of such hearings, the hearing officer will advise the 
Administrator, in writing, of his views and recommendations as to 
compliance with this part and a copy of such decision shall be sent by 
registered mail, return receipt requested, to the recipient or 
contractor and participating labor organization. If the hearing officer 
in his decision determines that the recipient or contractor is in 
noncompliance with this part, he may, if he determines that it is 
unlikely that compliance will be obtained, or that a lack of good faith 
exists, or for other good cause, order that further financial assistance 
be suspended in whole or in part, pending a decision by the 
Administrator in the matter.
    (2) The recipient, contractor or labor organization may file 
exceptions to the hearing officer's decision, with his reasons therefor, 
with the Administrator within thirty (30) days of receipt of the initial 
decision. Within twenty (20) days, after the time for filing exceptions, 
the Administrator shall determine, in writing, whether or not the 
parties involved are in compliance with this part. A copy of the 
Administrator's decision will be given to the recipient, contractor, 
labor organization, if appropriate, and to the complainant, if any.
    (3) If the Administrator determines that compliance can reasonably 
be attained, his decision shall provide that if such person fails or 
refuses to comply with the decision of the Administrator within thirty 
(30) days after receipt of the decision, the Administrator shall:
    (i) Direct that no further Federal assistance be provided to such a 
person;
    (ii) Refer the matter to the Attorney General with a recommendation 
that an appropriate civil action be instituted;
    (iii) Exercise the powers and functions provided by title VI of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964; and/or
    (iv) Take such other actions as may be provided by law or this part.
    (4) A recipient or contractor adversely affected by a decision of 
the Administrator issued under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section 
shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal assistance or 
award of a federally assisted contract if the recipient or contractor 
takes complete curative action to eliminate the noncompliance with this 
part and if the recipient or contractor provides reasonable assurance 
that the recipient or contractor will fully comply with this part.

operation assistance. Eligible in-kind benefits are valued as follows:
    (i) The value of forgiven taxes, such as those portions of gross 
receipts or revenue taxes which are applicable to an approved project or 
property taxes on project related property, shall be the amount which 
would otherwise have been levied by the taxing authority. Forgiveness 
may be through exemption or remission;

[[Page 491]]

    (ii) The value of trackage rights secured by a State for a common 
carrier shall be the amount paid by railroads for comparable rights on 
comparable rail freight properties;
    (iii) The value of State salaries for State public employees working

behalf of the State of real property or tangible personal property of 
the kind necessary for safe and efficient operation of rail freight 
service, such as State or locally owned or leased buildings used in rail 
freight operations or equipment or materials, shall be determined as 
follows:
    (A) The value of State tangible personal property shall be 
established at the State's actual cost in accordance with Federal 
Management Circular 74-4;
    (B) The value of donated tangible personal property shall be 
determined in accordance with Attachment F of Office of Management and 
Budget Circular (OMB) A-102;
    (C) The value of State real property shall be established at the 
State's actual cost in accordance with Federal Management Circular 74-4, 
if at least one independent appraisal based on the results of a title 
search was performed when the property was purchased by the State, 
otherwise it shall be valued at the fair market value as established by 
at least one independent appraisal based on the results of a title 
search at the time the state proposes to make the property available as 
in-kind benefit; and
    (D) The value of donated real property shall be its fair market 
value, at the time of donation to the State, as established by at least 
one independent appraisal based on the results of a title search;
    (2) Eligibility criteria. To be applied toward the State share, in-
kind benefits must:
    (i) Be verifiable from the State's records;

allocable to the work performed: Planning and program operation costs 
which are allowed under Federal Management Circular 74-4; and costs of 
projects eligible under Sec. 266.7 of this part. All allowable costs 
shall be authorized by a fully executed grant agreement. A State may 
incur costs prior to the execution of a grant agreement only if the 
Administrator, based on the State's demonstration of a compelling need 
to incur costs prior to the execution of a grant agreement, has 
authorized the costs in writing prior to their incurrence by the State.


<R05>
Sec. 266.13  Distribution of funds.

    (a) Formula. Funds appropriated for or reallocated in any fiscal 
year (in this section refered to jointly as ``funds'') are to be 
distributed to each State as follows:
    (1) Two-thirds of the funds will be allocated in the ratio which a 
State's rail mileage that, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 10904(d), is 
either potentially

[[Page 492]]

subject to abandonment or is to become the subject of an application for 
a certificate of abandonment or discontinuance which a carrier plans to 
submit, but has not yet submitted, bears to the total such rail mileage 
in all the States;
    (2) One-third of the funds will be allocated in the ratio which a 
State's rail mileage for which the Commission has found within three 
years prior to the first day of the fiscal year for which the funds are 
being allocated that the public convenience and necessity permits the 
abandonment, or the discontinuance, of rail service on such rail 
mileage, bears to the total such rail mileage in all the States. Until 
September 30, 1981, such rail mileage includes the rail mileage which 
was eligible under the Rail Service Assistance Program pursuant to 
section 402 of the Rail Act, and all rail mileage which, prior to 
October 1, 1978, had been included for formula allocation purposes. The 
Administrator will calculate rail mileage under this paragraph as of 
October 1 of each year; and
    (3) The above calculations will be adjusted if necessary so that no 
State receives less than 1 percent of the funds appropriated for a 
fiscal year.
    (b) Reallocation. The Administrator will reallocate among the States 
funds which have not been granted under an executed grant agreement by 
the end of the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated and 
funds determined by a Federal audit to be in excess of allowable costs 
when they have not been granted under an executed grant agreement by the 
end of the fiscal year in which the Federal audit is made. Reallocated 
funds are distributed in accordance with the allocation formula 
described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Interstate sharing of allocated funds. Where not in violation of 
State law, two or more States, which are eligible to receive assistance 
under the Rail Service Assistance Program pursuant to Sec. 266.5 of this 
part may combine any portion of their entitlements for purposes of 
conducting any eligible project of mutual benefit provided that they 
enter into an agreement for this purpose.

Sec. 266.19  Environmental impact.

    (a) General. The Administrator has determined that providing 
assistance to cover the following costs is not a major action 
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment: 
Rehabilitation or improvement consisting of work normally performed on a 
periodic basis which does not change the existing character of the 
facility (including work to overcome normal periodic maintenance that 
had been deferred) rail service continuation, acquisition, and planning.
    (b) Substitute service assistance, rail facility construction 
assistance, and non-exempt rehabilitation or improvement assistance--(1) 
Environmental assessment. (i) When an applicant requests substitute 
service assistance, rail facility construction assistance, or 
rehabilitation or improvement assistance (except for

[[Page 500]]

rehabilitation or improvement assistance which is exempt under paragraph 
(a) of this section), the applicant shall:
    (A) Prepare an environmental assessment to determine whether the 
future use of the property will significantly affect the quality of the 
human environment; or
    (B) Provide sufficient documentation to enable the Administrator to 
determine that the project satisfies the following criteria:
    (1) The action is not likely to be environmentally controversial 
from the point of view of people living within the environment affected 
by the action or controversial with respect to the availability of 
adequate relocation housing;
    (2) The action is not inconsistent with any Federal, State, or local 
law, regulation, ordinance, or judicial or administrative determination 
relating to environmental protection;

natural, cultural, recreational, or scenic environment(s) in which the 
action takes place, or on the air or water quality or ambient noise 
levels of such environment(s);
    (4) The action will not: use 4(f)-protected properties; adversely 
affect properties under section 106 of the National Historic 
Preservation Act; involve new construction location in a wetlands area; 
or affect a base floodplain;
    (5) The action will not cause a significant short- or long-term 
increase in traffic congestion, or other significant adverse 
environmental impact on any mode of transportation;
    (6) The action is not an integral part of a program of actions 
which, when considered separately, would not be classified as major FRA 
actions, but when considered together would be so classified; and

Federal law, regulation, guideline, order, or judicial or administrative 
determination other than this part.
    (ii) Prior to submitting an application, FRA recommends that the 
applicant seek the Administrator's advice as to form and substance of 
the assessment for the project under consideration. The environmental 
assessment shall utilize an interdisciplinary approach in identifying 
the type, degree of effect, and probability of occurrence of primary, 
secondary and cumulative potential environmental impacts (positive and 
negative) of the proposed action and of alternative courses of action. 
The depth of coverage shall be consistent with the magnitude of the 
project and its expected environmental effects. The environmental 
assessment and all documents used as a basis for the assessment shall be 
submitted together with the application for assistance.
    (2) Environmental impact statement. A draft environmental impact 
statement (EIS) shall be submitted with each application when the 
environmental assessment concludes that the future use significantly 
affects the quality of human environment. FRA recommends that prior to 
submitting the application, the applicant seek the Administrator's 
advice as to form and substance of the EIS for the project under 
consideration.
    (3) Finding of no significant impact. A draft finding of no 
significant impact declaration shall be submitted with each application 
when the applicant's environmental assessment concludes that the figure 
use does not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. 
The finding of no significant impact shall include a description of the 
project, and sufficient data and environmental findings to support the 
conclusions as to the impact upon the quality of the human environment. 
FRA recommends that prior to submitting the application, the applicant 
seek the Administrator's advice as to the form and substance of this 
finding for the project under consideration.
    (4) Section 4(f) determination. For projects involving the use of 
any land from a public park, recreation area, wildlife and waterfowl 
refuge, or historic site of national, State or local significance as 
determined by the Federal, State, or local officials having jurisdiction 
thereon, information to support a determination pursuant to section 4(f)

for the Federal share of the approved amount of estimated program costs 
will be executed by the Administrator and the grantee.
    (2) The grant agreement will identify the amount of the grantee's 
share of program costs to be furnished in cash and through approved in-
kind benefits. The grantee shall expend a pro-rata share of its cash 
contribution at the same time payments of the Federal share are made 
available to the grantee.
    (b) Disbursement.  (1) Federal funds are provided either in advance 
by a letter-of-credit or a Treasury check or by reimbursement in 
accordance with Attachment J of OMB Circular A-102.
    (2) Prior to receipt of advance payments, the grantee must have 
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that it has 
established procedures to comply with OMB Circular A-102, Attachment J, 
including procedures that will minimize the time elapsing between the 
receipt of funds by the grantee and their disbursement. Evidence of such 
compliance shall be provided to the Administrator at least 30 days prior 
to the anticipated date of receipt of advance payments. An advance by 
letter-of-credit is used when the rail service assistance is expected to 
be provided for a minimum of one (1) year, and is expected to involve 
annual payments aggregating at least $120,000. Otherwise, advance 
payments are made by Treasury check.
    (3) If the grantee is not eligible for advance payments or does not 
desire them, the grantee will be reimbursed for eligible expenditures at 
the end of each fiscal quarter upon submission of a request for 
reimbursement.
    (4) Before disbursement of Federal funds can be made to a grantee 
for payment to third parties under this subsection, the grantee must 
have executed an agreement with the third party.
    (5) Acquisition assistance will be disbursed only after the 
following have been approved by the Administrator:

describe the type of title being acquired, and if a general warranty 
deed is not being given, it must explain why it could not be given. The 
opinion shall also advise of any need for use of the State's eminent 
domain powers to assure adequate title. In addition, the opinion shall 
explain how the defects disclosed by the title search might affect the 
marketability of the property;
    (ii) A written determination that the property acquired is limited 
to the land and facilities that are needed for the rail freight services 
which would have been curtailed or abandoned but for the acquistion has 
been accepted by the Administrator; and
    (iii) A written determination that the purchase price is consistent 
with the value of the property interest being acquired, and the evidence 
upon which the determination is based.
    (c)  Settlement. (1) Settlement under the grant agreement is made on 
the basis of a Federal audit which has determined the allowable costs 
over the entire term of the grant agreement. If the Federal audit 
determines that the allowable costs under the grant agreement are less 
than the amount of the grant, the difference shall be refunded to FRA at 
the end of the fiscal year in which the audit was made unless it has

[[Page 502]]

become the subject of another executed grant agreement. Upon termination 
of a State's participation in the Rail Service Assistance Program, the 
State shall repay FRA the Federal share of any unused rehabilitation and 
improvement assistance and any accumulated interest.


<R05>
Sec. 266.23  Record, audit, and examination.

    (a) Retention and custodial requirements for financial records, 
supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records 
pertinent to a grant provided under this part shall be governed by

    (b) The Administrator and the Comptroller General of the United 
States or any of their duly authorized representatives shall, until the 
expiration of three years after submission to the Administrator of the 
grantee's final accounting of all program funds, and for any longer 
period necessary to resolve audit findings, have access for the purpose 
of audit and examination to any books, documents, papers, and records 
which in the opinion of the Administrator or the Comptroller General of 
the United States may be related or pertinent to the grants, contracts, 
or other arrangements arising out of, or in any way connected with, the 
rail service assistance program.


<R05>
Sec. 266.25  Waivers and modifications.

    The Administrator may, with respect to individual requests, upon 
good cause shown, waive or modify any requirement of this part not 
required by law or make any additional requirements the Administrator 
deems necessary. Procedures for submission and consideration of 
petitions for waiver or modification are governed by 49 CFR part 211.

Sec.
301.50  Regional offices; general description.
301.52  Jurisdiction of regional offices.

    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 104, 307, 501 et seq., 1801 et seq., 3101 et 
seq., 10925, 10927 note; 42 U.S.C. 4917; 49 CFR 1.48.


<R05>
Sec. 301.50  Regional offices; general description.

    The Federal Highway Administration has regional offices, commonly 
referred to as Regional Administrations, which are numerically 
identified as Regions 1 and 3 through 10. Each regional office has 
jurisdiction over a geographical area consisting of a designated group 
of States. Each regional office is headed by a Regional Federal Highway 
Administrator (commonly called the Regional Administrator for ease of 
reference), who is assisted by a regional headquarters staff of legal, 
administrative, and program specialists, and who is responsible for 
directing at local levels the Federal Highway Administration 
responsibilities for administration of the direct Federal, Federal-aid, 
and other highway and traffic safety programs.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 325.1   Scope of the rules in this part.

    (a) The rules in this part prescribe procedures for inspection, 
surveillance, and measurement of motor vehicles and motor vehicle 
equipment operated by motor carriers to determine whether those vehicles 
and that equipment conform to the Interstate Motor Carrier Noise 
Emission Standards of the Environmental Protection Agency, 40 CFR part 
202.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the rules 
in this part apply to motor carriers engaged in interstate commerce. The 
rules apply at any time or under any condition of highway grade, load, 
acceleration or deceleration.
    (c) The rules in this part do not apply to--
    (1) A motor vehicle that has a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) of 
10,000 pounds (4,536 kg.) or less;
    (2) A combination of motor vehicles that has a Gross Combination 
Weight Rating (GCWR) of 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg.) or less;
    (3) The sound generated by a warning device, such as a horn or 
siren, installed in a motor vehicle, unless such device is intentionally 
sounded in order to preclude an otherwise valid noise emission 
measurement;
    (4) An emergency motor vehicle, such as a fire engine, an ambulance, 
a police van, or a rescue van, when it is responding to an emergency 
call;
    (5) A snow plow in operation; or
    (6) The sound generated by auxiliary equipment which is normally 
operated only when the motor vehicle on which it is installed is stopped 
or is operating at a speed of 5 miles per hour (8 kph) or less, unless 
such device is intentionally operated at speeds greater than 5 mph (8 
kph) in order to preclude an otherwise valid noise measurement. Examples 
of that type of auxiliary equipment include, but are not limited to, 
cranes, asphalt, spreaders, ditch diggers, liquid or slurry pumps, 
auxiliary air compressors, welders, and trash compactors.


<R05>
Sec. 325.3   Effective date.

    The rules in this part are effective on October 15, 1975.


<R05>
Sec. 325.5   Definitions.

    (a)  Statutory definitions.  All terms defined in the Noise Control 
Act of 1972 (Pub. L. 92-574, 86 Stat. 1234) are used as they are defined 
in that Act.
    (b)  Definitions in standards.  All terms defined in Sec. 202.10 of 
the Interstate Motor Carrier Noise Emission Standards, 40 CFR 202.10, 
are used as they are defined in that section.
    (c)  Additional definitions.  (1) Hard test site means any test site 
having the ground surface covered with concrete, asphalt, packed dirt, 
gravel, or similar reflective material for more than \1/2\ the distance 
between the microphone target point and the microphone location point.
    (2) Soft test site means any test site having the ground surface 
covered with grass, other ground cover, or similar absorptive material 
for \1/2\ or more of the distance between the microphone

[[Page 507]]

target point and the microphone location point.
    (3) Ground cover means any of various low, dense-growing plants, 
such as ivy, myrtle, low weeds, or brush.
    (4) Traffic railing means any longitudinal highway traffic barrier 
system installed along the side or median of a highway. For the purpose 
of this part, a traffic railing must have at least 35 percent of its 
vertical height, from the ground surface to the top of the railing, open 
to free space in order to qualify as an acceptable object within a noise 
measurement test site. Further, for the purposes of this part, posts or 
other discrete supports shall be ignored when ascertaining open free 
space.
    (5) Relatively flat when used to describe a noise measurement site 
means a site which does not contain significant concave curvatures or 
slope reversals that may result in the focusing of sound waves toward 
the microphone location point.


<R05>
Sec. 325.7   Allowable noise levels.

    Motor vehicle noise emissions, when measured according to the rules 
of this part, shall not exceed the values specified in Table 1.

Sec. 325.9   Measurement tolerances.

    (a) Measurement tolerances will be allowed to take into account the 
effects of the following factors:
    (1) The consensus standard practice of reporting filed sound level 
measurements to the nearest whole decibel.
    (2) Variations resulting from commercial instrument tolerances.
    (3) Variations resulting from the topography of the noise 
measurement site.
    (4) Variations resulting from atmospheric conditions such as wind, 
ambient temperature, and atmospheric pressure.
    (5) Variations resulting from reflected sound from small objects 
allowed within the test site.

measurement systems which are used to make the sound level measurements 
specified in subpart D and subpart E of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 325.23   Type of measurement systems which may be used.

    The sound level measurement system must meet or exceed the 
requirements of American National Standard Specification for Sound Level 
Meters (ANSI S1.4-1971), approved April 27, 1971, issued by the American 
National Standards Institute,<SUP>1 throughout the applicable frequency 
range for either:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sec. 325.25   Calibration of measurement systems.

    (a)(1) The sound level measurement system must be calibrated and 
appropriately adjusted at one or more frequencies in the range from 250 
to 1,000 Hz at the beginning of each series of measurements and at 
intervals of 5-15 minutes thereafter, until it has been determined that 
the sound level measurement system has not significantly drifted from 
its calibrated level. Once this fact has been established, calibrations 
may be made at intervals once every hour. A significant drift shall be 
considered to have occurred if a 0.3 dB or more excursion is noted from 
the system's predetermined reference calibration level. In the case of 
systems using displays with whole decibel increments, the operator may 
visually judge when the 0.3 dB drift has been met or exceeded.
    (2) The sound level measurement system must be checked periodically 
by its manufacturer, a representative of its manufacturer, or a person 
of equivalent special competence to verify that its accuracy meets the 
manufacturer's design criteria.

<R05>
Sec. 325.59   Measurement procedure; stationary test.

    In accordance with the rules in this subpart, a measurement shall be 
made of the sound level generated by a stationary motor vehicle as 
follows:
    (a) Park the motor vehicle on the test site as specified in 
Sec. 325.53 of this subpart. If the motor vehicle is a combination 
(articulated) vehicle, park the combination so that the longitudinal 
centerlines of the towing vehicle and the towed vehicle or vehicles are 
in substantial alinement.
    (b) Turn off all auxiliary equipment which is installed on the motor 
vehicle and which is designed to operate under normal conditions only 
when the vehicle is operating at a speed of 5 mph (8 kph) or less. 
Examples of such equipment include cranes, asphalt spreaders, liquid or 
slurry pumps, auxiliary air compressors, welders, and trash compactors.
    (c) If the motor vehicle's engine radiator fan drive is equipped 
with a clutch or similar device that automatically either reduces the 
rotational speed of the fan or completely disengages the fan from its 
power source in response to reduced engine cooling loads, park the 
vehicle before testing with its engine running at high idle or any other 
speed the operator may choose, for sufficient time but not more than 10 
minutes, to permit the engine radiator fan to automatically disengage 
when the vehicle's noise emissions are measured under stationary test.
    (d) With the motor vehicle's transmission in neutral and its clutch 
engaged, rapidly accelerate the vehicle's engine from idle to its 
maximum governed speed with wide open throttle. Return the engine's 
speed to idle.
    (e) Observe the maximum reading on the sound level measurement 
system during the time the procedures specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section are followed. Record that reading, if the reading has not been 
influenced by extraneous noise sources such as motor vehicles operating 
on adjacent roadways.
    (f) Repeat the procedures specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of 
this section until the first two maximum sound level readings that are 
within 2 dB(A) of each other are recorded. Numerically average those two 
maximum

[[Page 514]]

sound level readings. When appropriate, correct the average figure in 
accordance with the rules in subpart F of this part.
    (g) The average figure, corrected as appropriate, contained in 
accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, is the sound level 
generated by the motor vehicle for the purpose of determining whether it 
conforms to the Standard for Operation Under Stationary Test, 40 CFR 
202.21. (Table 1 in Sec. 325.7 lists the range of maximum permissible 
sound level readings for various test conditions.)

added to, or subtracted from, the reading of the sound level generated 
by a motor vehicle, as displayed on a sound level measurement system, 
during the measurement of the motor vehicle's sound level emissions at a 
test site which is not a standard site.
    (b) The purpose of adding or subtracting a correction factor is to 
equate the sound level reading actually generated by the motor vehicle 
to the sound level reading it would have generated if the measurement 
had been made at a standard test site.

Sec. 325.75   Ground surface correction factors.<SUP>1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1 Table 1, in Sec. 325.7 is a tabulation of the maximum allowable 
sound level readings taking into account both the distance correction 
factors contained in Sec. 325.73 and the ground surface correction 
factors contained in Sec. 325.75.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) Highway operations. When measurements are made in accordance 
with the rules in subpart D of this part upon a test site which is 
``hard,'' a correction factor of 2 dB(A) shall be subtracted from the 
maximum observed sound level reading generated by the motor vehicle to 
determine whether the motor vehicle conforms to the Standards for 
Highway Operations, 40 CFR 202.20.
    (b) Stationary Test. When measurements are made in accordance with 
the rules in subpart E of this part upon a test site which is ``soft,'' 
a correction factor of 2 dB(A) shall be added to the numerical average 
of the recorded maximum observed sound level readings generated by the 
motor vehicle to determine whether the motor vehicle conforms to the 
Standard for Operation Under Stationary Test, 40 CFR 202.21.

Sec. 325.77   Computation of open site requirements--nonstandard sites.

    (a) If the distance between the microphone location point and the 
microphone target point is other than 50 feet (15.2 m), the test site 
must be an open site within a radius from both points which is equal to 
the distance between the microphone location point and the microphone 
target point.
    (b) Plan view diagrams of nonstandard test sites are shown in 
Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 illustrates a test site which is larger than a 
standard test site and is based upon a 60-foot (18.3 m) distance between 
the microphone location point and the microphone target point. (See 
Sec. 325.79(b)(1) for an example of the application of the correction 
factor to a sound level reading obtained at such a site.) Figure 4 
illustrates a test site which is smaller than a standard test site and 
is based upon a 35-foot (10.7 m) distance between the microphone 
location point and the microphone target point. (See Sec. 325.79(b)(2) 
for an example of the application of the correction factor to a sound 
level reading obtained at such a site.)

<R05>
Sec. 325.79   Application of correction factors.

    (a) If two correction factors apply to a measurement they are 
applied cumulatively.
    (b) The following examples illustrate the application of correction 
factors to sound level measurement readings:
    (1) Example 1--Highway operations. Assume that a motor vehicle 
generates a maximum observed sound level reading of 86 dB(A) during a 
measurement in accordance with the rules in subpart D of this part. 
Assume also that the distance between the microphone location point and 
the microphone target point is 60 feet (18.3 m) and that the measurement 
area of the test site is acoustically ``hard.'' The corrected sound 
level generated by the motor vehicle would be 85 dB(A), calculated as 
follows:

 86 dB(A)  Uncorrected reading
+1 dB(A)  Distance correction factor
-2 dB(A)  Ground surface correction factor
----------
 85 dB(A)  Corrected reading

    (2) Example 2--Stationary test. Assume that a motor vehicle 
generates maximum sound level readings which average 88 dB(A) during a 
measurement in accordance with the rules in subpart E of this part. 
Assume also that the distance between the microphone location point and 
the microphone target point is 35 feet (10.7 m), and that the 
measurement area of the test site is acoustically ``soft.'' The 
corrected sound level generated by the motor vehicle

[[Page 516]]

would be 87 dB(A), calculated as follows:

 88 dB(A)  Uncorrected average of readings
-3 dB(A)  Distance correction factor
+2 dB(A)  Ground surface correction factor
----------

 87 dB(A)  Corrected reading

<R05>
Sec. 325.91   Exhaust systems.

    A motor vehicle does not conform to the visual exhaust system 
inspection requirements, 40 CFR 202.22, of the Interstate Motor Carrier 
Noise Emission Standards, if inspection of the exhaust system of the 
motor vehicle discloses that the system--
    (a) Has a defect which adversely affects sound reduction, such as 
exhaust gas leaks or alteration or deterioration of muffler elements, 
(small traces of soot on flexible exhaust pipe sections shall not 
constitute a violation of this subpart);
    (b) Is not equipped with either a muffler or other noise dissipative 
device, such as a turbocharger (supercharger driven by exhaust gases); 
or
    (c) Is equipped with a cut-out, by-pass, or similar device, unless 
such device is designed as an exhaust gas driven cargo unloading system.


<R05>
Sec. 325.93   Tires.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a motor 
vehicle does not conform to the visual tire inspection requirements, 40 
CFR 202.23, of the Interstate Motor Carrier Noise Emissions Standards, 
if inspection of any tire on which the vehicle is operating discloses 
that the tire has a tread pattern composed primarily of cavities in the 
tread (excluding sipes and local chunking) which are not vented by 
grooves to the tire shoulder or circumferentially to each other around 
the tire.
    (b) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to a motor vehicle 
operated on a tire having a tread pattern of the type specified in that 
paragraph, if the motor carrier who operates the motor vehicle 
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Associate Administrator for 
Motor Carriers or his/her designee that either--
    (1) The tire did not have that type of tread pattern when it was 
originally manufactured or newly remanufactured; or
    (2) The motor vehicle generates a maximum sound level reading of 90 
dB(A) or less when measured at a standard test site for highway 
operations at a distance of 15.3 meters (50 feet) and under the 
following conditions:
    (i) The measurement must be made at a time and place and under 
conditions specified by the Associate Administrator or his/her designee.
    (ii) The motor vehicle must be operated on the same tires that were 
installed on it when the inspection specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section occurred.
    (iii) The motor vehicle must be operated on a highway having a 
posted speed limit of more than 56.3 kph (35 mph).
    (iv) The sound level measurement must be made while the motor 
vehicle is operating at the posted speed limit.

[57 FR 40956, Sept. 8, 1992, as amended at 60 FR 38743, July 28, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 350.5  Policy.

    The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) policy is to encourage 
each State to enforce uniform motor carrier safety and hazardous 
materials regulations for both interstate and intrastate motor carriers 
and drivers. The requirements for compliance with safety standards in 
one State should be compatible with the requirements in another State. A 
coordinated program of inspection and enforcement activities is needed 
to avoid duplication of effort, to promote compliance with uniform 
safety requirements by all types of motor carriers, and to provide a 
basis for sanctioning carriers for poor safety performance.


<R05>
Sec. 350.7  Objective.

    The objective of the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) 
is to reduce the number and severity of accidents and hazardous 
materials incidents involving commercial motor vehicles by substantially 
increasing the level and effectiveness of enforcement activity and the 
likelihood that safety defects, driver deficiencies and unsafe carrier 
practices will be detected and corrected.


<R05>
Sec. 350.9  Conditions for basic grant approval.

    (a) The State shall agree to adopt, and to assume responsibility for 
enforcing the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR) (49 CFR 
parts 390 through 399, except as may be determined by the Administrator 
to be inapplicable to a State enforcement program) including highway 
related portions of the Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations (FHMR) 
(49 CFR parts 107, 171-173, 177, 178 and 180), or compatible State 
rules, regulations, standards, and orders applicable to motor carrier 
safety, including highway transportation of hazardous materials.
    (b) The State shall submit a State Enforcement Plan (SEP) for the 
conduct of an effective safety program. Such plan, upon acceptance by 
the FHWA, will serve as the basis for monitoring and evaluating 
performance of the State under the grant, and will be resubmitted, with 
revisions as necessary, in applications for reapproval in following 
years.
    (c) The SEP shall designate the lead State agency responsible for 
administering the plan for the State.
    (d) The agencies named to perform functions under the plan shall 
have the legal authority, resources, and qualified personnel necessary 
to enforce the FMCSR and FHMR or compatible State rules at the time the 
State implements the approved SEP.
    (e) The State shall allocate adequate funds for the administration 
of the SEP and the enforcement of the FMCSR and FHMR or compatible State 
rules.
    (f) State laws shall provide for right of entry and inspection 
adequate to carry out the SEP and provide that the State will grant 
maximum reciprocity for inspections conducted pursuant to the North 
American Uniform Driver/Vehicle Inspection standard, through the use of 
a nationally accepted system allowing ready identification of previously 
inspected commercial motor vehicles.
    (g) The State shall certify that it will maintain its aggregate 
expenditure of funds by the State and political subdivisions thereof, 
exclusive of Federal funds, for commercial motor vehicle safety programs 
and related programs eligible for funding under this part, as required 
by Sec. 350.17 of this part.
    (h) The State shall agree to prepare and submit all reports required 
in connection with the SEP or other conditions of the grant to the FHWA 
upon request.
    (i) The lead State agency shall agree to adopt such uniform 
reporting requirements and use such uniform forms to record work 
activities performed under the SEP as may be established and required by 
the FHWA.
    (j) The State shall require registrants of commercial motor vehicles 
to declare, at the time of registration, knowledge of the FMCSR and FHMR 
or compatible State rules, as applicable.
    (k) The statutory authority of the State to regulate motor carriers 
shall extend to private motor carriers of

[[Page 519]]

property as well as for-hire motor carriers.
    (l) The State shall ensure that commercial motor vehicle size and 
weight enforcement, drug interdiction, and traffic enforcement 
activities funded under this program will not diminish the effectiveness 
of other commercial motor vehicle safety enforcement programs.
    (m) The State shall take appropriate steps to ensure that fines 
imposed and collected by the State for violations will be reasonable and 
appropriate and, to the maximum extent practicable, will seek to 
implement into law and practice the recommended fine schedule published 
by the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance.
    (n) The State will participate in the SAFETYNET no later than 
January 1, 1994.
    (o) The State will undertake efforts to emphasize and improve 
enforcement of State and local traffic laws as they pertain to 
commercial motor vehicle safety.
    (p) The State will ensure comprehensive enforcement and reinspection 
of vehicles and drivers placed out of service to verify compliance with 
lawful orders and the correction of all violations cited on roadside 
inspection reports.


<R05>
Sec. 350.11  Adopting and enforcing compatible laws and regulations.

    (a) No funds shall be awarded under this part to States that do not 
adopt and enforce laws and regulations that are compatible with the 
FMCSR (except as may be determined by the Administrator to be 
inapplicable) and the FHMR, unless otherwise provided in the Tolerance 
Guidelines (appendix C to this part).
    (b) The State shall conduct an annual review of all its laws and 
regulations pertaining to commercial motor vehicle safety to determine 
their compatibility with the FMCSR and FHMR. The review shall be carried 
out in accordance with part 355 of this subchapter. To support a State's 
contention of compatibility, the State may submit opinions from the 
State's Attorney General or other chief legal officer with respect to 
the effect and enforceability of State laws, rules, regulations, 
standards, or orders in relation to the FMCSR and FHMR.
    (c) State laws and regulations pertaining to commercial motor 
vehicle safety in interstate commerce are also subject to preemption 
under the provisions of Sec. 355.25 of this chapter.
    (d) State laws and regulations that are not identical to the FMCSR 
or FHMR will be deemed compatible for purposes of this part only if they 
are within the variances permitted under the tolerance guidelines in 
appendix C of this part.
    (e) No State shall implement any changes to a State law or 
regulation which makes that or any other law or regulation incompatible 
under this section.
    (f) As soon as practical after the effective date of any amendment 
to the FMCSR or FHMR, but no longer than three years, the applicable 
State law or regulation must be adopted or amended in such manner as 
makes it compatible with the amended Federal provision.
    (g) Any State may apply for a variance related to State laws, 
regulations or enforcement practices pertaining to commercial motor 
vehicle safety in intrastate commerce, which shall be granted if the 
State can satisfactorily demonstrate that the State law, regulation or 
enforcement practice achieves substantially the same purpose as the 
similar Federal rule, does not apply to interstate commerce, and has no 
adverse impact on safety.
    (h) Upon a determination by the FHWA, on its own initiative or after 
determination initiated at the request of any person, including a State, 
that a State has failed to comply with the requirements of this part, or 
that a State law, regulation or enforcement practice pertaining to 
commercial motor vehicle safety in either interstate or intrastate 
commerce is incompatible with the FMCSR or HMTR, a proceeding under 
Sec. 350.27 for withdrawal of approval of a State plan may be initiated. 
This proceeding shall be in addition to or in conjunction with any 
action initiated under Sec. 355.25 of this chapter.
    (i) Any decision regarding the compatibility of a State law or 
regulation

[[Page 520]]

with the FHMR that requires an interpretation will be referred to the 
Research and Special Programs Administration for such interpretation 
before proceeding under Sec. 350.27.

[57 FR 40956, Sept. 8, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 5264, Feb. 3, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 350.13  State Enforcement Plan (SEP) for a basic grant.

    (a) As a condition of the basic grant the State shall submit its 
proposed SEP or update thereof to the FHWA division office.
    (b) The SEP shall:
    (1) Provide an assessment of the commercial motor carrier and 
highway hazardous materials safety problems within the State;
    (2) Identify State penalty structures applicable to enforcement 
activities covered in the SEP, evaluate their reasonableness and 
appropriateness, and indicate the steps being taken to approximate the 
published Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) fine schedule, if 
necessary.
    (3) Demonstrate that the State has authority to regulate and to 
enforce its regulations with respect to private carriers of property as 
well as for-hire motor carriers; and
    (4) Describe in detail the objectives sought to be achieved, the 
resources to be employed, the work items to be performed, the unit costs 
where feasible and the methods to be used to measure effectiveness. 
Specifically, the SEP shall:
    (i) Identify other agencies participating in the plan and describe 
the roles of each;
    (ii) Identify the number and category of personnel employed and the 
specialized training provided;
    (iii) Include roadside inspection activity at such times and 
locations as will assure comprehensive enforcement;
    (iv) Describe the proposed reinspection activities that would ensure 
motor carriers had made timely corrections of the out-of-service defects 
and other safety violations cited on the roadside inspection reports and 
that out-of-service drivers came into compliance with the regulations. 
These reinspection activities shall include covert operations to 
determine the extent of compliance with the State's out-of-service 
orders. State enforcement activities to remedy out-of-service violations 
shall depend on the extent of the verification problem and may include, 
but are not limited to: on-site reinspection activities; covert 
surveillance activities; safety and compliance review programs; and 
other State proposed activities approved by the FHWA; and
    (v) Describe the tracking system to be used by the State to ensure 
that the motor carrier has certified to the correction of the safety 
violations and returned the inspection report to the issuing agency.
    (5) Be coordinated with the State highway safety plan under 23 
U.S.C. 402.
    (6) Describe the methods the State will use to promote:
    (i) Removing impaired drivers from the highways through enforcement 
of regulations on the use of alcohol and controlled substances and by 
ensuring ready roadside access to alcohol detection and measuring 
equipment;
    (ii) Appropriate training to its personnel on the recognition of 
drivers impaired by alcohol or controlled substances;
    (iii) Enforcement of requirements relating to the licensing of 
commercial motor vehicle drivers, including checking the status of 
commercial driver's licenses;
    (iv) Improved enforcement of hazardous materials transportation 
regulation by encouraging more inspections of shipper facilities and 
comprehensive inspections of hazardous materials loads;
    (v) Effective controlled substance interdiction activities and 
training on strategies for carrying out such activities; and
    (vi) Effective use of trained and qualified officers and employees 
of political subdivisions and local governments, under the direction and 
supervision of the lead agency, in enforcement of commercial motor 
vehicle safety and hazardous materials transportation safety.
    (7) Document, if funds are used for vehicle size and weight, 
alcohol/controlled substance checks, drug interdiction and/or traffic 
law enforcement, that such activities are carried out in

[[Page 521]]

conjunction with an appropriate type of vehicle or driver inspection.
    (c) Guidelines for the preparation of the SEP are provided in 
appendix A to this part.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
2125-0536)


<R05>
Sec. 350.15  Certification of compliance by State.

    The FHWA will accept a certification, executed by the Governor, the 
State's Attorney General or other State official specifically designated 
by the Governor, in the form provided in appendix B to this part, that 
the State is in compliance with the conditions of Sec. 350.9 of this 
part. The certification shall accompany the SEP and be made part 
thereof. The certification shall be supplemented by a copy of any State 
law, regulation or forms pertaining to commercial motor carrier safety 
adopted since the State's last certification, if any, which bear on the 
items listed in the certification. The certificate should acknowledge 
that activities described in Sec. 350.9 will be performed.


<R05>
Sec. 350.17  Maintenance of effort.

    (a) No SEP shall be approved or grant awarded in the absence of a 
commitment by the State to maintain the aggregate expenditure of funds 
by the State for commercial motor vehicle and highway hazardous 
materials safety programs as provided in this section.
    (b) The State shall certify each year that the level of State 
funding for the 12-month period covered in the SEP for motor carrier and 
highway hazardous materials safety, size and weight, traffic safety and 
drug interdiction enforcement purposes shall not fall below the average 
aggregate expenditure of funds, exclusive of Federal funds and any State 
matching funds used to receive Federal funding, for those purposes in 
the base period of three full fiscal years prior to December 18, 1991. 
The State may elect to use either Federal fiscal years or State fiscal 
years at its option.
    (c) In determining whether a State has complied with this 
maintenance of effort commitment, expenditures of State funds for 
federally sponsored demonstration or pilot programs need not be included 
in aggregating expenditures in the base period.
    (d) For the purpose of determining the State's expenditures in the 
base period, only costs associated with activities performed by State or 
local agencies currently receiving or projected to receive funds under 
this part must be counted, and only those activities which meet the most 
current requirements for funding eligibility under the grant program 
must be included.
    (e) If it is determined that a State has not maintained its level of 
expenditures as certified, the State shall be notified of the 
deficiency. Upon receipt of such notification, the State shall have the 
opportunity to submit information to substantiate the certification.
    (f) If, after consideration of all information, it is finally 
determined that a State has failed to meet its maintenance of effort 
requirement, an amount equal to the deficiency shall be deducted from 
the State's current allocation. That amount will then be available for 
reallocation under Sec. 350.21 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 350.19  Grant application submission.

    A State shall submit its application to the FHWA division office on 
or before August 1 of each year. The time for submitting a plan may be 
extended for a period not to exceed 30 calendar days for good cause 
shown. Grants are approved for the fiscal year for which application is 
made. Failure of a State to submit a plan for any given fiscal year will 
preclude consideration of grant approval for that State for that year.


<R05>
Sec. 350.21  Distribution of funds.

    (a) The Federal share payable to reimburse States for eligible costs 
incurred in the administration of a commercial motor carrier safety 
program shall not exceed 80 percent.
    (b) The FHWA will, upon request, waive the requirement for matching 
funds to be provided by the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, or the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas.
    (c) The funds available to any State for a basic grant in any one 
year shall

[[Page 522]]

be distributed according to an allocation formula based on the most 
recent reliable data concerning the following factors in equal 
proportion:
    (1) Road mileage (all highways);
    (2) Vehicle miles travelled (all vehicles);
    (3) Number of commercial vehicles over 10,000 pounds (gross vehicle 
weight rating);
    (4) Population (most current census); and
    (5) Special fuel consumption (net after reciprocity adjustment).
    (d) Subject to the availability of funds, the individual allocations 
shall be adjusted so that no State qualifying for an award shall be 
allocated more than a ceiling amount, which shall be no less than the 
ceiling amount used in the previous year's distribution process. The 
ceiling shall be increased each fiscal year in proportion to the amount 
of increase in the funds available for distribution in that fiscal year. 
The allocation formula shall also be adjusted so that no State 
qualifying for an award shall be allocated:
    (1) Less than the basic allocation of funds received in the 1991 
fiscal year, provided the SEP continues to support that level of 
funding; or
    (2) Less than 0.5 percent of the total amount allocated to all 
States (or $250,000, whichever is greater).
    (3) Beginning on October 1, 1994, and each October 1 thereafter, 
more than 50 percent of the basic formula allocation provided for in 
this section if any such State has adopted and is enforcing compatible 
regulations applicable to interstate transportation, but has not adopted 
or is not enforcing compatible regulations applicable to intrastate 
transportation.
    (e) Funds will be allocated to States in recognition of innovative, 
successful, cost efficient or cost effective programs to promote 
commercial motor vehicle safety and hazardous materials transportation 
safety and provide incentives to States that conduct traffic safety 
enforcement activities done in conjunction with motor carrier safety 
inspections. The allocations will be done in three separate grants:
    (1) Basic grants--funds used to perform commercial vehicle safety 
activities such as driver/vehicle inspections, safety reviews and 
compliance reviews. Allocation for basic grants will be made pursuant to 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Unused basic allocations will be 
periodically redistributed. Any eligible MCSAP activity can be included 
under the State's basic grant activities.
    (2) Supplemental grants--funds used to conduct additional activities 
or innovative programs demonstrated to be effective and cost-efficient, 
and may include emphasis areas established by policy in consultation 
with the States. To be eligible for a supplemental grant, a State must 
qualify for a basic grant. Unused supplemental grant funds will be 
periodically redistributed among those States that are able to 
demonstrate innovative, cost-effective purposes consistent with the 
objectives of this part.
    (3) Special grants--funds used by States to meet the conditions in 
Sec. 350.9 regarding eligibility requirements for basic grants; or for 
States already participating in the basic program, to develop the 
prerequisites for expanded activities not presently part of their basic 
programs. Special grants are also available for research or data 
collection activities, or for projects specifically identified by 
statute, as, for example, commercial driver's license enforcement. To be 
eligible for a special grant, a State need not qualify for a basic 
grant.
    (f) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, funds 
which have not been awarded to States under application of the 
allocation formula and the provisions for additional allocations 
contained in this section may be redistributed at the discretion of the 
Administrator. Subject to the availability of funds, the primary purpose 
of any such redistribution is to prevent a decrease in the amount of 
Federal funds used by particular States in previous years to support 
effective and innovative programs. Preference will be given to those 
States which have maintained effective federally assisted programs at 
levels beyond that possible if limited to formula allocations.
    (g) The funds obligated by a State will remain available to the 
State for a period of the fiscal year in which obligated and the next 
full fiscal year. Any

[[Page 523]]

unexpended obligations which are to be carried over to the next fiscal 
year must be accounted for in the new SEP for that fiscal year. Funds 
must be expended in the order in which they are obligated.

[57 FR 40956, Sept. 8, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 5264, Feb. 3, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 350.23  Acceptance of State plan.

    (a) Each plan will be reviewed for content, after which the State 
will be notified of its acceptance or rejection.
    (b) The time for submitting a plan may be extended for a period not 
to exceed 30 calendar days for good cause shown.
    (c) Each State plan shall include an analysis of the effectiveness 
of its prior year's plan in reaching the stated objectives. The State 
will be advised whether any changes are needed in the plan or in its 
intended objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 350.25  Effect of failure to submit a satisfactory State plan.

    (a) A State will be notified in writing that approval of the plan is 
being withheld along with the reasons for such action, if:
    (1) It is determined that a plan does not meet the requirements 
described in Secs. 350.9 and 350.13; or
    (2) It is determined that an SEP is not adequate to ensure effective 
enforcement of the FMCSR and FHMR; or compatible State rules.
    (b) The State shall have 30 calendar days from the date of the 
notice to modify the plan and resubmit it for approval.


<R05>
Sec. 350.27  Procedure for withdrawal of approval.

    (a) If a State is not performing according to an approved plan or a 
State is not adequately enforcing the FMCSR and FHMR, or compatible 
State rules, the Administrator shall issue a written notice of proposed 
determination of nonconformity to the Governor of the State or the 
official designated in the plan. The notice shall state the reasons for 
the proposed determination and inform the State that it may reply in 
writing within 30 calendar days from the date of the notice. The reply 
should address the deficiencies cited in the notice and provide 
documentation as necessary.
    (b) The Administrator's decision, after notice and opportunity for 
comment, will constitute the final decision of the FHWA. An adverse 
decision will result in immediate cessation of Federal participation in 
the plan.
    (c) If the State does not respond to a notice of proposed 
determination of nonconformity as provided in paragraph (a) of this 
section, the proposed determination shall become the Administrator's 
final decision with the same effect as paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Any State aggrieved by an adverse decision issued under this 
part may seek judicial review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. ch. 7.


<R05>
Sec. 350.29  Eligible costs.

    (a) Work must be performed pursuant to an acceptable State plan in 
order for the cost of that work to be eligible for reimbursement. The 
eligible costs under the grant program are comprised of the allowable 
direct costs incident to the State's performance and its allocable 
portion of allowable indirect costs, less applicable credits.
    (b) The primary functions to be performed under a basic grant are 
uniform roadside inspections and safety and compliance reviews with 
follow-up enforcement actions or compliance measures. Consequently, the 
major cost will be compensation and expenses of the personnel required 
to perform these functions.
    (c) Subject to paragraph (c)(5) of this section, funds may also be 
used for:
    (1) Enforcement of size and weight limitations;
    (2) Detecting the unlawful presence of controlled substances in a 
commercial motor vehicle or on the person of any occupant (including the 
operator) of such a vehicle;
    (3) Enforcement of State traffic laws and regulations designed to 
promote safe operation of commercial motor vehicles; and
    (4) Sanitary food transportation inspections pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 
2808.
    (5) Provided: these activities are carried out in conjunction with 
an appropriate type of inspection for enforcement of safety regulations. 
Size and

[[Page 524]]

weight enforcement must be conducted at locations other than fixed 
weight facilities, at specific geographical locations where the weight 
of the vehicle can significantly affect the safe operation of the 
vehicle, or at seaports where intermodal shipping containers enter and 
exit the United States.
    (d) Eligible personnel costs include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Recruitment and screening;
    (2) Training;
    (3) Salaries and fringe benefits; and
    (4) Supervision.
    (e) Equipment and travel costs directly related to the primary 
functions are also eligible for proportionate reimbursement. These costs 
include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Vehicles;
    (2) Uniforms;
    (3) Communications equipment;
    (4) Special inspection equipment;
    (5) Vehicle maintenance;
    (6) Motor fuel and oil; and
    (7) Travel and per diem expenses.
    (f) Indirect expenses related to facilities used to conduct 
inspections or to house enforcement personnel, support staff, and 
equipment, except those related to fixed weighing facilities, may also 
be eligible to the extent they are measurable and recurring, such as 
rent and overhead.
    (g) A secondary function of the MCSAP is to develop a data base on 
which to coordinate resources and improve efficiency. Therefore, costs 
related to data acquisition, storage, and analysis that are specifically 
identifiable as program expenses may be eligible for reimbursement.
    (h) Clerical and administrative expenses, to the extent they are 
necessary and directly attributable to the MCSAP, are eligible for 
reimbursement.
    (i) The cost of acquisition of real property, land and buildings, is 
not eligible as a participating cost in the MCSAP. Expenditures related 
to the improvement of real property, for example, the installation of 
lights for the inspection of vehicles at night or minor modifications to 
existing structures, are not considered acquisition costs.
    (j) The eligibility of specific costs is subject to review, and such 
costs must be necessary, reasonable, allocable to the approved SEP, and 
allowable under this part and 49 CFR part 18, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local 
Governments.
    (k) In-kind contributions are acceptable if they represent eligible 
costs as established by 49 CFR part 18, OMB Circulars, agency rule or 
policy.

    Appendix A to Part 350--Guidelines To Be Used in Preparing State 
                            Enforcement Plan

    1. Designate the lead State agency: The plan should indicate the 
agency responsible for administering the plan.
    2. Program Summary: This section includes objectives, activities, 
resources, costs and an analysis of the effectiveness of the program.
    (a) Define the problem: In assessing the level of commitment to be 
made to the enforcement of commercial motor carrier and highway 
hazardous materials safety regulations, the following factors should be 
considered:
    (1) Volume of commercial motor vehicle traffic;
    (2) Type of commercial motor vehicle traffic;
    (3) Volume of commercial motor vehicle traffic transporting 
hazardous materials;
    (4) Number and frequency (rate) of commercial motor carrier 
accidents;
    (5) Severity of accidents involving commercial motor carriers:
    (i) Fatalities;
    (ii) Injuries; and
    (iii) Property damage.
    (6) Seasonal commercial motor carrier operational patterns within 
the State;
    (7) Type and frequency of violations of traffic safety laws and 
regulations pertaining to commercial motor vehicles and accidents;
    (8) Use of alcohol and controlled substances by commercial motor 
vehicle drivers; and
    (9) Problems related to overweight vehicles and safety. (The 
information in paragraphs 2(a) (6), (7), (8), and (9) of this appendix 
may or may not be available to the States at present. To be able to 
measure program effectiveness, however, States will need to compile this 
type of data.)
    (b) Determine current enforcement efforts: The plan should identify 
the activities currently engaged in by the State to address the 
commercial motor carrier and hazardous materials safety problems. This 
should include a description of existing laws, regulations and 
compliance activities, as well as the agencies within the State with 
enforcement responsibilities.

[[Page 525]]

    (c) Establish the objectives: A key element in each plan is the 
establishment of the objectives sought to be achieved through the use of 
Federal funds. The objectives should be stated in terms of quantifiable 
measurements of results, where possible, or at least of effort. Ideally, 
the objectives should include a measurable reduction in highway 
accidents or hazardous materials incidents involving commercial motor 
vehicles, but may also refer to quantifiable improvements in legislative 
or regulatory authorities, problem identification, enforcement 
strategies and resource allocations.
    (1) Goals should be identified as:
    (i) Short term--the year beginning October 1 following submission of 
a MCSAP enforcement plan.
    (ii) Medium term--two to four years after submission of the 
enforcement plan.
    (iii) Long term--five years beyond the submission of the enforcement 
plan.
    (2) Describe the practices: The plan should describe how the 
resources are to be employed to achieve the objectives included under 
350.13 and should discuss:
    (i) Schedules of operation of inspection sites and units;
    (ii) Tactics for placing vehicles out of service and verifying 
compliance;
    (iii) Projected number of annual:
    (A) Roadside vehicle inspections including Commercial Driver's 
Licenses checks; and
    (B) Safety and Compliance Reviews;
    (iv) Methods to inspect all types of carriage;
    (v) Strategy for preventing circumvention or avoidance of 
inspections;
    (vi) Procedures for handling hazardous materials carriers and 
passenger carriers;
    (vii) Supervision and recordkeeping; and
    (viii) Methods used to coordinate activities with the State highway 
safety plan under 23 U.S.C. 402, including providing information to the 
appropriate State agency, describing the information provided, and 
discussing the comments that were received.
    (3) Identify the resources: The plan should detail the resources to 
be used in accomplishing the objectives, and should include:
    (i) State agencies involved:
    (A) Lead agency; and
    (B) Local and other cooperating political subdivisions.
    (ii) Personnel (from each agency involved):
    (A) Line functions;
    (B) Staff and supervision; and
    (C) Administrative, technical and clerical.
    (iii) Facilities:
    (A) Inspection sites regularly maintained; and
    (B) Building space required.
    (iv) Equipment:
    (A) Vehicles;
    (B) Communication and ADP; and
    (C) Other specialized tools.
    (v) Itemization of Costs:
    (A) Personnel (salaries, benefits, etc.);
    (B) Equipment (purchase, rental, fuel, maintenance, depreciation, 
salvage, etc.); and
    (C) Facilities (rent and overhead).
    (d) Program evaluation: Each plan should include a provision for 
program evaluation of the effectiveness of previous activities. This 
should include the economic and operational impact of increased 
enforcement and provisions for review and update of the plan. It is not 
practicable to establish objective minimums, as each State has unique 
characteristics and varying levels of existing enforcement activity. The 
FHWA will cooperate with State regulatory and enforcement agencies by 
gathering useful information and experience on elements of enforcement 
practices that produce positive results.
    The bottom line objective in any safety program is a decrease in the 
number and severity of accidents. Motor carrier safety regulations 
should be designed to prescribe methods to eliminate the risks of 
accidents. Compliance with such regulations should, therefore, reduce 
accidents. The States are encouraged to design their programs to link 
their enforcement efforts to causes of accidents, whenever possible, and 
to develop the data necessary to demonstrate the results. The States are 
encouraged to use the safety and program performance data collected over 
several years to show trends and effects of program activities. In 
assessing State Enforcement Plans, the FHWA will be particularly 
attentive to the methods by which effectiveness is to be evaluated, and 
will provide whatever assistance is feasible in developing measurement 
factors.

  Appendix C to Part 350--Tolerance Guidelines for Adopting Compatible 
                       State Rules and Regulations

           1. Introduction, Purpose and Rules of Construction

    The goal of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is to 
encourage all States to ultimately adopt motor carrier safety and 
hazardous materials transportation rules and regulations identical in 
all respects to those requirements set forth in Federal laws and 
regulations, applicable to both interstate and intrastate commerce. 
Recognizing that there are circumstances unique to each State which may 
require special attention in that particular State, FHWA has concluded 
that certain circumstances may warrant limited deviations from the 
Federal standards where the Federal regulations do not apply.
    The purpose of this appendix is to set forth the limits within which 
a State's deviations to variances in adopting motor carrier safety and 
hazardous materials rules may extend and still be considered compatible 
for funding purposes under 49 CFR 350. These limits or tolerances are 
applicable for this purpose to those State rules and regulations 
applicable where the U.S. Department of Transportation does not have 
jurisdiction.

 2. Tolerance Guidelines for State Rules and Regulations Where the U.S. 
          Department of Transportation Also Holds Jurisdiction

    (a) States shall not be required to adopt 49 CFR parts 398, 399, 
107, 171.15, 171.16 and 177.807 as applicable to either interstate or 
intrastate commerce. A State is not required to adopt 49 CFR part 178 
only if the State can still enforce the standards contained therein.
    (b) State rules must be applicable to the same extent as the Federal 
Motor Carrier Safety and Hazardous Materials Regulations

[[Page 527]]

except where deviation may be allowed by part 355 of this subchapter and 
this appendix.

 3. Tolerance Guidelines for State Rules and Regulations Where the U.S. 
          Department of Transportation Regulations Do Not Apply

    (a) State rules must be applicable to the same extent as the Federal 
Motor Carrier Safety and Hazardous Materials Regulations except where 
deviation may be allowed by parts 350 and 355 of this subchapter and 
this appendix.
    (b) States may exempt from all or part of their regulations 
commercial motor vehicles with a GVWR of 26,000 pounds or less. However, 
vehicles with a GVWR of 26,000 pounds or less may not be exempted from 
either the motor carrier safety regulations or hazardous materials 
regulations if the vehicle is used to transport hazardous materials 
requiring a placard or if the vehicle is designed to transport more than 
15 passengers, including the driver.
    (c) States may not exempt from regulation motor carriers based on 
the type of carriage being performed (i.e., for-hire, private, etc.).
    (d) Exemptions granted to certain industries by a State prior to 
April 1988 and accepted by FHWA may remain valid. Although industry 
exemptions are strongly discouraged, a State may request and FHWA may 
approve such an exemption after the State has submitted to the FHWA 
documentation which will allow evaluation of the following or similar 
information:
    (1) Type and scope of the industry exemption requested;
    (2) Type and scope of regulatory exemption requested;
    (3) Accident information related to that specific industry--ratio, 
frequency, comparative figures, etc.;
    (4) Percentage of industry affected--number of vehicles, mileage 
traveled, number of companies involved, etc.;
    (5) Inspection information--number of violations per inspection, 
out-of-service information, etc.;
    (6) Other regulations enforced by other State agencies not 
participating in the MCSAP;
    (7) Commodity transported--i.e., hazardous materials, livestock, 
grain, etc.;
    (8) Similar exemptions granted;
    (9) Reason exemption is needed;
    (10) Projected effect on safety;
    (11) The State's economic environment and its ability to compete in 
foreign and domestic markets.
    (e) Regulatory exemptions based on the distance a motor carrier or 
driver operates from their home terminal are not deemed to be 
compatible. This prohibition does not apply to those exemptions already 
contained in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations nor to the 
extension of the mileage radius exemption contained in 49 CFR 395.1(e) 
from 100 to 150 miles.
    (f) States are strongly encouraged to apply the identical regulatory 
and enforcement schemes to both interstate and intrastate carriers as 
set forth in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations when 
regulating drivers' hours of service. However, certain limited 
tolerances where the U.S. Department of Transportation's hours of 
service regulations do not apply are allowed. Specifically, an expansion 
of the 10-hour driving rule to a 12-hour driving limit, provided that 
the total period of time spent driving and on duty not driving is not 
extended to more than 16 hours and an increase in the 70 hour rule to 70 
hours in 7 consecutive days or 80 hours in 8 consecutive days will be 
considered compatible.
    (g) Drivers operating not subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. 
Department of Transportation may drive if they are at least 18 years 
old.
    (h) States may provide grandfather clauses in their rules and 
regulations if such exemptions are uniform or in substantial harmony 
with the Federal standards and provide an orderly transition to full 
regulatory adoption at a later date.
    (i) The States may qualify any driver engaged wholly in intrastate 
commerce who is adversely affected by current State medical standards, 
upgraded to be consistent with part 391, even if the States adopted 
those medical standards in the past. Drivers identified through July 29, 
1996, as not meeting the upgraded State standards may also be qualified. 
Such a driver may remain qualified after July 29, 1996, as long as an 
examining physician determines during the biennial medical examination 
that existing medical or physical conditions that would otherwise render 
the driver not qualified under Federal standards have not significantly 
worsened or another non-qualifying medical or physical condition has not 
developed.
    (j) States whose rules and regulations do not meet these guidelines 
may still be considered qualified for participation under Sec. 350.21. 
However, their formula allocations for basic grant funds will be subject 
to the limitations of Sec. 350.21 (d).
    It should be noted that the FHWA still considers the physical 
qualification requirements in part 391 to be the minimum requirements 
that contribute significantly to commercial motor vehicle operational 
safety. The FHWA continues to encourage States to adopt these minimum 
standards as their own and to use this grandfathering option judiciously 
to respond to legitimate hardships. This policy should in no way be 
interpreted as discrediting the medical standards adopted in part 391.
    This guideline will not preclude a State's adoption of or 
continuation of a waiver program which can be demonstrated to be based

[[Page 528]]

on sound medical judgment combined with appropriate performance 
standards causing no adverse affect on safety.

                         Subpart B--Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 355.21  Regulatory review.

    (a) General. Each State shall annually analyze its laws and 
regulations, including those of its political subdivisions, which 
pertain to commercial motor vehicle safety to determine whether its laws 
and regulations are compatible with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Regulations. Guidelines for the regulatory review are provided in the 
appendix to this part.
    (b) Responsibility. The State agency designated as lead agency for 
the administration of grants made pursuant to part 350 of this 
subchapter is responsible for reviewing and analyzing State laws and 
regulations for compliance with this part. In the absence of an 
officially designated Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) 
lead agency or in its discretion, the State shall designate another 
agency responsible to review and determine compliance with these 
regulations.
    (c) State review. (1) The State shall determine which of its laws 
and regulations pretaining to commercial motor vehicle safety are the 
same as the Federal Motor Carrier Safety or Federal Hazadous Materials 
Regulations. With respect to any State law or regulation which is not 
the same, the State shall identify such law or regulation and determine 
whether:

[[Page 529]]

    (i) It has the same effect as a corresponding section of the Federal 
Motor Carrier Safety or Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations;
    (ii) It applies to interstate commerce;
    (iii) It is more stringent than the FMCSR or FHMR in that it is more 
restrictive or places a greater burden on any entity subject to its 
provisions;
    (2) If the inconsistent State law or regulation applies to 
interstate commerce and is more stringent than the FMCSR or FHMR, the 
State shall determine:
    (i) The safety benefits associated with such State law or 
regulation; and
    (ii) The effect of the enforcement of such State law or regulation 
on interstate commerce.
    (3) If the inconsistent State law or regulation does not apply to 
interstate commerce or is less stringent than the FMCSR or FHMR, the 
tolerance guidelines for participation in the Motor Carrier Safety 
Assistance Program in part 350 of this subchapter shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 355.23  Submission of results.

    Each State shall submit the results of its regulatory review 
annually with its certification of compliance under 49 CFR 350.15. It 
shall submit the results of the regulatory review with the certification 
no later than August 1 of each year with the SEP. The State shall 
include copies of pertinent laws and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 355.25  Adopting and enforcing compatible laws and regulations.

    (a) General. No State shall have in effect or enforce any State law 
or regulation pertaining to commercial motor vehicle safety in 
interstate commerce which the Administrator finds to be incompatible 
with the provisions of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations.
    (b) New state requirements. No State shall implement any changes to 
a law or regulation which makes that or any other law or regulation 
incompatible with a provision of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Regulations.
    (c) Enforcement. To enforce compliance with this section, the 
Administrator will initiate a rulemaking proceeding under part 389 of 
this subchapter to declare the incompatible State law or regulation 
pertaining to commercial motor vehicle safety unenforceable in 
interstate commerce.
    (d) Waiver of determination. Any person (including any State) may 
petition for a waiver of a determination made under paragraph (c) of 
this section. Such petition will also be considered in a rulemaking 
proceeding under part 389. Waivers shall be granted only upon a 
satisfactory showing that continued enforcement of the incompatible 
State law or regulation is not contrary to the public interest and is 
consistent with the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles.
    (e) Consolidation of proceedings. The Administrator may consolidate 
any action to enforce this section with other proceedings required under 
this section if the Administrator determines that such consolidation 
will not adversely affect any party to any such proceeding.

      Appendix A to Part 355--Guidelines for the Regulatory Review

    Each State shall review its laws and regulations to achieve 
compatibility with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations 
(FMCSRs). Each State shall consider all related requirements on 
enforcement of the State's motor carrier safety regulations. The 
documentation shall be simple and brief.

                                  Scope

    The State review required by Sec. 355.21 may be limited to those 
laws and regulations previously determined to be incompatible in the 
report of the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Regulatory Review Panel 
issued in August 1990, or by subsequent determination by the 
Administrator under this part, and any State laws or regulations enacted 
or issued after August 1990.

                              Applicability

    The requirements must apply to all segments of the motor carrier 
industry common, contract, and private carriers of property and for-hire 
carriers of passengers.

                               Definitions

    Definitions of terms must be consistent with those in the FMCSR. For 
example, a commercial motor vehicle is a vehicle operating in interstate 
commerce on a public highway, that (1) has a gross vehicle weight rating 
(GVWR) of 10,001 pounds or more, (2) is designed to transport more that 
15 passengers (including the driver), or (3) is used

[[Page 530]]

to transport hazardous materials in a quantity requiring placarding 
under regulations issued by the Secretary under the Hazardous Materials 
Transportation Act, as amended (49 U.S.C. app. 1801 et seq).

                          Driver Qualifications

    Require a driver to be properly licensed to drive a motor vehicle; 
require a driver to be in good physical health, at least 21 years of 
age, able to operate a vehicle safely, and maintain a good driving 
record; prohibit drug and alcohol abuse; require a motor carrier to 
maintain a driver qualification file for each driver; require a motor 
carrier to ensure that a driver is medically qualified; and require a 
motor carrier to establish an anti-drug program with testing of drivers 
prior to employment, periodically, based on reasonable cause, after 
accidents, and by random selection.

    Note: The requirements for testing apply only to drivers of 
commercial motor vehicles as defined in 49 CFR part 383.

                        Driving of Motor Vehicles

    Prohibit possession, use, or driving under the influence of alcohol 
or other controlled substances (while on duty); and establish 0.04 
percent as the level of alcohol in the blood at which a driver is 
considered under the influence of alcohol.

           Parts and Accessories Necessary for Safe Operation

    Require operational lights and reflectors; require systematically 
arranged and installed wiring; and require brakes working at the 
required performance level, and other key components included in 49 CFR 
part 393.

                            Hours of Service

    Prohibit a motor carrier from allowing or requiring any driver to 
drive: More than 10 hours following 8 consecutive hours off duty; after 
being on duty 15 hours, after being on duty more than 60 hours in any 7 
consecutive days; or after being on duty more than 70 hours in any 8 
consecutive days.
    Require a driver to prepare a record-of-duty status for each 24-hour 
period. The driver and motor carrier must retain the records.

                       Inspection and Maintenance

    Prohibit a commercial motor vehicle from being operated when it is 
likely to cause an accident or a breakdown; require the driver to 
conduct a walk-around inspection of the vehicle before driving it to 
ensure that it can be safely operated; require the driver to prepare a 
driver vehicle inspection report; and require commercial motor vehicles 
to be inspected at least annually.

                           Hazardous Materials

    Require a motor carrier or a person operating a commercial motor 
vehicle transporting hazardous materials to follow the safety and 
hazardous materials requirements.

                          State Determinations

    1. Each State must determine whether its requirements affecting 
interstate motor carriers are ``less stringent'' than the Federal 
requirements. ``Less stringent'' requirements represent either gaps in 
the State requirements in relation to the Federal requirements as 
summarized under item number one in this appendix or State requirements 
which are less restrictive than the Federal requirements.
    a. An example of a gap is when a State does not have the authority 
to regulate the safety of for-hire carriers of passengers or has the 
authority but chooses to exempt the carrier.
    b. An example of a less restrictive State requirement is when a 
State allows a person under 21 years of age to operate a commercial 
motor vehicle in interstate commerce.
    2. Each State must determine whether its requirements affecting 
interstate motor carriers are ``more stringent'' than the Federal 
requirements: ``More stringent'' requirements are more restrictive or 
inclusive in relation to the Federal requirements as summarized under 
item number one in this appendix. For example, a requirement that a 
driver must have 2 days off after working 5 consecutive days. The State 
would demonstrate that its more stringent requirements:
    a. Have a ``safety benefit;'' for example, result in fewer accidents 
or reduce the risk of accidents;
    b. do not create ``an undue burden on interstate commerce,'' e.g., 
do not delay, interfere with, or increase that cost or the 
administrative burden for a motor carrier transporting property or 
passengers in interstate commerce; and
    c. Are otherwise compatible with Federal safety requirements.
    3. A State must adopt and enforce in a consistent manner the 
requirements referenced in the above guidelines in order for the FHWA to 
accept the State's determination that it has compatible safety 
requirements affecting interstate motor carrier operations. Generally, 
the States would have up to 3 years from the effective date of the new 
Federal requirement to adopt and enforce compatible requirements. The 
FHWA would specify the deadline when promulgating future Federal safety 
requirements. The requirements are considered of equal importance.

will not adversely affect the driver's ability to safely operate a 
commercial motor vehicle.
    (b) No employer having actual knowledge that a driver has used a 
controlled substance shall permit the driver to perform or continue to 
perform a safety-sensitive function.
    (c) An employer may require a driver to inform the employer of any 
therapeutic drug use.

                        Subpart C--Tests Required


<R05>
Sec. 382.301  Pre-employment testing.

    (a) Prior to the first time a driver performs safety-sensitive 
functions for an employer, the driver shall undergo testing for alcohol 
and controlled substances as a condition prior to being used, unless the 
employer uses the exception in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. 
No employer shall allow a driver, who the employer intends to hire or 
use, to perform safety-sensitive functions unless the driver has been 
administered an alcohol test with a result indicating an alcohol 
concentration less than 0.04, and has received a controlled substances 
test result from the MRO indicating a verified negative test result. If 
a pre-employment alcohol test result under this section indicates an 
alcohol content of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04, the provision of 
Sec. 382.505 shall apply.
    (b) Exception for pre-employment alcohol testing. An employer is not 
required to administer an alcohol test required by paragraph (a) of this 
section if:
    (1) The driver has undergone an alcohol test required by this 
section or the alcohol misuse rule of another DOT agency under part 40 
of this title within the previous six months, with a result indicating 
an alcohol concentration less than 0.04; and
    (2) The employer ensures that no prior employer of the driver of 
whom the employer has knowledge has records of a violation of this part 
or the alcohol misuse rule of another DOT agency within the previous six 
months.
    (c) Exception for pre-employment controlled substances testing. An 
employer is not required to administer a controlled substances test 
required by paragraph (a) of this section if:
    (1) The driver has participated in a controlled substances testing 
program that meets the requirements of this part within the previous 30 
days; and
    (2) While participating in that program, either
    (i) Was tested for controlled substances within the past 6 months 
(from the date of application with the employer) or
    (ii) Participated in the random controlled substances testing 
program for the previous 12 months (from the date of application with 
the employer); and
    (3) The employer ensures that no prior employer of the driver of 
whom the employer has knowledge has records of a violation of this part 
or the controlled substances use rule of another DOT agency within the 
previous six months.
    (d)(1) An employer who exercises the exception in either paragraph 
(b) or (c) of this section shall contact the alcohol and/or controlled 
substances testing program(s) in which the driver participates or 
participated and shall obtain and retain from the testing program(s) the 
following information:
    (i) Name(s) and address(es) of the program(s).
    (ii) Verification that the driver participates or participated in 
the program(s).
    (iii) Verification that the program(s) conforms to part 40 of this 
title.
    (iv) Verification that the driver is qualified under the rules of 
this part, including that the driver has not refused to be tested for 
controlled substances.
    (v) The date the driver was last tested for alcohol or controlled 
substances.
    (vi) The results of any tests taken within the previous six months 
and any other violations of subpart B of this part.
    (2) An employer who uses, but does not employ, a driver more than 
once a year to operate commercial motor vehicles must obtain the 
information in paragraph (d)(1) of this section at least once every six 
months. The records prepared under this paragraph shall be maintained in 
accordance with Sec. 382.401. If the employer cannot verify that the 
driver is participating in a controlled

[[Page 537]]

substances testing program in accordance with this part and part 40, the 
employer shall conduct a pre-employment alcohol and/or controlled 
substances test.
    (e) Nothwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, all 
provisions and requirements in this section pertaining to pre-employment 
testing for alcohol are vacated as of May 1, 1995.


<R05>
Sec. 382.303  Post-accident testing.

    (a) As soon as practicable following an occurrence involving a 
commercial motor vehicle operating on a public road in commerce, each 
employer shall test for alcohol and controlled substances each surviving 
driver:
    (1) Who was performing safety-sensitive functions with respect to 
the vehicle, if the accident involved the loss of human life; or
    (2) Who receives a citation under State or local law for a moving 
traffic violation arising from the accident, if the accident involved:
    (i) Bodily injury to any person who, as a result of the injury, 
immediately receives medical treatment away from the scene of the 
accident; or
    (ii) One or more motor vehicles incurring disabling damage as a 
result of the accident, requiring the motor vehicle to be transported 
away from the scene by a tow truck or other motor vehicle.

    (b)(1) Alcohol tests. If a test required by this section is not 
administered within two hours following the accident, the employer shall 
prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the test was 
not promptly administered. If a test required by this section is not 
administered within eight hours following the accident, the employer 
shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall prepare and 
maintain the same record. Records shall be submitted to the FHWA upon 
request of the Associate Administrator.
    (2) For the years stated in this paragraph, employers who submit MIS 
reports shall submit to the FHWA each record of a test required by this 
section that is not completed within eight hours. The employer's records 
of tests that are not completed within eight hours shall be submitted to 
the FHWA by March 15, 1996; March 15, 1997, and March 15, 1998, for 
calendar years 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively. Employers shall 
append these records to their MIS submissions. Each record shall include 
the following information:
    (i) Type of test (reasonable suspicion/post-accident);
    (ii) Triggering event (including date, time, and location);
    (iii) Reason(s) test could not be completed within eight hours;
    (iv) If blood alcohol testing could have been completed within eight 
hours, the name, address, and telephone number of the testing site where

Alcohol Testing Program, Office of Motor Carrier Research and Standards 
(HCS-1), Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., 
Washington, DC 20590.
    (4) Controlled substance tests. If a test required by this section 
is not administered within 32 hours following the accident, the employer 
shall cease attempts to administer a controlled substances test, and 
prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the test was 
not promptly administered. Records shall be submitted to the FHWA upon 
request of the Associate Administrator.
    (c) A driver who is subject to post-accident testing shall remain 
readily available for such testing or may be

[[Page 538]]

deemed by the employer to have refused to submit to testing. Nothing in 
this section shall be construed to require the delay of necessary 
medical attention for injured people following an accident or to 
prohibit a driver from leaving the scene of an accident for the period 
necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident, or to 
obtain necessary emergency medical care.
    (d) An employer shall provide drivers with necessary post-accident 
information, procedures and instructions, prior to the driver operating 
a commercial motor vehicle, so that drivers will be able to comply with 
the requirements of this section.
    (e)(1) The results of a breath or blood test for the use of alcohol, 
conducted by Federal, State, or local officials having independent 
authority for the test, shall be considered to meet the requirements of 
this section, provided such tests conform to the applicable Federal, 
State or local alcohol testing requirements, and that the results of the 
tests are obtained by the employer.
    (2) The results of a urine test for the use of controlled 
substances, conducted by Federal, State, or local officials having 
independent authority for the test, shall be considered to meet the 
requirements of this section, provided such tests conform to the 
applicable Federal, State or local controlled substances testing 
requirements, and that the results of the tests are obtained by the 
employer.
    (f) Exception. This section does not apply to:
    (1) An occurrence involving only boarding or alighting from a 
stationary motor vehicle; or
    (2) An occurrence involving only the loading or unloading of cargo; 
or
    (3) An occurrence in the course of the operation of a passenger car 
or a multipurpose passenger vehicle (as defined in Sec. 571.3 of this 
title) by an employer unless the motor vehicle is transporting 
passengers for hire or hazardous materials of a type and quantity that 
require the motor vehicle to be marked or placarded in accordance with 
Sec. 177.823 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 382.305  Random testing.

    (a) Every employer shall comply with the requirements of this 
section. Every driver shall submit to random alcohol and controlled 
substance testing as required in this section.
    (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this 
section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing 
shall be 25 percent of the average number of driver positions.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) through (h) of this 
section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random controlled 
substances testing shall be 50 percent of the average number of driver 
positions.
    (c) The FHWA Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the 
minimum annual percentage rate for alcohol testing is based on the 
reported violation rate for the entire industry. All information used 
for this determination is drawn from the alcohol management information 
system reports required by Sec. 382.403 of this part. In order to ensure 
reliability of the data, the FHWA Administrator considers the quality 
and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information 
or reports from employers, and may make appropriate modifications in 
calculating the industry violation rate. Each year, the FHWA 
Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the minimum annual 
percentage rate for random alcohol testing of drivers. The new minimum 
annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing will be applicable 
starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication.
    (d)(1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 25 percent or more, the FHWA Administrator may lower this 
rate to 10 percent of all driver positions if the FHWA Administrator 
determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of 
Sec. 382.403 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the 
violation rate is less than 0.5 percent.
    (2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 50 percent, the FHWA Administrator may lower this rate to 25 
percent of all driver positions if the FHWA

[[Page 539]]

Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting 
requirements of Sec. 382.403 for two consecutive calendar years indicate 
that the violation rate is less than 1.0 percent but equal to or greater 
than 0.5 percent.
    (e)(1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 10 percent, and the data received under the reporting 
requirements of Sec. 382.403 for that calendar year indicate that the 
violation rate is equal to or greater than 0.5 percent, but less than 
1.0 percent, the FHWA Administrator will increase the minimum annual 
percentage rate for random alcohol testing to 25 percent for all driver 
positions.
    (2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 25 percent or less, and the data received under the reporting 
requirements of Sec. 382.403 for that calendar year indicate that the 
violation rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the FHWA 
Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for 
random alcohol testing to 50 percent for all driver positions.
    (f) The FHWA Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the 
minimum annual percentage rate for controlled substances testing is 
based on the reported positive rate for the entire industry. All 
information used for this determination is drawn from the controlled 
substances management information system reports required by 
Sec. 382.403 of this part. In order to ensure reliability of the data, 
the FHWA Administrator considers the quality and completeness of the 
reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from 
employers, and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the 
industry positive rate. Each year, the FHWA Administrator will publish 
in the Federal Register the minimum annual percentage rate for random 
controlled substances testing of drivers. The new minimum annual 
percentage rate for random controlled substances testing will be 
applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following 
publication.
    (g) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random controlled 
substances testing is 50 percent, the FHWA Administrator may lower this 
rate to 25 percent of all driver positions if the FHWA Administrator 
determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of 
Sec. 382.403 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the 
positive rate is less than 1.0 percent. However, after the initial two 
years of random testing by large employers and the initial first year of 
testing by small employers under this section, the FHWA Administrator 
may lower the rate the following calendar year, if the combined positive 
testing rate is less than 1.0 percent, and if it would be in the 
interest of safety.
    (h) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random controlled 
substances testing is 25 percent, and the data received under the 
reporting requirements of Sec. 382.403 for any calendar year indicate 
that the reported positive rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, 
the FHWA Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate 
for random controlled substances testing to 50 percent of all driver 
positions.
    (i) The selection of drivers for random alcohol and controlled 
substances testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such 
as a random number table or a computer-based random number generator 
that is matched with drivers' Social Security numbers, payroll 
identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under 
the selection process used, each driver shall have an equal chance of 
being tested each time selections are made.
    (j) The employer shall randomly select a sufficient number of 
drivers for testing during each calendar year to equal an annual rate 
not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol and 
controlled substances testing determined by the FHWA Administrator. If 
the employer conducts random testing for alcohol and/or controlled 
substances through a consortium, the number of drivers to be tested may 
be calculated for each individual employer or may be based on the total 
number of drivers covered by the consortium who are subject to random 
alcohol and/or controlled substances testing at the same minimum annual 
percentage rate under this part

[[Page 540]]

or any DOT alcohol or controlled substances random testing rule.
    (k) Each employer shall ensure that random alcohol and controlled 
substances tests conducted under this part are unannounced and that the 
dates for administering random alcohol and controlled substances tests 
are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
    (l) Each employer shall require that each driver who is notified of 
selection for random alcohol and/or controlled substances testing 
proceeds to the test site immediately; provided, however, that if the 
driver is performing a safety-sensitive function, other than driving a 
commercial motor vehicle, at the time of notification, the employer 
shall instead ensure that the driver ceases to perform the safety-
sensitive function and proceeds to the testing site as soon as possible.
    (m) A driver shall only be tested for alcohol while the driver is 
performing safety-sensitive functions, just before the driver is to 
perform safety-sensitive functions, or just after the driver has ceased 
performing such functions.
    (n) If a given driver is subject to random alcohol or controlled 
substances testing under the random alcohol or controlled substances 
testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same employer, the 
driver shall be subject to random alcohol and/or controlled substances 
testing at the annual percentage rate established for the calendar year 
by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the driver's 
function.
    (o) If an employer is required to conduct random alcohol or 
controlled substances testing under the alcohol or controlled substances 
testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employer may--
    (1) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool 
containing the DOT-covered employees who are subject to testing at the 
same required minimum annual percentage rate; or
    (2) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest 
minimum annual percentage rate established for the calendar year by any 
DOT agency to which the employer is subject.


<R05>
Sec. 382.307  Reasonable suspicion testing.

    (a) An employer shall require a driver to submit to an alcohol test 
when the employer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver 
has violated the prohibitions of subpart B of this part concerning 
alcohol. The employer's determination that reasonable suspicion exists 
to require the driver to undergo an alcohol test must be based on 
specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the 
appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the driver.
    (b) An employer shall require a driver to submit to a controlled 
substances test when the employer has reasonable suspicion to believe 
that the driver has violated the prohibitions of subpart B of this part 
concerning controlled substances. The employer's determination that 
reasonable suspicion exists to require the driver to undergo a 
controlled substances test must be based on specific, contemporaneous, 
articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or 
body odors of the driver. The observations may include indications of 
the chronic and withdrawal effects of controlled substances.
    (c) The required observations for alcohol and/or controlled 
substances reasonable suspicion testing shall be made by a supervisor or 
company official who is trained in accordance with Sec. 382.603 of this 
part. The person who makes the determination that reasonable suspicion 
exists to conduct an alcohol test shall not conduct the alcohol test of 
the driver.
    (d) Alcohol testing is authorized by this section only if the 
observations required by paragraph (a) of this section are made during, 
just preceding, or just after the period of the work day that the driver 
is required to be in compliance with this part. A driver may be directed 
by the employer to only undergo reasonable suspicion testing while the 
driver is performing safety-sensitive functions, just before the driver 
is to perform safety-sensitive functions, or just after the driver has 
ceased performing such functions.
    (e)(1) If an alcohol test required by this section is not 
administered within two hours following the determination under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the

[[Page 541]]

employer shall prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons 
the alcohol test was not promptly administered. If an alcohol test 
required by this section is not administered within eight hours 
following the determination under paragraph (a) of this section, the 
employer shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall 
state in the record the reasons for not administering the test.
    (2) For the years stated in this paragraph, employers who submit MIS 
reports shall submit to the FHWA each record of a test required by this 
section that is not completed within 8 hours. The employer's records of 
tests that could not be completed within 8 hours shall be submitted to 
the FHWA by March 15, 1996; March 15, 1997; and March 15, 1998; for 
calendar years 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively. Employers shall 
append these records to their MIS submissions. Each record shall include 
the following information:
    (i) Type of test (reasonable suspicion/post-accident);
    (ii) Triggering event (including date, time, and location);
    (iii) Reason(s) test could not be completed within 8 hours; and
    (iv) If blood alcohol testing could have been completed within eight 
hours, the name, address, and telephone number of the testing site where 
blood testing could have occurred.
    (3) Records of tests that could not be completed in eight hours 
shall be submitted to the FHWA at the following address: Attn.: Alcohol 
Testing program, Office of Motor Carrier Research and Standards (HCS-1), 
Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 
20590.
    (4) Notwithstanding the absence of a reasonable suspicion alcohol 
test under this section, no driver shall report for duty or remain on 
duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions while the 
driver is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, as shown by the 
behavioral, speech, and performance indicators of alcohol misuse, nor 
shall an employer permit the driver to perform or continue to perform 
safety-sensitive functions, until:
    (i) An alcohol test is administered and the driver's alcohol 
concentration measures less than 0.02; or
    (ii) Twenty four hours have elapsed following the determination 
under paragraph (a) of this section that there is reasonable suspicion 
to believe that the driver has violated the prohibitions in this part 
concerning the use of alcohol.
    (5) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, no 
employer shall take any action under this part against a driver based 
solely on the driver's behavior and appearance, with respect to alcohol 
use, in the absence of an alcohol test. This does not prohibit an 
employer with independent authority of this part from taking any action 
otherwise consistent with law.
    (f) A written record shall be made of the observations leading to a 
controlled substance reasonable suspicion test, and signed by the 
supervisor or company official who made the observations, within 24 
hours of the observed behavior or before the results of the controlled 
substances test are released, whichever is earlier.


<R05>
Sec. 382.309  Return-to-duty testing.

    (a) Each employer shall ensure that before a driver returns to duty 
requiring the performance of a safety-sensitive function after engaging 
in conduct prohibited by subpart B of this part concerning alcohol, the 
driver shall undergo a return-to-duty alcohol test with a result 
indicating an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02.
    (b) Each employer shall ensure that before a driver returns to duty 
requiring the performance of a safety-sensitive function after engaging 
in conduct prohibited by subpart B of this part concerning controlled 
substances, the driver shall undergo a return-to-duty controlled 
substances test with a result indicating a verified negative result for 
controlled substances use.


<R05>
Sec. 382.311  Follow-up testing.

    (a) Following a determination under Sec. 382.605(b) that a driver is 
in need of assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol 
misuse and/or use of controlled substances, each employer shall ensure 
that the driver is subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol and/

[[Page 542]]

or controlled substances testing as directed by a substance abuse 
professional in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 382.605(c)(2)(ii).
    (b) Follow-up alcohol testing shall be conducted only when the 
driver is performing safety-sensitive functions, just before the driver 
is to perform safety-sensitive functions, or just after the driver has 
ceased performing safety-sensitive functions.

driver's return to duty. The employer may direct the driver to undergo 
return-to-duty and follow-up testing for both alcohol and controlled 
substances, if the substance abuse professional determines that return-
to-duty and follow-up testing for both alcohol and controlled substances 
is necessary for that particular driver. Any such testing shall be 
performed in accordance with the requirements of 49 CFR part 40. Follow-
up testing shall not exceed 60 months from the date of the driver's 
return to duty. The substance abuse professional may terminate the 
requirement for follow-up testing at any time after the first six tests 
have been administered, if the substance abuse professional determines

    (d) Evaluation and rehabilitation may be provided by the employer, 
by a substance abuse professional under contract with the employer, or 
by a substance abuse professional not affiliated with the employer. The 
choice of substance abuse professional and assignment of costs shall be 
made in accordance with employer/driver agreements and employer 
policies.
    (e) The employer shall ensure that a substance abuse professional 
who determines that a driver requires assistance in resolving problems 
with alcohol misuse or controlled substances use does not refer the 
driver to the substance abuse professional's private practice or to a 
person or organization from which the substance abuse professional 
receives remuneration or in which the substance abuse professional has a 
financial interest. This paragraph does not prohibit a substance abuse 
professional from referring a driver for assistance provided through--
    (1) A public agency, such as a State, county, or municipality;
    (2) The employer or a person under contract to provide treatment for

number of calendar days in any 12-month period for which the restricted 
CDL is valid does not exceed 180. If a State elects to provide for more 
than one seasonal period, the restricted CDL is valid for commercial 
motor vehicle operation only during the currently approved season, and 
must be revalidated for each successive season. Only one seasonal period 
of validity may appear on the license document at a time. The good 
driving record must be confirmed prior to any renewal or revalidation.
    (iii) Restricted CDL holders are limited to operating Group B and C 
vehicles, as described in subpart F of this part.
    (iv) Restricted CDLs shall not be issued with any endorsements on

[[Page 554]]

    (g) Restricted CDL for certain drivers in the pyrotechnic industry.

materials knowledge tests of subpart H of this part and issue restricted 
CDLs to part-time drivers operating commercial motor vehicles 
transporting less than 227 kilograms (500 pounds) of fireworks 
classified as DOT Class 1.3G explosives.
    (2) A State issuing a CDL under the terms of this paragraph must 
restrict issuance as follows:
    (i) The GVWR of the vehicle to be operated must be less than 4,537 
kilograms (10,001 pounds);
    (ii) If a State believes, at its discretion, that the training 
required by Sec. 172.704 of this title adequately prepares part-time 
drivers meeting the other requirements of this paragraph to deal with 
fireworks and the other potential dangers posed by fireworks 
transportation and use, the State may waive the hazardous materials 
knowledge tests of subpart H of this part. The State may impose any 
requirements it believes is necessary to ensure itself that a driver is 
properly trained pursuant to Sec. 172.704 of this title.
    (iii) A restricted CDL document issued pursuant to this paragraph 
shall have a statement clearly imprinted on the face of the document 
that is substantially similar as follows: ``For use as a CDL only during

than 227 kilograms (500 pounds) of fireworks classified as DOT Class 
1.3G explosives in a vehicle with a GVWR of less than 4,537 kilograms 
(10,001 pounds).
    (3) A restricted CDL issued pursuant to this paragraph shall meet 
all the requirements of this part, except those specifically identified. 
A restricted CDL issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be accorded the 
same reciprocity as a CDL meeting all of the requirements of this part. 
The restrictions imposed upon the issuance of this restricted CDL shall 
not limit a person's use of the CDL in a non-CMV during either validated 
or non-validated periods, nor shall the CDL affect a State's power to 
administer its driver licensing program for operators of vehicles other 
than CMVs.
    (4) Restricted CDLs shall have the same renewal cycle as 
unrestricted CDLs, but shall be limited to the seasonal period of June 
30 through July 6 of each year or a lesser period as defined by the 
State of licensure.
    (5) Persons who operate commercial motor vehicles during the period 
from July 7 through June 29 for purposes of transporting less than 227 
kilograms (500 pounds) of fireworks classified as DOT Class 1.3G

pounds) and who also operate such vehicles for the same purposes during 
the period June 30 through July 6 shall not be issued a restricted CDL

this section, no person shall operate a commercial motor vehicle unless 
such person possesses a CDL which meets the standards contained in 
subpart J of this part, issued by his/her State or jurisdiction of 
domicile.
    (b) Exception. If a commercial motor vehicle operator is domiciled 
in a foreign jurisdiction which, as determined by the Administrator, 
does not test drivers and issue a CDL in accordance with, or similar to, 
the standards contained in subparts F, G, and H of this part, the person 
shall obtain a Nonresident CDL from a State which does comply with the 
testing and licensing standards contained in such subparts F, G, and H.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Effective December 29, 1988, the Administrator determined that 
commercial drivers' licensees issued by Canadian Provinces and 
Territories in conformity with the Canadian National Safety Code are in 
accordance with the standards of this part. Effective November 21, 1991, 
the Administrator determined that the new Licencias Federales de 
Conductor issued by the United Mexican States are in accordance with the 
standards of this part. Therefore, under the single license provision of 
Sec. 383.21, a driver holding a commercial driver's license issued under 
the Canadian National Safety Code or a new Licencia Federal de Conductor 
issued by Mexico is prohibited from obtaining nonresident CDL, or any 
other type of driver's license, from a State or other jurisdiction in 
the United States.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Learner's permit. State learner's permits, issued for limited 
time periods according to State requirements, shall be considered valid 
commercial drivers' licenses for purposes of behind-the-wheel training 
on public roads or highways, if the following minimum conditions are 
met:
    (1) The learner's permit holder is at all time accompanied by the 
holder of a valid CDL; and
    (2) He/she either holds a valid automobile driver's license, or has 
passed such vision, sign/symbol, and knowledge tests as the State 
issuing the learner's permit ordinarily administers

(Sec. 383.95):
    (1) If the applicant scores less than 80 percent on the air brake 
component of the basic knowledge test as described in Sec. 383.111(g), 
the driver will have failed the air brake component and, if the driver 
is issued a CDL, an air brake restriction shall be indicated on the 
license; and
    (2) If the applicant performs the skills test in a vehicle not

makes application for a transfer CDL.
    (b) Required action--(1) CDL holders. A State shall satisfy the 
requirement of this part that the State disqualify a person who holds a 
CDL by, at a minimum, suspending, revoking, or canceling the person's 
CDL for the applicable period of disqualification.
    (2) Non-CDL holders applies on and after May 18, 1997. A State shall 
satisfy the requirement of this subpart that the State disqualify a non-
CDL holder who is convicted of an offense or offenses necessitating 
disqualification under Sec. 383.51 by, at a minimum, implementing the 
limitation on licensing provisions of Sec. 384.210 and the timing and 
recordkeeping requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section so 
as to prevent such non-CDL holder from legally obtaining a CDL from any 
State during the applicable disqualification period(s) specified in this 
subpart.
    (c) Required timing. The State shall disqualify a driver as 
expeditiously as possible.
    (d) Recordkeeping requirements. The State shall maintain such driver 
records and cause such driver identification data to be retained on the 
CDLIS as the operator of the CDLIS specifies are necessary to the 
implementation and enforcement of the disqualifications called for in 
Secs. 384.215 through 384.219.

<R05>
Sec. 385.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This part establishes procedures to determine the safety fitness 
of motor carriers, to assign safety ratings, to take remedial action 
when required, and to prohibit motor carriers receiving a safety rating 
of ``unsatisfactory'' from operating a commercial motor vehicle:
    (1) To provide transportation of hazardous materials for which 
vehicle placarding is required in accordance with part 172, subpart F of 
this title; or
    (2) To transport more than 15 passengers, including the driver.
    (b) The provisions of this part apply to all motor carriers subject 
to the requirements of this subchapter.

[56 FR 40805, Aug. 16, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 385.3  Definitions.

    Applicable safety regulations or requirements means 49 CFR subtitle 
B, chapter III, Subchapter B--Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations; 
and 49 CFR subtitle B, chapter I, Subchapter C--Hazardous Materials 
Regulations.
    Commercial motor vehicle shall have the same meaning as described in 
Sec. 390.5 of this subchapter.
    Preventable accident on the part of a motor carrier means an 
accident (1) that involved a commercial motor vehicle, and (2) that 
could have been averted but for an act, or failure to act, by the motor 
carrier or the driver.
    Reviews. For the purposes of this part:
    (1) Compliance review means an on-site examination of motor carrier 
operations, such as drivers' hours of service, maintenance and 
inspection, driver qualification, commercial drivers license 
requirements, financial responsibility, accidents, hazardous materials, 
and other safety and transportation records to determine whether a motor 
carrier meets the safety fitness standard. A compliance review may be 
conducted in response to a request to change a safety rating, to 
investigate potential violations of safety regulations by motor 
carriers, or to investigate complaints or other evidence of safety 
violations. The compliance review may result in the initiation of an 
enforcement action.
    (2) Safety review means an on-site assessment to determine if a 
motor carrier has adequate safety management controls in place and 
functioning to meet the safety fitness standard. The safety review 
includes an inspection of selected motor carrier records and operations. 
It is used to gather information for assigning ratings to unrated 
carriers. The safety review is not ordinarily employed to gather 
evidence in support of enforcement actions, but will if certain serious 
violations are discovered (e.g., absence of proof of financial 
responsibility; document falsification).
    (3) Safety management controls means the systems, policies programs, 
practices, and procedures used by a motor carrier to ensure compliance 
with applicable safety and hazardous materials regulations which ensure 
the safe movement of products and passengers through the transportation 
system, and to reduce the risk of highway accidents and hazardous 
materials incidents resulting in fatalities, injuries, and property 
damage.
    Safety ratings: (1) Satisfactory safety rating means that a motor 
carrier has in place and functioning adequate safety management controls 
to meet the safety fitness standard prescribed in Sec. 385.5. Safety 
management controls are adequate if they are appropriate for the size 
and type of operation of the particular motor carrier.
    (2) Conditional safety rating means a motor carrier does not have 
adequate safety management controls in place to ensure compliance with 
the safety fitness standard that could result in the occurrences listed 
in Sec. 385.5 (a) through (h).
    (3) Unsatisfactory safety rating means a motor carrier does not have 
adequate safety management controls in place to ensure compliance with 
the safety fitness standard which has resulted in occurrences listed in 
Sec. 385.5 (a) through (h). Motor carriers receiving an ``unsatisfactory 
safety rating'' may be subject to the provisions of Sec. 385.13.

[[Page 582]]

    (4) Unrated carrier means that a safety rating has not been assigned 
to the motor carrier by the FHWA.

[53 FR 50968, Dec. 19, 1988, as amended at 56 FR 40805, Aug. 16, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 385.5  Safety fitness standard.

    The satisfactory safety rating is based on the degree of compliance 
with the safety fitness standard for motor carriers. To meet the safety 
fitness standard, the motor carrier shall demonstrate that it has 
adequate safety management controls in place, which function effectively 
to ensure acceptable compliance with applicable safety requirements to 
reduce the risk associated with:
    (a) Commercial driver's license standard violations (part 383),
    (b) Inadequate levels of financial responsibility (part 387),
    (c) The use of unqualified drivers (part 391),
    (d) Improper use and driving of motor vehicles (part 392),
    (e) Unsafe vehicles operating on the highways (part 393),
    (f) Failure to maintain accident registers and copies of accident 
reports (part 390),
    (g) The use of fatigued drivers (part 395),
    (h) Inadequate inspection, repair, and maintenance of vehicles (part 
396),
    (i) Transportation of hazardous materials, driving and parking rule 
violations (part 397),
    (j) Violation of hazardous materials regulations (parts 170 through 
177), and
    (k) Motor vehicle accidents and hazardous materials incidents.

[53 FR 50968, Dec. 19, 1988, as amended at 58 FR 33776, June 21, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 385.7  Factors to be considered in determining a safety rating.

    The factors to be considered in determining the safety fitness and 
assigning a safety rating include information from safety reviews, 
compliance reviews and any other data. The factors may include all or 
some of the following:
    (a) Adequacy of safety management controls. The adequacy of controls 
may be questioned if their degree of formalization, automation, etc., is 
found to be substantially below the norm for similar carriers. 
Violations, accidents or incidents substantially above the norm for 
similar carriers will be strong evidence that management controls are 
either inadequate or not functioning properly.
    (b) Frequency and severity of regulatory violations.
    (c) Frequency and severity of driver/vehicle regulatory violations 
identified in roadside inspections.
    (d) Number and frequency of out-of-service driver/vehicle 
violations.
    (e) Increase or decrease in similar types of regulatory violations 
discovered during safety or compliance reviews.
    (f) Frequency of accidents; hazardous materials incidents; accident 
rate per million miles; preventable accident rate per million miles; and 
other accident indicators; and whether these accident and incident 
indicators have improved or deteriorated over time.
    (g) The number and severity of violations of state safety rules, 
regulations, standards, and orders applicable to commercial motor 
vehicles and motor carrier safety that are compatible with Federal 
rules, regulations, standards, and orders.

[53 FR 50968, Dec. 19, 1988, as amended at 58 FR 33776, June 21, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 385.9  Determination of a safety rating.

    Following a safety or compliance review of a motor carrier 
operation, the FHWA, using the factors prescribed in Sec. 385.7, shall 
determine whether the present operations of the motor carrier are 
consistent with the safety fitness standard set forth in Sec. 385.5, and 
assign a safety rating accordingly.


<R05>
Sec. 385.11  Notification of a safety rating.

    (a) The FHWA shall provide written notification to the motor carrier 
of the assigned safety rating.

will include a list of those items for which immediate corrective action 
must be taken.
    (c) A notification of an ``unsatisfactory'' safety rating will also 
include a notice that the motor carrier will be subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 385.13, which prohibit motor carriers rated 
``unsatisfactory'' from transporting:

[[Page 583]]

    (1) Hazardous materials requiring placarding under part 172, subpart 
F, of this title; or
    (2) 15 or more passengers, including the driver.

[56 FR 40806, Aug. 16, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 385.13  Unsatisfactory safety rating--Prohibition on transportation of hazardous materials and passengers.

    (a)(1) A motor carrier that receives a safety rating from the 
Federal Highway Administration which is ``unsatisfactory'' shall have 45 
calendar days from the effective date of that rating or from the date of 
notice of that rating, whichever is later, to take such action as may be 
necessary to improve such safety rating to ``conditional'' or 
``satisfactory.''
    (2) Prohibition on transportation. After the last day of the 45-day 
period established pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section and 
until notification is issued pursuant to this part of either a 
``conditional'' or ``satisfactory'' safety rating, a motor carrier rated 
``unsatisfactory'' shall be prohibited from operating a commercial motor 
vehicle to transport--
    (i) Hazardous materials for which vehicle placarding is required 
pursuant to this title; or
    (ii) More than 15 passengers, including the driver.
    (3) Ineligibility for Federal Government transportation. Any motor 
carrier that receives a safety rating of ``unsatisfactory'' shall be 
ineligible to contract or subcontract with any Federal agency for the 
transportation of--
    (i) Hazardous materials for which vehicle placarding is required 
pursuant to this title; or
    (ii) More than 15 passengers, including the driver.
    (b) Penalties. Any motor carrier that operates commercial motor 
vehicles in violation of this section will be subject to the penalty 
provisions of 49 U.S.C. App. 1809 and 49 U.S.C. 521.

of Motor Carrier Field Operations, may request the motor carrier to 
submit additional data and attend a conference to discuss the safety 
rating. Failure to provide such data or to attend the conference may 
result in dismissal of the petition.
    (d) The Director, Office of Motor Carrier Field Operations, shall 
notify the motor carrier in writing of a decision on a petition for 
review of a safety rating, which will constitute the final agency 
action. The decision may:
    (1) Confirm the rating; or
    (2) Revise the rating.

[56 FR 40806, Aug. 16, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 385.17  Request for a change in a safety rating; corrective action taken.

    (a) A request for a change in a safety rating may be made when the 
basis for the change is evidence that corrective actions have been taken 
and that operations currently meet the safety fitness standard specified 
in Sec. 385.5. The request shall be directed in writing, via certified 
mail, to the Regional Director of Motor Carriers for the FHWA Region in 
which the motor carrier maintains its principal place of business for

claimant may determine appropriate to aid in the enforcement of the law 
and regulations.
    (c) Notice of investigation. This is a notice to respondent that

complaint under paragraph (a) of this section, the Associate

investigation and action by the Administration. If he/she determines 
that the complaint states such grounds, the Associate Administrator 
shall issue, or authorize the issuance of, a notice of investigation 
under Sec. 386.11(c). If he/she determines that the complaint does not 
state reasonable grounds for investigation and action by the 
Administration, the Associate Administrator shall dismiss it.
    (c) Complaint of substantial violation. Any person may file a 
written complaint with the Associate Administrator alleging that a 
substantial violation of any regulation issued under the Motor Carrier

violation.
    (d) Action on complaint of substantial violation. Upon the filing of 
a complaint of a substantial violation under paragraph (c) of this 
section, the Associate Administrator shall determine whether it is 
nonfrivolous and meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this 
section. If the Associate Administrator determines that the complaint is 
nonfrivolous and meets the requirements of paragraph (c), he/she shall 
investigate the complaint. The complainant shall be timely notified of 
findings resulting from such investigation. The Associate Administrator 
shall not be required to conduct separate investigations of duplicative 
complaints. If the Associate Administrator determines that the complaint 
is frivalous or does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c), he/she 
shall dismiss the complaint and notify the complainant in writing of the 
reasons for such dismissal.
    (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 552 of title 5, United 
States Code, the Associate Administrator shall not disclose the identity 
of complainants unless it is determined that such disclosure is 
necessary to prosecute a violation. If disclosure becomes necessary, the 
Associate Administrator shall take every practical means within the 
Associate Administrator's authority to assure that the complainant is 
not subject to harassment, intimidation, disciplinary action, 
discrimination, or financial loss as a result of such disclosure.

<R05>
Sec. 386.13  Petitions to review and request for hearing: Driver qualification proceedings.

    (a) Within 60 days after service of the determination under

following:
    (1) Identification of what action the petitioner wants overturned;

forth material factual issues believed to be in dispute;
    (5) Certification that the reply has been filed in accordance with 
Sec. 386.31; and
    (6) Any other pertinent material.
    (b) Failure to submit a petition as specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section shall constitute a waiver of the right to petition for 
review of the determination or letter of disqualification. In these 
cases, the determination or disqualification issued automatically 
becomes the final decision of the Associate Administrator 30 days after 
the time to submit the reply or petition to review has expired, unless 
the Associate Administrator orders otherwise.
    (c) If the petition does not request a hearing, the Associate 
Administrator may issue a final decision and order based on the evidence 
and arguments submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 386.14  Replies and request for hearing: Civil forfeiture proceedings.

    (a) Time for reply. The respondent must reply within 15 days after a 
Claim Letter is served, or 30 days after a Notice of Investigation is 
received.
    (b) Contents of reply. The reply must contain the following:
    (1) An admission or denial of each allegation of the claim or notice 
and a concise statement of facts constituting each defense;
    (2) If the respondent contests the claim or notice, a request for an 
oral hearing or notice of intent to submit evidence without an oral 
hearing must be contained in the reply. A request for a hearing must 
list all material facts believed to be in dispute. Failure to request a 
hearing within 15 days after the Claim Letter is served, or 30 days in 
the case of a Notice of Investigation, shall constitute a waiver of any 
right to a hearing;
    (3) A statement of whether the respondent wishes to negotiate the 
terms of payment or settlement of the amount claimed, or the terms and 
conditions of the order; and
    (4) Certification that the reply has been served in accordance with 
Sec. 386.31.
    (c) Submission of evidence. If a notice of intent to submit evidence

or the contents of the notice, all evidence must be served in written 
form no later than the 40th day following service of the Claim Letter or 
Notice of Investigation. Evidence must be served in the form specified 
in Sec. 386.49.
    (d) Complainant's request for a hearing. If the respondent files a 
notice of intent to submit evidence without formal hearing, the 
complainant may, within 15 days after that reply is filed, submit a 
request for a formal hearing. The request must include a listing of all 
factual issues believed to be in dispute.
    (e) Failure to reply or request a hearing. If the respondent does 
not reply to a Claim Letter within the time prescribed in this section, 
the Claim Letter becomes the final agency order in the proceeding 25 
days after it is served. When no reply to the Notice of Investigation is 
received, the Associate Administrator may, on motion of any party, issue 
a final order in the proceeding.
    (f) Non-compliance with final order. Failure to pay the civil 
penalty as directed in a final order constitutes a violation of that 
order subjecting the respondent to an additional penalty as prescribed 
in subpart G of this part.

does not request an oral hearing, the Associate Administrator may issue 
a final decision and order based on the evidence and arguments 
submitted.
    (b) Request for oral hearing. If a request for an oral hearing has 
been filed, the Associate Administrator shall determine whether there

order to that effect and set a time for submission of argument by the 
parties. Upon the submission of argument he/she shall decide the case.
    (c) Settlement of civil forfeitures. (1) When negotiations produce

entitled to intervene. The petition must be served on all parties in

    (a) Unless otherwise limited by order of the Associate Administrator 
or, in cases that have been called for a hearing, the administrative law 
judge, in accordance with these rules, the parties may obtain discovery 
regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject 
matter involved in the proceeding, including the existence, description, 
nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or 
other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having 
knowledge of any discoverable matter.

reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
    (c) A party may obtain discovery of documents and tangible things 
otherwise discoverable under paragraph (a) of this section and prepared 
in anticipation of or for the hearing by or for another party's 
representative (including his or her attorney, consultant, surety, 
indemnitor, insurer, or agent) only upon a showing that the party 
seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the 
preparation of his or her case and that he or she is unable without 
undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by 
other means. In ordering discovery of such materials when the required 
showing has been made, the Associate Administrator or the administrative 
law judge shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, 
conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other 
representative of a party concerning the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 386.39  Protective orders.

    Upon motion by a party or other person from whom discovery is 
sought, and for good cause shown, the Associate Administrator or the 
administrative law judge, if one has been appointed, may make any order 
which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including one or 
more of the following:
    (a) The discovery not be had;
    (b) The discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions, 
including a designation of the time or place;
    (c) The discovery may be had only by a method of discovery other 
than that selected by the party seeking discovery;
    (d) Certain matters not relevant may not be inquired into, or that 
the scope of discovery be limited to certain matters;
    (e) Discovery be conducted with no one present except persons 
designated by the Associate Administrator or the administrative law 
judge; or

commercial information may not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a 
designated way.


<R05>
Sec. 386.40  Supplementation of responses.

    A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response 
that was complete when made is under no duty to supplement his/her 
response to include information thereafter acquired, except as follows:
    (a) A party is under a duty to supplement timely his/her response 
with respect to any question directly addressed to:

[[Page 596]]

    (1) The identity and location of persons having knowledge of 
discoverable matters; and
    (2) The identity of each person expected to be called as an expert 
witness at the hearing, the subject matter on which he or she is 
expected to testify and the substance of his or her testimony.
    (b) A party is under a duty to amend timely a prior response if he 
or she later obtains information upon the basis of which:
    (1) he or she knows the response was incorrect when made; or
    (2) he or she knows that the response though correct when made is no 
longer true and the circumstances are such that a failure to amend the 
response is in substance a knowing concealment.
    (c) A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of the 
Associate Administrator or the administrative law judge or agreement of 
the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 386.41  Stipulations regarding discovery.

    Unless otherwise ordered, a written stipulation entered into by all 
the parties and filed with the Associate Administrator or the 
administrative law judge, if one has been appointed, may:

or place, upon sufficient notice, and in any manner, and when so taken 
may be used like other depositions, and
    (b) Modify the procedures provided by these rules for other methods 
of discovery.


<R05>
Sec. 386.42  Written interrogatories to parties.

    (a) Any party may serve upon any other party written interrogatories 
to be answered in writing by the party served, or if the party served is 
a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or 
governmental agency, by any authorized officer or agent, who shall 
furnish such information as is available to the party. A copy of the 
interrogatories, answers, and all related pleadings shall be served on 
the Associate Administrator or, in cases that have been called to a 
hearing, on the administrative law judge, and upon all parties to the 
proceeding.
    (b) Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in 
writing under oath or affirmation, unless it is objected to, in which 
event the reasons for objection shall be stated in lieu of an answer. 
The answers and objections shall be signed by the person making them. 
The party upon whom the interrogatories were served shall serve a copy 
of the answer and objections upon all parties to the proceeding within 
30 days after service of the interrogatories, or within such shortened 
or longer period as the Associate Administrator or the administrative 
law judge may allow.
    (c) An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily 
objectionable merely because an answer to the interrogatory involves an 
opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to 
fact, but the Associate Administrator or administrative law judge may 
order that such an interrogatory need not be answered until after 
designated discovery has been completed or until a prehearing conference 
or other later time.


<R05>
Sec. 386.43  Production of documents and other evidence; entry upon land for inspection and other purposes; and physical and mental examination.

    (a) Any party may serve on any other party a request to:
    (1) Produce and permit the party making the request, or a person 
acting on his or her behalf, to inspect and copy any designated 
documents, or to inspect and copy, test, or sample any tangible things 
which are in the possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom 
the request is served; or
    (2) Permit entry upon designated land or other property in the 
possession or control of the party upon whom the request is served for 
the purpose of inspection and measuring, photographing, testing, or for 
other purposes as stated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

    (b) The request may be served on any party without leave of the 
Associate Administrator or administrative law judge.
    (c) The request shall:

[[Page 597]]

    (1) Set forth the items to be inspected either by individual item or 
category;
    (2) Describe each item or category with reasonable particularity;
    (3) Specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making the 
inspection and performing the related acts;
    (4) Specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the 
physical or mental examination and the person or persons by whom it is 
to be made. A report of examining physician shall be made in accordance 
with Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, title 28, U.S. 
Code, as amended.
    (d) The party upon whom the request is served shall serve on the 
party submitting the request a written response within 30 days after 
service of the request.
    (e) The response shall state, with respect to each item or category:
    (1) That inspection and related activities will be permitted as 
requested; or
    (2) That objection is made in whole or in part, in which case the 
reasons for objection shall be stated.
    (f) A copy of each request for production and each written response 
shall be served on all parties and filed with the Associate 
Administrator or the administrative law judge, if one has been 
appointed.


<R05>
Sec. 386.44  Request for admissions.

    (a) Request for admission. (1) Any party may serve upon any other 
party a request for admission of any relevant matter or the authenticity 
of any relevant document. Copies of any document about which an 
admission is requested must accompany the request.
    (2) Each matter for which an admission is requested shall be 
separately set forth and numbered. The matter is admitted unless within 
15 days after service of the request, the party to whom the request is 
directed serves upon the party requesting the admission a written answer 
signed by the party or his/her attorney.
    (3) Each answer must specify whether the party admits or denies the 
matter. If the matter cannot be admitted or denied, the party shall set 
out in detail the reasons.
    (4) A party may not issue a denial or fail to answer on the ground 
that he/she lacks knowledge unless he/she has made reasonable inquiry to 
ascertain information sufficient to allow him/her to admit or deny.
    (5) A party may file an objection to a request for admission within 
10 days after service. Such motion shall be filed with the 
administrative law judge if one has been appointed, otherwise it shall 
be filed with the Associate Administrator. An objection must explain in 
detail the reasons the party should not answer. A reply to the objection 
may be served by the party requesting the admission within 10 days after 
service of the objection. It is not sufficient ground for objection to 
claim that the matter about which an admission is requested presents an 
issue of fact for hearing.
    (b) Effect of admission. Any matter admitted is conclusively 
established unless the Associate Administrator or administrative law 
judge permits withdrawal or amendment. Any admission under this rule is 
for the purpose of the pending action only and may not be used in any 
other proceeding.
    (c) If a party refuses to admit a matter or the authenticity of a 
document which is later proved, the party requesting the admission may 
move for an award of expenses incurred in making the proof. Such a 
motion shall be granted unless there was a good reason for failure to 
admit.


<R05>
Sec. 386.45  Motion to compel discovery.

    (a) If a deponent fails to answer a question propounded or a party 
upon whom a request is made pursuant to Secs. 386.42 through 386.44, or 
a party upon whom interrogatories are served fails to respond adequately 
or objects to the request, or any part thereof, or fails to permit 
inspection as requested, the discovering party may move the Associate 
Administrator or the administrative law judge, if one has been 
appointed, for an order compelling a response or inspection in 
accordance with the request.
    (b) The motion shall set forth:
    (1) The nature of the questions or request;

[[Page 598]]

    (2) The response or objections of the party upon whom the request 
was served; and
    (3) Arguments in support of the motion.
    (c) For purposes of this section, an evasive answer or incomplete 
answer or response shall be treated as a failure to answer or respond.
    (d) In ruling on a motion made pursuant to this section, the 
Associate Administrator or the administrative law judge, if one has been 
appointed, may make and enter a protective order such as he or she is 
authorized to enter on a motion made pursuant to Sec. 386.39(a).


<R05>
Sec. 386.46  Depositions.

    (a) When, how, and by whom taken. The deposition of any witness may 
be taken at any stage of the proceeding at reasonable times. Depositions 
may be taken by oral examination or upon written interrogatories before 
any person having power to administer oaths.
    (b) Application. Any party desiring to take the deposition of a 
witness shall indicate to the witness and all other parties the time 
when, the place where, and the name and post office address of the 
person before whom the deposition is to be taken; the name and address 
of each witness; and the subject matter concerning which each such 
witness is expected to testify.
    (c) Notice. Notice shall be given for the taking of a deposition, 
which shall be not less than 5 days written notice when the deposition 
is to be taken within the continental United States and not less than 20 
days written notice when the deposition is to be taken elsewhere.
    (d) Taking and receiving in evidence. Each witness testifying upon 
deposition shall be sworn, and any other party shall have the right to 
cross-examine. The questions propounded and the answers thereto, 
together with all objections made, shall be reduced to writing; read by 
or to, and subscribed by the witness; and certified by the person 
administering the oath. Thereafter, such officer shall seal the 
deposition in an envelope and mail the same by certified mail to the 
Associate Administrator or the administrative law judge, if one has been 
appointed. Subject to such objections to the questions and answers as 
were noted at the time of taking the deposition and which would have 
been valid if the witness were personally present and testifying, such 
deposition may be read and offered in evidence by the party taking it as 
against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the 
deposition or who had due notice thereof.
    (e) Motion to terminate or limit examination. During the taking of a 
deposition, a party or deponent may request suspension of the deposition 
on grounds of bad faith in the conduct of the examination, oppression of 
a deponent or party or improper questions propounded. The deposition 
will then be adjourned. However, the objecting party or deponent must 
immediately move the Associate Administrator or administrative law judge 
for a ruling on his or her objections to the deposition conduct or 
proceedings. The Associate Administrator or administrative law judge may 
then limit the scope or manner of the taking of the deposition.


<R05>
Sec. 386.47  Use of deposition at hearings.

    (a) Generally. At the hearing, any part or all of a deposition, so 
far as admissible under the rules of evidence, may be used against any 
party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or 
who had due notice thereof in accordance with any one of the following 
provisions:
    (1) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of 
contradicting or impeaching the testimony of the deponent as a witness.
    (2) The deposition of expert witnesses, particularly the deposition 
of physicians, may be used by any party for any purpose, unless the 
Associate Administrator or administrative law judge rules that such use 
would be unfair or a violation of due process.
    (3) The deposition of a party or of anyone who at the time of taking 
the deposition was an officer, director, or duly authorized agent of a 
public or private organization, partnership, or association which is a 
party, may be used by any other party for any purpose.
    (4) The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used 
by any party for any purpose if the presiding officer finds:

[[Page 599]]

    (i) That the witness is dead; or
    (ii) That the witness is out of the United States or more than 100 
miles from the place of hearing unless it appears that the absence of 
the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition; or
    (iii) That the witness is unable to attend to testify because of 
age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or
    (iv) That the party offering the deposition has been unable to 
procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or
    (v) Upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances 
exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due 
regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally 
in open hearing, to allow the deposition to be used.
    (5) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, 
any other party may require him or her to introduce all of it which is 
relevant to the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other 
parts.
    (b) Objections to admissibility. Except as provided in this 
paragraph, objection may be made at the hearing to receiving in evidence 
any deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the 
exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and 
testifying.
    (1) Objections to the competency of a witness or to the competency, 
relevancy or materiality of testimony are not waived by failure to make 
them before or during the taking of the deposition, unless the ground of 
the objection is one which might have been obviated or removed if 
presented at that time.
    (2) Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in 
the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or 
answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of parties and 
errors of any kind which might be obviated, removed, or cured if 
promptly presented, are waived unless reasonable objection thereto is 
made at the taking of the deposition.
    (3) Objections to the form or written interrogatories are waived 
unless served in writing upon the party propounding them.
    (c) Effect of taking using depositions. A party shall not be deemed 
to make a person his or her own witness for any purpose by taking his or 
her deposition. The introduction in evidence of the deposition or any 
part thereof for any purpose other than that of contradicting or 
impeaching the deponent makes the deponent the witness of the party 
introducing the deposition, but this shall not apply to the use by any 
other party of a deposition as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section. At the hearing, any party may rebut any relevant evidence 
contained in a deposition whether introduced by him or her or by any 
other party.


<R05>
Sec. 386.48  Medical records and physicians' reports.

    In cases involving the physical qualifications of drivers, copies of 
all physicians' reports, test results, and other medical records that a 
party intends to rely upon shall be served on all other parties at least 
30 days prior to the date set for a hearing. Except as waived by the 
Director, Office of Motor Carrier Standards, reports, test results and

               Subpart F--Injunctions and Imminent Hazards


<R05>
Sec. 386.71  Injunctions.

    Whenever it is determined that a person has engaged, or is about to 
engage, in any act or practice constituting a violation of section 3102 
of title 49, United States Code, or the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 
1984, or the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, or any regulation 
or order issued under that section or those Acts for which the Federal 
Highway Administrator exercises enforcement responsibility, the Chief 
Counsel or the Assistant Chief Counsel for Motor Carrier and Highway 
Safety Law may request the United States Attorney General to bring an 
action in the appropriate United States District Court for such relief 
as is necessary or appropriate, including mandatory or prohibitive 
injunctive relief, interim equitable relief, and punitive damages, as 
provided by section 213(c) of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 and 
section 111(a) of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. 
507(c), 1810).


<R05>
Sec. 386.72  Imminent hazard.

    (a) Whenever it is determined that there is substantial likelihood 
that death, serious illness, or severe personal injury, will result from 
the transportation by motor vehicle of a particular hazardous material 
before a notice of investigation proceeding, or other administrative 
hearing or formal proceeding to abate the risk of harm can be completed, 
the Chief Counsel or the Assistant Chief Counsel for Motor Carrier and 
Highway Safety Law may bring, or request the United States Attorney 
General to bring, an action in the appropriate United States District 
Court for an order suspending or restricting the transportation by motor 
vehicle of the hazardous material or for such other order as is 
necessary to eliminate or ameliorate the imminent hazard, as provided by 
section 111(b) of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. 
1810).
    (b)(1) Whenever it is determined that a violation of 49 U.S.C. 3102 
or the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 or the Commercial Motor Vehicle 
Safety Act of 1986 or a regulation issued under such section or Acts, or 
combination of such violations, poses an imminent hazard to safety, the 
Director, Motor Carrier Safety Field Operations or the Regional Director 
of Motor Carriers, or his or her delegate, shall order a vehicle or 
employee operating such vehicle out of service, or order an employer to 
cease all or part of the employer's commercial motor vehicle operations 
as provided by section 213(b) of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 
and section 12012(d) of the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986. 
(49 U.S.C. 521(b)(5)). In making any such order, no restrictions shall 
be imposed on any employee or employer beyond that required to abate the 
hazard. In this paragraph, ``imminent hazard'' means any condition of 
vehicle, employee, or commercial motor vehicle operations which is 
likely to result in serious injury or death if not discontinued 
immediately.
    (2) Upon the issuance of an order under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the motor carrier employer or driver employee shall comply 
immediately with such order. Opportunity for review shall be provided in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554, except that such review shall occur not 
later than 10 days after issuance of such order, as provided by section 
213(b) of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 (49 U.S.C. 521(b)(5)). An 
order to an employer to cease all or part of its operations shall not 
prevent vehicles in transit at the time the order is served from 
proceeding to their immediate destinations, unless any such vehicle or 
its driver is specifically ordered out of service

[[Page 604]]

forthwith. However, vehicles and drivers proceeding to their immediate 
destination shall be subject to compliance upon arrival.
    (3) For purposes of this section the term ``immediate destination'' 
is the next scheduled stop of the vehicle already in motion where the 
cargo on board can be safely secured.
    (4) Failure to comply immediately with an order issued under this 
section shall subject the motor carrier employer or driver to penalties 
prescribed in subpart G of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 386.81  General.

    (a) The maximum amounts of civil penalties that can be imposed for 
regulatory violations subject to the civil forfeiture proceedings in 
this part are set in the statutes authorizing the regulations. The 
determination of the actual civil penalties assessed in each proceeding 
is based on those defined limits and consideration of information 
available at the time the claim is made concerning the nature, 
circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation and, with respect to 
the violator, the degree of culpability, history of prior offenses, 
ability to pay, effect on ability to continue to do business, and such 
other matters as justice and public safety may require. In adjudicating 
the claims and notices under the administrative procedures herein, 
additional information may be developed regarding those factors that may 
affect the final amount of the claim.
    (b) When assessing penalties for violations of notices and orders or 
settling claims based on these assessments, consideration will be given 
to good faith efforts to achieve compliance with the terms of the 
notices and orders.


<R05>
Sec. 386.82  Civil penalties for violations of notices and orders.

    (a) Additional civil penalties are chargeable for violations of 
notices and orders which are issued under civil forfeiture proceedings 
pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 521(b). These notices and orders are as follows:
    (1) Notice to abate--Sec. 386.11 (b)(2) and (c)(1)(iv);
    (2) Notice to post--Sec. 386.11(b)(3);
    (3) Final order--Sec. 386.14(f); and
    (4) Out-of-service order--Sec. 386.72(b)(3).
    (b) A schedule of these additional penalties is provided in the 
appendix A to this part. All the penalties are maximums, and discretion 
will be retained to meet special circumstances by setting penalties for 
violations of notices and orders, in some cases, at less than the 
maximum.
    (c) Claims for penalties provided in this section and in the 
appendix A to this part shall be made through the civil forfeiture 
proceedings contained in this part. The issues to be decided in such 
proceedings will be limited to whether violations of notices and orders 
occurred as claimed and the appropriate penalty for such violations. 
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to authorize the reopening 
of a matter already finally adjudicated under this part.

[[Page 611]]

used on a highway for transporting property, or any combination thereof.
Bodily Injury means injury to the body, sickness, or disease to any 
person, including death resulting from any of these.
Environmental Restoration means restitution for the loss, damage, or 
destruction of natural resources arising out of the accidental 
discharge, dispersal, release or escape into or upon the land, 
atmosphere, watercourse, or body of water, of any commodity transported 
by a motor carrier. This shall include the cost of removal and the cost 
of necessary measures taken to minimize or mitigate damage to human 
health, the natural environment, fish, shellfish, and wildlife.
Property Damage means damage to or loss of use of tangible property.
Public Liability means liability for bodily injury, property damage, and 
environmental restoration.

    The insurance policy to which this endorsement is attached provides 
automobile liability insurance and is amended to assure compliance by 
the insured, within the limits stated herein, as a motor carrier of 
property, with sections 29 and 30 of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 and 
the rules and regulations of the Federal Highway Administration and the 
Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).
    In consideration of the premium stated in the policy to which this 
endorsement is attached, the insurer (the company) agrees to pay, within 
the limits of liability described herein, any final judgment recovered 
against the insured for public liability resulting from negligence in 
the operation, maintenance or use of motor vehicles subject to the 
financial responsibility requirements of sections 29 and 30 of the Motor 
Carrier Act of 1980 regardless of whether or not each motor vehicle is 
specifically described in the policy and whether or not such negligence 
occurs on any route or in any territory authorized to be served by the 
insured or elsewhere. Such insurance as is afforded, for public 
liability, does not apply to injury to or death of the insured's 
employees while engaged in the course of their employment, or property 
transported by the insured, designated as cargo. It is understood and 
agreed that no condition, provision, stipulation, or limitation 
contained in the policy, this endorsement, or any other endorsement 
thereon, or violation thereof, shall relieve the company from liability 
or from the payment of any final judgment, within the limits of 
liability herein described, irrespective of the financial condition, 
insolvency or bankruptcy of the insured. However, all terms, conditions, 
and limitations in the policy to which the endorsement is attached shall 
remain in full force and effect as binding between the insured and the 
company. The insured agrees to reimburse the company for any payment 
made by the company on account of any accident, claim, or suit involving 
a breach of the terms of the policy, and for any payment that the 
company would not have been obligated to make under the provisions of 
the policy except for the agreement contained in this endorsement.
    It is further understood and agreed that, upon failure of the 
company to pay any final judgment recovered against the insured as 
provided herein, the judgment creditor may maintain an action in any 
court of competent jurisdiction against the company to compel such 
payment.
    The limits of the company's liability for the amounts prescribed in 
this endorsement apply separately to each accident and any payment under 
the policy because of any one accident shall not operate to reduce the 
liability of the company for the payment of final judgments resulting 
from any other accident.

    Purpose--This is an agreement between the Surety and the Principal 
under which the Surety, its successors and assigness, agree to be 
responsible for the payment of any final judgment or judgments against 
the Principal for public liability, property damage, and environmental 
restoration liability claims in the sums prescribed herein; subject to 
the governing provisions and the following conditions.
    Governing provisions--(1) Sections 29 and 30 of the Motor Carrier 
Act of 1980 (49 U.S.C. 10927 note).
    (2) Rules and regulations of the Federal Highway Administration.
    (3) Rules and regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission 
(ICC).
    Conditions--The Principal is or intends to become a motor carrier of 
property subject to the applicable governing provisions relating to 
financial responsibility for the protection of the public.
    This bond assures compliance by the Principal with the applicable 
governing provisions, and shall inure to the benefit of any person or 
persons who shall recover a final

[[Page 612]]

judgment or judgments against the Principal for public liability, 
property damage, or environmental restoration liability claims 
(excluding injury to or death of the Principal's employees while engaged 
in the course of their employment, and loss of or damange to property of 
the principal, and the cargo transported by the Principal). If every 
final judgment shall be paid for such claims resulting from the 
negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles in 
transportation subject to the applicable governing provisions, then this 
obligation shall be void, otherwise it will remain in full effect.
    Within the limits described herein, the Surety extends to such 
losses regardless of whether such motor vehicles are specifically 
described herein and whether occurring on the route or in the territory 
authorized to be served by the Principal or elsewhere.
    The liability of the Surety on each motor vehicle subject to the 
financial responsibility requirements of Section's 29 and 30 of the 
Motor Carrier Act of 1980 for each accident shall not exceed 
$__________, and shall be a continuing one notwithstanding any recovery 
hereunder.
    The surety agrees, upon telephone request by an authorized 
representative of the FHWA or the ICC, to verify that the surety bond is 
in force as of a particular date. The telephone number is: ____________
    This bond is effective from ______ (12:01 a.m., standard time, at 
the address of the Principal as stated herein) and shall countine in 
force until terminated as described herein. The principal or the Surety 
may at any time terminate this bond by giving (1) thirty five (35) days 
notice in writing to the other party (said 35 day notice to commence 
from the date the notice is mailed, proof of mailing shall be sufficient 
proof of notice), and (2) if the Principal is subject to the ICC's 
jurisdiction, by providing thirty (30) days notice to the ICC (said 30 
days notice to commence from the date notice is received by the ICC at 
its office in Washington, DC). The Surety shall not be liable for the 
payment of any judgment or judgments against the Principal for public 
liability, property damage, or environmental restoration claims 
resulting from accidents which occur after the termination of this bond 
as described herein, but such termination shall not affect the liability 
of the Surety for the payment of any such judgment or judgments 
resulting from accidents which occur during the time the bond is in 
effect.

device meets the identification and legibility requirements of this 
section, and such marking shall be maintained in such a manner as to 
remain legible as required by this section.
    (e) Rented commercial motor vehicles. A motor carrier operating a 
self-propelled commercial motor vehicle under a rental agreement having

    (i) The name or trade name of the lessor is displayed in accordance 
with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section;
    (ii) The city or community and State (name abbreviated), in which 
the lessor maintians its principal place of business or in which the

with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section;
    (iii) The lessor's identification number, issued by the FHWA, 
preceded by the letters ``USDOT'' is displayed in accordance with 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section; and
    (iv) The rental agreement entered into by the lessor and the renting 
motor carrier conspicuously contains the following information:

business of the renting motor carrier;
    (B) The identification number issued the renting motor carrier by 
the Federal Highway Administration, preceded by the letters ``USDOT,'' 
if the motor carrier has been issued such a number. In lieu of the 
identification number required in this paragraph, the following may be 
shown:
    (1) Information which will indicate if the motor carrier is engaged 
in ``interstate'' or ``intrastate'' commerce; and
    (2) Information which will indicate if the renting motor carrier is 
transporting hazardous materials in the rented commercial motor vehicle;

and local law enforcement officials nationwide to provide the identity 
of customers who operate this rental commercial motor vehicle;'' and
    (v) The rental agreement entered into by the lessor and the renting 
motor carrier is carried on the rental commercial motor vehicle during 
the full term of the rental agreement.

Sec. 390.23  Relief from regulations.

    (a) Parts 390 through 399 of this chapter shall not apply to any 
motor carrier or driver operating a commercial

[[Page 632]]

motor vehicle to provide emergency relief during an emergency, subject 
to the following time limits:
    (1) Regional emergencies. (i) The exemption provided by paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section is effective only when:
    (A) An emergency has been declared by the President of the United 
States, the Governor of a State, or their authorized representatives 
having authority to declare emergencies; or
    (B) The Regional Director of Motor Carriers has declared that a 
regional emergency exists which justifies an exemption from parts 390 
through 399 of this chapter.
    (ii) Except as provided in Sec. 390.25, this exemption shall not 
exceed the duration of the motor carrier's or driver's direct assistance 
in providing emergency relief, or 30 days from the date of the initial 
declaration of the emergency or the exemption from the regulations by 
the Regional Director of Motor Carriers, whichever is less.
    (2) Local emergencies. (i) The exemption provided by paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section is effective only when:
    (A) An emergency has been declared by a Federal, State or local 
government official having authority to declare an emergency; or
    (B) The Regional Director of Motor Carriers has declared that a 
local emergency exists which justifies an exemption from parts 390 
through 399 of this chapter.
    (ii) This exemption shall not exceed the duration of the motor 
carrier's or driver's direct assistance in providing emergency relief, 
or 5 days from the date of the initial declaration of the emergency or 
the exemption from the regulations by the Regional Director of Motor 
Carriers, whichever is less.
    (3) Tow trucks responding to emergencies. (i) The exemption provided 
by paragraph (a)(3) of this section is effective only when a request has 
been made by a Federal, State or local police officer for tow trucks to 
move wrecked or disabled motor vehicles.
    (ii) This exemption shall not exceed the length of the motor 
carrier's or driver's direct assistance in providing emergency relief, 
or 24 hours from the time of the initial request for assistance by the 
Federal, State or local police officer, whichever is less.
    (b) Upon termination of direct assistance to the regional or local 
emergency relief effort, the motor carrier or driver is subject to the 
requirements of parts 390 through 399 of this chapter, with the 
following exception: A driver may return empty to the motor carrier's 
terminal or the driver's normal work reporting location without 
complying with parts 390 through 399 of this chapter. However, a driver 
who informs the motor carrier that he or she needs immediate rest shall 
be permitted at least 8 consecutive hours off duty before the driver is 
required to return to such terminal or location. Having returned to the 
terminal or other location, the driver must be relieved of all duty and 
responsibilities. Direct assistance terminates when a driver or 
commercial motor vehicle is used in interstate commerce to transport 
cargo not destined for the emergency relief effort, or when the motor 
carrier dispatches such driver or commercial motor vehicle to another 
location to begin operations in commerce.
    (c) When the driver has been relieved of all duty and 
responsibilities upon termination of direct assistance to a regional or 
local emergency relief effort, no motor carrier shall permit or require 
any driver used by it to drive nor shall any such driver drive in 
commerce until:
    (1) The driver has met the requirements of Sec. 395.3(a) of this 
chapter; and
    (2) The driver has had at least 24 consecutive hours off-duty when:
    (A) The driver has been on duty for more than 60 hours in any 7 
consecutive days at the time the driver is relieved of all duty if the 
employing motor carrier does not operate every day in the week, or
    (B) The driver has been on duty for more than 70 hours in any 8 
consecutive days at the time the driver is relieved of all duty if the 
employing motor carrier operates every day in the week.

<R05>
Sec. 390.25  Extension of relief from regulations--emergencies.

    The Regional Director of Motor Carriers may extend the 30-day time 
period of the exemption contained in

[[Page 633]]

Sec. 390.23(a)(1), but not the 5-day time period contained in 
Sec. 390.23(a)(2) or the 24-hour period contained in Sec. 390.23(a)(3). 
Any motor carrier or driver seeking to extend the 30-day limit shall 
obtain approval from the Regional Director of Motor Carriers in the 
region in which the motor carrier's principal place of business is 
located before the expiration of the 30-day period. The motor carrier or 
driver shall give full details of the additional relief requested. The 
Regional Director of Motor Carriers shall determine if such relief is 
necessary taking into account both the severity of the ongoing emergency 
and the nature of the relief services to be provided by the carrier or 
driver. If the Regional Director of Motor Carriers approves an extension 
of the exemption, he or she shall establish a new time limit and place 
on the motor carrier or driver any other restrictions deemed necessary.

<R05>
Sec. 390.50  Applicability.

    The provisions of this subpart apply to any person tendering a 
loaded container or trailer which is transported by a motor carrier on a 
public highway in the United States and to carriers used to transport 
such containers or trailers. This subpart also applies to any person who 
coerces or attempts to coerce a motor carrier to transport a loaded 
container or trailer in violation of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 390.52  Definitions.

    In this subpart:
    Applicable State law means the vehicle weight laws, including 
overweight operating permit regulations, of each State in which 
intermodal transportation occurs or where an act of coercion allegedly 
occurs.
    Carrier means:
    (1) A motor carrier, water carrier, and rail carrier (as such terms 
are defined in 49 U.S.C. 10102), and
    (2) An ocean common carrier (as such term is defined in 46 U.S.C. 
app. 1702), providing transportation of property in commerce.
    Coerce or attempt to coerce means a threat to inflict physical harm 
or to withhold business from a person participating in intermodal 
transportation in order to induce that person to transport a loaded 
container or trailer in violation of the provisions of Sec. 390.56 or 
390.60.
    Container means an article of transport equipment:
    (1) Of a permanent character and accordingly strong enough to be 
suitable for repeated use;
    (2) Specially designed to facilitate the carriage of goods by one or 
more modes of transport, without intermediate reloading;
    (3) Fitted with devices permitting its ready handling, particular 
its transfer from one mode of transport to another;
    (4) So designed as to be easy to fill and empty; and
    (5) Having an internal volume of one cubic meter (35.3 cubic feet) 
or more.
    Initial carrier means the first carrier transporting in intermodal 
transportation a loaded container or trailer.
    Intermodal transportation means successive carriage of a loaded 
container or trailer from an origin point to a destination point by more 
than one type of carrier in interstate or foreign commerce. Such term 
shall include carriage by more than one mode of transportation in 
interstate or foreign commerce both under a single bill of lading and 
under separate bills of lading.
    Loaded container or trailer means a container or trailer in 
intermodal transportation with an actual gross cargo weight (inclusive 
of packing material and pallets) of more than 10,000 pounds or 4,536 
kilograms.
    Reasonable description means a representative statement that 
characterizes the cargo transported, such as, but not limited to, the 
term freight all kinds and other similar generic descriptions. A 
reasonable description shall identify a container or trailer loaded with 
perishable agricultural commodities. A reasonable description shall 
identify a container or trailer whose contents are likely to shift 
during intermodal transportation causing an uneven or concentrated 
weight distribution which may result in an axle weight violation during 
highway transportation. For the purposes of reasonable description, 
likely to shift means the contents of a container or trailer by the 
nature of its transportation characteristics has a high probability of 
moving within the container or trailer. Hazardous material shipping 
paper requirements (49 CFR part 172, subpart C) are not affected by this 
definition, and shipping papers must be prepared as required.
    Tender a loaded container or trailer means to present a loaded 
container or trailer to an initial carrier for intermodal 
transportation. A person who

[[Page 637]]

loads the container or trailer, including a person who consolidates 
multiple shipments, shall be considered to be the person tendering a 
loaded container or trailer unless some other appropriate party assumes 
that responsibility.
    Trailer means a nonpower, cargo carrying, trailing unit which is 
designed for use in combination with a truck tractor.


<R05>
Sec. 390.54  Notification and certification.

    (a) If the initial carrier is a motor carrier, before any person 
tenders a container or trailer subject to this subpart having a 
projected gross cargo weight (inclusive of packing material and pallets) 
of more than 10,000 pounds or 4,536 kilograms, such person shall notify 
the initial carrier of the projected gross cargo weight and a reasonable 
description of the contents of the container or trailer. The 
notification may be communicated by electronic transmission or 
telephone.
    (b) At or before the time any person tenders a loaded container or 
trailer subject to this subpart, such person shall provide a 
certification to the initial carrier.
    (1) If the initial carrier is a motor carrier, the certification 
shall be provided in a tangible form.
    (2) The certification may be transmitted electronically, provided 
that the certification can be reproduced in a tangible form.
    (3) A carrier, agent of a carrier, broker, customs broker, freight

to be tendering a loaded container or trailer unless such person loads 
the container or trailer or issues the certification on the basis of 
information available from the person who loads the container or 
trailer.
    (c) The certification shall include:
    (1) The title ``INTERMODAL CERTIFICATION'';
    (2) The identification number of the container or trailer;
    (3) The actual gross cargo weight, including the unit of 
measurement, of the contents of the container or trailer, including 
packing material and pallets;
    (4) A reasonable description of the contents;
    (5) The name and company of the person tendering the loaded 
container or trailer; and
    (6) The date.
    (d) Signature. The certification required by paragraph (c) of this 
section:
    (1) Must be legibly signed by the person or representative tendering 
the loaded container or trailer; and
    (2) May be legibly signed manually, by typewriter, or other 
mechanical means.
    (e) The required elements of a certification shall be legible and in 
the English language.
    (f) No person may provide false or erroneous information in a 
certification.
    (g) The following form may be used to comply with this section:

                        Intermodal Certification

Identification number:
Gross cargo weight:

Reasonable description:

(Name and company of the person tendering the loaded container or 
trailer)

(Signature of the person tendering the loaded container or trailer)

(Date)


<R05>
Sec. 390.56  Duty of motor carrier.

    (a) No motor carrier may provide transportation of a loaded 
container or trailer subject to this subpart prior to receiving the 
certification required by Sec. 390.54 in a tangible form.
    (b) The certification in a tangible form shall accompany the loaded 
container or trailer during transportation by a motor carrier.


<R05>
Sec. 390.58  Forwarding and retention of certification.

    (a) A carrier, agent of a carrier, broker, customs broker, freight 
forwarder, warehouseman, or terminal operator that receives the 
certification required by Sec. 390.54 in the course of intermodal 
transportation shall forward the certification to a subsequent carrier 
transporting the loaded container or trailer.
    (1) If received in a tangible form, the certification may be 
converted into an electronic format.

[[Page 638]]

    (2) If received as a separate document, the certification may be 
incorporated into a shipping document corresponding to the loaded 
container or trailer.
    (3) The person who converts a certification into an electronic 
format and/or incorporates a certification into a shipping document 
corresponding to the loaded container or trailer shall state in writing 
that the conversion and/or incorporation was performed accurately. Such 
statement shall take the following form: ``Electronic Format and/or 
Incorporation by John Doe, X Company, Month/Day/Year.'' Such statement 
shall appear immediately after the certification of the person tendering 
the loaded container or trailer.
    (b) The certification may be forwarded by electronic transmission 
provided that all subsequent motor carriers receive the certification in 
a tangible form.
    (c) The forwarding of any certification required or statement 
authorized by this section does not constitute a verification or 
affirmation of the accuracy or completeness of the certification or 
statement.
    (d) Any person who tenders a loaded container or trailer that is 
transported by a motor carrier, and each motor carrier transporting a 
loaded container or trailer shall maintain a copy of the certification 
for a period of one year from the date of the tendering. Certifications 
may be maintained electronically if the certification can be reproduced 
in a tangible form.


<R05>
Sec. 390.60  Coercion.

    (a) No person may coerce or attempt to coerce a person to transport 
a loaded container or trailer subject to this subpart without the 
certification required by Sec. 390.54.
    (b) No person, knowing that the weight of a tractor-trailer 
combination which includes a loaded container or trailer is in excess of 
that permitted by applicable State law, may coerce or attempt to coerce 
a motor carrier or driver in violation of such law--
    (1) To transport the loaded container or trailer; or
    (2) To operate the tractor-trailer combination.
    (c) Exception. This section does not apply to a carrier transferring 
a loaded container or trailer to another carrier in the course of 
intermodal transportation. This exception does not apply if the 
transferring carrier is also the person tendering the loaded container 
or trailer.

     Instructions for Performing and Recording Physical Examinations

    The examining medical examiner should review these instructions 
before performing the physical examination. Answer each question yes or 
no where appropriate.
    The examining medical examiner should be aware of the rigorous 
physical demands and mental and emotional responsibilities placed on the 
driver of a commercial motor vehicle. In the interest of public safety 
the examining medical examiner is required to certify that the driver 
does not have any physical, mental, or organic defect of such a nature 
as to affect the driver's ability to operate safely a commercial motor 
vehicle.
    General information. The purpose of this history and physical 
examination is to detect the presence of physical, mental, or organic 
defects of such a character and extent as to affect the applicant's 
ability to operate a commercial motor vehicle safely. The examination 
should be made carefully and at least as complete as indicated by the 
attached form. History of certain defects may be cause for rejection or 
indicate the need for making certain laboratory tests or a further, and 
more stringent, examination. Defects may be recorded which do not, 
because of their character or degree, indicate that certification of 
physical fitness should be denied. However, these defects should be 
discussed with the applicant and he/she should be advised to take the 
necessary steps to insure correction, particularly of those which, if 
neglected, might lead to a condition likely to affect his/her ability to 
drive safely.
    General appearance and development. Note marked overweight. Note any 
posture defect, perceptible limp, tremor, or other defects that might be 
caused by alcoholism, thyroid intoxication, or other illnesses. The 
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations provide that no driver shall 
use a narcotic or other habit-forming drugs.
    Head-eyes. When other than the Snellen chart is used, the results of 
such test must be expressed in values comparable to the standard Snellen 
test. If the applicant wears corrective lenses, these should be worn 
while applicant's visual acuity is being tested. If appropriate, 
indicate on the Medical Examiner's Certificate by checking the box, 
``Qualified only when wearing corrective lenses.'' In recording distance 
vision use 20 feet as normal. Report all vision as a fraction with 20 as 
numerator and the smallest type read at 20 feet as denominator. Note 
ptosis, discharge, visual fields, ocular muscle imbalance, color 
blindness, corneal scar, exophtalmos, or strabismus, uncorrected by 
corrective lenses. Monocular drivers are not qualified to operate 
commercial motor vehicles under existing Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Regulations. If the driver habitually wears contact lenses, or intends 
to do so while driving, there should be sufficient evidence to indicate 
that he/she has good tolerance is well adapted to their use. The use of 
contact lenses should be noted on the record.
    Ears. Note evidence of mastoid or middle ear disease, discharge, 
symptoms of aural vertigo, or Meniere's Syndrome. When recording 
hearing, record distance from patient at which a forced whispered voice 
can first be heard. If audiometer is used to test hearing, record 
decibel loss at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz, and 2,000 Hz.
    Throat. Note evidence of disease, irremediable deformities of the 
throat likely to interfere with eating or breathing, or any laryngeal 
condition which could interfere with the safe operation of a commercial 
motor vehicle.
    Thorax-heart. Stethoscopic examination is required. Note murmurs and 
arrhythmias, and any past or present history of cardiovascular disease, 
of a variety known to be accompanied by syncope, dyspnea, collapse, 
enlarged heart, or congestive heart failures. Electrocardiogram is 
required when findings so indicate.
    Blood pressure. Record with either spring or mercury column type of 
sphygomomanometer. If the blood pressure is consistently above 160/90 
mm. Hg., further tests may be necessary to determine whether the driver 
is qualified to operate a commercial motor vehicle.
    Lungs. If any lung disease is detected, state whether active or 
arrested; if arrested, your opinion as to how long it has been 
quiescent.
    Gastrointestinal system. Note any diseases of the gastrointestinal 
system.
    Abdomen. Note wounds, injuries, scars, or weakness of muscles of 
abdominal walls sufficient to interfere with normal function. Any hernia 
should be noted if present. State how long and if adequately contained 
by truss.
    Abnormal masses. If present, note location, if tender, and whether 
or not applicant knows how long they have been present. If the diagnosis 
suggests that the condition might interfere with the control and safe 
operation of a commercial motor vehicle, more stringent tests must be 
made before the applicant can be certified.
    Tenderness. When noted, state where most pronounced, and suspected 
cause. If the diagnosis suggests that the condition might interfere with 
the control and safe operation of a commercial motor vehicle, more 
stringent tests must be made before the applicant can be certified.
    Genito-urinary. Urinalysis is required. Acute infections of the 
genito-urinary tract, as defined by local and State public health laws, 
indications from urinalysis of uncontrolled diabetes, symptomatic 
albumin-urea in the urine, or other findings indicative of health 
conditions likely to interfere with the control and safe operation of a 
commercial

[[Page 648]]

motor vehicle, will disqualify an applicant from operating a motor 
vehicle.
    Neurological. If positive Romberg is reported, indicate degrees of 
impairment. Pupillary reflexes should be reported for both light and 
accommodation. Knee jerks are to be reported absent only when not 
obtainable upon reinforcement and as increased when foot is actually 
lifted from the floor following a light blow on the patella, sensory 
vibratory and positional abnormalities should be noted.
    Extremities. Carefully examine upper and lower extremities. Record 
the loss of impairment of a leg, foot, toe, arm, hand, or fingers. Note 
any and all deformities, the presence of atrophy, semiparalysis or 
paralysis, or varicose veins. If a hand or finger deformity exists, 
determine whether sufficient grasp is present to enable the driver to 
secure and maintain a grip on the steering wheel. If a leg deformity 
exists, determine whether sufficient mobility and strength exist to 
enable the driver to operate pedals properly. Particular attention 
should be given to and a record should be made of, any impairment or 
structural defect which may interfere with the driver's ability to 
operate a commercial motor vehicle safely.
    Spine. Note deformities, limitation of motion, or any history of 
pain, injuries, or disease, past or presently experienced in the 
cervical or lumbar spine region. If findings so dictate, radiologic and 
other examinations should be used to diagnose congenital or acquired 
defects; or spondylolisthesis and scoliosis.
    Recto-genital studies. Diseases or conditions causing discomfort 
should be evaluated carefully to determine the extent to which the 
condition might be handicapping while lifting, pulling, or during 
periods of prolonged driving that might be necessary as part of the 
driver's duties.
    Laboratory and other special findings. Urinalysis is required, as 
well as such other tests as the medical history or findings upon 
physical examination may indicate are necessary. A serological test is 
required if the applicant has a history of luetic infection or present 
physical findings indicate the possibility of latent syphilis. Other 
studies deemed advisable may be ordered by the examining medical 
examiner.
    Diabetes. If insulin is necessary to control a diabetic condition, 
the driver is not qualified to operate a commercial motor vehicle. If 
mild diabetes is noted at the time of examination and it is stabilized 
by use of a hypoglycemic drug and a diet that can be obtained while the 
driver is on duty, it should not be considered disqualifying. However, 
the driver must remain under adequate medical supervision.
    Controlled Substances Testing. If a test for controlled substances 
is performed as part of the medical examination, the medical examiner is 
to check the box next to the statement, ``Controlled substances test 
performed'' on the medical examination form. If a test for controlled 
substances is not performed, the medical examiner is to check the box 
next to the statement, ``Controlled substances test not performed.'' If 
a controlled substances test is performed under the requirements of 
subpart H of this part, then the medical examiner must also check the 
box next to the statement, ``in accordance with subpart H,'' and must 
obtain information that the results of such test were negative prior to 
certifying that the driver is otherwise medically qualified. If a 
controlled substance test is performed but not in accordance with 
subpart H, the medical examiner must also check the box next to the 
statement, ``not in accordance with subpart H,'' and ensure that the 
results of the test were negative prior to certifying that the driver is 
otherwise medically qualified.
    The medical examiner must date and sign his/her findings upon 
completion of the examination.

vehicles equipped with vacuum brakes, shall have, in addition to the 
single control required by Sec. 393.49 to operate all brakes of the 
combination, a second manual control device which can be used to operate 
the brakes on the towed vehicles in emergencies. Such second control 
shall be independent of brake air, hydraulic, and other pressure, and 
independent of other controls, unless the braking system be so arranged 
that failure of the pressure on which the second control depends will 
cause the towed vehicle brakes to be applied automatically. The second 
control is not required by this rule to provide modulated or graduated 
braking.
    (d) Every trailer required to be equipped with brakes shall be 
equipped with brakes of such character as to be applied automatically 
and promptly upon breakaway from the towing vehicle, and means shall be 
provided to maintain application of the brakes on the trailer in such 
case for at least 15 minutes.
    (e) Air brake systems installed on towed vehicles shall be so 
designed, by the use of ``no-bleed-back'' relay emergency valves or 
equivalent devices, that the supply reservoir used to provide air for 
brakes shall be safeguarded against backflow of air to the towing 
vehicle upon reduction of the towing vehicle air pressure.
    (f) The requirements of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section 
shall not be applicable to motor vehicles in driveaway-towaway 
operations.

Sec. 393.48   Brakes to be operative.

    (a) General rule. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section, all brakes with which a motor vehicle is equipped must at 
all times be capable of operating.
    (b) Devices to reduce or remove front-wheel braking effort. A motor 
vehicle may be equipped with a device to reduce the braking effort upon 
its front wheels or, in the case of a three-axle truck or truck tractor 
manufactured before March 1, 1975, to remove the braking effort upon its 
front wheels, if that device conforms to, and is used in compliance 
with, the rules in paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) Manually operated devices. A manually operated device to reduce 
or remove the front-wheel braking effort must not be--
    (i) Installed in a motor vehicle other than a bus, truck, or truck 
tractor; or
    (ii) Installed in a bus, truck, or truck tractor manufactured after 
February 28, 1975; or
    (iii) Used in the reduced mode except when the vehicle is operating 
under adverse conditions such as wet, snowy, or icy roads.
    (2) Automatic devices. An automatic device to reduce the front-wheel 
braking effort by up to 50 percent of the normal braking force, 
regardless of whether or not antilock system failure has occurred on any 
axle, must not--
    (i) Be operable by the driver except upon application of the control 
that activates the braking system; and
    (ii) Be operable when the pressure that transmits brake control 
application force exceeds--
    (A) 85 psig on air-mechanical braking systems; or
    (B) 85 percent of the maximum system pressure in the case of 
vehicles utilizing other than compressed air.
    (c) Towed vehicle. Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to--
    (1) A disabled vehicle being towed; or
    (2) A vehicle being towed in a driveaway-towaway operation which is 
exempt from the general rule of Sec. 393.42 under paragraph (b) of that

Sec. 393.49   Single valve to operate all brakes.

    Every motor vehicle, the date of manufacture of which is subsequent 
to June 30, 1953, which is equipped with power brakes, shall have the 
braking system so arranged that one application valve shall when applied 
operate all the service brakes on the motor vehicle or combination of 
motor vehicles. This requirement shall not be construed to prohibit 
motor vehicles from being equipped with an additional valve to be used 
to operate the brakes on a trailer or trailers or as provided in 
Sec. 393.44. This section shall not be applicable to driveaway-towaway 
operations unless the brakes on such operations are designed to be 
operated by a single valve.


<R05>
Sec. 393.50   Reservoirs required.

    (a) General. Every commercial motor vehicle using air or vacuum for 
breaking shall be equipped with reserve capacity or a reservoir 
sufficient to ensure a full service brake application with the engine 
stopped without depleting the air pressure or vacuum below 70 percent of 
that pressure or degree of vacuum indicated by the gauge

[[Page 708]]

immediately before the brake application is made. For purposes of this 
section, a full service brake application is considered to be made when 
the service brake pedal is pushed to the limit of its travel.
    (b) Safeguarding of air and vacuum. (1) Every bus, truck, and truck 
tractor, when equipped with air or vacuum reservoirs and regardless of 
date of manufacture, shall have such reservoirs so safeguarded by a 
check valve or equivalent device that in the event of failure or leakage 
in its connection to the source of compressed air or vacuum the air or 
vacuum supply in the reservoir shall not be depleted by the leak or 
failure.
    (2) Means shall be provided to establish the check valve to be in 
working order. On and after May 1, 1966, means other than loosening or 
disconnection of any connection between the source of compressed air or 
vacuum and the check valve, and necessary tools for operation of such 
means, shall be provided to prove that the check valve is in working 
order. The means shall be readily accessible either from the front, 
side, or rear of the vehicle, or from the driver's compartment.
    (i) In air brake systems with one reservoir, the means shall be a 
cock, valve, plug, or equivalent device arranged to vent a cavity having 
free communication with the connection between the check valve and the 
source of compressed air or vacuum.
    (ii) Where air is delivered by a compressor into one tank or 
compartment (wet tank), and air for braking is taken directly from 
another tank or compartment (dry tank) only, with the required check 
valve between the tanks or compartments, a manually operated drain cock 
on the first (wet) tank or compartment will serve as a means herein 
required if it conforms to the requirements herein.
    (iii) In vacuum systems stopping the engine will serve as the 
required means, the system remaining evacuated as indicated by the 
vacuum gauge.

brakes in the event of a hydraulic-type complete failure of a partial 
system. The signal must be readily audible or visible to the driver.
    (c) Air brakes. A vehicle (regardless of the date it was 
manufactured) having service brakes activated by compressed air (air-
mechanical brakes) or a vehicle towing a vehicle having service brakes 
activated by compressed air (air-mechanical brakes) must be equipped, 
and perform, as follows:
    (1) The vehicle must have a low air pressure warning device that 
conforms to the requirements of either paragraph (c)(1) (i) or (ii) of 
this section.
    (i) If Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 121 (Sec. 571.121 
of this title) was applicable to the vehicle at the time it was

continuous warning to the driver whenever the pressure of the compressed 
air in the braking system is below a specified pressure, which must be 
at least one-half of the compressor governor cutout pressure.
    (2) The vehicle must have a pressure gauge which indicates to the 
driver the pressure in pounds per square inch available for braking.

[[Page 709]]

    (d) Vacuum brakes. A vehicle (regardless of the date it was 
manufactured) having service brakes activated by vacuum or a vehicle 
towing a vehicle having service brakes activated by vacuum must be 
equipped with--
    (1) A device that provides a readily audible or visible continuous 
warning to the driver whenever the vacuum in the vehicle's supply 
reservoir is less than 8 inches of mercury; and
    (2) A vacuum gauge which indicates to the driver the vacuum in 
inches of mercury available for braking.
    (e) Hydraulic brakes applied or assisted by air or vacuum. A vehicle 
having a braking system in which hydraulically activated service brakes 
are applied or assisted by compressed air or vacuum must be equipped 
with both a warning signal that conforms to the requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section and a warning device that conforms to the 
requirements of either paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) of this section.
    (f) Maintenance. The warning signals, devices, and gauges required 
by this section must be maintained in operative condition.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: (a) There is a definite mathematical relationship between the figures in columns 2 and 3. If the          
  decelerations set forth in column 3 are divided by 32.2 feet per second per second, the figures in column 2   
  will be obtained. (For example, 21 divided by 32.2 equals 65.2 percent.) Column 2 is included in the          
  tabulation because certain brake-testing devices utilize this factor.                                         
(b) The decelerations specified in column 3 are an indication of the effectiveness of the basic brakes, and as  
  measured in practical brake testing are the maximum decelerations attained at some time during the stop. These
  decelerations as measured in brake tests cannot be used to compute the values in column 4 because the         
  deceleration is not sustained at the same rate over the entire period of the stop. The deceleration increases 
  from zero to a maximum during a period of brake-system application and brake-force buildup. Also, other       
  factors may cause the deceleration to decrease after reaching a maximum. The added distance which results     
  because maximum deceleration is not sustained is included in the figures in column 4 but is not indicated by  
  the usual brake-testing devices for checking deceleration.                                                    
(c) The distances in column 4 and the decelerations in column 3 are not directly related. ``Brake-system        
  application and braking distance in feet'' (column 4) is a definite measure of the overall effectiveness of   
  the braking system, being the distance traveled between the point at which the driver starts to move the      
  braking controls and the point at which the vehicle comes to rest. It includes distance traveled while the    
  brakes are being applied and distance traveled while the brakes are retarding the vehicle.                    
(d) The distance traveled during the period of brake-system application and brake-force buildup varies with     
  vehicle type, being negligible for many passenger cars and greatest for combinations of commercial vehicles.  
  This fact accounts for the variation from 20 to 40 feet in the values in column 4 for the various classes of  
  vehicles.                                                                                                     
(e) The terms ``GVWR'' and ``GVW'' refer to the manufacturer's gross vehicle rating and the actual gross vehicle
  weight, respectively.

commercial motor vehicle which was not subject to this section or 49 CFR 
571.301 at the time of its manufacture, provided the fuel tank of such 
vehicle is maintained to the original manufacturer's standards.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this section--
    (1) The term liquid fuel tank means a fuel tank designed to contain 
a fuel that is liquid at normal atmospheric pressures and temperatures.
    (2) A side-mounted fuel tank is a liquid fuel tank which--
    (i) If mounted on a truck tractor, extends outboard of the vehicle 
frame and outside of the plan view outline of the cab; or
    (ii) If mounted on a truck, extends outboard of a line parallel to 
the longitudinal centerline of the truck and tangent to the outboard 
side of a front tire in a straight ahead position. In determining 
whether a fuel tank on a truck or truck tractor is side-mounted, the

[[Page 714]]

fill pipe is not considered a part of the tank.
    (c) Construction of liquid fuel tanks--(1) Joints. Joints of a fuel 
tank body must be closed by arc-, gas-, seam-, or spot-welding, by 
brazing, by silver soldering, or by techniques which provide heat 
resistance and mechanical securement at least equal to those 
specifically named. Joints must not be closed solely by crimping or by 
soldering with a lead-based or other soft solder.
    (2) Fittings. The fuel tank body must have flanges or spuds suitable 
for the installation of all fittings.
    (3) Threads. The threads of all fittings must be Dryseal American 
Standard Taper Pipe Thread or Dryseal SAE Short Taper Pipe Thread, 
specified in Society of Automotive Engineers Standard J476, as contained 
in the 1971 edition of the ``SAE Handbook,'' except that straight 
(nontapered) threads may be used on fittings having integral flanges and 
using gaskets for sealing. At least four full threads must be in 
engagement in each fitting.
    (4) Drains and bottom fittings. (i) Drains or other bottom fittings 
must not extend more than three-fourths of an inch below the lowest part 
of the fuel tank or sump.
    (ii) Drains or other bottom fittings must be protected against 
damage from impact.
    (iii) If a fuel tank has drains the drain fittings must permit 
substantially complete drainage of the tank.
    (iv) Drains or other bottom fittings must be installed in a flange 
or spud designed to accommodate it.
    (5) Fuel withdrawal fittings. Except for diesel fuel tanks, the 
fittings through which fuel is withdrawn from a fuel tank must be 
located above the normal level of fuel in the tank when the tank is 
full.
    (6) [Reserved]
    (7) Fill pipe. (i) Each fill pipe must be designed and constructed 
to minimize the risk of fuel spillage during fueling operations and when 
the vehicle is involved in a crash.
    (ii) The fill pipe and vents of a fuel tank having a capacity of 
more than 25 gallons of fuel must permit filling the tank with fuel at a 
rate of at least 20 gallons per minute without fuel spillage.
    (iii) Each fill pipe must be fitted with a cap that can be fastened 
securely over the opening in the fill pipe. Screw threads or a bayonet-
type joint are methods of conforming to the requirements of this 
subdivision.
    (8) Safety venting system. A liquid fuel tank with a capacity of 
more than 25 gallons of fuel must have a venting system which, in the 
event the tank is subjected to fire, will prevent internal tank pressure 
from rupturing the tank's body, seams, or bottom opening (if any).
    (9) Pressure resistance. The body and fittings of a liquid fuel tank 
with a capacity of more than 25 gallons of fuel must be capable of 
withstanding an internal hydrostatic pressure equal to 150 percent of 
the maximum internal pressure reached in the tank during the safety 
venting systems test specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (10) Air vent. Each fuel tank must be equipped with a nonspill air 
vent (such as a ball check). The air vent may be combined with the fill-
pipe cap or safety vent, or it may be a separate unit installed on the 
fuel tank.
    (11) Markings. If the body of a fuel tank is readily visible when 
the tank is installed on the vehicle, the tank must be plainly marked 
with its liquid capacity. The tank must also be plainly marked with a 
warning against filling it to more than 95 percent of its liquid 
capacity.
    (12) Overfill restriction. A liquid fuel tank manufactured on or 
after January 1, 1973, must be designed and constructed so that--
    (i) The tank cannot be filled, in a normal filling operation, with a 
quantity of fuel that exceeds 95 percent of the tank's liquid capacity; 
and
    (ii) When the tank is filled, normal expansion of the fuel will not 
cause fuel spillage.
    (d) Liquid fuel tank tests. Each liquid fuel tank must be capable of 
passing the tests specified in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this 
section. \1\
    (1) Safety venting system test--(i) Procedure. Fill the tank three-
fourths full with fuel, seal the fuel feed outlet, and invert the tank. 
When the fuel temperature is between 50 deg. F. and 80 deg. F., apply an 
enveloping flame to the tank so that the temperature of the fuel

[[Page 715]]

rises at a rate of not less than 6 deg. F. and not more than 8 deg. F. 
per minute.
    (ii) Required performance. The safety venting system required by 
paragraph (c)(8) of this section must activate before the internal 
pressure in the tank exceeds 50 pounds per square inch, gauge, and the 
internal pressure must not thereafter exceed the pressure at which the 
system activated by more than five pounds per square inch despite any 
further increase in the temperature of the fuel.
    (2) Leakage test--(i) Procedure. Fill the tank to capacity with fuel 
having a temperature between 50 deg. F. and 80 deg. F. With the fill-
pipe cap installed, turn the tank through an angle of 150 deg. in any 
direction about any axis from its normal position.
    (ii) Required performance. Neither the tank nor any fitting may leak 
more than a total of one ounce by weight of fuel per minute in any 
position the tank assumes during the test.
    (e) Side-mounted liquid fuel tank tests. Each side-mounted liquid 
fuel tank must be capable of passing the tests specified in paragraphs 
(e) (1) and (2) of this section and the tests specified in paragraphs 
(d) (1) and (2) of this section. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The specified tests are a measure of performance only. 
Manufacturers and carriers may use any alternative procedures which 
assure that their equipment meets the required performance criteria.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Drop test--(i) Procedure. Fill the tank with a quantity of water 
having a weight equal to the weight of the maximum fuel load of the tank 
and drop the tank 30 feet onto an unyielding surface so that it lands 
squarely on one corner.
    (ii) Required performance. Neither the tank nor any fitting may leak 
more than a total of 1 ounce by weight of water per minute.
    (2) Fill-pipe test--(i) Procedure. Fill the tank with a quantity of

             Subpart F--Coupling Devices and Towing Methods


<R05>
Sec. 393.70   Coupling devices and towing methods, except for driveaway-towaway operations.

    (a) Tracking. When two or more vehicles are operated in combination, 
the coupling devices connecting the vehicles shall be designed, 
constructed, and installed, and the vehicles shall be designed and 
constructed, so that when the combination is operated in a straight line 
on a level, smooth, paved surface, the path of the towed vehicle will 
not deviate more than 3 inches to either side of the path of the vehicle 
that tows it.
    (b) Fifth wheel assemblies--(1) Mounting--(i) Lower half. The lower 
half of a fifth wheel mounted on a truck tractor or converter dolly must 
be secured to the frame of that vehicle with properly designed brackets, 
mounting plates or angles and properly tightened bolts of adequate size 
and grade, or devices that provide equivalent security. The installation 
shall not cause cracking, warping, or deformation of the frame. The 
installation must include a device for positively preventing the lower 
half of the fifth wheel from shifting on the frame to which it is 
attached.
    (ii) Upper half. The upper half of a fifth wheel must be fastened to 
the motor vehicle with at least the same security required for the 
installation of the lower half on a truck tractor or converter dolly.
    (2) Locking. Every fifth wheel assembly must have a locking 
mechanism. The locking mechanism, and any adapter used in conjunction 
with it, must prevent separation of the upper and lower halves of the 
fifth wheel assembly unless a positive manual release is activated. The 
release may be located so that the driver can operate it from the cab. 
If a motor vehicle has a fifth wheel designed and constructed to be 
readily separable, the fifth wheel locking devices shall apply 
automatically on coupling.
    (3) Location. The lower half of a fifth wheel shall be located so 
that, regardless of the condition of loading, the relationship between 
the kingpin and the rear axle or axles of the towing motor vehicle will 
properly distribute the gross weight of both the towed and towing 
vehicles on the axles of those vehicles, will not unduly interfere with 
the steering, braking, and other maneuvering of the towing vehicle, and 
will not otherwise contribute to unsafe operation of the vehicles 
comprising the combination. The upper half of a fifth wheel shall be 
located so that the weight of the vehicles is properly distributed on 
their axles and the combination of vehicles will operate safely during 
normal operation.
    (c) Towing of full trailers. A full trailer must be equipped with a 
tow-bar and a means of attaching the tow-bar to the towing and towed 
vehicles. The tow-bar and the means of attaching it must--
    (1) Be structurally adequate for the weight being drawn;
    (2) Be properly and securely mounted;
    (3) Provide for adequate articulation at the connection without 
excessive slack at that location; and
    (4) Be provided with a locking device that prevents accidental 
separation of the towed and towing vehicles. The mounting of the trailer 
hitch (pintle hook or equivalent mechanism) on the towing vehicle must 
include reinforcement or bracing of the frame sufficient

[[Page 717]]

to produce strength and rigidity of the frame to prevent its undue 
distortion.
    (d) Safety devices in case of tow-bar failure or disconnection. 
Every full trailer and every converter dolly used to convert a 
semitrailer to a full trailer must be coupled to the frame, or an 
extension of the frame, of the motor vehicle which tows it with one or 
more safety devices to prevent the towed vehicle from breaking loose in 
the event the tow-bar fails or becomes disconnected. The safety device 
must meet the following requirements:
    (1) The safety device must not be attached to the pintle hook or any 
other device on the towing vehicle to which the tow-bar is attached. 
However, if the pintle hook or other device was manufactured prior to 
July 1, 1973, the safety device may be attached to the towing vehicle at 
a place on a pintle hook forging or casting if that place is independent 
of the pintle hook.
    (2) The safety device must have no more slack than is necessary to 
permit the vehicles to be turned properly.
    (3) The safety device, and the means of attaching it to the 
vehicles, must have an ultimate strength of not less than the gross 
weight of the vehicle or vehicles being towed.
    (4) The safety device must be connected to the towed and towing 
vehicles and to the tow-bar in a manner which prevents the tow-bar from 
dropping to the ground in the event it fails or becomes disconnected.
    (5) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, if the 
safety device consists of safety chains or cables, the towed vehicle 
must be equipped with either two safety chains or cables or with a 
bridle arrangement of a single chain or cable attached to its frame or 
axle at two points as far apart as the configuration of the frame or 
axle permits. The safety chains or cables shall be either two separate 
pieces, each equipped with a hook or other means for attachment to the 
towing vehicle, or a single piece leading along each side of the tow-bar 
from the two points of attachment on the towed vehicle and arranged into 
a bridle with a single means of attachment to be connected to the towing 
vehicle. When a single length of cable is used, a thimble and twin-base 
cable clamps shall be used to form the forward bridle eye. The hook or 
other means of attachment to the towing vehicle shall be secured to the 
chains or cables in a fixed position.
    (6) If the towed vehicle is a converter dolly with a solid tongue 
and without a hinged tow-bar or other swivel between the fifth wheel 
mounting and the attachment point of the tongue eye or other hitch 
device--
    (i) Safety chains or cables, when used as the safety device for that 
vehicle, may consist of either two chains or cables or a single chain or 
cable used alone;
    (ii) A single safety device, including a single chain or cable used 
alone as the safety device, must be in line with the centerline of the 
trailer tongue; and
    (iii) The device may be attached to the converter dolly at any point 
to the rear of the attachment point of the tongue eye or other hitch 
device.
    (7) Safety devices other than safety chains or cables must provide 
strength, security of attachment, and directional stability equal to, or 
greater than, safety chains or cables installed in accordance with 
paragraphs (d) (5) and (6) of this section.
    (8) When two safety devices, including two safety chains or cables, 
are used and are attached to the towing vehicle at separate points, the 
points of attachment on the towing vehicle shall be located equally 
distant from, and on opposite sides of, the centerline of the towing 
vehicle. Where two chains or cables are attached to the same point on 
the towing vehicle, and where a bridle or a single chain or cable is 
used, the point of attachment must be on the longitudinal centerline of 
the towing vehicle. A single safety device, other than a chain or cable, 
must also be attached to the towing vehicle at a point on its 
longitudinal centerline.

be full-mounted on the structure of towed vehicles engaged in any 
driveaway-towaway operation.
    (2) No motor vehicle shall be full-mounted on a motor vehicle towed 
by means of a tow-bar unless the towed vehicle is equipped with brakes 
and is provided with means for effective application of brakes acting on 
all wheels and is towed on its own wheels.
    (3) No motor vehicle or motor vehicles shall be full-mounted on a 
motor vehicle towed by means of a saddle-mount unless the center line of 
the kingpin or equivalent means of attachment of such towed vehicle 
shall be so located on the towing vehicle that the relationship to the 
rear axle or axles results in proper distribution of the total gross 
weight of the vehicles and does not unduly interfere with the steering, 
braking, or maneuvering of the towing vehicle or otherwise contribute to 
the unsafe operation of vehicles comprising the combination; and unless 
a perpendicular to the ground from the center of gravity of the full-
mounted vehicles lies forward of the center line of the rear axle of the 
saddle-mounted vehicle.

\1\The required strength of tow-bars for towed vehicles of 15,000 pounds
  and over gross weight and of new tow-bars acquired and used after     
  Sept. 30, 1948, for towed vehicles of 5,000 pounds and over gross     
  weight shall be computed by means of the following formulae:          
  Longitudinal strength=gross weight of towed vehicle x 1.3. Strength as
  a beam=gross weight of towed vehicle x 0.6.                           
\2\In testing, the whole unit shall be tested with all clamps, joints,  
  and pins so mounted and fastened as to approximate conditions of      
  actual operation.                                                     
\3\This test shall be applicable only to tow-bars which are, in normal  
  operation, subjected to a bending movement such as tow-bars for house 
  trailers.                                                             

    (2) Tow-bars, jointed. The tow-bar shall be so constructed as to 
freely permit motion in both horizontal and vertical planes between the 
towed and towing vehicles. The means used to provide the motion shall be 
such as to prohibit the transmission of stresses under normal operation 
between the towed and towing vehicles, except along the longitudinal 
axis of the tongue or tongues.
    (3) Tow-bar fastenings. The means used to transmit the stresses to 
the chassis or frames of the towed and towing vehicles may be either 
temporary structures or bumpers or other integral parts of the vehicles: 
Provided, however, That the means used shall be so constructed, 
installed, and maintained that when tested as an assembly, failure in 
such members shall not occur when the weakest new tow-bar which is 
permissible under paragraph (h)(1) of this section is subjected to the 
tests given therein.
    (4) Means of adjusting length. On tow-bars, adjustable as to length, 
the means used to make such adjustment shall fit tightly and not result 
in any slackness or permit the tow-bar to bend. With the tow-bar 
supported rigidly at both ends and with a load of 50 pounds at the 
center, the sag, measured at the center, in any direction shall not 
exceed 0.25 inch under any condition of adjustment as to length.
    (5) Method of clamping. Adequate means shall be provided for 
securely fastening the tow-bar to the towed and towing vehicles.
    (6) Tow-bar connection to steering mechanism. The tow-bar shall be 
provided with suitable means of attachment to and actuation of the 
steering mechanism, if any, of the towed vehicle. The attachment shall 
provide for sufficient angularity of movement of the front wheels of the 
towed vehicle so that it may follow substantially in the path of the 
towing vehicle without cramping the tow-bar. The tow-bar shall be 
provided with suitable joints to permit such movement.
    (7) Tracking. The tow-bar shall be so designed, constructed, 
maintained, and mounted as to cause the towed vehicle to follow 
substantially in the path of the towing vehicle. Tow-bars of such design 
on in our condition as to permit the towed vehicle to deviate more than 
3 inches to either side of the path of a towing vehicle moving in a 
straight line as measured from the center of the towing vehicle are 
prohibited.
    (8) Passenger car-trailer type couplings. Trailer couplings used for 
driveaway-towaway operations of passenger car trailers shall conform to 
Society of Automotive Engineers Standard No. J684c, ``Trailer Couplings 
and Hitches--Automotive Type,'' July 1970.<SUP>1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1 See footnote 1 to Sec. 393.24(c).

    (9) Marking tow-bars. Every tow-bar acquired and used in driveaway-
towaway operations by a motor carrier shall be plainly marked with the 
following certification of the manufacturer thereof (or words of 
equivalent meaning):

    This tow-bar complies with the requirements of the Federal Highway 
Administration for (maximum gross weight for which tow-bar is 
manufactured) vehicles.
Allowable Maximum Gross Weight__________________________________________

    (10) Safety devices in case of tow-bar failure or disconnection. (i) 
The towed vehicle shall be connected to the towing vehicle by a safety 
device to prevent the towed vehicle from breaking loose in the event the 
tow-bar fails or becomes disconnected. When safety chains or cables are 
used as the safety device for that vehicle, at least two safety chains 
or cables meeting the requirements of paragraph (h)(10)(ii) of this 
section shall be used. The tensile strength of the safety device and the 
means of attachment to the vehicles shall be at least equivalent to the 
corresponding longitudinal strength for tow-bars required in the table 
of paragraph (h)(1) of this section. If safety chains or cables are used 
as the safety device, the required strength shall be the combined 
strength of the combination of chains and cables.
    (ii) If chains or cables are used as the safety device, they shall 
be crossed and attached to the vehicles near the points of bumper 
attachments to the chassis of the vehicles. The length of chain used 
shall be no more than necessary to permit free turning of the vehicles. 
The chains shall be attached to the tow-bar at the point of crossing or 
as close to that point as is practicable.
    (iii) A safety device other than safety chains or cables must 
provide strength, security of attachment, and directional stability 
equal to, or greater than, that provided by safety chains or cables 
installed in accordance with paragraph (h)(10)(ii) of this section. A 
safety device other than safety chains or cables must be designed, 
constructed, and installed so that, if the tow-bar fails or becomes 
disconnected, the tow-bar will not drop to the ground.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Requirements for upper-half of saddle-mounts. The upper-half of 
any saddle-mount shall comply with the following requirements:
    (1) Upper-half connection to towed vehicle. The upper-half shall be 
securely attached to the frame or axle of the towed vehicle by means of 
U-bolts or other means providing at least equivalent security.
    (2) U-bolts or other attachments. U-bolts used to attach the upper 
half to the towed vehicle shall be made of steel rod, free of defects, 
so shaped as to avoid at any point a radius of less than 1 inch: 
Provided, however, That a lesser radius may be utilized if the U-bolt is 
so fabricated as not to cause more than 5 percent reduction in cross-
sectional area at points of curvature, in which latter event the minimum 
radius shall be one-sixteenth inch. U-bolts shall have a diameter not 
less than required by the following table:

\1\The total weight of all the vehicles being towed shall govern. If    
  other devices are used to accomplish the same purposes as U-bolts they
  shall have at least equivalent strength of U-bolts made of mild steel.
  Cast iron shall not be used for clamps or any other holding devices.  

    (3) U-bolts and points of support, location. The distance between 
the most widely separated U-bolts shall not be less than 9 inches. The 
distance between the widely separated points where the upper-half 
supports the towed vehicle shall not be less than 9 inches, except that 
saddle-mounts employing ball and socket joints shall employ a device 
which clamps the axle of the towed vehicle throughout a length of not 
less than 5 inches.
    (4) Cradle-type upper-halves, specifications. Upper-halves of the 
cradle-type using vertical members to restrain the towed vehicle from 
relative movement in the direction of motion of the vehicles shall be 
substantially constructed and adequate for the purpose. Such cradle-
mounts shall be equipped with at least one bolt or equivalent means to 
provide against relative vertical movement between the upper-half and 
the towed vehicle. Bolts, if used, shall be at least one-half inch in 
diameter. Devices using equivalent means shall have at least equivalent 
strength. The means used to provide against relative vertical motion 
between the upper-half and the towed vehicle shall be such as not to 
permit a relative motion of over one-half inch. The distance between the 
most widely separated points of support between the upper-half and the 
towed vehicle shall be at least 9 inches.

[[Page 721]]

    (5) Lateral movement of towed vehicle. (i) Towed vehicles having a 
straight axle or an axle having a drop of less than 3 inches, unless the 
saddle-mount is constructed in accordance with paragraph (m)(2) of this 
section, shall be securely fastened by means of chains or cables to the 
upper-half so as to insure against relative lateral motion between the 
towed vehicle and the upper-half. The chains or cables shall be at least 
\3/16\-inch diameter and secured by bolts of at least equal diameter.
    (ii) Towed vehicles with an axle with a drop of 3 inches or more, or 
connected by a saddle-mount constructed in accordance with paragraph 
(m)(2) of this section, need not be restrained by chains or cables 
provided that the upper-half is so designed as to provide against such 
relative motion.
    (iii) Chains or cables shall not be required if the upper-half is so 
designed as positively to provide against lateral movement of the axle.
    (k) Requirements for lower half of saddle-mounts. The lower half of 
any saddle-mount shall comply with the following requirements:
    (1) U-bolts or other attachments. U-bolts used to attach the lower 
half to the towing vehicle shall be made of steel rod, free of defects, 
so shaped as to avoid at any point a radius of less than 1 inch: 
Provided, however, That a lesser radius may be utilized if the U-bolt is 
so fabricated as not to cause more than 5 percent reduction in cross-
sectional area at points of curvature, in which latter event the minimum 
radius shall be one-sixteenth inch. U-bolts shall have a total cross-
sectional area not less than as required by the following table:

\1\The total weight of all the vehicles being towed shall govern. If    
  other devices are used to accomplish the same purposes as U-bolts they
  shall have at least equivalent strength of U-bolts made of mild steel.
  Cast iron shall not be used for clamps or any other holding devices.  

    (2) Shifting. Adequate provision shall be made by design and 
installation to provide against relative movement between the lower-half 
and the towing vehicle especially during periods of rapid acceleration 
and deceleration. To insure against shifting, designs of the tripod type 
shall be equipped with adequate and securely fastened hold-back chains 
or similar devices.
    (3) Swaying. (i) Adequate provision shall be made by design and 
installation to provide against swaying or lateral movement of the towed 
vehicle relative to the towing vehicle. To insure against swaying, 
lower-halves designed with cross-members attached to but separable from 
vertical members shall have such cross-members fastened to the vertical 
members by at least two bolts on each side. Such bolts shall be of at 
least equivalent cross-sectional area as those required for U-bolts for 
the corresponding saddle-mount as given in the table in paragraph (k)(1) 
of this section. The minimum distance between the most widely separated 
points of support of the cross-member by the vertical member shall be 
three inches as measured in a direction parallel to the longitudinal 
axis of the towing vehicle.
    (ii) The lower-half shall have a bearing surface on the frame of the 
towing vehicle of such dimensions that the pressure exerted by the 
lower-half upon the frame of the towing vehicle shall not exceed 200 
pounds per square inch under any conditions of static loading. Hardwood 
blocks or blocks of other suitable material, such as hard rubber, 
aluminum or brakelining, if used between the lower half and the frame of 
the towing vehicle shall be at least \1/2\ inch thick, 3 inches wide, 
and a combined length of 6 inches.
    (iii) Under no condition shall the highest point of support of the 
towed vehicle by the upper-half be more than 24 inches, measured 
vertically, above the top of the frame of the towing vehicle, measured 
at the point where the lower-half rests on the towing vehicle.
    (4) Wood blocks. (i) Hardwood blocks of good quality may be used to 
build up the height of the front end of the towed vehicle, provided that 
the total height of such wood blocks shall not exceed 8 inches and not 
over two separate pieces are placed upon each other to obtain such 
height; however, hardwood blocks,

[[Page 722]]

not over 4 in number, to a total height not to exceed 14 inches, may be 
used if the total cross-sectional area of the U-bolts used to attach the 
lower-half of the towing vehicle is at least 50 percent greater than 
that required by the table contained in paragraph (k)(1) of this 
section, or, if other devices are used in lieu of U-bolts, they shall 
provide for as great a resistance to bending as is provided by the 
larger U-bolts above prescribed.
    (ii) Hardwood blocks must be at least 4 inches in width and the 
surfaces between blocks or block and lower-half or block and upper-half 
shall be planed and so installed and maintained as to minimize any 
tendency of the towed vehicle to sway or rock.
    (5) Cross-member, general requirements. The cross-member, which is 
that part of the lower-half used to distribute the weight of the towed 
vehicle equally to each member of the frame of the towing vehicle, if 
used, shall be structurally adequate and properly installed and 
maintained adequately to perform this function.
    (6) Cross-member, use of wood. No materials, other than suitable 
metals, shall be used as the cross-member, and wood may not be used 
structurally in any manner that will result in its being subject to 
tensile stresses. Wood may be used in cross-members if supported 
throughout its length by suitable metal cross-members.
    (7) Lower half strength. The lower half shall be capable of 
supporting the loads given in the following table. For the purpose of 
test, the saddle-mount shall be mounted as normally operated and the 
load applied through the upper half:

\2\High-tensile steel is steel having a minimum ultimate strength of 65,000 pounds per square inch.             

    (ii) If a ball and socket joint is used in place of a kingpin, the 
diameter of the neck of the ball shall be at least equal to the diameter 
of the corresponding solid kingpin given in the above table. If hollow 
kingpins are used, the metallic cross-sectional area shall be at least 
equal to the cross-sectional area of the corresponding solid kingpin.
    (2) Kingpin fit. If a kingpin bushing is not used, the king-pin 
shall fit snugly into the upper and lower-halves but shall not bind. 
Those portions of the upper or lower-halves in moving contact with the 
kingpin shall be smoothly machined with no rough or sharp edges. The 
bearing surface thus provided shall not be less in depth than the radius 
of the kingpin.
    (3) Kingpin bushing on saddle-mounts. The kingpin of all new saddle-
mounts acquired and used shall be snugly enclosed in a bushing at least 
along such length of the kingpin as may be in moving contact with either 
the upper or lower-halves. The bearing surface

[[Page 723]]

thus provided shall not be less in depth than the radius of the kingpin.
    (4) Kingpin to restrain vertical motion. The kingpin shall be so 
designed and installed as to restrain the upper-half from moving in a 
vertical direction relative to the lower-half.
    (m) Additional requirements for saddle-mounts. Saddle-mounts shall 
comply with the following requirements:
    (1) Bearing surface between upper and lower-halves. The upper and 
lower-halves shall be so constructed and connected that the bearing 
surface between the two halves shall not be less than 16 square inches 
under any conditions of angularity between the towing and towed 
vehicles: Provided, however, That saddle-mounts using a ball and socket 
joint shall have a ball of such dimension that the static bearing load 
shall not exceed 800 pounds per square inch, based on the projected 
cross-sectional area of the ball: And further provided, That saddle-
mounts having the upper-half supported by ball, taper, or roller-
bearings shall not have such bearings loaded beyond the limits 
prescribed for such bearings by the manufacturer thereof. The upper-half 
shall rest evenly and smoothly upon the lower-half and the contact 
surfaces shall be lubricated and maintained so that there shall be a 
minimum of frictional resistance between the parts.
    (2) Saddle-mounts, angularity. All saddle-mounts acquired and used 
shall provide for angularity between the towing and towed vehicles due 
to vertical curvatures of the highway. Such means shall not depend upon 
either the looseness or deformation of the parts of either the saddle-
mount or the vehicles to provide for such angularity.
    (3) Tracking. The saddle-mount shall be so designed, constructed, 
maintained, and installed that the towed vehicle or vehicles will follow 
substantially in the path of the towing vehicle without swerving. Towed 
vehicles shall not deviate more than 3 inches to either side of the path 
of the towing vehicle when moving in a straight line.
    (4) Prevention of frame bending. Where necessary, provision shall be 
made to prevent the bending of the frame of the towing vehicle by 
insertion of suitable blocks inside the frame channel to prevent 
kinking. The saddle-mount shall not be so located as to cause 
deformation of the frame by reason of cantilever action.
    (5) Extension of frame. No saddle-mount shall be located at a point 
to the rear of the frame of a towing vehicle.
    (6) Nuts, secured. All nuts used on bolts, U-bolts, king-pins, or in 
any other part of the saddle-mount shall be secured against accidental 
disconnection by means of cotter-keys, lock-washers, double nuts, safety 
nuts, or equivalent means. Parts shall be so designed and installed that 
nuts shall be fully engaged.
    (7) Inspection of all parts. The saddle-mount shall be so designed 
that it may be disassembled and each separate part inspected for worn, 
bent, cracked, broken, or missing parts.
    (8) Saddle-mounts, marking. Every new saddle-mount acquired and used 
in driveaway-towaway operations by a motor carrier shall have the upper-
half and the lower-half separately marked with the following 
certification of the manufacturer thereof (or words of equivalent 
meaning).

    This saddle-mount complies with the requirements of the Federal 
Highway Administration for vehicles up to 5,000 pounds (or over 5,000 
pounds):

<R05>
Sec. 393.77   Heaters.

    On every motor vehicle, every heater shall comply with the following 
requirements:
    (a) Prohibited types of heaters. The installation or use of the 
following types of heaters is prohibited:
    (1) Exhaust heaters. Any type of exhaust heater in which the engine 
exhaust gases are conducted into or through any space occupied by 
persons or any heater which conducts engine compartment air into any 
such space.
    (2) Unenclosed flame heaters. Any type of heater employing a flame 
which is not fully enclosed, except that such heaters are not prohibited 
when used for heating the cargo of tank motor vehicles.
    (3) Heaters permitting fuel leakage. Any type of heater from the 
burner of which there could be spillage or leakage of fuel upon the 
tilting or overturning of the vehicle in which it is mounted.
    (4) Heaters permitting air contamination. Any heater taking air, 
heated or to be heated, from the engine compartment or from direct 
contact with any portion of the exhaust system; or any heater taking air 
in ducts from the outside atmosphere to be conveyed through the engine 
compartment, unless said ducts are so constructed and installed as to 
prevent contamination of the air so conveyed by exhaust or engine 
compartment gases.
    (5) Solid fuel heaters except wood charcoal. Any stove or other 
heater employing solid fuel except wood charcoal.
    (6) Portable heaters. Portable heaters shall not be used in any 
space occupied by persons except the cargo space of motor vehicles which 
are being loaded or unloaded.
    (b) Heater specifications. All heaters shall comply with the 
following specifications:
    (1) Heating elements, protection. Every heater shall be so located 
or protected as to prevent contact therewith by occupants, unless the 
surface temperature of the protecting grilles or of any exposed portions 
of the heaters, inclusive of exhaust stacks, pipes, or conduits shall be 
lower than would cause contact burns. Adequate protection shall be 
afforded against igniting parts of the vehicle or burning occupants by 
direct radiation. Wood charcoal heaters shall be enclosed within a metal 
barrel, drum, or similar protective enclosure which enclosure shall be 
provided with a securely fastened cover.
    (2) Moving parts, guards. Effective guards shall be provided for the 
protection of passengers or occupants against injury by fans, belts, or 
any other moving parts.
    (3) Heaters, secured. Every heater and every heater enclosure shall 
be securely fastened to the vehicle in a substantial manner so as to 
provide against relative motion within the vehicle during normal usage 
or in the event the vehicle overturns. Every heater shall be so 
designed, constructed, and mounted as to minimize the likelihood of 
disassembly of any of its parts, including exhaust stacks, pipes, or 
conduits, upon overturn of the vehicle in or on which it is mounted. 
Wood charcoal heaters shall be secured against relative motion within 
the enclosure required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the 
enclosure shall be securely fastened to the motor vehicle.
    (4) Relative motion between fuel tank and heater. When either in 
normal operation or in the event of overturn, there is or is likely to 
be relative motion between the fuel tank for a heater and the heater, or 
between either of such units and the fuel lines between them, a suitable 
means shall be provided at the point of greatest relative motion so as 
to allow this motion without causing failure of the fuel lines.
    (5) Operating controls to be protected. On every bus designed to 
transport more than 15 passengers, including the driver, means shall be 
provided to prevent unauthorized persons from tampering with the 
operating controls. Such means may include remote control by the driver; 
installation of controls at inaccessible places; control of adjustments 
by key or keys; enclosure of controls in a locked space, locking of 
controls, or other means of accomplishing this purpose.
    (6) Heater hoses. Hoses for all hot water and steam heater systems 
shall be specifically designed and constructed for that purpose.
    (7) Electrical apparatus. Every heater employing any electrical 
apparatus shall be equipped with electrical conductors, switches, 
connectors, and

[[Page 727]]

other electrical parts of ample current-carrying capacity to provide 
against overheating; any electric motor employed in any heater shall be 
of adequate size and so located that it will not be overheated; 
electrical circuits shall be provided with fuses and/or circuit breakers 
to provide against electrical overloading; and all electrical conductors 
employed in or leading to any heater shall be secured against dangling, 
chafing, and rubbing and shall have suitable protection against any 
other condition likely to produce short or open circuits.

    Note: Electrical parts certified as proper for use by Underwriters' 
Laboratories, Inc., shall be deemed to comply with the foregoing 
requirements.

    (8) Storage battery caps. If a separate storage battery is located 
within the personnel or cargo space, such battery shall be securely 
mounted and equipped with nonspill filler caps.
    (9) Combustion heater exhaust construction. Every heater employing 
the combustion of oil, gas, liquefied petroleum gas, or any other 
combustible material shall be provided with substantial means of 
conducting the products of combustion to the outside of the vehicle: 
Provided, however, That this requirement shall not apply to heaters used 
solely to heat the cargo space of motor vehicles where such motor 
vehicles or heaters are equipped with means specifically designed and 
maintained so that the carbon monoxide concentration will never exceed 
0.2 percent in the cargo space. The exhaust pipe, stack, or conduit if 
required shall be sufficiently substantial and so secured as to provide 
reasonable assurance against leakage or discharge of products of 
combustion within the vehicle and, if necessary, shall be so insulated 
as to make unlikely the burning or charring of parts of the vehicle by 
radiation or by direct contact. The place of discharge of the products 
of combustion to the atmosphere and the means of discharge of such 
products shall be such as to minimize the likelihood of their reentry 
into the vehicle under all operating conditions.
    (10) Combustion chamber construction. The design and construction of 
any combustion-type heater except cargo space heaters permitted by the 
proviso of paragraph (c)(9) of this section and unenclosed flame heaters 
used for heating cargo of tank motor vehicles shall be such as to 
provide against the leakage of products of combustion into air to be 
heated and circulated. The material employed in combustion chambers 
shall be such as to provide against leakage because of corrosion, 
oxidation, or other deterioration. Joints between combustion chambers 
and the air chambers with which they are in thermal and mechanical 
contact shall be so designed and constructed as to prevent leakage 
between the chambers and the materials employed in such joints shall 
have melting points substantially higher than the maximum temperatures 
likely to be attained at the points of jointure.
    (11) Heater fuel tank location. Every bus designed to transport more 
than 15 passengers, including the driver, with heaters of the combustion 
type shall have fuel tanks therefor located outside of and lower than 
the passenger space. When necessary, suitable protection shall be 
afforded by shielding or other means against the puncturing of any such 
tank or its connections by flying stones or other objects.
    (12) Heater, automatic fuel control. Gravity or siphon feed shall 
not be permitted for heaters using liquid fuels. Heaters using liquid 
fuels shall be equipped with automatic means for shutting off the fuel 
or for reducing such flow of fuel to the smallest practicable magnitude, 
in the event of overturn of the vehicle. Heaters using liquefied 
petroleum gas as fuel shall have the fuel line equipped with automatic 
means at the source of supply for shutting off the fuel in the event of 
separation, breakage, or disconnection of any of the fuel lines between 
the supply source and the heater.
    (13) ``Tell-tale'' indicators. Heaters subject to paragraph (c)(14) 
of this section and not provided with automatic controls shall be 
provided with ``tell-tale'' means to indicate to the driver that the 
heater is properly functioning. This requirement shall not apply to 
heaters used solely for the cargo space in semitrailers or full 
trailers.

         Subpart I--Protection Against Shifting or Falling Cargo

    Source: 38 FR 23522, Aug. 31, 1973, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 393.100   General rules for protection against shifting or falling cargo.

    (a) Application and scope of the rules in this section. This section 
applies to trucks, truck tractors, semitrailers, full trailers, and pole 
trailers. Each of those motor vehicles must, when transporting cargo, be 
loaded and equipped to prevent the shifting or falling of the cargo in 
the manner prescribed by the rules in paragraph (b) of this section. In 
addition, each cargo-carrying motor vehicle must conform to the 
applicable rules in Secs. 393.102, 393.104, and 393.106.
    (b) Basic protection components. Each cargo-carrying motor vehicle 
must be equipped with devices providing protection against shifting or 
falling cargo that meet the requirements of either paragraph (b) (1), 
(2), (3), or (4) of this section.
    (1) Option A. The vehicle must have sides, side-boards, or stakes, 
and a rear

[[Page 736]]

endgate, endboard, or stakes. Those devices must be strong enough and 
high enough to assure that cargo will not shift upon, or fall from the 
vehicle. Those devices must have no aperture large enough to permit 
cargo in contact with one or more of the devices to pass through it.
    (2) Option B. The vehicle must have at least one tiedown assembly 
that meets the requirements of Sec. 393.102 for each 10 linear feet of 
lading or fraction thereof. (However, a pole trailer or an expandable 
trailer transporting metal articles under the special rules in paragraph 
(c) of this section is required only to have two or more of those 
tiedown assemblies at each end of the trailer.) In addition, the vehicle 
must have as many additional tiedown assemblies meeting the requirements 
of Sec. 393.102 as are necessary to secure all cargo being transported 
either by direct contact between the cargo and the tiedown assemblies or 
by dunnage which is in contact with the cargo and is secured by tiedown 
assemblies.<SUP>1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1 Tiedown assemblies or dunnage in contact with sufficient exterior 
(including topmost) pieces of the cargo and securely holding each 
interior or lower piece comply with this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Option C (for vehicles transporting metal articles only). A 
vehicle transporting cargo which consists of metal articles must conform 
to either the rules in paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (4) of this section, 
or the special rules for transportation of metal articles set forth in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (4) Option D. The vehicle must have other means of protecting 
against shifting or falling cargo which are similar to, and at least as 
effective as, those specified in paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this 
section.
    (c) Special rules for metal articles--(1) Scope of the rules in this 
paragraph. The rules in this paragraph apply to a motor vehicle 
transporting cargo consisting of metal articles if that vehicle does not 
conform to the rules in paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (4) of this section.
    (2) Application of other sections. A motor vehicle transporting 
property consisting of metal articles must, regardless of whether the 
rules in this paragraph apply to it, conform to the rules in 
Sec. 393.102 (relating to securement systems), Sec. 393.104 (relating to 
blocking and bracing of cargo), and Sec. 393.106 (relating to front-end 
structure requirements).
    (3) Coils. Whenever a motor carrier transports one or more coils of 
metal which, individually or as a combination banded together, weigh 
5,000 pounds or more, the coils shall be secured in the following 
manner:
    (i) Coils with eyes vertical:  One or more coils which are grouped 
and loaded side by side in a transverse or longitudinal row must be 
secured by--
    (a) A tiedown assembly against the front of the coil or row of 
coils, restraining against forward motion;
    (b) A tiedown assembly against the rear of the coil or row of coils, 
restraining against rearward motion; and
    (c) A tiedown assembly over the top of each coil or transverse row 
of coils, restraining against vertical motion.

The same tiedown assembly shall not be used to comply with more than one 
of the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(i) (a), (b), or (c) of this 
section.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP91.031

    (ii) Coils with eyes crosswise:  Each coil or transverse row of 
coils loaded side by side and having approximately the same outside 
diameters must be secured by--
    (a) A tiedown assembly through the eye of each coil, restricting 
against forward motion and making an angle of less than 45 deg. with the 
horizontal when viewed from the side of the vehicle;
    (b) A tiedown assembly through the eye of each coil, restricting 
against rearward motion and making an angle of less than 45 deg. with 
the horizontal when viewed from the side of the vehicle; and
    (c) Timbers, having a nominal cross section of 4 x 4 inches or more 
and a length which is at least 75 percent of

[[Page 737]]

the width of the coil or row of coils, tightly placed against both the 
front and rear sides of the coil or row of coils and restrained to 
prevent movement of the coil or coils in the forward and rearward 
directions.
    (d) If coils are loaded to contact each other in the longitudinal 
direction and relative motion between coils, and between coils and the 
vehicle, is prevented by tiedown assemblies and timbers--
    (1) Only the foremost and rearmost coils must be secured with 
timbers; and
    (2) A single tiedown assembly, restricting against forward motion, 
may be used to secure any coil except the rearmost one, which must be 
restrained against rearward motion.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP91.032

    (iii) Coils with eyes lengthwise: A coil or transverse row of coils 
having approximately equal outside diameters and loaded side by side or 
a longitudinal row of coils having approximately equal outside diameters 
and loaded end to end must be secured as follows:
    (a) The coil or coils must be restrained against side-by-side and 
fore-and-aft movement by--
    (1) One or more tiedown assemblies over the top of each coil or 
transverse row; or
    (2) Two or more tiedown assemblies through the eye of each coil or 
longitudinal row; or
    (3) One or more tiedown assemblies, crossing from one side of the 
vehicle to the other, through the eye of each coil or longitudinal row 
of coils in a transverse row.
    (b) Timbers having nominal cross section of 4 x 4 inches or more 
must be tightly placed against the sides of each coil or against the 
outboard sides of each transverse row of coils which are loaded side by 
side so that the timbers restrain against side-to-side movement.
    (c) If, in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(a)(1) of this 
section, only one tiedown assembly over the top of each coil or 
transverse row of coils is used to restrain against side-to-side 
movement and fore-and-aft movement, timbers having a nominal cross 
section of 2 x 4 inches or more and which are firmly secured to 
longitudinal blocking must be tightly placed against the front and back 
of each coil, each longitudinal row of coils, and each transverse row of 
coils in a manner which restricts forward and rearward movement.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP91.033

    (iv) Timber which is used for blocking must be sound lumber which is 
free of defects (such as knots or cracks) that materially reduce its 
strength.
    (v) Timbers need not be used on vehicles which have depressions in 
the floor or are equipped with other restraining devices which perform 
the functions specified for timbers by the rules in this section.
    (vi) As used in this section, the term ``nominal'', when used to 
describe timber, means commercially dressed sizes generally designated 
by the dimensions indicated.
    (4) Miscellaneous metal articles. Except as provided in paragraph 
(c)(4)(iv) of this section, whenever a motor carrier transports metal 
articles consisting of cut-to-length bars, plates, rods, sheet and tin 
mill products, billets, blooms, ingots, slabs, structural shapes, or 
pipe, and other tubular products and those articles, either individually 
or as a combination of articles banded or boxed together and handled as 
a single unit, weigh more than 2,000 pounds, the article shall be 
secured in the following manner:

[[Page 738]]

    (i) A single article, a group of articles, or a combination of 
articles loaded side by side across the width of the vehicle must be 
secured by at least one tiedown assembly over its top for at least every 
8 feet of its length and at least two tiedown assemblies securing each 
individual article or combination of articles banded or otherwise 
secured together and handled as a single unit. However, articles which 
individually have a length of 8 feet or less and which are securely 
butted against each other in the fore-and-after direction may be secured 
by metal angles secured by tiedown assemblies, or they may be secured by 
a timber having a nominal cross section of 4 x 4 inches or more placed 
longitudinally over the articles and secured by tiedown assemblies. 
Tiedown assemblies may not be located beyond the ends of the article 
which they secure.
    (ii) If articles are tiered and each tiered article rests securely 
on the one beneath it, the tier may be secured in the same manner as a 
single level of those articles is secured in accordance with the rules 
in this section.
    (iii) Pole trailers must either comply with the requirements of 
paragraph (c)(4) (i) and (ii) of this section or have at least two 
tiedown assemblies securing the load to the forward bolster and at least 
two tiedown assemblies securing the load to the rear bolster.
    (iv) The rules in this paragraph do not apply to special loads 
consisting of machinery or fabricated structural items, such as beams, 
girders, and trusses, which are fastened by special methods. However, 
those loads must be securely and adequately fastened to the vehicle.
    (d) Special rule for special-purpose vehicles. The rules in this 
section do not apply to a vehicle transporting one or more articles 
which, because of their size, shape, or weight, must be carried on 
special-purpose vehicles or must be fastened by special methods. 
However, any article carried on that vehicle must be securely and 
adequately fastened to the vehicle.
    (e) Special rule for intermodal cargo containers. Containers 
designed for the transportation of containerized, intermodal cargo and 
having integral securement devices must be fastened to the chassis of 
the motor vehicle with securement devices that prevent them from being 
unintentionally unfastened. The securement devices must restrain the 
container from moving more than one-half inch forward, more than one-
half inch aft, more than one-half inch to the right, more than one-half 
inch to the left, or more than one inch vertically when the container is 
subjected to the following accelerations relative to the vehicle:

Sec. 393.104   Blocking and bracing.

    (a) Protection against longitudinal movement. When a motor vehicle 
carries cargo that is not firmly braced against a front-end structure 
that conforms to the requirements of Sec. 393.106, the cargo must be 
secured so that, when the vehicle decelerates at a rate of 20 feet per 
second per second, the cargo will remain on the vehicle and will not 
penetrate the vehicle's front-end structure.
    (b) Protection against lateral movement. When a vehicle carries 
cargo that may shift sideways in transit, the cargo must either be 
securely blocked or braced against the sides, sideboards, or stakes of 
the vehicle or be secured by devices that conform to the requirements of 
paragraph (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of Sec. 393.100.
    (c) Effective date. This section is effective on October 1, 1973.

<R05>
Sec. 393.106   Front-end structure.

    (a) General rule. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this 
section, every cargo-carrying motor vehicle must be equipped with a 
headerboard or similar device of sufficient strength to prevent load 
shifting and penetration or crushing of the driver's compartment.
    (2) On and after the effective dates specified in paragraph (h) of 
this section, every cargo-carrying motor vehicle must have a front-end 
structure that conforms to the rules in this section.
    (b) Location. The front-end structure must be located between the 
vehicle's cargo and the vehicle's driver.
    (c) Height and width. The front-end structure must extend either to 
a height of 4 feet above the floor of the vehicle or to a height at 
which it blocks forward movement of any item of cargo being carried on 
the vehicle, whichever is lower. The front-end structure must have a 
width which is at least equal to the width of the vehicle or which 
blocks forward movement of any item of cargo being transported on the 
vehicle, whichever is narrower.

[[Page 742]]

    (d) Strength. The front-end structure must be capable of 
withstanding the horizontal forward static load specified in either 
paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) For a front-end structure less than 6 feet in height, a 
horizontal forward static load equal to one half (\1/2\) of the weight 
of the cargo being transported on the vehicle uniformly distributed over 
the entire portion of the front-end structure that is within 4 feet 
above the vehicle's floor or that is at or below a height above the 
vehicle's floor at which it blocks forward movement of any item of the 
vehicle's cargo, whichever is less.
    (2) For a front-end structure 6 feet in height or higher, a 
horizontal forward static load equal to four-tenths (0.4) of the weight 
of the cargo being transported on the vehicle uniformly distributed over 
the entire front-end structure.
    (e) Penetration resistance. The front-end structure must be 
designed, constructed and maintained so that it is capable of resisting 
penetration by any item of cargo that contacts it when the vehicle 
decelerates at a rate of 20 feet per second per second. The front-end 
structure must have no aperture large enough to permit any item of cargo 
in contact with the structure to pass through it.
    (f) Substitute devices. The requirements of this section may be met 
by the use of devices performing the same functions as a front-end 
structure, if the devices are at least as strong as, and provide 
protection against shifting cargo at least equal to, a front-end 
structure which conforms to those requirements.
    (g) Exemptions. The following motor vehicles are exempt from the 
rules in this section:
    (1) A vehicle which is designed and used exclusively to transport 
other vehicles, if each vehicle it transports is securely tied down by 
devices that conform to the requirements of Sec. 393.102.
    (2) A pole trailer or semitrailer being towed by a truck tractor 
that is equipped with a front-end structure that conforms to the rules 
in this section.
    (3) A full trailer being towed by a vehicle that is equipped with a 
front-end structure that conforms to the requirements of this section 
for a front-end structure.
    (4) A full trailer being towed by a vehicle that is loaded in such a 
manner that the cargo on the towing vehicle conforms to the requirements 
of this section for a front-end structure.
    (5) The rules in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section do not apply 
to a motor vehicle manufactured before January 1, 1974.
    (h) Effective dates. Cargo-carrying motor vehicles which are not 
exempted by paragraph (g) of this section must conform to the rules in 
this section as follows:

consecutive days, if the motor carrier for which the driver drives does 
not operate every day in the week; or
    (iv) After having been on duty for 80 hours in any period of 8 
consecutive days, if the motor carrier for which the driver drives 
operates every day in the week.
    (2) A driver who is driving a commercial motor vehicle in the State 
of Alaska and who encounters adverse driving conditions (as defined in 
Sec. 395.2) may drive and be permitted or required to drive a commercial 
motor vehicle for the period of time needed to complete the run. After 
he/she completes the run, that driver must be off duty for 8 consecutive 
hours before he/she drives again.
    (j) State of Hawaii. The rules in Sec. 395.8 do not apply to a

under paragraph (b) of this section when establishing, maintaining or 
enforcing specific NRHM routing designations over which NRHM may or may 
not be transported.
    (b) The Federal standards are as follows:
    (1) Enhancement of public safety. The State or Indian tribe shall 
make a finding, supported by the record to be developed in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3)(iv) of this section, that any NRHM 
routing designation enhances public safety in the areas subject to its 
jurisdiction and in other

[[Page 766]]

areas which are directly affected by such highway routing designation. 
In making such a finding, the State or Indian tribe shall consider:
    (i) The factors listed in paragraph (b)(9) of this section; and
    (ii) The DOT ``Guidelines for Applying Criteria to Designate Routes 
for Transporting Hazardous Materials,'' DOT/RSPA/OHMT-89-02, July 1989

Information Management Division, HHS-10, Federal Highway Administration, 
U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 7th Street, SW., Washington, D.C. 
20590-0001.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Public participation. Prior to the establishment of any NRHM 
routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall undertake the 
following actions to ensure participation by the public in the routing 
process:
    (i) The State or Indian tribe shall provide the public with notice 
of any proposed NRHM routing designation and a 30-day period in which to 
comment. At any time during this period or following review of the 
comments received, the State or Indian tribe shall decide whether to 
hold a public hearing on the proposed NRHM route designation. The public 
shall be given 30 days prior notice of the public hearing which shall be 
conducted as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Notice 
for both the comment period and the public hearing, if one is held, 
shall be given by publication in at least two newspapers of general 
circulation in the affected area or areas and shall contain a complete 
description of the proposed routing designation, together with the date, 
time, and location of any public hearings. Notice for both the comment 
period and any public hearing may also be published in the official 
register of the State.
    (ii) If it is determined that a public hearing is necessary, the 
State or Indian tribe shall hold at least one public hearing on the 
record during which the public will be afforded the opportunity to 
present their views and any information or data related to the proposed 
NRHM routing designation. The State shall make available to the public, 
upon payment of prescribed costs, copies of the transcript of the 
hearing, which shall include all exhibits and documents presented during 
the hearing or submitted for the record.
    (3) Consultation with others. Prior to the establishment of any NRHM 
routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall provide notice to, 
and consult with, officials of affected political subdivisions, States 
and Indian tribes, and any other affected parties. Such actions shall 
include the following:
    (i) At least 60 days prior to establishing a routing designation, 
the State or Indian tribe shall provide notice, in writing, of the 
proposed routing designation to officials responsible for highway 
routing in all other affected States or Indian tribes. A copy of this 
notice may also be sent to all affected political subdivisions. This 
notice shall request approval, in writing, by those States or Indian 
tribes, of the proposed routing designations. If no response is received 
within 60 days from the day of receipt of the notification of the 
proposed routing designation, the routing designation shall be 
considered approved by the affected State or Indian tribe.
    (ii) The manner in which consultation under this paragraph is 
conducted is left to the discretion of the State or Indian tribe.
    (iii) The State or Indian tribe shall attempt to resolve any concern 
or disagreement expressed by any consulted official related to the 
proposed routing designation.
    (iv) The State or Indian tribe shall keep a record of the names and 
addresses of the officials notified pursuant to this section and of any 
consultation or meeting conducted with these officials or their 
representatives. Such record shall describe any concern or disagreement 
expressed by the officials and any action undertaken to resolve such 
disagreement or address any concern.
    (4) Through routing. In establishing any NRHM routing designation, 
the State or Indian tribe shall ensure through highway routing for the 
transportation of NRHM between adjacent areas. The term ``through 
highway routing'' as used in this paragraph means that the routing 
designation

[[Page 767]]

must ensure continuity of movement so as to not impede or unnecessarily 
delay the transportation of NRHM. The State or Indian tribe shall 
utilize the procedures established in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of 
this section in meeting these requirements. In addition, the State or 
Indian tribe shall make a finding, supported by a risk analysis 
conducted in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that the 
routing designation enhances public safety. If the risk analysis shows--
    (i) That the current routing presents at least 50 percent more risk 
to the public than the deviation under the proposed routing designation, 
then the proposed routing designation may go into effect.
    (ii) That the current routing presents a greater risk but less than 
50 percent more risk to the public than the deviation under the proposed 
routing restriction, then the proposed routing restriction made by a 
State or Indian tribe shall only go into effect if it does not force a 
deviation of more than 25 miles or result in an increase of more than 25 
percent of that part of a trip affected by the deviation, whichever is 
shorter, from the most direct route through a jurisdiction as compared 
to the intended deviation.
    (iii) That the current route has the same or less risk to the public 
than the deviation resulting from the proposed routing designation, then 
the routing designation shall not be allowed.
    (5) Agreement of other States; burden on commerce. Any NRHM routing 
designation which affects another State or Indian tribe shall be 
established, maintained, or enforced only if:
    (i) It does not unreasonably burden commerce, and
    (ii) It is agreed to by the affected State or Indian tribe within 60 
days of receipt of the notice sent pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of 
this section, or it is approved by the Administrator pursuant to 
Sec. 397.75.
    (6) Timeliness. The establishment of a NRHM routing designation by 
any State or Indian tribe shall be completed within 18 months of the 
notice given in either paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, 
whichever occurs first.
    (7) Reasonable routes to terminals and other facilities. In 
establishing or providing for reasonable access to and from designated 
routes, the State or Indian tribe shall use the shortest practicable 
route considering the factors listed in paragraph (b)(9) of this 
section. In establishing any NRHM routing designation, the State or 
Indian tribe shall provide reasonable access for motor vehicles 
transporting NRHM to reach:
    (i) Terminals,
    (ii) Points of loading, unloading, pickup and delivery, and
    (iii) Facilities for food, fuel, repairs, rest, and safe havens.
    (8) Responsibility for local compliance. The States shall be 
responsible for ensuring that all of their political subdivisions comply 
with the provisions of this subpart. The States shall be responsible for 
resolving all disputes between such political subdivisions within their 
jurisdictions. If a State or any political subdivision thereof, or an 
Indian tribe chooses to establish, maintain, or enforce any NRHM routing 
designation, the Governor, or Indian tribe, shall designate a routing 
agency for the State or Indian tribe, respectively. The routing agency 
shall ensure that all NRHM routing designations within its jurisdiction 
comply with the Federal standards in this section. The State or Indian 
tribe shall comply with the public information and reporting 
requirements contained in Sec. 397.73.
    (9) Factors to consider. In establishing any NRHM routing 
designation, the State or Indian tribe shall consider the following 
factors:
    (i) Population density. The population potentially exposed to a NRHM 
release shall be estimated from the density of the residents, employees, 
motorists, and other persons in the area, using United States census 
tract maps or other reasonable means for determining the population 
within a potential impact zone along a designated highway route. The 
impact zone is the potential range of effects in the event of a release. 
Special populations such as schools, hospitals, prisons, and senior 
citizen homes shall, among other things, be considered when determining 
the potential risk to the populations along a highway routing. 
Consideration shall be given to the amount of time

[[Page 768]]

during which an area will experience a heavy population density.
    (ii) Type of highway. The characteristics of each alternative NRHM 
highway routing designation shall be compared. Vehicle weight and size 
limits, underpass and bridge clearances, roadway geometrics, number of 
lanes, degree of access control, and median and shoulder structures are 
examples of characteristics which a State or Indian tribe shall 
consider.
    (iii) Types and quantities of NRHM. An examination shall be made of 
the type and quantity of NRHM normally transported along highway routes 
which are included in a proposed NRHM routing designation, and 
consideration shall be given to the relative impact zone and risks of 
each type and quantity.
    (iv) Emergency response capabilities. In consultation with the 
proper fire, law enforcement, and highway safety agencies, consideration 
shall be given to the emergency response capabilities which may be 
needed as a result of a NRHM routing designation. The analysis of the 
emergency response capabilities shall be based upon the proximity of the 
emergency response facilities and their capabilities to contain and 
suppress NRHM releases within the impact zones.
    (v) Results of consultation with affected persons. Consideration 
shall be given to the comments and concerns of all affected persons and 
entities provided during public hearings and consultations conducted in 
accordance with this section.
    (vi) Exposure and other risk factors. States and Indian tribes shall 
define the exposure and risk factors associated with any NRHM routing 
designations. The distance to sensitive areas shall be considered. 
Sensitive areas include, but are not limited to, homes and commercial 
buildings; special populations in hospitals, schools, handicapped 
facilities, prisons and stadiums; water sources such as streams and 
lakes; and natural areas such as parks, wetlands, and wildlife reserves.
    (vii) Terrain considerations. Topography along and adjacent to the 
proposed NRHM routing designation that may affect the potential severity 
of an accident, the dispersion of the NRHM upon release and the control 
and clean up of NRHM if released shall be considered.
    (viii) Continuity of routes. Adjacent jurisdictions shall be 
consulted to ensure routing continuity for NRHM across common borders. 
Deviations from the most direct route shall be minimized.
    (ix) Alternative routes. Consideration shall be given to the 
alternative routes to, or resulting from, any NRHM route designation. 
Alternative routes shall be examined, reviewed, or evaluated to the 
extent necessary to demonstrate that the most probable alternative 
routing resulting from a routing designation is safer than the current 
routing.
    (x) Effects on commerce. Any NRHM routing designation made in 
accordance with this subpart shall not create an unreasonable burden 
upon interstate or intrastate commerce.
    (xi) Delays in transportation. No NRHM routing designations may 
create unnecessary delays in the transportation of NRHM.
    (xii) Climatic conditions. Weather conditions unique to a highway 
route such as snow, wind, ice, fog, or other climatic conditions that 
could affect the safety of a route, the dispersion of the NRHM upon 
release, or increase the difficulty of controlling it and cleaning it up 
shall be given appropriate consideration.
    (xiii) Congestion and accident history. Traffic conditions unique to 
a highway routing such as: traffic congestion; accident experience with 
motor vehicles, traffic considerations that could affect the potential 
for an accident, exposure of the public to any release, ability to 
perform emergency response operations, or the temporary closing of a 
highway for cleaning up any release shall be given appropriate 
consideration.

circumstances when there is only one practicable highway route 
available, considering operating necessity and safety, a carrier or any 
person operating a motor vehicle that contains a Class 7 (radioactive) 
material, as defined in 49 CFR 172.403, for which placarding is required 
under 49 CFR part 172 shall:
    (1) Ensure that the motor vehicle is operated on routes that 
minimize radiological risk;
    (2) Consider available information on accident rates, transit time, 
population density and activities, and the time of day and the day of 
week during which transportation will occur to determine the level of 
radiological risk; and
    (3) Tell the driver which route to take and that the motor vehicle 
contains Class 7 (radioactive) materials.
    (b) Except as otherwise permitted in this paragraph and in paragraph 
(f) of this section, a carrier or any person operating a motor vehicle 
containing a highway route controlled quantity of

[[Page 771]]

Class 7 (radioactive) materials, as defined in 49 CFR 173.403(l), shall 
operate the motor vehicle only over preferred routes.
    (1) For purposes of this subpart, a preferred route is an Interstate 
System highway for which an alternative route is not designated by a 
State routing agency; a State-designated route selected by a State 
routing agency pursuant to Sec. 397.103; or both of the above.
    (2) The motor carrier or the person operating a motor vehicle 
containing a highway route controlled quantity of Class 7 (radioactive)

when available, shall be used in place of a preferred route through a 
city, unless a State routing agency has designated an alternative route.
    (c) A motor vehicle may be operated over a route, other than a 
preferred route, only under the following conditions:
    (1) The deviation from the preferred route is necessary to pick up 
or deliver a highway route controlled quantity of Class 7 (radioactive) 
materials, to make necessary rest, fuel or motor vehicle repair stops, 
or because emergency conditions make continued use of the preferred 
route unsafe or impossible;
    (2) For pickup and delivery not over preferred routes, the route 
selected must be the shortest-distance route from the pickup location to 
the nearest preferred route entry location, and the shortest-distance 
route to the delivery location from the nearest preferred route exit 
location. Deviation from the shortest-distance pickup or delivery route 
is authorized if such deviation:
    (i) Is based upon the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section to 
minimize the radiological risk; and
    (ii) Does not exceed the shortest-distance pickup or delivery route 
by more than 25 miles and does not exceed 5 times the length of the 
shortest-distance pickup or delivery route.
    (iii) Deviations from preferred routes, or pickup or delivery routes 
other than preferred routes, which are necessary for rest, fuel, or 
motor vehicle repair stops or because of emergency conditions, shall be 
made in accordance with the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section to 
minimize radiological risk, unless due to emergency conditions, time 
does not permit use of those criteria.
    (d) A carrier (or a designated agent) who operates a motor vehicle 
which contains a package of highway route controlled quantity of Class 7 
(radioactive) materials, as defined in 49 CFR 173.403(l), shall prepared 
a written route plan and supply a copy before departure to the motor 
vehicle driver and a copy to the shipper (before departure for exclusive 
use shipments, as defined in 49 CFR 173.403(i), or within fifteen 
working days following departure for all other shipments). Any variation 
between the route plan and routes actually used, and the reason for it, 
shall be reported in an amendment to the route plan delivered to the 
shipper as soon as practicable but within 30 days following the 
deviation. The route plan shall contain:
    (1) A statement of the origin and destination points, a route 
selected in compliance with this section, all planned stops, and 
estimated departure and arrival times; and
    (2) Telephone numbers which will access emergency assistance in each 
State to be entered.
    (e) No person may transport a package of highway route controlled 
quantity of Class 7 (radioactive) materials on a public highway unless:
    (1) The driver has received within the two preceding years, written 
training on:
    (i) Requirements in 49 CFR parts 172, 173, and 177 pertaining to the 
Class 7 (radioactive) materials transported;
    (ii) The properties and hazards of the Class 7 (radioactive) 
materials being transported; and
    (iii) Procedures to be followed in case of an accident or other 
emergency.
    (2) The driver has in his or her immediate possession a certificate 
of training as evidence of training required by this section, and a copy 
is placed in his or her qualification file (see Sec. 391.51 of this 
subchapter), showing:
    (i) The driver's name and operator's license number;
    (ii) The dates training was provided;

[[Page 772]]

    (iii) The name and address of the person providing the training;
    (iv) That the driver has been trained in the hazards and

information on the certificate is accurate.
    (3) The driver has in his or her immediate possession the route plan 
required by paragraph (d) of this section and operates the motor vehicle 
in accordance with the route plan.
    (f) A person may transport irradiated reactor fuel only in 
compliance with a plan if required under 49 CFR 173.22(c) that will 
ensure the physical security of the material. Variation for security 
purposes from the requirements of this section is permitted so far as 
necessary to meet the requirements imposed under such a plan, or 
otherwise imposed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 10 CFR 
part 73.
    (g) Expect for packages shipped in compliance with the physical 
security requirements of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 10 
CFR part 73, each carrier who accepts for transportation a highway route 
controlled quantity of Class 7 (radioactive) material (see 49 CFR

    (c) Each person submitting written comments to the Administrator 
with respect to an application filed under this section shall send a 
copy of the comments to the applicant and certify to the Administrator 
that he or she has complied with this requirement. The Administrator may 
notify other persons participating in the proceeding of the comments and 
provide an opportunity for those other persons to respond.


<R05>
Sec. 397.209  Preemption processing.

    (a) The Administrator may initiate an investigation of any statement 
in an application and utilize in his or her evaluation any relevant 
facts obtained by that investigation. The Administrator may solicit and 
accept submissions from third persons relevant to an application and 
will provide the applicant an opportunity to respond to all third person 
submissions. In evaluating an application, the Administrator may

[[Page 775]]

consider any other source of information. The Administrator may convene 
a hearing or conference, if a hearing or conference will advance the 
evaluation of the application.
    (b) The Administrator may dismiss the application without prejudice 
if:
    (1) he or she determines that there is insufficient information upon 
which to base a determination; or
    (2) he or she requests additional information from the applicant and 
it is not submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 397.211  Preemption determination.

    (a) Upon consideration of the application and other relevant 
information received, the Administrator issues a determination.
    (b) Notwithstanding that an application for a determination has not 
been filed under Sec. 397.205, the Administrator, on his or her own 
initiative, may issue a determination as to whether a particular highway 
routing designation of a State, political subdivision thereof, or Indian 
tribe is preempted under the Act or the regulations issued under the 
Act.
    (c) The determination includes a written statement setting forth the 
relevant facts and the legal basis for the determination, and provides 
that any person aggrieved thereby may file a petition for 
reconsideration within 20 days in accordance with Sec. 397.223.
    (d) Unless the determination is issued pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section, the Administrator serves a copy of the determination upon 
the applicant. In all preemption determinations, the Administrator 
serves a copy of the determination upon any other person who 
participated in the proceeding or who is readily identifiable by the 
Administrator as affected by the determination. A copy of each 
determination is placed on file in the public docket. The Administrator 
may publish the determination or notice of the determination in the 
Federal Register.
    (e) If no petition for reconsideration is filed within 20 days in 
accordance with Sec. 397.223, a determination issued under this section 
constitutes the final agency decision as to whether a particular highway 
routing designation of a State, political subdivision thereof, or Indian 
tribe is preempted under the Act or regulations issued thereunder. The 
fact that a determination has not been issued under this section with 
respect to a particular highway routing designation of a State, 
political subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe carries no implication as 
to whether the requirement is preempted under the Act or regulations 
issued thereunder.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 397.219  Waiver determination and order.

    (a) Upon consideration of the application and other relevant 
information received or obtained during the proceeding, the 
Administrator issues an order setting forth his or her determination.
    (b) The Administrator may issue a waiver of preemption order only if 
he or she finds that the requirement of the State, political subdivision 
thereof, or Indian tribe affords the public a level of safety at least 
equal to that afforded by the requirements of the Act and the 
regulations issued under the Act and does not unreasonably burden 
commerce. In determining whether the requirement of the State, political 
subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe unreasonably burdens commerce, the 
Administrator may consider the following factors:
    (1) The extent to which increased costs and impairment of efficiency 
result from the highway routing designation of the State, political 
subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe;
    (2) Whether the highway routing designation of the State, political 
subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe has a rational basis;
    (3) Whether the highway routing designation of the State, political 
subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe achieves its stated purpose; and
    (4) Whether there is need for uniformity with regard to the subject 
concerned and if so, whether the highway routing designation of the 
State, political subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe competes or 
conflicts with those of other States, political subdivisions thereof, or 
Indian tribes.
    (c) The order includes a written statement setting forth the 
relevant facts and the legal basis for the determination, and provides 
that any person aggrieved by the order may file a petition for 
reconsideration in accordance with Sec. 397.223.
    (d) The Administrator serves a copy of the order upon the applicant, 
any other person who participated in the proceeding and upon any other 
person readily identifiable by the Administrator as one who may be 
affected by the order. A copy of each order is placed on file in the 
public docket. The Administrator may publish the order or notice of the 
order in the Federal Register.
    (e) If no petition for reconsideration is filed within 20 days in 
accordance with Sec. 397.223, an order issued under this section 
constitutes the final agency decision regarding whether a particular 
requirement of a State, political subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe 
is preempted under the Act or any regulations issued thereunder, or 
whether preemption is waived.


<R05>
Sec. 397.221  Timeliness.

    If the Administrator fails to take action on the application within 
90 days of serving the notice required by Sec. 397.217(d), the applicant 
may treat the application as having been denied in all respects.


<R05>
Sec. 397.223  Petition for reconsideration.

    (a) Any person aggrieved by an order issued under Sec. 397.211 or 
Sec. 397.219 may file a petition for reconsideration with the 
Administrator. The petition must be filed within 20 days of service of 
the determination or order issued under the above sections.

seeking reconsideration, including any specific

[[Page 778]]

factual or legal errors, or material information not previously 
available.

who participated, either as an applicant or routing, in the waiver of 
preemption proceeding, accompanied by a statement that the person may 
submit comments concerning the petition to the Administrator within 20

certification that the petitioner has complied with this paragraph and 
include the names and addresses of all persons to whom a copy of the 
petition was sent.
    (d) The Administrator's decision under this section constitutes the 
final agency decision. If no petition for reconsideration is filed under 
this section, then the determination issued under Sec. 397.211 or 
Sec. 397.219 becomes the final agency decision at the end of the 20 day 
period.


<R05>
Sec. 397.225  Judicial review.

    A party to a proceeding under Sec. 397.205(a), Sec. 397.213(a), or 
Sec. 397.223(a) may seek review by the appropriate district court of the 
United States of the decision of the Administrator under such proceeding

[44 FR 43732, July 26, 1979, as amended at 46 FR 56799, Nov. 19, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 399.205  Definitions.

    Cab-over-engine (COE) A truck or truck-tractor having all, or the 
front portion, of the engine under the cab.
    COE--High profile A COE having the door sill step above the height 
of the front tires.
    Deck plate A horizontal surface designed to provide a person with 
stable footing for the performance of work such as the connection and 
disconnection of air and electrical lines, gaining access to 
permanently-mounted equipment or machinery or for similar needs.
    Door sill step Any step normally protected from the elements by the 
cab door when closed.
    Effective peripheral grip Any shaped surface, free of sharp edges, 
in which a full grasp can be made to secure a handhold by a person.
    Fingertip grasp A handhold surface which provides a person contact 
restricted to finger segments 1 and/or 2 only; or which limits wrap-
around closure of finger segment 1 with the palm of the hand to 90 
degrees as shown in Illustration I.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP91.036

    Full grasp A handhold surface which provides a person contact with 
finger segments 2 and 3 and which provides

[[Page 786]]

space for finger segment 1 to wrap around toward the palm of the hand 
beyond the 90-degree surface restriction shown in Illustration I. The 
handhold need not require contact between fingers and thumb. For 
example, the hand position shown in Illustration II qualifies as full 
grasp.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP91.037

    Ground The flat horizontal surface on which the tires of a motor 
vehicle rest.
    Handhold That which qualifies as providing full grasp if a person is 
able to find a hand position on the handhold which allows more than 
fingertip grasp.
    Handprint The surface area contacted by the hand when grasping a 
handhold. The size of this area is the width of the hand across the 
metacarpal and half the circumference of the handhold. The hand breadth 
of the typical person is 88.9 millimeters (3.5 inches).
    Person Any individual within the 5th percentile female adult through 
the 95th percentile male adult of anthropometric measures as described 
by the 1962 Health Examination Survey, ``Weight, Height and Selected 
Body Dimensions of Adults, United States 1960-1962'' which is 
incorporated by reference. It is Public Health Service publication No. 
1000-Series 11-No. 8 and is for sale from the U.S. Department of 
Commerce, National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, 
Springfield, Virginia 22161. When ordering use NTIS Accession No. PB 
267174. It is also available for inspection at the Office of the Federal 
Register Library, 800 North Capitol Street, NW, suite 700, Washington,

of the Federal Register on July 17, 1979. These materials are 
incorporated as they exist on the date of the approval and a notice of 
any change in these materials will be published in the Federal Register.
    Slip resistant material Any material designed to minimize the 
accumulation of grease, ice, mud or other debris and afford protection 
from accidental slipping.


<R05>
Sec. 399.207  Truck and truck-tractor access requirements.

    (a) General rule. Any person entering or exiting the cab or 
accessing the rear portion of a high profile COE truck or truck-tractor 
shall be afforded sufficient steps and handholds, and/or deck plates to 
allow the user to have at least 3 limbs in contact with the truck or 
truck-tractor at any time. This rule applies to intermediate positions 
as well as transition between intermediate positions. To allow for 
changes in climbing sequence, the step design shall include, as a 
minimum, one intermediate step of sufficient size to accommodate two 
feet. Exception. If air and electrical connections necessary to couple 
or uncouple a truck-tractor from a trailer are accessible from the 
ground, no step, handholds or deck plates are required to permit access 
to the rear of the cab.
    (b) Performance requirements. All high profile COE trucks or truck-
tractors shall be equipped on each side of the vehicle where a seat is 
located, with a sufficient number of steps and handholds to conform with 
the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and shall meet the 
performance requirements:
    (1) Vertical height. All measurements of vertical height shall be 
made from ground level with the vehicle at unladen weight.
    (2) Distance between steps. The distance between steps, up to and 
including the door sill step, shall provide any person a stable resting 
position which can be sustained without body motion and by exerting no 
more arm force

[[Page 787]]

than 35 percent of the person's body weight per grasp during all stages 
of entry and exit. This criterion applies to intermediate positions as 
well as transition between intermediate positions above ground level.
    (i) When the ground provides the person foot support during entry or 
is the final step in the sequence during exit, and the step is 508 
millimeters (20 inches) or more above ground, the stable resting 
position shall be achievable by the person using both hands to grasp the 
handhold(s) and requiring no more arm force than 35 percent of body 
weight per grasp.
    (ii) The vertical height of the first step shall be no more than 609 
millimeters (24 inches) from ground level.
    (3) Construction. Each step or deck plate shall be of a slip 
resistant design which minimizes the accumulation of foreign material. 
Wherever practicable, a self-cleaning material should be used.
    (4) Foot accommodation. Step depth or clearance and step width 
necessary to accommodate a climbing person are defined by using a 
minimum 127 millimeter (5 inch) diameter disc as shown in Illustration 
III.
    (i) Single foot accommodation. The disc shall fit on a tread rung, 
or in a step recess, with no exterior overhang.
    (ii) Two-foot accommodation. Two discs shall fit on a tread rung, or 
in a step recess, with no exterior overhang.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP91.038

    Note: The 127 millimeter (5 inch) disc is only intended to test for 
a minimum depth and width requirement. The step need not retain the disc 
at rest.

    (5) Step strength. Each step must withstand a vertical static load 
of at least 204 kilograms (450 pounds) uniformly distributed over any 
127 millimeter (5 inch) increment of step width.
    (6) Handhold location. A handhold must be located within the reach 
of any person entering or exiting the vehicle.
    (7) Exterior mounting specifications for handholds. Each handhold, 
affixed to the exterior of the vehicle, shall have at least 38 
millimeters (1.5 inches) clearance between the handhold and the surface 
to which it is mounted for the distance between its mounting points.
    (8) Handhold size and shape. Each handhold shall be free of sharp 
edges (minimum 1 millimeter [0.04 inch] radius) and have an effective 
peripheral grip length that permits full grasp by any person.
    (9) Handhold strength. Each handhold shall withstand a horizontal 
static load of at least 114 kilograms (250 pounds) uniformly distributed 
over the area of a hand print and applied away from the mounting 
surface.
    (10) Deck plates. Deck plates shall be on the rear of a truck-
tractor as necessary to couple or uncouple air and/or electrical 
connections.
    (11) Deck plate strength. Each deck plate shall be capable of 
withstanding

[[Page 788]]

the vertical static load of at least 205 kilograms (450 pounds) 
uniformly distributed over a 127 millimeter (5 inch) diameter disc.


<R05>
Sec. 399.209  Test procedures.

    (a) The force exerted on a handhold will be measured using a 
handheld spring scale or force transducer which can be attached to the 
vehicle and is free to rotate into alignment with a person's hand 
position.
    (b) Hand grasp will be evaluated by observing the handgrip of any 
individual who conforms with the definition of ``person'' appearing in 
Sec. 399.205 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 399.211  Maintenance.

    All steps, handholds, and/or deck plates required by this subpart 
shall be adequately maintained to serve their intended function.

  Comparison of Appendix G, and the new North American Uniform Driver-
Vehicle Inspection Procedure (North American Commercial Vehicle Critical 
          Safety Inspection Items and Out-Of-Service Criteria)

    The vehicle portion of the FHWA's North American Uniform Driver-
Vehicle Inspection Procedure (NAUD-VIP) requirements, CVSA's North 
American Commercial Vehicle Critical Safety Inspection Items and Out-Of-
Service Criteria and Appendix G of subchapter B are similar documents 
and follow the same inspection procedures. The same items are required 
to be inspected by each document. FHWA's and CVSA's out-of-service 
criteria are intended to be used in random roadside inspections to 
identify critical vehicle inspection items and provide criteria for 
placing a vehicle(s) out-of-service. A vehicle(s) is placed out-of-
service only when by reason of its mechanical condition or loading it is 
determined to be so imminently hazardous as to likely cause an accident 
or breakdown, or when such condition(s) would likely contribute to loss 
of control of the vehicle(s) by the driver. A certain amount of 
flexibility is given to the inspecting official whether to place the 
vehicle out-of-service at the inspection site or if it would be less 
hazardous to allow the vehicle to proceed to a repair facility for 
repair. The distance to the repair facility must not exceed 25 miles. 
The roadside type of inspection, however, does not necessarily mean that 
a vehicle has to be defect-free in order to continue in service.
    In contrast, the Appendix G inspection procedure requires that all 
items required to be inspected are in proper adjustment, are not 
defective and function properly prior to the vehicle being placed in 
service.

    Differences Between the Out-of-Service Criteria & FHWA's Annual 
                               Inspection

    1. Brake System.
    The Appendix G criteria rejects vehicles with any defective brakes, 
any air leaks, etc. The out-of-service criteria allows 20% defective 
brakes on non-steering axles and a certain latitude on air leaks before 
placing a vehicle out-of-service.
    2. Coupling Devices.
    Appendix G rejects vehicles with any fifth wheel mounting fastener 
missing or ineffective. The out-of-service criteria allows up to 20% 
missing or ineffective fasteners on frame mountings and pivot bracket 
mountings and 25% on slider latching fasteners. The out-of-service 
criteria also allows some latitude on cracked welds.
    3. Exhaust System.
    Appendix G follows Section 393.83 verbatim. The CVSA out-of-service 
criteria allows vehicles to exhaust forward of the dimensions given in 
Section 393.83 as long as the exhaust does not leak or exhaust under the 
chassis.
    4. Fuel System.
    Same for Appendix G and the out-of-service criteria.
    5. Lighting Devices.
    Appendix G requires all lighting devices required by Section 393 to 
be operative at all times. The out-of-service criteria only requires one 
stop light and functioning turn signals on the rear most vehicle of a 
combination vehicle to be operative at all times. In addition one 
operative head lamp and tail lamp are required during the hours of 
darkness.
    6. Safe Loading.
    Same for both Appendix G and the out-of-service criteria.
    7. Steering Mechanism
    Steering lash requirements of Appendix G follows the new 
requirements of Sec. 393.209.
    8. Suspension
    Appendix G follows the new requirements of Sec. 393.207 which does 
not allow any broken

[[Page 813]]

leaves in a leaf spring assembly. The out-of-service criteria allows up 
to 25% broken or missing leaves before being placed out-of-service.
    9. Frame
    The out-of-service criteria allows a certain latitude in frame 
cracks before placing a vehicle out-of-service. Appendix G follows the 
new requirements of 393.201 which does not allow any frame cracks.
    10. Tires
    Appendix G follows the requirements of 393.75 which requires a tire 
tread depth of \4/32\ inch on power unit steering axles and \2/32\ inch 
on all other axles. The out-of-service criteria only requires \2/32\ 
inch tire tread depth on power unit steering axles and \1/32\ inch on 
all other axles.
    11. Wheel and Rims
    The out-of-service criteria allows a certain amount latitude for 
wheel and rim cracks and missing or defective fasteners. Appendix G 
meets the requirements of the new 393.205 which does not allow defective 
wheels and rims non-effective nuts and bolts.
    12. Windshield Glazing
    The out-of-service criteria places in a restricted service condition 
any vehicle that has a crack or discoloration in the windshield area 
lying within the sweep of the wiper on the drivers side and does not 
address the remaining area of the windshield. Appendix G addresses 
requirements for the whole windshield as specified in 393.60.
    13. Windshield Wipers
    Appendix G requires windshield wipers to be operative at all times. 
The out-of-service criteria only requires that the windshield wiper on 
the driver's side to be inspected during inclement weather.

At 61 FR 42822, Aug. 19, 1996, the effective date was further extended 
to Jan. 2, 1997.
    This appendix reprints for informational purposes those portions of 
sec. 2 of the Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Act of 1992 (Pub. 
L. 102-548, 106 Stat. 3646) which enacted 49 U.S.C. 5904, 5905, and 
5906, concerning State enforcement and liens, and amended 49 U.S.C. 5901 
by adding the definition of beneficial owner. 
    The text of 49 U.S.C. 5901(2) reads:
    (2) ``beneficial owner'' means a person not having title to property 
but having ownership rights in the property, including a trustee of 
property in transit from an overseas place of origin that is domiciled 
or doing business in the United States, except that a carrier, agent of 
a carrier, broker, customs broker, freight forwarder, warehouser, or 
terminal operator is not a beneficial owner only because of providing or 
arranging for any part of the intermodal transportation of property.
    The text of 49 U.S.C. 5904, State enforcement, reads:
    (a) GENERAL.--A State may enact a law to permit the State or a 
political subdivision of the State--
    (1) to impose a fine or penalty, for a violation of a State highway 
weight law or regulation by a tractor-trailer combination carrying a 
loaded container or trailer for which a certification is required by 
section 5902(b) of this title, against the person tendering the loaded 
container or trailer to the first carrier if the violation results from 
the person's having provided erroneous information in the certification 
in violation of section 5903(a) of this title; and
    (2) to impound the container or trailer until the fine or penalty 
has been paid by the owner or beneficial owner of the contents of the 
container or trailer or the person tendering the loaded container or 
trailer to the first carrier.
    (b) LIMITATION.--This chapter does not require a person tendering a 
loaded container or trailer to the first carrier to ensure that the 
first carrier or any other carrier involved in the intermodal 
transportation will comply with any State highway weight law or 
regulation, other than as required by this chapter.
    The text of 49 U.S.C. 5905, Liens, reads:
    (a) GENERAL.--If a person involved in the intermodal transportation 
of a loaded container or trailer for which a certification is required 
by section 5902(b) of this title is required under State law to post a 
bond or pay any fine, penalty, cost, or interest resulting from 
providing erroneous information in the certification to the first 
carrier in violation of section 5903(a) of this title, the person has a 
lien against the contents equal to the amount of the bond, fine, 
penalty, cost, or interest incurred, until the person receives a payment 
of that amount from the owner or beneficial owner of the contents or 
from the person responsible for making the certification.
    (b) LIMITATIONS.--(1) A lien under this section does not authorize a 
person to dispose of the contents of a loaded container or trailer until 
the person who tendered the container or trailer to the first carrier is 
given a reasonable opportunity to establish responsibility for the bond, 
fine, penalty, cost, or interest.

[[Page 814]]

    (2) In this section, an owner or beneficial owner of the contents of 
a container or trailer or a person tendering a container or trailer to 
the first carrier is deemed not to be a person involved in the 
intermodal transportation of the container or trailer.
    The text of 49 U.S.C. 5906, Perishable agricultural commodities, 
reads:
    Sections 5904(a)(2) and 5905 of this title do not apply to a 
container or trailer the contents of which are perishable agricultural 
commodities (as defined in the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 
1930 (7 U.S.C. 499a et seq.)).
